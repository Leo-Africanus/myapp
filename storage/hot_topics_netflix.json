        "content": "I just saw my mother watching some foreign nonsense called The Sea Beyond earlier today. Not sure what it's all about, didn't really give a dang to find out. All I know about it was that it's another random foreign show Netflix has in its catalog, and it is one with horrid translation issues. And with this one, it's the worst I've ever seen with any of them as the subtitles were on as she watched it and literally NOTHING was matching what the actors, or rathe yet the DUBBED actors, were reciting or saying AT ALL!\n\nThat's been a major issue I've had with Neflix for years now when it comes to how they handle captions and subtitles for foreign shows and here, it's far more worse than any other one I've seen. I don't know why they never fixed that issue, but when it comes to the hard of hearing, it really does them a disservice more when they don't realize what they're reading doesn't match of to what they're watching.\n\nEspecially when they're charging nearly thirty bucks a month for the bloody thing. With all that they could've been able afford to improve their subtitle tech. Use AI on that for improved accuracies or something , if they want. ",

After and after the murderer gets on of the kids till no one is left over. The acting was like simmiliar to a scary movie film (horror with a little bit of comedy i think) i rember an exact scene where the murderer put a guy with a black leather jacket in an oven.",

I do have Netflix Premium so I don't know why this could be a problem since it's noted that premium has more features compared to the other plans and it just says I can download on up to 6 supported devices at a time but never specified how much I could download.\n\nI am a person that notices every aspect of quality change and like my downloaded content to be at least 1080p.\n\nSorry i had to use this account, I didn't have enough karma on my \"main\".",

I watched cyberpunk awhile ago obviously but it\u2019s still my 3rd favorite anime ever. 1.) attack on titan 2.) demon slayer which is another hot take but whatever. I\u2019m not a big fan of the very long anime\u2019s like one peice or Naruto but if I was I would probably include them. I\u2019m not including romance anime\u2019s because most of them low-key all follow the same format but maybe just different names / looks. Does anyone agree about my take? I loved the scenario , the characters, the backstories , the futuristic look. ",

        "content": "Just discovered this hidden gem. It's been around for a few years.\nLoudermilk is an addiction counselor with a motley crew of devotees that attend his regular meetings in a catholic church.\n\nThe cast are mostly men, and there are some gross moments (doll episode).\n\nAnja Savcic is the only regular woman casted. They manage her presence nicely without being overly sexual, which I can appreciate. \n\nThe show also mingles comedy with hard topics such as living with disabilities, misogyny, and failure really well. \n\nI've rewatched it several times, especially when winding down at night or if there's nothing else to watch (skipping the doll episode). \n\nAnyone else find this show oddly comforting?
