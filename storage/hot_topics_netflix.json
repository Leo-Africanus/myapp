The first one was slow to get through, granted, but by the end it was easily one of my favorite horror/suspense shows. CANCELLED. And it\u2019s certainly not the production costs since very little special effects were used. \n\nThere were more shows that got canceled, obviously, but these were the three that really got to me. Seriously considering cancelling\n Netflix now since all they seem to care about is producing trash. \n\n\n\u201cNew on netflix\u201d flair because it\u2019s ironically relevant.",

        "content": "I understand with Netflix you have to add an \"extra member\" to share your account these days but a curious situation has had me doing some research on those details.  A friend of mine ex's has \"shared\" whether it be unofficial or officially their account (it sounds unofficially).  Everything was fine up until recently where the \"adult\" standard profile now states extra member mumbo jumbo where \"not in this family\" / \"are you in vacation\" etc.  I assume with the extra member stuff, you actually get your own account and you're just attached to theirs.  So by this logic the account wasn't an extra member as they are/we're using it under their ex's email.\n\nSo enough background, the question is, this account even tho it preaches about unknown location, the \"Kids\" profile still works without issue for their kids.\n\nIs this something normal where Netflix doesn't restrict Kids profiles the same or is this more of a fluke?\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Hi guys. Around a week ago I upgraded my Netflix plan to Premium with the idea to watch HDR content on my new OLED monitor. The thing is, whatever I do, there is no HDR on my PC with Windows 11 Pro. It is only working on my TV.\n\nI have already contacted Netflix support 3 times with no luck, no one was even close to help. Believe me I have already tried what I could. I installed the HEVC video extensions from the Microsoft store, I have tried with several browsers like Edge, Opera, Firefox and of course Chrome. The weird thing is that it was working on Chrome then it stopped there too and I can't make it work again. There's just no HDR indicator anywhere.\n\nI have disabled and enabled the GPU hardware acceliration several times with no luck. I have enabled forced HDR in Edge and it is still not working. I have Auto HDR enabled on Windows and still doesn't make a difference. I am using HDMI 2.1 cable if that matters with a RX 7900 XT if that matters. I have even tried with DP and it is still not working.\n\nI am using HDR in games and Youtube content all the time so I know it is working, it is not wokring only on Netflix. I have installed the Desktop App too and it is not workinig there too. I have set the playback settings quality to \"High - Best video and audo quality etc\". \n\nSo I was just wondering if there is anything else I could try before downgrading my plan. Any advice would be of help, thanks!",
