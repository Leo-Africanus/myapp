My favorite podcasts are \"sip and gossip\" (it's a french podcast) where you read anecdotes/stories and there are reactions I think it's really cool but there are no such masses. (PLUS I don't like true crimes, it seems there's only that)\n\nSo as an alternative I put on Netflix series and I listen but usually it's what I already know so I don't need to watch! I'm someone who watches the same series in a loop so it's easy but I want to again but I don't know where to go \n",
