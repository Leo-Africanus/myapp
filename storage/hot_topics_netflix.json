They canceled it, apparently because they couldn\u2019t afford it, even though the show brought in huge viewership numbers. Make it make sense. So many unresolved storylines, it felt like they just walked off set mid-scene. I genuinely hope now that Netflix has picked it up, a 4th season is in the works. It deserves one. We deserve one. I\u2019m honestly kind of mad about it.\n\nNow maybe this is a dumb question, but it\u2019s been bugging me: why did the show seem more focused on who killed Jorge  than on Frankie himself\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, was a full-blown murderer? He\u2019s out of prison again and somehow they still couldn\u2019t charge him with anything? That was beyond frustrating. I get that the writers probably wanted to push Ray to kill him in the end, but still\u2014it felt like everyone was just shrugging off Frankie\u2019s entire rap sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a great show, but man, that ending left me with more questions than closure.",

        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging.   \n  \nEdit: Surprised it got Emmy nomination.",

But today, we're both experiencing the weirdest thing. I tried to create a session, but the link is noticeably shorter than usual and doesn't include the show title in it. I thought that would be fine, but when she opened the link, it just played on its own and refuses to sync. Then she tried to create the session, but the same thing happened to her too.\n\nIt's so weird because it shows in the chat log whenever one of us joins or pauses/plays and whatnot, but it's playing two separate instances. If I play, it's still paused for her, and vice versa. It's refusing to sync, and this has never happened before until today. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a possible fix, or maybe it'll just randomly fix itself after a time? Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people in the replies experiencing the same thing, so hopefully they fix it soon.",

This one started out strong, the first 30-45 minutes were pretty good, and happy is still a really funny character, but then it completely fell off. For some reason they decided to bring back every single side character from the original and redo every single joke and gag. Some parts of it feel like a remake and I really didn\u2019t like how they kept playing clips from the original. On top of that the villains and the ending were really stupid. I\u2019d probably rate this movie a 5/10, but that\u2019s just my opinion I guess.",

        "content": "I got a recruiting email for a role at Netflix.\n\nThe sender email address is: talents@netflixcareerhighlights.com which seems potentially sketchy. Now as I write it out, seems majorly sketchy.\n\nThe email does not otherwise seem sketchy whatsoever.\n\nThe role is relevant to my background and the email came to an account that is not widely circulated. I think it would have had to be found via LinkedIn recruiter tools.\n\nThere are no links in the email, and they ask for a reply to confirm interest and then say someone from the team will be in touch to schedule a call.\n\nI guess I know what to do (delete) but I\u2019m secretly hoping it\u2019s real, so figured I\u2019d try here.",
