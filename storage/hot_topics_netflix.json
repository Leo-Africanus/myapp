        "content": "Celebrity Bear Hunt is a fun show, undoubtedly. But every episode I watch leaves me a little but perplexed / annoyed by the lack of logic in the rules of the competition and how Bear approaches it.\n\nFirstly, the way people get selected for the Bear Pit. On some episodes this makes sense but on others it doesn't. On the episode where they cross the rope bridge, Bear or the producers decided that Shirley wouldn't face the Bear Pit even though she was directly responsible for her team's loss.\n\nOnce in the Bear Pit, the rules about who gets caught and who gets eliminated seem completely arbitrary.\n\nIt's very obvious Bear isn't putting much effort into hunting contestants. He often sees a contestant in close proximity, and decides not to chase after them, even though he could easily catch them.\n\nThen the decision about who gets eliminated is for some reason divorced from the actual outcome of the Bear Pit. Surely, if 4 people are in the pit, trying not to get caught, and 1 of them is going to be eliminated... then the first person caught should be eliminated. Or the last one to escape. That would be an objective way to decide.\n\nBut no, the decision is made separately by Bear (or producers) - he's using evidence from their performance in the Bear Pit, but making a subjective judgement about who deserves to go. We have seen players get caught in traps really early through stupid decisions, and then be allowed to stay because Bear preferred to eliminate someone else - even though that person evaded capture much longer.\n\nOne final point - what is the point of Holly Willoughby being employed as a presenter on this show? She has such a minimal role. She isn't involved at all in the Bear Pit and isn't even present when Bear decides who is going to be eliminated. \n\n",

        "content": "I just finished watching Night Age Season 2, and I\u2019m not happy with it. I thought Season 1 was excellent, but this season felt all over the place.\n\nFirst off, Rose was incredibly annoying. She couldn\u2019t decide if she wanted to stay or go back to California; she flip-flopped like four times in a single episode!\n\nThen there\u2019s the whole Iranian involvement\u2026 which left me completely confused. What exactly was their role in all of this? It felt like they were introduced, but their purpose wasn\u2019t clearly explained.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me: they never mentioned the name of the mysterious country the Bala family is from. Why keep that a secret?\n\nAnd speaking of the Bala family; why would Vickor Bala use the chemical KX on his own people? That made no sense to me. Now he suddenly wants revenge on the U.S.? For what exactly? His motivations just felt weak.\n\nOverall, the season didn\u2019t make much sense to me. But back to my main question: What was the Iranians\u2019 involvement? It really confused me, and I\u2019d love to hear what others think.\n",
