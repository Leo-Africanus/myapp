We live in a romance obsessed culture, and some people will ignore hard facts and red flags to claim a relationship. Our obsession with romance is what makes women such easy victims to predatory personalities. \n\nMy hope is for women especially in marriage obsessed cultures, is to wake up and realize they're more worthy endeavors in life. It's so silly and I'm just so sooo sad for women like Kirat who are stigmatized for being single, and through their desperation are easily fooled.",

Ive looked it up before and something about turning off 5.1 surround or something, but thats not even an option. the only options are subtitles and audio language. Thats all.

        "content": "So I've just started watching this series... literally less than 10 minutes into episode 1 and this so-called psychologist is something else. Did anyone else find her incredibly irritating? She came across as being rather uneducated and very presumptuous, neither of which are great traits in a psychologist. \n\nFirst of all, she states that the guy being paralytic was intentional because he wanted to make his date vulnerable (what?! He was the drunk one  not her) or because he wanted some dutch courage so that he could get away with his evil plan. Surely if it was all part of his plan, he wouldn't have gotten black out drunk? \n\nSecondly, she said that him having pre-booked a hotel is a clear sign that he wanted to control the night and has a sense of ownership. There are SO many other reasons as to why someone might book a hotel. \n\nI think what irritated me most (so far) is that she claimed that people with EUPD like Carl are often violent and spontaneous. That's just not true. I have EUPD (aka BPD) and these kind of claims can be SO damaging. I know several others with a similar diagnoses, none of whom are violent or spontaneous. I wouldn't hurt a fly, and schedules are everything. Saying he was undoubtedly dangerous because of his EUPD diagnosis was ridiculous. As if what he did was down to his personality disorder. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the guy is absolute scum and I really feel for Katie's family. This psychologist though... I'd love to know more about her credentials. ",

        "content": "The movie just came out yesterday, and I wanted to do a mini review on it. I\u2019ll get the obvious out of the way, animation was great, no comments on that, I liked the visuals and the character designs too.\n\nNow I\u2019ve read quite a few reviews on it quite alot of them seem to be positive, and I feel like I\u2019m in the minority that believes that this movie was mid at best? Personally I felt that the pacing, character stories and actual plot were all lacking substance. \n\nZoe and Mira: \n\nI\u2019ll start of with the characters, I\u2019ll be real, the movie did not do enough for me to care about them and their conflict. While watching I feel like I got tonal whiplash, because while the movie was obviously trying to dive into emotional arcs for each of the girls, it didn\u2019t provide strong enough development for characters like Zoey and Mira who were mostly just comic relief up until the climax. We know that Zoey is hotheaded and Mira is a people pleaser because that\u2019s what was told to us, it was rarely ever shown and when it was, it was played off as comic relief (up until the climax). I mean we never even got to find out why these girls are the way they are, and in the end their arcs were resolved to quickly, which made the ending feel overly convenient. \n\nRumi: \n\nRumi\u2019s arc was done slightly better than the other two, albeit she was the main character so it is expected, however by the end of the movie I was left with more questions than answers. I felt that Rumi\u2019s background of being half demon, isn\u2019t fully explored. Rather than exploring themes of fear and shame in depth a lot of her struggles are just shown to you through some quick flashbacks. I think these themes could\u2019ve been better explored, by touching more upon the relationship between Rumi and her aunt/adoptive mother? Given the ending her aunt obviously had a pretty big influence on the girls, yet this relationship is never really fleshed out, aside from that one flashback, (where she\u2019s telling Rumi to not share her secret )and so many questions were left, with their final interaction at the end of the movie, like why she\u2019s so afraid of Rumi\u2019s demonic side? How that relates to loosing Rumi\u2019s mother, or whether she herself doubts her judgement? \n\nJinu: \n\nSimilar complaint as the girls, emotional arc was way too rushed and not fleshed out to its full potential. Also while I won\u2019t deny Rumi and Jinu having some sort of chemistry, their romantic build up, in my opinion was paced oddly, and I wasn\u2019t a fan of the \u201cinsta-love\u201d dynamics. \n\nAside from that, it had some cute friendship scenes between the girls, I won\u2019t get into the music, since I\u2019m not the biggest k-pop fan so anything I say about it would be biased. I\u2019d probably rate this movie a 4.5-5/10\n",

        "content": "Their foreign made shows all seem to have the same few actors and actresses. I think like 3-5 women, and about the same for men. Maybe if I watched the credits I'd figure out how many for real.\n\nTheir performances are clearly annunciated, with a slight but I discernable accent. However they are pretty deadpan.\n\n",
