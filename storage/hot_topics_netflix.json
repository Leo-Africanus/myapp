Netflix has to be rating it high in hopes that more people will watch it, RIGHT?! \n\nWhy though? I figure that Netflix is pumping it out with an in-house team (it doesn\u2019t show any info about producer, director, etc. under the \u201cCredits\u201d section on the show\u2019s main page \u201c\u2026that\u2019s suspicious, that\u2019s weird\u201d), so I\u2019m sure 95% of the profit they see from the show goes directly back into itself. \n\nIt feels like AI and Dhar Mann had a satan baby, I hate it.

The (gorgeous and talented) actress who plays the queen is wearing the most god awful blue contacts. Everytime she is in the light she literally looks like a twilight vampire with these huge cheap looking contacts sitting unnaturally over her eyes.\n\nOf course I understand that the real queen had large blue eyes, but I hate the way these contacts look and it\u2019s all I can look at in any scene where she\u2019s in the light. No one else on the show has such strange contacts in\u2026 \n\nIt honestly looks like she is wearing gag gift/Halloween costume contact lenses sometimes! Has anyone else noticed this? I am only on season one, so do they get better over time? Or is this something I should just do better ignoring? It seems strange to me that a show that went to such lengths to have amazing costumes, sets, and historical accuracy would allow such a wildly weird element and expect people not to notice. ",
