With almost every major media company now running their own streaming service and fighting for subscribers, it\u2019s more important than ever to have a variety of good content. Keeping shows with solid writing, even if they\u2019re not huge hits, could help in the long run by pulling in niche audiences, keeping loyal fans around, and making the platform look better overall. Instead of only chasing big, instant successes, streaming companies should think about the long-term value of having a mix of different shows that keep people watching and stop them from canceling their subscriptions.\n\n",

It has a bit of everyting! I loved all the characters and it became an obsession to me. I0m currently finishing season 7 and every time I watc an episode I feel like I'm close to the end, that's make me feel sad :(\n\nIf you haven't watched it yet, I totally recommend it!

        "content": "24 js my favorite show of all time so as a 24 fan i adored season 1 of the night agent. But season 2 is just strange. Firstly the episodes are just straight up boring. No fights are high adrenaline scenes. Just conversations that feel meaningless to the plot. Rose is actually unbearable with her storyline of constantly changing her mind about staying or leaving was so frustrating to watch and it just feels ljke theyre forcing her into the show. Big boss lady is awful and horribly acted. Peter feels like a shell of himself in this season and half the episodes is just his relationship with rose. Its all awful. The final problem with this season is the muslim people always speaking that language. I dont have any problem with muslims or their language but o hate that half the episode isnt captioned and half of it is and when it is the conversations still feel pointless. Who else agrees?",
