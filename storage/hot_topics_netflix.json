        "content": "Okay, XO, Kitty is proof that not everyone needs to be on TV. I mean, was there even an audition process? Or did Netflix just scroll through creators on insta and say, \u201cYou look okay, congrats, you\u2019re now an actor\u201d? The acting felt like a bunch of people who\u2019d never been in front of a camera before\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the dialogue. It\u2019s like the script was written in TikTok comment sections. Nobody actually talks like that in real life  Hearing those lines come out of their mouths was physically painful, like they were trying to make TikTok slang happen, but no just stop this aint it.\n\njust cast actual actors next time. And get a script that sounds like it was written by humans and not an algorithm trying to go viral. And everyone is suddenly gay and bisexual on a korean school? How unrealistic\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 is netflix just trying to check the lgbt boxes or something???",

        "title": "What everyone missed about La Palma (SPOILERS)",
        "content": "So I just finished re-watching La Palma for the sixth time and I hopped on reddit to see what people were saying about my new favorite cinematic masterpiece, and I'm absolutely amazed at how wrong everyone seems to be about Erik's \"death\".  Just thought I'd clear up any confusion on the matter.\n\nErik never died.  In the final scene Erik was revealed to actually have been a sea turtle the entire time, who ended up surviving the gunshot due to his hard shell blocking the bullet.  In the last scene of the final episode it literally shows him reuniting with his sea turtle family and slowly fading away as he swam off into the distance \ud83d\ude44\n\nThere were actually several signs throughout the show to hint at this being the case:\n\n* Erik's obsession with sea turtles and the many boat trips he took to visit them.  \nHe even divulges that he was in debt to the boat guy because of this.\n\n* Erik's need for his sister to take care of him.  \nTowards the beginning of the story he asks his sister for $100 to buy vegetables (sea turtle diet)\n\n* Halfway through the series the police start to arrest Erik but eventually realize he is a sea turtle (you can't arrest sea turtles) and then switch to arresting Marie when she gets involved, which gave away that she was his owner and therefore responsible for him.  \n\n* In the jail when he finally gets ahold of the keys, he struggles to unlock Marie's cell due to his  lack of opposable thumbs.  She even has to steady his flippers to help him out.\n(I honestly debated whether or not to even include this one it was so obvious, I seriously hope no one missed this)\n\nI could go on but I really feel like those are the main points and if you still can't see it then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nAll in all I really loved this series and thought it had a really heartwarming ending and message about how Sara should've died when the tsunami absolutely turbo-fucked the shit out of the airplane like seriously what the fuck was that",

I contacted netflix after noticing that i had been billed for last month and this month.  I asked them to apply a credit to my account for the 2 months.  They refused and told me to take it up with my bank.  According to them, one of my tvs was still using the old account.  Now, I could be mad at myself, or my wife, for failing to catch it myself, and I own that.  But seriously, they can see that we are paying on two accounts with the same freaking profiles.  14 years and this is how they treat their customers?  I used to be too lazy to cancel my subscription, from now on, but now, they may get me to pay a month or two out of a year, assuming I dont just find a different service.

I'm unsubbing from the service rn",

        "content": "Since when does Netflix dictate what my household looks like and force me to pay for another Netflix account. Even though my situation has me outside of the household temporarily. \n\nI am taking care of my ill grandmother for the duration of her time on this earth. We also pay for 2 users. Having to confirm my household on every device I use, every time I turn around is absolutely ridiculous. Considering canceling netflix altogether.\n\nAnyone else having this issue? I can see families having kids in college Or for extensive business travel. This requirement is just ridiculous to me when  the service is being paid for.",
