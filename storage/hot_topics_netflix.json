Today he said he would try watching what I like so I put on daredevil and he didn't like it at all. we've also seen love and monster and 1 ep of the witcher which he liked but for some reason doesn't want to finish anything that's more then 2 hours long.

But my primary residence is in state A. But sometimes I'm not home for 3 weeks at a time.\n\nMy wife and I have a premium account for 4 device access. We also have 2 kids, who live 60% with me and my wife in state A, 40% with my ex. When I travel, I bring a roku stick to watch on hotel TVs.\n\nI'm not trying to share netflix with anyone outside of my household, I want it just for me and my dependents. I also cannot have to constantly call my wife to verify the account since we are multiple timezones apart frequently, and I want it linked to her phone and email address so when my kids need to re-sign in on their tablets she can help me. \n\nBut I cannot add my TV at my second house without being asked to update my household location, and my Roku stick constantly wants me to update my household location when I am traveling, since Netflix trests it like a full TV sign in instead of a mobile device sign in. I guess I run out of \"I'm traveling\" sign ins between my kids when they go to my ex's and me traveling.\n\nAnd netflix support is completely unhelpful. They advised me to drop my subscription level to 2 devices and add another member. Which would cost an additional $1 but would drop my total simultaneous devices to 3x instead of 4x. Other than that they said it is designed to be shared with 1 house.\n\nIs there any way that anyone has figured out to have 2 physical houses and constantly traveling people without getting punished by netflix and having to purchase multiple accounts?\n\nThis is massively frustrating, I spent over an hour on the phone with support and got NOWHERE with their circular logic. Any tips?",
