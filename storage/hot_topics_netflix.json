Most appointments I had feel rushed Lab results get thrown at me with no explanation or I get a quick everything looks fine with zero context. It leaves a lot of questions hanging and makes it hard to know what to do next or what even matters.  \nWatching The Good Doctor just kind of reinforced how helpful it is to have something that brings that kind of clarity and support into real life even if its through tech.",

        "content": "Honestly, I think Worst Roommate Ever made Jamison Bachman look way too one-dimensional. Yes, he was manipulative and parasitic for decades, but he wasn\u2019t openly violent until very late in life. What really stood out to me was how things escalated after he lost his pets.\n\nThe dog being taken away, the court banning him from having animals, then the cat dying while he was in jail \u2014 those weren\u2019t small things. Pets may have been his only real anchor, the only beings that didn\u2019t reject him. Once those were gone, plus his reputation in court and his brother refusing to house him, he basically collapsed.\n\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t fully buy the \u201che killed his cat\u201d angle \u2014 if he was such a bad pet parent, why were his animals alive and well for years? To me it feels more like two unstable people clashing (the last roommate probably had her own issues) until it became explosive. His suicide in jail also says a lot \u2014 not a guy who loved life ruining others, but someone full of self-hatred once stripped of control. Netflix flattened him into a villain, but the real story feels way more tragic and complicated.\n\nIf you look at people like Ricky Morrisey who scammed women and abandoned his dog, or con man like Todd Dean, that\u2019s much colder and more psychopathic than Bachman, who at least took care of his pets. Bachman spiraled after losing them, which shows he had attachments \u2014 twisted, yes, but real.\n\nWhat do you guys take on this? Why did the latest roommate took his dog? Some Reddit posts even suggest she had her own issues (e.g. drugs), which would make this more of a \u201ctwo unstable people colliding\u201d tragedy. If this was handled better, perhaps his brother\u2019s life can be saved. ",

That night I threw on Love on the Spectrum to distract myself and there was this one woman who said something like Sometimes I feel like I love people wrong. And I just started crying cuz its how i feel [sometimes.Im](http://sometimes.im/) def doing everything I can but it lands wrong anyway. Why is it so easy to be misunderstood when youre doing your best? How do you explain that quiet doesnt mean distant and space doesnt mean disinterest?  \n  \nThe next day I put on an episode of Couples Therapytotal emotional spiral I know and Dr. Orna was working with this couple where one partner kept shutting down emotionally and said something like Its not that you dont feel it\u2019s that youre overwhelmed by feeling and freeze. And HOLY HELLL !!! I paused it and just sat there. It was my mirror, exactly me. Not cold just flooded. Weve been trying to work on things since. I use OurRitual on my own sometimes to help get thoughts straight before we talk it\u2019s structured but I still have moments where I feel like Im speaking an emotional dialect no one else quite understands.He still gets frustrated and I still shut down.

The thing that\u2019s annoying is there were people with powers in the very first sequence of episode 1 (a healer was tryna escape the organization\u2019s facility) and all their powers come in randomly later on at like different times (or I guess the same time technically cause it was different episodes but that\u2019s\u2026 kinda worse?!)
