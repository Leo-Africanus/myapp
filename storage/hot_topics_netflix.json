        "content": "\nI just finished the documentary about Piper Rockelle and the ex SQUAD. I feel bad for Piper. She\u2019s such a beautiful, talented little girl. She has so much potential but looking through her socials, it seems like she\u2019s really manipulated by her mother and she believes that everyone who left her is the bad guy. She\u2019s also been really acting inappropriately whilst being a minor. She had so many boyfriends and she doesn\u2019t even delete the contents she made with them (ex bfs)\n\nI think her mom taking advantage of her would similarly lead to her like Sky Bri whose mom is very much supportive on her \u201ccareer\u201d. Piper also hangs out with OF creators like Sophie Rain which looks like foreshadowing of what she will choose to become when she turns legal age.\n\nLooking forward to her response to all the allegations when she turns 18.

I tried searching on how to turn it off, but nothing that I found was for a tv that had a different format. Can someone help me me please?",

Cause she\u2019s on her side, she only has to worry about Jaymie catching on.\n\nSam\u2019s go to \u201cfake lying face\u201d when she\u2019s the millionaire was a wide open mouth, she uses it when the person they voted for has no money in the box at the elimination dinner. \n\nWhen Cara is the millionaire she tells sam off camera. They masterfully break up the guys alliance and start voting them out.\n\nSam tells Cara off camera the clue about the millionaire was 2 sisters. Later, on camera she asks and Cara knows to lie.\n\nCara has the guts to sabotage her laser challenge with Sydney because she has the assurance that sam will not vote for her no matter what and that sam can probably sway corey. Only reason she takes that \u201crisk\u201d. If corey moves to vote Cara out, sam would just deadlock it. Both Cara and sam view Sydney as their biggest threat and corey easy manipulated.\n\nWhen Sydney opens her box, fake big open mouth from sam.\n\nAt the end when Cara wins, Sam is kind of weirdly excited and not that upset. After seeing Cara cry due to winning and corey cry due to losing, Sam figures she needs to cry to to sell it and no tears actually come out cause they are fake crocodile tears.\n\nWatch the show again there are more tells not listed here but it\u2019s plain as day. Cheaters Cara and Sam need to be exposed! \n\n\n",

We never really saw her game play, at all, but we saw Corey\u2019s the entire season yet he never had a chance to be the millionaire. I feel like they built up Sam\u2019s story, and her great gameplay as the Millionaire, just to have filler time on the show. I had a large feeling that the last person to receive the money, would win the show, and as soon as we got to hear Cara\u2019s I hate to call it \u201csob story\u201d, but we all know tv plays those up lol, I knew she had it in the bag. Her reasoning for needing the money, and them mentioning over and over again how she was a burger cook and didn\u2019t have as glamorous of a job as a lot of the rest, would have connected best with the audience at home. I wholeheartedly believe that production made sure to give her the money last, out of the ones that were left, when she received the money. And in doing so we got to finally see a tiny bit of her gameplay, and a lot of her story at the very end, almost as a way to justify her win that would be confusing to a lot of viewers.",

Shouldn\u2019t they have continued the case till Tiffany was held accountable by the court?

        "content": "I don\u2019t have the ad-supported version and everything was working up until a couple hours ago. Suddenly tapping the Cast icon gives me No Devices Found. Every single other app still casts just fine. My wife\u2019s Netflix app, on the same model iPhone, casts just fine.\n\nI\u2019ve tried: \n\n* Restarting my phone\n* Restarting the Chromecast\n* Restarting my Wifi network\n* Resetting the app (twice)\n* Reinstalling the app (three times)\n\nStill nada, no devices found. Google Home connects perfectly, as does Prime, Plex, YouTube, and Dropout. My wife\u2019s iPhone connects fine, my iPad and MacBook connect fine.\n\nNetflix and ONLY Netflix, specifically on *just* my phone, can\u2019t find any devices and I\u2019m at my wits end.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.",

        "content": "I have a very strange problem. For several months now, Netflix has been advertising the game \u201cCozy Grove\u201d as the big teaser on the mainpage. It's not really a problem, but it's the only one I see. Netflix doesn't suggest any series, movies or anything else that might interest me via the big banner, but only Cozy Grove. And it's gradually starting to annoy me.\n\nI've already logged in and out, deleted cookies and website data on my computer ... but it remains.\n\n",
