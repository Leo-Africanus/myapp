        "content": "I know a lot of people are gonna come for me, but it's just my opinion. And don't get me wrong, this show will *always* have a special place in my heart, but it's clear that it's outgrown itself.\n\nThe 80s appeal no longer really has its charm, the kids are no longer kids, and most importantly, the stranger things aren't strange anymore. The unknown is what makes something unsettling. When you begin to spell out all the aspects, it doesn't have that eerie feeling anymore. This show has over-explained its lore to the point where it's very convoluted and no longer uncanny. The whole point of the Upside Down was the unknown, another world that's beyond human comprehension. All of that goes away when you reveal that it's just some guy who's been pulling the strings since the first season. Not only is it overly detailed, but it's also been the same thing for nearly a decade now. The monsters were creepy at first, but now we've seen it a hundred times, so it doesn't have that effect anymore.\n\nI rewatched seasons 1 and 2, and it's honestly crazy how much the show has detached from itself. If somebody watches season 1 and then watches the first episode of season 5 right after, they would be completely baffled. Remember when this show was just about a boy who went missing? And the characters have so much plot armor. I love how the demogorgon slaughters the background characters almost instantly, but when it comes to our protagonists, it stands and screams, so they always run away. Not to mention, the dialogue is also really bizarre, lots of exposition dumps, etc.\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but I don't want this to be too long. I just needed to voice my thoughts somewhere cause anytime you complain on TikTok or the ST subreddit, you just get attacked lol. But I'm glad others are enjoying it. I wonder if it will be one of those shows with an ending that's divisive among fans.",

        "title": "(SPOILERS) The Complete Stranger Things Season 5 Theory",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo here is my full theory on how I think Season 5 is building toward the final showdown. I am connecting everything from the show, the new season, The First Shadow play, and the patterns we have seen over the years. I will go from the beginning and build the whole picture step by step so it flows and makes sense.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n1. Vecna and Henry\u2019s Origin and Why He Was Not Born Evil\n\nTo me, one of the most important things is the idea that Henry was not born evil. There are two pieces of canon that support this.\n\nThe first is the stage play, The First Shadow. In the play, we see Henry as a strange kid, but he is not violent or murderous. He only changes after an incident in the cave. He interacts with experimental equipment from Brenner\u2019s project, and that accident sends him into Dimension X for the first time. That is the first moment where he is exposed to pure Dimension X energy and Mind Flayer particles.\n\nThe second piece of evidence comes from the show itself. In Season 2, when Will is possessed by the Mind Flayer, his behavior changes instantly. He becomes cruel, manipulative and cold. The scene where he leads the soldiers into the Demodogs is a perfect example. Will would never do that under normal circumstances. That tells us the Mind Flayer particles do not just control you physically. They change the way you think and feel.\n\nSo when Henry gets exposed in the cave, the same thing happens to him. He comes back from Dimension X with a completely different worldview. He starts seeing humans as lesser beings. He starts having thoughts about domination and reshaping reality. All of this lines up with the Mind Flayer\u2019s ideology, not with Henry\u2019s original personality.\n\nThis tells me Henry was not inherently evil. He was corrupted by Dimension X.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. The Cave and Why Vecna Is Afraid of It\n\nThis detail is one of the most important clues in Season 5. Vecna refusing to enter that cave is not random at all.\n\nHere is the corrected canon interpretation based on the play and the show.\n\nIn The First Shadow, the cave is the exact place where Henry gets exposed to Dimension X. That is where the equipment malfunction happens. That is where he gets pulled in. That is where the corruption begins.\n\nSo when Vecna avoids that cave many years later, that fear comes from Henry buried deep inside him. That moment was traumatic. It was the moment he lost control of his life and mind. The fact that he still hesitates shows that Henry is still inside Vecna. This supports the idea that he was not born evil. He still has human fear.\n\nThere is also a second meaning here. Vecna\u2019s fear of the cave hints at something else being inside Dimension X that even he does not want to face. If he were the top villain, he would not fear walking into any place. The fact that he avoids the location that connects to Dimension X tells us that there is something older and more dangerous than him.\n\nThis ties into the Dungeons and Dragons idea of the Thessalhydra and the possibility that the true final villain is the ancient creature that corrupted Henry in the first place.\n\nSo the cave symbolizes both Henry\u2019s corruption and the existence of a bigger threat.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Will\u2019s Powers and Why Will Is More Important Than Anyone Realizes\n\nSeason 5 finally makes it obvious that Will is not just connected to the hive mind. He has actual psychic abilities. These abilities come from all of the exposure he had in Season 1 and Season 2. He breathed in particles. He lived in the Upside Down longer than anyone else. He hosted the shadow monster inside him.\n\nHis connection is permanent, and it is deeper than Eleven\u2019s.\n\nWhen Will kills the Demogorgons using telekinesis, it is real telekinesis. His nose bleeds which is what happens when someone uses psychic force. That is something we only saw with Henry, Eleven and the other Hawkins Lab kids.\n\nThe difference is that Will\u2019s power comes from the hive. He amplifies his own psychic output with the network of Dimension X. That is why he can do it from miles away. He is basically using the hive as a power source.\n\nThis is why Vecna has always sensed Will. Will has access to the same pathways that Vecna uses. Will is the internal counter to Vecna\u2019s control. He is the one person who can fight Vecna from inside the hive while Eleven fights from the outside.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Kali and Why She Still Matters\n\nKali, or Eight, being present in Season 5 and in the Upside Down base is a huge sign. Kali was always the next strongest psychic after Eleven and Henry. Her illusion abilities might be the only thing that can shield the kids from Vecna or confuse whatever creature is coming from Dimension X.\n\nKali was also created through the same project as Henry and Eleven, which lines up with the idea that children are the best psychic conduits. If there is going to be a final psychic battle, Kali has a real role in it.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. The Kidnapped Children and Vecna\u2019s Lair\n\nSeason 5 shows us that Vecna has kidnapped twelve children. We see this through Will\u2019s visions. Vecna even tells Will that he likes the idea of children being intermediates.\n\nThis lines up with everything we know about the Hawkins Lab experiments. Children have more psychic sensitivity. Their minds are easier to link to other dimensions. Vecna wants to use these twelve kids as psychic amplifiers to open something big. The number twelve matters because it fits a pattern of ritualistic or structural stability that we have seen in the Upside Down.\n\nThis connects directly to the wormhole idea.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. Wormhole Theory and the Fleshy Wall Around the Upside Down\n\nOne of the best scenes in Season 5 is when Dustin, Nancy, Steve and Jonathan break into the UD and crash into the fleshy wall surrounding Hawkins.. Dustin realizes that the wall is perfectly circular around Hawkins and that the center of the circle is Hawkins Lab. This lines up with the original gate from 1979. The Upside Down formed as a snapshot frozen in time from that event.\n\nWe also have the science teacher giving a lesson on wormholes. This is the Duffers telling us that we are dealing with a tunnel between realities. Which confirms cannon from the First Shadow. The Upside Down is not a world by itself. It is a bridge. A halfway point. A buffer.\n\nThen Will makes that red swirling drawing of Vecna\u2019s lair. It looks exactly like the wormhole diagram from the science class. All of this is pointing toward the same direction.\n\nThe fleshy wall is blocking the path. It is designed to contain Dimension X energy so it does not spill out completely.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. The Full Wormhole Plan and Vecna\u2019s Real Goal\n\nVecna does not want another small portal. That is not enough. Demogorgons are dangerous but too slow. Vecna wants a direct wormhole from Dimension X to the Rightside Up.\n\nTo do that he needs to break the wall around the Upside Down. He needs the psychic power of the twelve kids. He needs the full hive network. He needs to weaken the membrane so Dimension X can push through.\n\nThis wormhole would allow the ultimate evil to enter. It could be the Thessalhydra or another massive creature from Dimension X. Vecna is building the bridge to bring this thing here. He is not the final villain. He is the one preparing the way for the real one.\n\nEpisode by Episode Breakdown and the Full Final Showdown\n\n(Part 2 of 2)\n\nNow that all the background is clear, everything starts falling into place when you look at how each episode moves the story toward the final fight in the Rightside Up.\n\nLet me go episode by episode and connect the dots.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEpisode 5: Shock Jock\n\nBy the time we reach this episode, the group already knows that the Upside Down is surrounded by that fleshy circular wall. Dustin figured that out earlier when they crashed into it. He also figured out that the center of that wall is Hawkins Lab, and that the wall is acting like a barrier to keep Vecna\u2019s lair hidden and stop El from reaching the kids. It is also stopping something from Dimension X from leaking fully into our world.\n\nIn Shock Jock, the gang is not randomly sending out a big radio wave. They are doing it because they need to weaken that fleshy wall. They know Vecna has twelve children held inside his lair. Will has seen this in his visions. These kids are being used as psychic amplifiers. The gang understands that unless they break through the wall, they cannot reach Vecna\u2019s lair and rescue the children.\n\nThe red radio wave is the attempt to blast the membrane. (Maybe). It will weaken. It might open just enough for them to get partial access. This is not the full wormhole yet. This is just the gang trying to break the blockade around the Upside Down.\n\nInside Hawkins Lab, they start finding clues. They discover old files, old devices, and remnants of Brenner\u2019s experiments that hint at Dimension X being the real origin point. This confirms Dustin\u2019s wormhole theory. It also matches what we saw in The First Shadow. The lab was messing with dimensional energy long before anyone realized what it was capable of.\n\nShock Jock ends with the barrier weakened but not destroyed. The gang realizes that Vecna is building something on the other side that they cannot fully see yet. Will senses that something massive is coming. The tension is now building toward a direct dimensional breach.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEpisode 6: Escape from Camazotz\n\nThis episode focuses heavily on Max and Holly. Holly has been reading A Wrinkle in Time earlier in the season. She uses the name Camazotz to describe the place where Max is stuck. Camazotz in that book is a world of mind control and psychic domination, which is a perfect description of Vecna\u2019s mental realm.\n\nMax is trapped inside Vecna\u2019s mind. Holly can see this because she has been exposed to particles earlier in the season, which has made her sensitive. It is not that Holly suddenly has full powers like Eleven or Henry, but she has enough psychic awareness to see and understand the mental traps.\n\n Max has already helped Holly navigate Vecna\u2019s illusions. This episode reveals how powerful Vecna\u2019s mind really is. He has built entire environments inside Camazotz that reflect his trauma, his corruption and the influence of Dimension X.\n\nAs Max and Holly fight their way out, their escape weakens Vecna. When someone escapes his mental realm, it forces him to redirect energy. That energy has to come from somewhere. Since Vecna is trying to build the wormhole during this same time, their escape disrupts his momentum.\n\nThis episode is important because it shows that Vecna can be weakened psychologically, not just physically. It also shows how Holly is now part of the larger fight. She is sensitive to Dimension X energy, and she becomes one of the keys to breaking Vecna\u2019s control over the kids he kidnapped.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEpisode 7: The Bridge\n\nThis is the turning point episode. The title says it all. The Bridge is the moment where Vecna\u2019s plan starts to succeed.\n\nWith the children acting as psychic nodes, Vecna begins to open a direct connection between Dimension X and the Rightside Up. This is not a portal like the ones we saw before. This is the wormhole Dustin was talking about. This is the tunnel between realities.\n\nThe membrane around the Upside Down starts tearing. Hawkins Lab begins to crack open. The air distorts. The sky changes color. Will\u2019s connection to the hive mind becomes overwhelming. He starts seeing shapes and creatures from Dimension X that are trying to push through.\n\nThis is the episode where Will fully taps into the hive. We saw earlier that Will can now use telekinesis through the network. In The Bridge, he tries to stop Vecna from inside the hive, but Vecna fights back. This is the first time we see the two of them clash directly on the psychic plane.\n\nEleven and the others are fighting on the outside while Will fights on the inside. Kali might help counter illusions that Vecna uses against them. The children in Vecna\u2019s lair begin to glow with Dimension X energy as the wormhole starts forming. The ground in Hawkins shakes. The barrier becomes thin enough that shadows start rising behind it.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the wormhole finally breaks open. Something massive is on the other side. A silhouette that looks like the Thessalhydra appears in the sky. Hawkins begins to collapse. This is where all the tension explodes into the final episode.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEpisode 8: The Rightside Up\n\nThe final showdown does not happen in the Upside Down. It happens in our world. That is why the episode is called The Rightside Up. The wormhole is fully open now. Dimension X energy floods into Hawkins. Dark clouds, red lightning, and shadow forms start pouring into our world.\n\nVecna steps into the Rightside Up. The children he kidnapped are still amplifying his power. The Thessalhydra or whatever ancient creature from Dimension X begins to break through the wormhole. Hawkins is almost unrecognizable.\n\nThis is where everything comes together.\n\nEleven fights Vecna physically.\nWill fights Vecna through the hive.\nKali uses her illusions to protect the group and distract the monster.\nHolly helps Max stay mentally grounded so Vecna cannot pull her back.\nThe gang fights the creatures entering Hawkins.\n\nThere is also a real possibility that Vecna does not remain loyal to the greater evil. When he sees the creature coming through, the same fear from the cave returns. He realizes he was never in control. He was only the door opener. This could push him to turn against the bigger villain during the final moments.\n\nThe finale ends with the wormhole collapsing after the ultimate villain is defeated through a combination of Eleven\u2019s power, Will\u2019s hive control, and the others fighting on the ground. The Upside Down stops functioning as a separate dimension. The final battle ends in the Rightside Up, which ties back perfectly to the episode title.\n",

        "content": "I have no idea if this is because of an update, but Netflix used to have an option where you could see the info about a show or movie. You clicked on the show and it sent you to the info page and a preview would play. Now it automatically plays it and you have to go find the info button. This is making me upset because I have like 50 things in my recent watch with this setting. I turned off autoplay previews while browsing but that\u2019s not what I wanted. Someone please help me.",

I am watching from my Apple TV and using the Netflix app. The day before Thanksgiving was fine, I watched episode one of stranger things. Last night, I was unable to watch any titles at all. \u201cThis title is unavailable for instant streaming\u201d I thought, \u201coh great, now I have to pay for premium to watch stranger things\u201d but then quickly realized every single title, popular or unpopular, had the same error message. Even those weird Netflix filler shows. So I googled, and it said to clear my cache. I did that. I reset my internet router. I updated my Apple TV, then restarted the Apple TV. Deleted the Netflix app and reinstalled it. Nothing worked, even today the same problem. So I\u2019m back to my original thought, I must need to pay for premium then right? I\u2019m just confused about nothing else being available either. Is there nothing available for the basic subscription anymore lol or is this a problem other people are experiencing? ",

Honestly this is enough to make me want to unsubscribe again. I don\u2019t mind ads between scenes, but in the middle is insane.",

Action, humor, emotions, fiction, and just the right amount of VFX for the plot without overdoing it. I laughed, I cried, and like any classic nerd, I imagined in my head what life could be if something like that happened in real life and how I would be.\n\n2025 has been an utterly disappointing year for movies in general, so I'm glad Netflix added this gem recently to it's collection and let me end the year on a high and positive note when it comes to content.  \nHappy Thanksgiving to anyone who's reading this.

        "content": "The series is very good in itself, but there was one detail that made this series one of the best I've ever watched. I started the series when I was 14 and ended it when I was 15. As the series takes place in the same period, which is when the main part of puberty happens. I ended up identifying with the characters and what they were going through. The icing on the cake was the ending, which I watched on the last day of the ninth year of elementary school, with all the fear I was about high school and with some of my friends changing groups and personalities, this episode was essential for me. The last episode portrays exactly this fear of the future that I was feeling and how much my friends and I grew this year as people and physical characteristics, and mainly, how normal this division of sides is after we start to establish our own ideas, each one meets new people and settles into new groups, or changes schools, but it's normal to be afraid or sad, it turns out that's life and we have to face it, but the memories of that good time will always be kept in our hearts forever. Very moving indeed, this series mirrored my life and helped me go through puberty. And it showed me how important ninth grade was for me, I will miss my old friends forever. And I never realized that when I was with them. Now I understand, thanks to this series.",

I keep thinking about the characters, the whole vibe, the music, everything, and it\u2019s making the wait even worse.\n\nIf anyone has a show that gives even a little bit of that same feeling, I\u2019d really appreciate the suggestions.
