        "title": "Singles inferno 5: Am I the only one that thinks Heesun and Subeen are not compatible???",
        "content": "Unpopular onion: I watched both Singles Inferno 5 and the reunion today. BTW, best season hands down. I wanted to put my honest and sincere opinion out there. Am I the only one that thinks Heesun and Subeen aren\u2019t compatible???\n\nas someone who used to be in their 20\u2019s, in college, and dating, their relationship seems lowkey\u2026toxic.\n\nIf I recall from Heesun\u2019s introduction in Singles Inferno 5, she said she\u2019s never had a boyfriend. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. She\u2019s also is a college student and one of the youngest contestants on the show. Despite her academic, trainee, beauty pageant, cheerleader, and Canadian background she strikes me as someone book smart but lacks street smarts especially in the area of relationships.\n\nLet me explain: if you watched the reunion, you can see when she\u2019s watching back the show \u2014she\u2019s completely clueless during SI5 and even present. She even said herself she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on half the time. During SI, she KNEW Subeen had unresolved feelings for Mina Sue but still chose him. Which is fine. However,  she looks like a lost puppy whenever she\u2019s around him. To me it isn\u2019t cute, it\u2019s actually kind of sad to see how much she likes him. But I feel like he only started really show interest in wanting to know her more after she revealed her age and background. I\u2019ve dated ex\u2019s in the past who only liked me bc of my background and accolades so it seemed off to me.\n\nEven after Mina Sue had the final conversation in inferno with Sunbeen. She said that she was ready to move on from him and go for Sam Lee and that he was ready to focus on Heesun \u2014they agreed on that. Water under the bridge, so we thought\u2026but the way I see it, Subeen was not over Mina. He was still butthurt during the campfire scene when Mina was saying interested in this guy and would go to paradise with another so fort bc he brought it up again at the reunion dinner. Again this isn\u2019t about Mina but how Sunbeen\u2019s pride was hurt. Which is valid and understandable.\n\nAt the reunion dinner, when they answered the questions in the Jenga blocks. The question Sunbeen got was \u201cwhat do you dislike most in someone\u201d in which he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t like someone who is changes their mind a lot.\u201d Was a direct shot to Mina Sue even after she apologized to him and he said it was fine. If he truly moved on from Mina and really liked Heesun, he wouldn\u2019t care. He would\u2019ve resolved those feelings and grown from it and remained neutral. But he STILL brought it up in front of everyone even after 6 months and even after Mina apologized for her behavior. He doesn\u2019t like that Mina got over it and can joke about it but he can\u2019t. Which shows he\u2019s still immature. He even expressed a lot of emotion during the reunion screening towards Mina. Whenever it\u2019s Heesun in the screen he\u2019s straight up crickets. \ud83e\udd97\n\nIf you watched the show and reunion, he acts nonchalant around Heesun and barely looks at her unless he\u2019s drinking a lot. That\u2019s why during their time in inferno and at the reunion he relied on alcohol to feel that attraction towards her. With Mina, he didn\u2019t need alcohol to be attracted to her \u2014He simply was.\n\nHe kept asking Heesun at the reunion if she was drunk. Bc to me, he wants her at his level so he can manipulate her. It\u2019s very subtle and it will going over a lot of peoples head. But to me, he\u2019s a red flag. When they\u2019re sober, he doesn\u2019t act crazy, obsessed, or attracted to Heesun. He acts very neutral which is contrast to how he felt with Mina Sue, his feelings were more prevalent and strong with her. Again, this isn\u2019t about Mina bc in the end Mina and Subeen wouldn\u2019t have been a good match. He really was attracted to Mina initially but bc of the indecisive campfire scene, Heesun was the easier pick. Heesun was always by his side. His pride was too strong and too hurt by Mina. So Heesun was easier and safe choice for him. I just dislike that when I watch them his body language and even his eyes he barely looks at her. To me, if a man was really interested and attracted to me he would physically show that with his eyes and body language. Like it looks like he\u2019s not into her, as much as she\u2019s into him. People will say \u201cshe fell for him first, but he fell harder\u201d \u2014I would have to disagree. I think he\u2019s shallow and only likes Heesun bc she\u2019s younger and less experienced than him (easier to manipulate) and comes from a good background. She\u2019s safe. But not what he wants.\n\nAnother example of why I think he\u2019s a red flag. At the reunion, when they were cheers-ing their drinks. He didn\u2019t even cheers his glass with Heesun. Heesun attempted to cheers with Sunbeen but he didn\u2019t notice nor paid attention to her. He\u2019s always paying attention to how everyone is perceiving him and is very careful with his words and hides his expression trying hard to be nonchalant. It\u2019s almost like a protective mechanism.\n\nAlso as someone who is married, at gatherings with friends I am not clinging on my partner the whole time.  We may sit together and interact but the WHOLE time??? We are two individuals that are able to have fun and enjoy our time with our friends together and individually. Because we trust each other and our very secure with ourselves. I don\u2019t see that Subeen and Heesun have reached that point with themselves yet.\n\nSubeen and Heesun reminded me of those couples you see in middle school/high school that don\u2019t know any better. It\u2019s like that young puppy love and they just cling to each other the whole time. Even around friends. Despite what the cast members say they to them, they will stick together like glue. Not in aww cute way but like a concerning unhealthy way. Mingee even joked with Heesun when Sunbeen was grilling the meat outside. She said to Heesun \u201cyou\u2019re always be his side like a puppy.\u201d Heesun doesn\u2019t notice she just stands there and laughs awkwardly while Sunbeen responds back to Mingee \u201cI\u2019m her dog.\u201d Notice how they don\u2019t really interact with other cast members, only amongst themselves. Not saying it\u2019s a bad thing but it\u2019s more of a sign of their insecurity within themselves and their lack of experience as adults and as a couple. I even notice Heesun is not close with the other girls. She just sticks with Subeen and Sam. That lowkey gives subtle pick me behavior but the pick me behavior is only toward the man she likes/dating. Again, it\u2019s very subtle no one has pointed this out. But I instantly noticed it even when there were shooting SI5, Heesun wasn\u2019t really close with the girls. Not saying it\u2019s a bad thing, but she was to herself and only opens up to the guy she likes.\n\nHeesun\u2019s flaw: despite how book smart and many talents she has, she strikes me as someone who becomes clueless and loyal to a fault when she really likes someone. Like she\u2019s willing to overlook all the bad things and endure all the pain just to be with someone. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Subeen cheated, manipulated her, and she would still take him back. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but as of what I saw and the age she\u2019s at she\u2019s very young and naive. She\u2019s willing to get any attention from him even just a little bc it validates her.\n\nSunbeen\u2019s flaw: is that he is very passive aggressive. People overlook this but if you watch the show and reunion, he shows classic signs of it. He did that when he was being petty towards Mina Sue at Inferno after he found he she wanted to got inferno with Seungil. He took to so far Mina passed out and fainted and he acted like he didn\u2019t know she did even though everyone on the island knew. He also was passive and avoidant, when he found out from Sam during the reunion dinner that Heesun drank a lot of Vodka in New York. He got up and went into the hallway for moment and Heesun followed him asking if he was okay. He claims he was but I don\u2019t interpret it that way. He\u2019s the type bury his feelings until he explodes or just becomes cold altogether. Either way, he acts like he\u2019s fine but he\u2019s not. To which I would say to Subeen, it\u2019s okay to feel jealous, possessive, or uncomfortable. It\u2019s okay to have feelings! He tends to be an avoidant (red flag) when he experiences these emotions and doesn\u2019t want to tell Heesun bc he claims he doesn\u2019t want her to worry. But Heesun even said herself she wants to know these things. I think if he really wanted to make it work with Heesun he needs to be more open about what bothers him and his feelings because that\u2019s human  nature. It\u2019s okay to not be okay. They didn\u2019t talk about this during the reunion episode 6, but I hope he\u2019s not just saying that bc he\u2019s in front of a camera.\n\nI had an ex like him, they would bottle things up for months and not tell you it bothered them. Acting nonchalant, all cool about it, the one day they just explode and tell you that it did actually bother them. With relationships you need to be able to talk about small and big things. Not just big things bc the small things will add up and come to the light eventually. That\u2019s something they both need to learn.\n\nThat\u2019s what I fear with Subeen and Heesun. He will just keep bottling up his emotions and explode on her and seeing that she\u2019s inexperienced with relationships, she\u2019ll just overlook it and take him back. Classic young couple behavior. It\u2019s honestly giving \u201cthat\u2019s my man and ima stick beside him\u201d energy. It\u2019s no shade to them but more so my concern as an older and married and who used to date different men when they were younger in college.\n\nAf the same time, I don\u2019t feel bad for Heesun either bc she CHOSE and still chooses him. But he seems very traditional and conservative type of man. I worry she will bend to him and to what his wants and needs are. Always saying it\u2019s okay it\u2019s okay. Which we already clearly see happening even when they were filming singles inferno. She always puts him first. She\u2019s more keen and in tune to his feelings than vice versa.  I don\u2019t see him apologizing or comforting her unless she brings it up to him or she gets to the point she\u2019s crying. Again, she needs to work on that too. He had no idea she felt that way so that\u2019s on her. But I do wish he was more keen to her emotions bc she\u2019s a very sensitive person that deserves someone who can be gentle and validate her. She needs someone who is mature and that will help her grow and he needs learn to open up more and not become so cold and passive. That combo could lead to a recipe for disaster imo. But what do I know I\u2019m just a random person sharing their option on the internet.\n\nAs a woman who is still working on her degree, I hope Heesun always puts her dreams and ambitions first. I heard from her conversation with Sam, that she was going back to school in Korea. Not sure what happened with Carnegie Mellon. Which means her and Subeen will be spending more time together figuring things out as a couple.\n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong about what I\u2019m saying about them. They could prove me wrong. However, I haven\u2019t seen much people post about Heesun and Subeen being not compatible together. Again this is my personal opinion.",

        "content": "I just rewatched Dash &amp; Lily after having a pretty rough week, and I\u2019m kind of emotional about it.\n\nI first watched it when I was 14, and I don\u2019t think I realized at the time how much it shaped my idea of what love should be. That show genuinely formed the way I see romance, as something pure, intentional, and almost\u2026 perfect in its imperfection.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most spectacular or dramatic series ever. It\u2019s not trying to shock you or overwhelm you. It\u2019s just balanced. A little humor, a little sadness, a little awkwardness, a little magic. But somehow it all comes together in a way that feels so safe and warm.\n\nThe whole notebook concept, two people connecting through words before really knowing each other  it just feels so sincere. Like love doesn\u2019t have to start with fireworks or chaos. It can start with understanding. With curiosity. With vulnerability.\n\nAnd the atmosphere?? The Christmas vibe in New York City, the bookstores, the quiet moments, the soundtrack it creates this world that feels softer than real life. Like there\u2019s space to breathe.\n\nWatching it again now, after feeling kind of suffocated by the world lately, it still gives me that same healing feeling. Like maybe out there, somewhere, there really is someone who fits you in that almost poetic way. The right timing. The right dynamic. The \u201cthis makes sense\u201d kind of connection.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t rewatch it sooner. I think I\u2019m going to make it a thing now anytime life feels heavy, I\u2019m putting it on.\n\nIt might not be the most complex show ever made. But to me? It\u2019s perfect. And I kind of owe it for shaping the part of me that still believes love can be something pure.",

        "content": "So i am having trouble listening to speech on new TV series (like Unfamiliar) in Netflix ennglish 5.1, i need to switch to English original so the backgound music goes down (this happens with older movies as well), but new series and new movies should be able to handle English 5.1.\n\nSo why is this happening with newer TV series on netflix, when in actual fact speech should be clear and louder than background music? I need to switch from English 5.1 to English orginal. \n\nI have LG s75qr surround speakers that are 5.1.2 and they work well and have been pleasing to the ears for 3 years.\n\nThanks ",

        "content": "Edit: Someone on another reddit group gave me the solution! I logged into Netflix using a Chrome browser on my PC. Then I went to Account -&gt; Edit Settings -&gt; Playback Settings -&gt; Data usage per screen. It was set to Low by default. I changed it to High. Then I went back to the Roku on my TV and, BAM!!! Stranger Things on the Netflix app now shows the 5.1 logo! I just watched the first 10 minutes of season 5 episode 1 in full glorious 5.1 surround sound.\n\nOriginal: I have a Roku streaming box and I'm on the Netflix Standard plan. I can't get 5.1 surround sound working on any Netflix movies or shows. I know the Roku can output 5.1 surround sound because it's working with other apps like YouTube, MAX, etc. It's just not working with the Netflix app. Do I need to be on the Premium plan to get 5.1 surround sound? \n\nEdit: I know not all Netflix movies and shows may have 5.1 audio. I just tried Stranger Things season 5 because people online say it has amazing surround sound. But I'm only getting 2-channel sound. ",

        "content": "Honestly, I still had a great time watching the show. It\u2019s not the next masterpiece, but it was a fun, quick 8-episode binge. I\u2019ve read complaints about the poor acting, but I couldn't care less because I actually enjoy a bit of trashy love triangle drama. However, one thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between the sisters, Adriana and Elise. They literally went from loving each other to being die-hard enemies wishing the worst on each other within five minutes. It didn't just happen once, it felt like it happened every single episode. It was laughable and made zero sense. Another thing that bothered me was how unrealistic the money situation was. Being 30k in debt is laughable if ALL of your pro athletes are going to the World Finals. I don't know exactly what figure skaters make, but I do know what sponsorships pay for a whole roster of World Champs. It made the debt plot point feel really weird. Also, why was there no winning party at the end? That felt like a huge missed opportunity!",
