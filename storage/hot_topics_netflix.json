Why are they not treating the place as a crime scene? Why isn\u2019t he taken back to the station to file a formal report?\nHow does a lawman fail to recognize the difference between running over a nail and a textbook slashed tire on the side wall? Why would the reporter be considered or treated as a suspect off the bat? just because he's a writer, he's automatically a body chopping homicidal individual? this is no Jussie Smollett case,(all though even his \"assailants\" were taken under better preliminary scrutiny) it's a possible cartelish sounding case with professionals at hand, which is far more pressing. yes, there's little proof to corroborate his story, but can a real cop tell us what would have taken place if a CNN or Fox personality with news media influence came to them with such a story?\nWhy hasn\u2019t the reporter contacted his colleagues at the station? And why would he even stay near that property alone after the police left?\nThis isn\u2019t a critique of the characters in this pilot ep.\u2014it's about the story writing. It\u2019s unrealistic, sloppy, and a product of LOUSY MADNESS so far.\n\nLousy madness or keep watching it gets better? \n",

Made it kind of difficult for me to get into.\nNow that I have...\nOhmygah, this is one of the fullest explorations into time that I have encountered, and I really have enjoyed the heck out of it!\n\nSo... for all you folks that are years ahead of me...\nDo the latter seasons take as long to grip you?\n\nI know that a pilot season has a lot of ground to lay out; new names, faces &amp; places &amp; the likes. This show had that 3x over, and did so wonderfully, BUT with so much to cover, I think the amount of minutes it took to do that may have been a factor that made it hard for me to get invested in much earlier than I did.\n\nAgain, being that the amount of time it took to take off was my only real issue, I am sincerely hoping that the next seasons kind of roll on a bit more quickly.\n\nAnd anyone that was a MEGA fan of the series...\nWhich season is your favorite?\nAny recommendations for after?\nThx!",

The dog thing just gave me anxiety (I always worry about ppl feeding my dog things he can't eat, so even her pushing the cookies near the dog made me uneasy), so no laughs for me there.  The end honesty reveals with everyone was fun for a second before it became really sad.  I guess like a lot of downers in this one between all the cheating and the mom's death, so just not exactly what I was expecting going into this kind of movie. \n\nSo yeah, at this point, I don't know if anything is going to be topping \"Nobody Wants This\" this year for my favorite rom-com.

And even this show had a LOT of cons. I do like historical satire tho like 1670. If you are making a show about a real historical person make it ACCURATE. If its a made up story , go for it. hate hero/villain movies. I dont like usless diversity and pointless romance(sex scenes). I enjoy thriller, comedy, a bit of drama doesnt hurt. I dont like Sci-fi. I love it when the movie is in the language where the story is happening. I like nature, advanture. I LOVE EPICS (Ben hur, Lawrence of Arabia) I  watch a show for the story and i frequently drop shows because they get too repetitive and generic . I dont think i have ever watched a tv series with more than 2 seasons on netflix MADE by netflix producers (especially american production team) that i have genuinely liked or finished til the end.",

        "title": "2 reliable methods for Picture-In-Picture (PiP) on Windows 11/10",
        "content": "If you're anything like me, you often have Netflix on while you do routine tasks or play casual games. Picture-in-picture (PiP) was wonderful. The \"upgrade\" away from version 6.99.5 has effectively crippled the Netflix app -- downloads are no longer supported, and PiP is not readily available.\n\nThere are 2 reliable methods to enable PiP with Netflix in its current state. I expect these solutions to continue to work, since they're supported by Microsoft/Google/Mozilla developers for non-Netflix applications too. Here's your options:\n\n1. __Use web browser's built-in PiP functionality. (Prefer MS Edge)__\n\n   - Microsoft Edge has the same video quality as the Netflix app, though subtitles will not show in the PiP window, nor will the arrow keys function to skip forward/backward. \n   - Firefox/Chrome/Chromium is intentionally capped in bitrate by Netflix. Reduced video and audio quality compared to the app/Edge. Specifically, it tags video for lower quality and older codecs, and often 128kbit vs 192 kbit audio. It may not make a difference in every show/movie or in conjunction with windowed mode and mixed audio.\n   - Firefox specifically supports subtitles while in PiP mode, a must-have for foreign languages or quiet dialogue.\n   - Browser PiP often needs to be reset when playback skips to a new video (next episode). Close PiP window and re-open it for the new episode.\n\n\n2. __\"Always On Top\" function provided by Microsoft PowerToys.__ Install first, then enable via setting and shortcut keys.\n\n   - To enable this module, turn it on under the Context Menu (Windowing &amp; Layouts) or Dashboard (Disabled Modules).\n   - To put Netflix above all, have PowerToys open in the background/minimized, click the Netflix window so it's focused in the foreground, and use the \"WIN + CTRL + T\" shortcut to enable \"Always On Top\". Change the shortcut bind if you must, in settings.\n   - Borders generated by PowerToys can be disabled by clicking on AlwaysOnTop header to open settings in the PowerToys interface. \n   - However, the Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons and the window title bar cannot be hidden without editing the Netflix app itself.\n\nMicrosoft PowerToys on Microsoft Store: [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld)\n\nREMINDER: Games and other apps must not be in exclusive Fullscreen mode. Windowed or Borderless will allow Netflix to stay on top.\n\nIMPORTANT: Microsoft Edge's PiP button is occasionally hidden unless you pause-play the video. Something about the menu option depends on playback being started by the user (not auto-played). When in doubt, pause-play the video first, right-click on the window tab for Netflix and choose \"Enter picture in picture\"; specifically it should be nestled between the \"Mute\" and \"Send to device\" options.\n\nHappy multi-tasking!",
