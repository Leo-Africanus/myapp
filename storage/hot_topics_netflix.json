There was no downside for an alliance of 5 people voting out 4 others. That would then make it a boring and predictable show when you know who will be voted out.\n\nLet's say the contestant's voted out someone that is not the millionaire, then $100,000 is taken off the prizepool and given to the millionaire.

I see a lot of people saying the series is about toxic masculinity, and while I can clearly see it plays a big role in the series, that\u2019s not \u201conly\u201d it to me.\n\nLastly, I invite everyone who has the intend to respond, to comment on my post. You may critique this, applaud it, laugh at my grammer, correct me, add to it, ask me about anything and even post memes. Just comment anything you want. Because I think you should know that your opinion matters (not necessarily to a person individually but it does 100% matter to society). If you don\u2019t want to respond then that\u2019s also fine, that\u2019s an opinion too. Only by talking things out as civil beings we can make this world a better place for everyone. If you don\u2019t agree with this part you may also comment if you want. (Sorry if this paragraph was too long, I have ADD so that may explain it hehe)\n\n(My first language isn\u2019t English so if there are any issues and you need me to reexplain something you know what to do ;)) \u2014&gt; if you don\u2019t know what I meant by this just read the paragraph above this one\n\nSmall joke at the end of my comment because I want to make someone smile:\nThis comment is copyrighted by my brain",

The one thing I repelled so far was the Hameed wedding, so the girl is big, Mo himself is big aswell he can have a \u201clove\u201d relationship with Maria but he does not believe Hameed loves Dallas and just marries her for greencard. So as a former big girl I got triggered why men are acceptable as big as they are and women are not? What is the difference and this coming from a big guy (I mean of course it is scripted and I don\u2019t know if he is in the writer squad but still) is very annoying and heartbreaking, when this hypocracy will end? Being a big women does not equal to not being loved\ud83d\ude22",
