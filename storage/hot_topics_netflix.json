        "content": "It\u2019s new &amp; I had never heard of this guy so I watched it last night. Why is Netflix is giving this guy more notoriety and why do we elevate \u2018influencers\u2019 like this??\n\nToxic &amp; cliche grifter promoting an \u2018All Meat Primal\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 lifestyle gets caught using steroids\u2026 a surprise to no one with eyeballs.  He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

I\u2019ve seen people who move for military reasons complain, and I am in college out of state so it\u2019s super frustrating to be kicked out of my family\u2019s subscription.\n\nIt\u2019s such an egregious cash grab as well as a petty attempt to discourage password sharing that affects people who aren\u2019t even doing so that unfairly (ie children on their parents\u2019 subscription). It\u2019s a genius business decision and you almost have to give it to em\u2014forcing people into paying for more individual plans just so they can watch makes Netflix wayyy more money\u2014but it\u2019s just sooooo frustrating.

It\u2019s already iconic but this could turn it into one of those generation wide sound memories we all associate with cozy nights, family time, or solo binge rituals.\n\nNetflix, if you see this\u2026 pls consider \ud83e\udd7a\n\n\nWould anyone else use this?\n",

There\u2019s a name, phone number and credit card that\u2019s not mine.\n\nI\u2019m so confused, because it seems like the scammers just took a random Netflix user and changed the email to my email? And it\u2019s definitely not by mistake because my email is my name and the name of the user is completely different(i\u2019m a man, the name of the account is a women). I looked up the phone number and it matches the name of the account.\n\nMaybe the scammer took her phone number and my email, but i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s her credit card they are using or just a random one. The account is 2 years old so maybe the scammers just keeps changing the info? But i\u2019m a bit confused because if it was a stolen credit card they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it for 2 years.\n\nAlso my email isn\u2019t compromised. It\u2019s a gmail and there\u2019s no \u201cforeign\u201d activity in the log in history.\n\nHave anyone seen or heard something like this happen before, because i\u2019m curious and wondering what is the scam here?",

        "title": "Things Bet does right and wrong",
        "content": "\ni watched this show as someone who\u2019s only seen a few episodes of kakegurui (both anime and live action, disliked them both, hope I\u2019m still allowed to post this here though) and honestly i think the show is not all that bad. however, it has LOTS of room foe improvement come s2 if we get it, which i hope we do! first i will start with what it does right:\n\nYumeko: easily the best part of the show, both yumekos character and actress. she\u2019s the perfect mix of mysterious yet an open book; she\u2019s very similar to the original but she openly has a soft, sensitive and sweet side. Great acting as well. Also I just wanna say she\u2019s so pretty lol\n\n\nPlot: The plot in this show is VERY different but quite intriguing, definitely not an adaptation of kakeguri, more like a reboot or reimagining. \n\n\nNow for the bad:\n\nCharacter design: woww this is really where the show struggles. firstly, at least 4 characters have names that rhyme: dori, suki, Mary, riri?? I get that their names were directly inspired by the anime counterparts but come on\u2026. was there really NO way to make the names more interesting while still keeping the Japanese influence? also the student council is supposed to be this intimidating (as in they can and will kill you if you mess with them) and powerful group but they literally all look soft. Literally suki comes is a run of the mill stan twitter user, all bark; ZERO bite whatsoever. riri looks like a cosplayer with bug/bugself pronouns straight out of 2020. Dori,, i wont even comment. Kira looks ok, but the blue lipstick just does NOT translate well from an anime character onto a real person, it was extremely distracting in every scene she was in. also doesn\u2019t really match her personality, hard to believe someone as uptight as her is walking around with bright blue lipstick. \n\n\nWorld building: it\u2019s my understanding that in kakegurui the school was specifically a school FOR gambling, but the school in bet is more like a  normal prep school where students just happen to gamble on the side? I wish they would have done more to make it seem like a school and not just a gigantic casino, I mean I don\u2019t even think there was ever even as much as ONE scene where the characters are in class or studying or interacting with a teacher or just doing something non gambling related?\n\n\nActing: you can definitely tell that many of the actors are novices especially in the last episode. The show definitely gets more interesting towards the end but in turn the pacing really suffers the closer it gets to the end as well.\n\n\nOverall, I want to say 6.5/10 with LOTS of potential; If i was to describe this show to someone whos thinking of watching it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s Wednesday meets Fate the winx saga meets Kill Bill meets Kakegurui\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "What a hard one to watch. He did so much right. He also did so much wrong that is traceable and yet he still claims innocence. I don\u2019t know how he lives with himself and looks in the mirror. Using welfare money from one of the poorest states in the US is a new bottom for any human. His sexual harassment is well-documented too. I hope they recover money for the people of Mississippi and I hope Favre acknowledges his wrongs and has regrets before Parkinson\u2019s makes it hard for him to apologize. Greed is a horrible thing.

        "content": "At some point in the past five years; perhaps between the eighth season of Love Is Blind and the 437th rebranding of The Bachelor; televised dating quietly stopped being about dating. Instead, it became a parade of bronzed narcissists dry-humping on bean bags for the chance to sell flat tummy tea and boner pills to strangers on Instagram. Into this rich tradition steps Netflix\u2019s latest entry, Sneaky Links: Dating After Dark, a show that dares to ask: What if your ex-booty call was also your soulmate? (And what if you were filmed trying to figure that out while shirtless, emotionally stunted, and surrounded by Ikea furniture?)\n\nIf you, like me, are 43 years old and unaware that \u201csneaky link\u201d is Gen Alpha for \u201cbooty call,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. Apparently, the term \u201cbooty call\u201d was too on-the-nose for a streaming platform that also produces prestige dramas about Elizabethan corsets and talking bears. Instead, we get \u201cSneaky Links,\u201d a phrase that sounds like a sketchy URL you click by accident while searching for airfare.",

When it\u2019s not on full screen it\u2019s perfectly normal.\nI saw somewhere something about the screen cool off setting, I checked mine and it\u2019s the recommended 120hz. I updated windows and it\u2019s still glitching. Any idea would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f",

Doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same, but something with suspense, smart characters, and that edgy feel.\n\n\nAlso I don't want really long series with 8-10 seasons with each having 24 eps of 1 hr each\n\nWoukd like 3-5 seasons with episodes about 20-40 mins ?\n\nMaybe there are none based on so many restrictions LAWLLLLLL but kindly help or suggest \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
