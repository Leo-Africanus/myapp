Idk if any of this makes sense, thanks in advance to anyone who does know (or understands)",

Delicately, not exploitedly, and showing strength and resilience in the survivor, instead of the usual crumbling and broken victim. It felt authentic. It was treated with compassion and without shame. \nI do think I would have ended many things differently, it was depressing AF, but overall I liked the series. ",

        "content": "I believe these are the views for the first time they appear in the Netflix Top 10 site.\n\nI recommend giving them a try. I've watched most of them, except Baki Hanma, Dragon Ball Daima, Demon Slayer Season 4. All of them are available in English dub too.\n\n**Sakamoto Days** (Currently simulcasting/weekly release) - 8/10  \nComedy action anime about a hitman who left his job after falling in love at first sight with a convenience store lady. As a result, he left his job and became a father who helped people, prohibited from killing. He's now living his peaceful quiet life... or is he?  \nHe is also being hunted or searched by his former rivals and partners, so he has to stop his enemies without killing them.\n\n**DAN DA DAN** (there's an attempted rape at ep. 1 by the aliens, afterwards it's safe) - 8.5/10  \nHe was an alien fanboy, she was a ghost fangirl. They're in dispute over which one is real since they believe the other one doesn't exist, so the female MC (main character) decided to look for alien; male MC looked for ghost. Turns out both are real. Male MC lost his balls (literally) to Turbo Granny in a tunnel. Long story short they both gain supernatural powers, guess you can say they are a match.\n\n**Record of Ragnarok** - 7/10  \nAnimation needs improvements imho, but it's still enjoyable. The gods want to wipe out humanity due to their sins and selfishness, but one of the Valkyries (Brunhilde) said hold up, let them cook, and proposed an idea to make humans literally fight against the gods in an arena instead. If humans have more wins than gods, humankind will be spared. Some of the fights include Adam vs Zeus, L\u00fc Bu vs Thor, Jack the Ripper vs Heracles, Raiden vs Shiva.\n\n**My Happy Marriage** - 7.5/10  \nThe female MC lives in an abusive household ever since her mother died and her father remarried an evil woman and her daughter. She got forced to be a servant/mais. Her father suddenly brought a news that she is to marry a guy from a noble and distinguished family. Her fiancee is known to be callous and dismissed all his previous fiancees. That's what she expected, but turns out he treated her nicely.\n\n**Ranma 1/2** (2024 remake) - 8/10  \nI'm sure you've heard of this slapstick romance comedy before; if not, it's about a dude (Ranma) who is a gender bender after falling into a hot lake in China; likewise his father who can turn into a Panda. Ranma got engaged with a tomboy girl by his father who is a friend to the fiancee's father.",

        "content": "Just finished watching S2 and damn it was fun. I didn't rewatch Season 1, but this one had me hooked from the first episode. I was on edge and invested in the characters.\n\nBut let's get real - Rose's character just didn't do it for me. I couldn't connect with her, and her storyline felt like a convenient plot device. On the other hand, Alice was a breath of fresh air. I loved her charm and personality, and I was gutted that we didn't get to see more of her. I think the screen time should have been the opposite. Alice in the lead and Rose on the side. Which makes more sense since Alice is an Agent where Rose is just a civilian \n\nCatherine, though personally I enjoyed her character. So classy and poised  There has to be someone who keeps Peter in check and I like Catherine for . And Noor? I liked her strength and perseverance. I loved how the show gave us these glimpses into the characters' pasts, making them feel so much more real and adding depth to the characters. I'm a big fan of characterization and they did it good .\n\nHere's the thing, though: I just don't buy Peter and Rose romance. They have no chemistry at all. I'm really looking forward to some other female lead. And Rose's character, in general, felt like an afterthought. It was like she was only there to advance the plot. So I don't get why people want to see more of her in s3 especially as a romantic interest.\n\nDespite that, I'm still booked with this show. The side characters were definately the show stopper",

        "content": "Does anyone else share this opinion? Sure she\u2019s helpful at times but in general she\u2019s causing more trouble than anything ESPECIALLY in ep 5-6. Rose wants everything to be perfect and ideal when it\u2019s not realistic at all, for example she demands that the agent go and save noors family with little to no time to prepare not only endangering his life but noors family as well but then when it goes wrong she gets upset about it when it should\u2019ve already been expected as a possibility, then she\u2019s iffy about having to lie to get the pictures when she\u2019s already been told that thousands of lives could be at risk but no she\u2019s right it\u2019s a hard choice wavering honesty over thousands of lives. She\u2019s extremely entitled and full of herself. I think the actor did a great job it\u2019s just the way the character was written. \n\nEdit: also biggest nitpick later on rose acts like she was dragged into all this and didn\u2019t ask to be a \u201cnight agent\u201d after having her tantrum when she quite literally inserted herself into every situation any way she could when everyone was hesitant on her doing so.",

I have watched several previews before so I\u2019m not new to this. I am logged into my main profile. I even tried resetting the app and logging in and out and nothing. Anyone else having an issue with the newest screening and it not showing up in your feed? ",

        "content": "Just finished watching two Netflix docuseries: Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War and Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror. Honestly, both were super interesting and packed with details about these major events in history.\n\nIf you\u2019re into learning about big global moments or people like Oppenheimer, these are definitely worth a watch. They break down a lot of important stuff without feeling too overwhelming. Highly recommend if you\u2019re into history or just want to understand these topics better!\n",
