        "title": "Dept Q - Were Carl being followed during his investigation ?",
        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nWhen I first watched the show, upon episode 6, when Carl and Akram go into questioning Fergus about the investigation, he was beaten by some guy.\n\nWhen Carl returns to the precinct, he pulls over and the camera then stays for a full frame on this dark red Mercedes slowing down and then stopping after his Ford.\nFor me this was not some useless detail because it seemed the camera followed this car on purpose, also it caught my eye because it was the same color as Carl's car. \n\nI found it quite bizarre and decided to remember this bit if it comes back later.\nFor me, this car seemed to have followed Carl. Especially after Fergus told them that he was beaten by someone who they suspect is hurting him for cooperating with the investigation.\nThis seemed very odd.\n\nThen episode 9, revelation : we see Ailsa, Lyle's mother, trying to run away on the ferry with the same burgundy red Mercedes. The license plate matches the one following Carl in ep 6. So it was the same Mercedes who stopped behind Carl. It's not possible to see exactly who the driver is... \n\nSo I'm just wondering :\n* Do you think Lyle and his mother were following Carl and Akram during their investigation?\n* Were they the one hurting Fergus to silence him?\n* What this not extremely stupid since \"Sam\" was supposed to be dead? Being caught still alive is risky? \n\nMy take is that it must have been Lyle following Carl but it throws everything upside down knowing that Lyle was following the investigation... \nLyle has the capabilities to spy and stalk since he did that to Merritt. (like the scene where he is behind the window watching from outside before William, Merritt's brother sees him and  screams, to later recognize him on the boat).\nHe was also not always guarding Merritt and not always on the island, her mother did most of the job of keeping her enclosed.\nSo maybe, he was spending his time following Carl?\nBut for what? Taking this chance of being discovered is for me really risky, what is the point? \nAlso, if you're a cop, normally you can spot someone tailing you. \n\nDid you also catch this detail or is this new to you ?\n\nLet me know, I'd love to hear your theories! :) ",

        "content": "I am just venting here out of frustration with the not so new anymore Netflix user interface. Many of you probably like it or have adjusted to it, as Netflix\u2019s own research would suggest, but I could not. I tried, I really tried. \n\nA discussion on the drawbacks of the interface has been exhausted so I will not get into it. What I would add is that I noticed that I have been recently spending more time on Apple TV and HuLu. Not out of stubbornness or revenge, but it came organically. The interface of all three platforms is now very similar with the Netflix one being mid pack. I can no longer tell the difference so I would watch whatever is good. I think the new Netflix interface is an opportunity for other streaming platforms to catch up with Netflix and get new subscribers. It might also be the beginning of Netflix\u2019s decline or at best plateau.",

I searched on our account and there were no trace of this in our payment history.\n\nI called Netflix and within minutes they found the scam and said this will be blocked and we won't have any more issues.\n\nWe also got an email from Netflix addressed to someone else saying the subscription had been cancelled, and to contact them if we didn't request this change.\n\nWhat exactly happened here? Did someone create a different account with my partner's email and bank card? I don't understand how they could get both his card details and his email address, and how could Netflix see that it was a scam so quickly without asking us any security questions or anything else?

With the first film centering on Rumi, I have exciting fan fic ideas for the sequels that will elevate the story and keep viewers hooked. \n\nIntroducing the second installment of the gripping trilogy\u2014a riveting story centered on Zoey, an Asian American singer of Huntr/x navigating the treacherous entertainment world. When Huntr/x arrives in Burbank, California to perform, the film exposes the industry's dark secrets across America, revealing how record labels and entertainment giants exploit artists for profit. Behind the dazzling facade, issues like institutional racism and cultural exploitation threaten artists like Zoey, who confront these challenges fueled by past betrayals and a thirst for justice. Teaming up with a former Korean-Vietnamese American actor and singer\u2014 a who was an old friend of Zoey\u2014the team embarks on a mission to dismantle the corrupt power structures. Together, they uncover a conspiracy rooted in hypocrisy, theft, and manipulation, aiming to expose those who exploit artists and dismantle broken bands. Little do they know, this former stat has other plans for the group. This movie delves into themes of resilience, identity, and redemption within an industry rife with deception\u2014an unmissable story of courage and truth.\n\nIn the thrilling final chapter of the trilogy, follow Mira\u2014a descendant of Korean warriors and the estranged daughter of wealthy weapons manufacturers\u2014as she seeks refuge in music to escape her violent legacy. Joining the acclaimed group Huntr/x, their rise sparks fierce international rivalry among South Korea, China, and Japan, who send their pop groups into intense competition. But as tensions escalated, ancient demon armies led by vengeful spirit kings threatened to destabilize the world, feeding on conflicts between the three nations to dominate their countries and expand their empires. Amidst the chaos, Mira uncovers a profound truth: music\u2019s power to transcend borders, heal wounds, free spirits, and unify people. This epic tale celebrates courage, culture, and hope, showcasing how harmony can triumph over chaos in a fractured world.\n\nThese are my fan fic pitches.

        "content": "**Sorry for my bad english and word repetition. English is not my native language :)**  \n  \nThe last epsiode shows a agent trying to understand the Carol's influence in office, in relation to the emotional epiphany in the Distraction. The final is discovered that the reason for epiphany is the own agent- in short.  \nThe influence of Carol is that she could bring a emotional conection, a individualization but in the same time a community that one cares about the other. The serie focus on the Carol's search for meaning and conection in the midst (I don't know if the translation is right) of a apocalipse. Carol looking for a value.  \nThe employees try don't lose the sanity with the permanence of the cycle, with the repetition from something that they had already done. They try justify their own existence in office, try distract themselves of the apocalipse. So Carol finds the value on monotomy, a satisfaction. She accepted her situation (the apocalipse) and her state (the work). There is a acceptation to death and routine, and with it, there is also a value.   \nThe insatisfaction about the death can be a insatisfaction about the life. Part of the despair of die is because the person didn't satisfied itself, because someone who stayed good don't care about the death, because this one has been already satisfied, has already with the life \"done\" with the things that the life gave.  \nThe people there stayed in comfort, and try to distract to don't thinking about the discomfort from death. Carol shows a balance between being satisfied with the atual situation but don't get attach, don't being dependent with the life.",
