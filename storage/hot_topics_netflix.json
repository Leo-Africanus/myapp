But many times the same thought came into my mind: this movie copied so much from \u201eThe Family Plan\u201c with Mark Wahlberg! First of all the plot itself is very similar. But also some scenes of the movie were almost identical. Like the scene, where they get filmed (in the club) or when they were singing classic songs in their cars.\n\nI wonder why Netflix is copying a one year old movie so obviously?",

I can't even just cast it from phone.

It's just the Netflix App.\n\nIf he turns the stereo system off and uses his TV speakers for Netflix, it works again and doesn't make this werid noises.\n\nI told him to check if there is a Netflix or TV update but both are on the latest versions. Then i told him to delete the app and then install it again, but he said, you can't deeinstall it... So I don't really know...\n\n  \nAnyone has a clue?\n\nThanks",

        "content": "Greetings all, I just received my Philips 65OLED809 and I have a weird issues concerning a sort of framedrop/slowdown in some scene when using Netflix in HDR/Dolbyvision on the TV App.\n\nI'm very sensitive to motion and for me the issue is really apparent when using motion smoothing \"Standard\" or \"Smooth\". By exemple in \"Squid Game\" season 01 first episode between 19m18s and 19m28s there is a quick lag when we see the main character. This is subtle and not really easy to notice at first but once seen \u2026\n\nI have not this issue on SDR, when I desactivate HDR on the Netflix app everything is smooth.\n\nI have not this issue either on my old 65OLED854 in the Netflix TV app or when using my Shield on this older TV model.\n\nI tried to plug my Shield (2017) on my new 809 (I tried the 4 HDMI) to see if the same issue occurs in Netflix and again I got the same lag/slowdown.\n\nI switched the Shield to 4k 23,97fps from 4k 59,94fps and no more issues !\n\nSo it seems to be an issue with the TV not able to keep the motion well if the refresh rate is not the same than the video played when HDR/DolbyVision is enabled. And since there is no way to change the refresh rate in GoogleTV, I can't see how to solve the issue.",
