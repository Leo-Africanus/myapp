        "title": "Just finished Adolescence",
        "content": "Wow, I just sobbed at the very last scene of the Dad sobbing in Jamie\u2019s room and tucking the teddy bear in. Facing what\u2019s probably been his biggest fear since the day he found out what Jamie did - that he, as his father, should\u2019ve done more. \n\nThere were so many emotions to hold while watching this show and I especially felt it during this episode. I wanted to be angry with his family, because that\u2019s the easiest thing to do when a 13 year old boy does something like this. Assume his family/home life is terrible. But there was this mixture of love, shame, anger, and grief they were experiencing. I\u2019ve seen other comments on here say that the dad was emotionally abusive. This may be my own blind spot coming out as the daughter of a man with anger issues, but I can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s what the series was trying to depict or not. What I saw was a man with temper issues but that those issues were extremely exacerbated by trying to keep it together and being in denial about his son\u2019s actions. Not that people are merely \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d but seeing his family be \u201cgood\u201d people made it a more emotional watch for me. And it makes me wonder how it is Jamie became the way he did. \n\nI felt gutted by the last scene and I thought it did an excellent job of demonstrating the grief they are going through. They are grieving the son they once knew and who they thought he was. They were trying to make sense of how this happened even though they had the best of intentions and were, by all means, a pretty \u201cnormal\u201d family. But as I felt gutted for his family, I had to remind myself what her family must be going through. And how what happened was tragic and Jamie\u2019s actions wreaked havoc upon everyone around him - no one in his family did what Jamie did but they are paying for his actions. But at the end of the day his main victim, above all, is the girl whose life he felt entitled to take, and nothing can ever change that. It\u2019s something his family will have to accept and her family will have to grieve forever. ",

I want too watch some more really dark thriller series with suspense, creative kills, fast paced and not slow burn, weird puzzles that the police have too folow in order too catch the killer.  Untamed, Fringe, Blacklist, Luther, True Detective and Hannibal all had perfect pilot episodes in my opinion that got me invested knto watching the shows fully. If the pilot, second or third episode doesn't hook me i'm out. Not going too waste my time waching a slow burn series with mostly talking and literally nothing happening for the whole episode(s)",

You just pick your mood, genre, time, and what streaming platforms you have, and it gives you a handful of solid recommendations right away.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly been a game-changer for me. Instead of endless scrolling, I just set a vibe \u2192 get a few good options \u2192 actually start watching.\n\nIt\u2019s free to try right now, so figured I\u2019d share in case anyone else struggles with the same decision fatigue: its called **Altlficks**\n\n",

I'm sure it's unlikely but its fun to think about. \n\nIf you're not familiar he's a pro wrestler who after dozens of bad concussions and hard steroid abuse ended up killing his wife and child before committing suicide the same weekend.

        "content": "Okay so I watched these 2 recently and I just need to chat about them \ud83d\ude02  (this sub won't let me post about UnKN so)\n\n\n\nShe's Gotta Have It.\nSo I watched it all, but I found Nola (the main character) really unlikable. I don't have masses to discuss, but yeah, I read some reviews on IMDB afterwards and was pleased to see similar thoughts. \nShe seemed incredibly self absorbed and self righteous. And yeah, she was a lousy friend, lover and partner. I was 100% with Opal when they argued and split. I don't have children, I don't want them either, but there's no way in hell I'd take a child to get their ears pierced, against the parents wishes, and then not tell them. \nShe abused Mars' love for her and took advantage of him. She claimed she didn't want to be like anyone else but \"the struggling artist living in NYC\" is like most of the population there I assume, equally so overdone and cliche \ud83d\ude02\nI also think she was very privileged in comparison to what millions of other women go through. And she was taking advantage of her God mothers generosity. She was very fortunate, and still kept acting like a victim.\nThe actress herself is stunning though. What a beautiful women - her eyes are gorgeous.\nI don't know, I have very mixed feelings on the whole show. I wouldn't recommend it personally. ",
