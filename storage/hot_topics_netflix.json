No it is not a psychological, open-ended thriller that is meant to leave you guessing and interpret your own meaning. We didn\u2019t need that many angles, that many countdowns and that many different perspectives. To each their own but the entire time I was DYING to know who sent the missile and what the appropriate response would be. We were given none of this. It\u2019s like eating your veggies expecting a steak will come later and then it never comes. I don\u2019t know about you but a movie like this is essentially pointless if we don\u2019t at least get some sort of simulation as to what would happen next. Not to mention, they never even actually confirmed or denied that the missile made impact! What?!? This movie was all suspense, all buildup and no drop. Disagree all you want, after all it\u2019s just an opinion but this left me dissatisfied and disappointed. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",

I think the Bomb went off and I think the audience not been informed of who launched the bomb also worked quite nicely. \n\nI think it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s okay if you do like it. So let\u2019s stop shitting on other people\u2019s opinions and quit trying to change their mind(s). \n\nI think the way how we watch media has changed. The rise of technology and acquiring information so quickly, has sort of shifted how we view movies. We want conclusions, we want information, we want the plot to be easy to follow, we want to know what exactly what happens. So it makes sense If there are a lot of people who are not really a fan of cliffhangers, which is OK. It\u2019s just a different way of absorbing media.\n\n",

The doc shows Susan\u2019s actions were calculated, not reactive self-defense. \n\nI get the parental angle, I\u2019d be extra vigilant too and would keep my kids away from someone like Susan with her cursing, petty aggressions and escalating beef. You never know what people are capable of so you should trust your instincts, but blaming the parents overlooks Susan\u2019s premeditation.\n\nSusan told AJ\u2019s kid to fetch his mom (knowing it\u2019d bring AJ over), called 911 then shot AJ unarmed in under two minutes. Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground might cover perceived threats on your property, but why not wait for cops? Lock the door? Retreat inside? Aim non-lethally? The body cams, timelines and forensics scream intent, not fear.\n\nShe escalated from verbal abuse to physical by throwing skates and swinging umbrellas at AJ\u2019s kid to provoke AJ. That\u2019s baiting, not being \u201cfed up.\u201d Any parent would confront that. The trespassing and door-banging excuses ignore how Susan orchestrated it betting on the law to shield her.\n\nParents could\u2019ve chosen differently in hindsight, but Susan had clear alternatives to killing. Someone that determined would\u2019ve found a way regardless. \n\nAccountability\u2019s on her.",
