        "content": "Hey everyone! Audio in movies not being great is at this point a well documented thing I believe. Yet it almost seems to be getting worse. I just watched *Extraction* on Netflix because someone recommended it to me. I mostly enjoyed the movie but the audio was so bad. Like there was an emotional scene between two characters but I couldn't understand a single word that one of them was saying. But then the explosions and gun shots are way louder. Sure, to a degree this can be used as a stylistic choice to make the violence more intimdating and such. However it can not be in the interest of the filmmakers that I, as a viewer, end up moving the volume up and down constantly depending if there are people talking or if there is fighting going on. Constantly.\n\nWhen are TV &amp; movie producers going to adress this problem? People have made videos about this on YouTube for years yet nothing is being done about it; what's up with that?",

        "content": "So here is what I am using. LG C1 Oled smart TV. Got Netflix downloaded on it. And for audio, I have a pair of Sony Wireless Headphones connected through bluetooth to my tv\n\nMy issue is, everytime I watch Netflix with this exact set up, the audio always cuts out while whatever im watching keeps playing. Ive looked it up before and something about Dolby audio settings in Netflix, but that's not a thing, the only options are subtitles and audio language. Thats all. I need to know why this is happening and if there is a fix please \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude2d",
