But this was a major miscalculation by both sides. Completely pulling the full content from YouTube, Apple etc to instead place it all on Netflix and only clips on the previous platforms was a bad move. I\u2019m never gonna go to Netflix to watch a podcast. I\u2019d rather just not watch the podcast. The numbers will reflect the sentiment because I know I\u2019m not alone. ",

I am talking about the audience) and I find it extremely hard to sympathise with him and the gang.\n\nFirst of all, he is not doing a heroic act by printing the money because he is not distributing it among common people. And to justify that by saying that other huge corporations and governments have also done it doesn\u2019t make it right. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Right?\n\nAlso printing money like this doesn\u2019t have zero consequences. It leads to overall reduction in value of the currency affecting the general public so it is not a good act.\n\nNow, in the last season he was ready to plummet the entire stock market as if it would not affect the common man? Millions would lose their jobs and so many would commit suicide. How is this heroic in any way?\n\nAlso, these heists lead to so many deaths, injuries and emotional pain to so many people.\n\nI am fine seeing them as smart people but to portray them as heroes who are here to save the world is nonsense.

        "content": "Although I've seen new ads for Mexico, and they look interesting, I get the feeling that everything related to Latin America is always heavily focused on drug trafficking, light comedy, telenovelas, and reality TV. But I think we have the resources to explore many more themes. Instead of teen comedies, we should focus more on romance stories with intergenerational female drama, for example, because we have great potential. We need stories of healing that blend people's resilience, as happened with Acapulco, but without forgetting the contrast with the luxury villas and resorts on our beaches, as well as the Mayan and Aztec culture of the interior, because we have so much richness. We need to contrast that with the rebirth of Mexico City and other major cities that offer a blend of history and modernity, all the gastronomy, art\u2014all that potential that sometimes seems to be overlooked as a character in the stories. Now that it seems more will be invested in Latin America, we want stories that travel and showcase our full potential abroad, but that also bring something new to our catalog here.\n\n\n\nDo you agree, or do you think there's already enough new material?",

        "content": "I enjoyed H&amp;H and would conditionally recommend it to others. However there are a few plot holes that I can\u2019t wrap my head around. Maybe someone here has read the book which may have more details, or just has a plausible theory on these questions.\n\n1.\t\u2060Rachel and Helen were attempting to blackmail Lexi/Catherine, but for what? They couldn\u2019t have known about L\u2019s sister. What then?\n\n2.\t\u2060When Richard took Anna to the lake house to clear the air / bury the hatchet with Lexy, what was their true intention? Did Richard confess to Lexy that he banged Anna? When Jack beat him up at the bar and Anna told him she\u2019d tell Lexy they slept together if he pressed charges, he seemed to genuinely not want Lexy to know and agreed not to press charges if Anna kept quiet. Were they planning on murdering Anna? Was that why the bleach and other stuff was on the pool table? He had purchased that stuff days before so there must have been some kind of plan to harm her, but if so what was their motive?\n\n3. Here\u2019s the biggest hole for me. How did the mother know that cancelling their hotel reservation would make both Anna and Richard go to the lake house and how did she know lexi would be there? How did she know it would lead to an altercation in which the cops would come, search the house and find the planted evidence? That seems like a big reach. Seems like a lot of ifs, conditions and leaps of faith to make that all happen the way it did. Seems like anna would have been more likely to go to Jack or her mom\u2019s house, after all her and Jack had just recently somewhat reconciled (aka banged in his truck). Maybe if that didn\u2019t work out, if Anna didn\u2019t go to the lake house, she would have tried again another day another way?\n\nTLDR\n\n1. What did Rachel and Helen have on Lexi?\n\n2. Was Lexi and Richard planning to harm Anna and why?\n\n3. How did the mother know the stars would align and the cops would find the planted evidence?\n\nThanks for reading this far and thanks for any insight offered.",

        "content": "Every time I pause a show on Netflix, the audio cuts out upon resuming the show. Initially, a brief rewind would correct the issue, but that no longer works. Now I have to exit Netflix completely-- and even that doesn't always work. I've taken to exiting the app every time I want to pause, which is a pita. Anybody know of a workaround for this?",

I just finished this, not very good product.\n\nI looked around and there are 2 problems I have that I haven\u2019t seen addressed, though I have given up digging pretty quickly. Spoilers ahead.\n\n1. the commission techs work on an anti-virus patch and then push it out through automatic updates. How? If everything is down including power and comms, how are they pushing out these auto updates? The App Store servers would be down. The cell towers to push the updates would be down. How exactly did they get these updates pushed?\n2. In the second episode, Angela Basset gives DeNiro like 48 hours to figure this out. She is seconds from going on air to tell the world she\u2019s giving the go on a counter to Russia. By the last episode, she\u2019s saying how she suspected there were high level players in the government who were behind it but couldn\u2019t give DeNiro a heads up in there first meeting. So this awful woman was just going to knowing lead the world to ruin for no reason? Or the writers couldn\u2019t keep continuity for 5 episodes?\n\nThat is all. I thought it was fine, not amazing, through the first 4.5-5 episodes. But that last episode was next level stupid.",

Why in the world did they even put that into the story line? Shandi faced significant backlash and bullying online. \n\nAlso hearing that they filmed while a girl was showering with another guy was said to be prohibited? Sounds like a bunch of creeps to me.",
