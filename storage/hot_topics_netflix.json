It is so easy to fall into that pipeline without any intentions of actually looking up people like Andrew Tate. As someone is constantly in the gym and looking up workout and diet recommendations on YouTube, I will almost always run into those kinds of videos and I just ignore them. \n\nSo many friends or fellow gym bros have shifted their attitude into this alpha male, high quality man, Andrew Tate style aggressiveness from YouTube and social media feeding them these influencers when originally all they were doing was looking up workout videos. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly concerning how easy it is and I feel for anyone trying to get into fitness and having to deal with this. Just understand there are normal fitness influencers out there that are not this way. ",

        "content": "I've seen a lot of men on different subs arguing about how the new show Adolescence with Owen Cooper is anti-male. However, I think this is very false. \n\nJamie (played by Owen Cooper) does not become evil overnight; he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online communities. There are many times in the show where I sympathized with Jamie, given that he is just a 13-year-old boy. I think that societal expectations regarding men showing their emotions led Jamie to struggle with emotional repression, which caused him to lash out when he was rejected. And before you say \"he was bullied\", I don't think he was. Jamie asked Katie out when he knew she would be vulnerable, and then she just called him out on it. As someone who was bullied as a kid, bullying is more repetitive. from the show, It just seemed like she had \"bullied\" him this one time. The show more urges people to create better support systems for young men so they learn how to manage their emotions rather than just saying men are bad. \n\nBasically, the moral of the story is to make sure that you are teaching your boys how to show their emotions in a healthy way, ask for help, and learn how to handle rejection. I think this show did an excellent job examining how online spaces can radicalize young boys and how its important to understand the challenges they face like internalizing emotions.",

        "content": "Recommendation from culture writer Meredith Blake at [The Contrarian](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/contrarian-culture-club-recommendations-2da), a Substack news site with a weekly \"Culture Club\" column:\n\n&gt;I realize that a show about murder and incompetence at the White House might not sound like the most appealing thing right now, but would still urge anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit and loves going behind the scenes of hallowed institutions to fire up\u00a0*The Residence.*  \nFrom executive producer Shonda Rhimes and creator Paul William Davies, this witty, upstairs-downstairs murder mystery is set at the White House during a tense state dinner with Australia. In the midst of the lavish event\u2014featuring a performance by a sparkly Kylie Minogue\u2014chief usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito, of\u00a0*Breaking Bad*\u00a0and\u00a0*Better Call Saul*\u00a0fame) is found dead in the third-floor game room.\n\n&gt;Enter Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba,\u00a0*Orange Is the New Black),*\u00a0a consulting detective for the Metropolitan Police and eccentric bird enthusiast (is there any other kind?) tasked with investigating the murder. Turns out there are plenty of people in the household staff with violent grudges against Wynter, from free-spirited butler Sheila (Edwina Findley) to aggrieved pastry chef Didier (Bronson Pinchot). Al Franken also has a supporting role as a senator leading the hearing inquiry into the murder. (A real stretch for him, to be sure.)  \nI like to imagine the elevator pitch for this was something like \u201c*Clue*\u00a0meets\u00a0*The West Wing,*\u00a0with a side of\u00a0*Downton Abbey.\u201d*\u00a0The eight-episode series is very loosely inspired by\u00a0*The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House,*\u00a0by\u00a0Kate Anderson Brower (who also happens to be a\u00a0[*Contrarian*\u00a0](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/flipping-the-script-how-americas)[contributor](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/flipping-the-script-how-americas)).  \nAnd while it clearly deviates from the source material and is consciously over-the-top in a very Rhimesian way,\u00a0*The Residence*\u00a0does manage to paint a fascinating portrait of life inside the White House, complete with elaborate sets and detailed production. It also humorously explores the tensions that can emerge between the residence staff, many of whom have worked at the White House for decades, though the administrations change every few years (may it remain that way).\n\n[Photo by Jessica Brooks of Netflix](https://preview.redd.it/hrrc0unaobre1.jpg?width=3600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eadf08a4716363cbdf7117c1d44106c014480da8)",

You know why? Because everybody is entitled to an opinion!\n\nTikTok, X, Facebook, Reddit, everywhere I leave my opinion saying \"I thought it was alright, pretty good, I probably wouldn't watch again though\" I get people saying...\n\n\"You obviously didn't get it \ud83d\ude44 \"\n\"You must have a low IQ, this is only for deep thinkers to watch\"\n\"Sorry that TikTok has rotted you're brain and you can't go more than 5 mins without getting bored\"\n\"You're part of the problem with society\"\n\"We found the Andrew Tate supporter who hates women!!!\" (I'm gay lol)\n\nMy point is that it's OK to not be a big fan of a fictional TV show lol Everybody has an opinion. But it just seems like fans of this show are actively going out of their way to be rude and aggressive towards those who weren't big fans of the show.\n\nI can understand the obvious hate towards those who are wearing tin foil hats or who are actual Andrew Tate supporters, but what is the deal with getting angry with a random person who just didn't like it? Lol\n\nI know it explores sensitive topics but people really need to chill out over this show. One of the key messages was how we behave online and some of the fans are completely contradicting that message imho. They're being SO hateful towards people who have a different opinion. \n\nRant over, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. ",

        "content": "Watching Knives Out or Glass Onion, it\u2019s easy to take for granted how incredibly easy Rian Johnson makes it look. The reveals are satisfying because not only is it possible for things to have happened that way, he\u2019s pieced everything together so skillfully that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for things to have happened any *other* way.\n \nWith The Residence, on the other hand, I was trying to lean in and give it the benefit of the doubt, but by the end it had entirely lost me with two wildly implausible elements:\n \n&gt;!A.B. used his journal to meticulously document noteworthy events and record thoughtful, generous impressions of the people around him. This was 99%+ of the content of his journal. And in a tussle, someone tears out a half-sheet from it and not only does that sheet happen to be so tonally different from the rest as to read as a flawless suicide note, the rip goes out of its way to include just one word from the next paragraph and that word is \u201cgoodbye\u201d!?! Infinite monkeys with infinite typewriters would produce Shakespeare\u2019s complete works, but infinite journal-writers and infinite journal-rippers would never produce this scenario.!&lt;\n \n&gt;!After A.B. hangs up from the call with Lilly making nice and asking him to meet up, he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be dead by the end of the night.\u201d The show scrambles over itself to point out that that\u2019s not a thing that humans actually say, but pointing out bad writing doesn\u2019t make it any less bad. A.B. has admittedly had a pretty contentious day dealing with various personnel and interpersonal issues, but that\u2019s his *entire job*. The show didn\u2019t sell me for one second on the idea that this night of doing mostly things he\u2019s been doing for his whole career was so extraordinary that he had a premonition of his own murder following an apparently innocuous call, he (this polished, poised ultimate public servant) casually said as much to a foreign diplomat, and the Australian guy was like okay that\u2019s the end of this conversation I guess rather than asking, \u201cExcuse me, what in the actual hell are you talking about?\u201d!&lt;\n \nI actually think the show could\u2019ve worked if they leaned into the parody angle and played it as a send-up of murder mystery tropes like &gt;!everyone incredibly developing a motive to kill the guy on this particular night!&lt; and wild coincidences leading to unbelievable turns of events like &gt;!the yellow oval room having a revolving door of people in and out all evening, and the murderer timing it exactly right to the point that she\u2019s basically walking out of the room as someone else is walking in!&lt;. But to thread the needle on the attempted humor/sincerity blend, you need such skilled writing, and in my opinion it just wasn\u2019t there.",

        "content": "So I have an HDR 1440p monitor since a few months, and on Youtube it looks absolutely stunning when reaching those 1200 nits. It's just gorgeous.\n\nI just put my Netflix subscription to Premium to test out HDR, and when playing back an HDR show (it shows the HDR logo) then I can see it stream 1080p HDR content when looking at the CTRL Alt Shift D stats. However, as example Love, Death and Robots is literally darker with HDR than with SDR, and the highlights clip wayyy to early, like maybe at 150 nits. Why, what is Netflix doing to their HDR stuff?",

        "content": "I\u2019ve never been so captivated by a show as I have with Adolescence and this definitely has to do with how smooth it was shot in one take. Constantly keeping your attention.\n\nThis show really hit home because I grew up with a lot of terrible influences, bullies and also seeked validation from others or idolized someone. \n\nNot wanting to disappoint. The conditions of my life led me to believe I had to prove myself and be liked by others.\n\nI definitely cried on episode 4 because this finale really put everything in a neat bow tie. Everything was leading up to a breaking point and then it broke, but not into a disaster. Something more surreal and heartbreaking. This show is very very real. Amazing acting from everyone. And it portrayed the world we live in today perfectly. \n\nWe all try to hold our pain inside and a lot of us deal with the aftermath of others mistakes. People judge and mistreat you without knowing everything. But we will survive it!\n\nI hope it wins some awards. And the people who committed their time towards it understand that they did create a masterpiece.",

        "content": "Why does netflix constantly give me error 5.8 on mobile recently? This has never happened until around last week and now every time I open the app I get the 5.8 error until I restart my phone. The app is up to date. My phone is too. I have full bars and am perfectly connected to the wifi, everything else works. I should not have to restart my damn phone every time I want to watch a show late at night ot early morning. How do I get this error message to go away permenently?",

        "content": "Hey, I'm currently watching The Walking Dead on Netflix and at times experience incredibly bad quality (like it goes from 4k to 480p or something). It just happens for a scene or two and goes back to normal. I have the highest 4k tier and my internet connection is 1Gb/s down.\n\nIs anybody else experiencing this? I wonder if the show is encoded that way on Netflix or what, but never had had on other shows (or at least didn't notice) and it's been happening the last few days that I watch the show both on an iPad and on my iMac.\n\nI just had that happen a moment ago and refreshed the page and still see it in that scene. Here's a still for reference:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s16olt5v78re1.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73716cd5f9e63bac3b23f7282f5fb9eac837f36\n\nIs Netflix doing some shady stuff to save costs? This scene was quite dynamic with lots of moving content, but I mean we pay a lot of money for that shit.  \n\n\n  \n",

        "title": "Adolescence, stop making this show a gender war topic",
        "content": "I keep seeing people referencing comments everywhere about certain groupsusing this show to attack women and blame Katie. Most people haven't seen those comments cause unlike you they aren't searching for them. I've seen people say r/men is doing this but you're seeing that because you're looking for it. \n\nThe actual majority of men and women see how truly complex this story is. Anyone that thinks that this is a show to show an issue with 'men' or 'women' just clearly didn't pay attention with an open mind but rather with there own biased ideas already at the front of their mind. I personally think the biggest take from this show for me was the fact that parents have no clue what there kids are doing by themselves. I'm not that old, I'm only 25 so I was a teenager with unsupervised access to the Internet and I know for a fact that I saw ALOT of stuff that no one should ever see at any age. Twitter was a cesspool (still is) and had videos of people being killed, the gauntlet challenge was easily accessed. And as time has gone on I don't think that this issue has even started to resolve itself, parents still don't care to take the time to monitor children, most of them have a smartphone at the age of 10! \n\nSo can we please stop all of these stupid arguements about whether one gender is worse than the other?",

        "content": "I don't know if this is the right place to ask but this was the best place I could think of to ask something like this, so apologies in advance if not. For background info, I loved 'It's What's Inside' from last year (it was actually probably my favourite movie from 2024 tbh) and I knew it was most likely not gonna be on DVD but I wanted to do a quick search just in case and I found a bunch on eBay from different sellers, most of which are from China. I also know the movie was at Sundance before being acquired by Netflix so I was just wondering if it was at all possible that these were legit or if they are most likely bootlegs. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to these sorts of things so any expertise will help.",
