There\u2019s so much potential and depth in them (ex. Glitch, Dead to me, The end of the fucking world, playing Gracie darling, ratched, you get the point) that would put them as high as like vampire diaries and supernatural. Netflix doesn\u2019t really have a Long series, like AMC and Hulu. Unless they mark Stranger things as one if it continues that long. It\u2019s just so sad, these writers have potential and deserve their whole story to produced. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why Netflix is taking such AMAZING ideas and just cutting it short. Multiple short stories doesn\u2019t equal out to the long insanely amazing shows, and if it\u2019s for money? That would be stupid right? Cos they would make so much more money, continuing these fascinating series. \n\nI feel Netflix has gone down hill after Stranger things, and 13 reasons why, those were their star shows. I would include Arcane, but that has just recently become a thing. They could have so many good long ass shows. But they just don\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t make sense to as why :(",

He was also very educated when it came to law stuff, so every time they wanted to have a protection order against him and things like that, he ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS found a way to flip it on them, to the point where a couple of them would lose their own apartment to him!! Eventually he met his match and a girl had him sent to jail a couple times, his fucking brother bailed him out each time and I never knew why! Next thing you know, he kills his brother !! I think he had some sort of grudge or anger towards his brother, I\u2019m not sure what it is I just know that his older brother became more successful then him. But he gets locked up for his murder, then fucking kills hangs him self before he really even got sentenced in 2017. He put these people through wayyyy too much to to sit there and cop out on life, he was evil as fuck . I usually don\u2019t care too much when people kill themselves while waiting for their sentencing the way he did, but he was the lastttttt person to sit and have the opportunity to cop out on life the way he did.

It would also sidestep regional copyrights on the subtitles themselves as it is the end user generating them, not Netflix distributing existing copyrighted subtitles.\n\nI suspect there may be some reason Netflix isn't doing this, even if only because it's simply too niche; Netflix clearly trusts first-party subtitles enough to spend resources providing them in the first place.  However a third-party solution would be a nice fallback solution like an iPhone repair shop for those too far from the Genius Bar.",

I spent about 30 minutes on the phone to get this fixed but I have to infer a lot of folks are going to be upcharged a little or a lot \n\nThis all seems like \u201cdesperate\u201d behavior by Netflix. Is anyone protesting or suing at this point?",
