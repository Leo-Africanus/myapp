        "content": "As mentioned in the title, I just finished watching it, and I\u2019d say it was worth the wait.kind of. If you haven\u2019t seen the series yet I suggest skipping this  to avoid spoilers\n\nThat said, I\u2019m a bit disappointed. This season focused heavily on homosexual relationships. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s bad, but most of us want to see the main character\u2019s love story, not a side character creating drama in everyone else\u2019s love lives. The story was supposed to center around Kitty discovering more about her mom, which was why she went to KISS in the first place\n\nOn top of that, making Kitty bisexual felt like a misstep. It shifted the focus away from the original premise, leading to unnecessary fights and breakups that dominated the screen time. If you\u2019ve seen the show, you\u2019ll notice that more than half of the relationships are homosexual. It felt like the series lost sight of Kitty\u2019s journey and the charm of the original story\n\nWhat I did enjoy, however, was Kitty finding new love. I genuinely thought she\u2019d end up with the same person(Dae) from season 1, so that twist was refreshing. And seeing Margot and Peter from To All the Boys was so relieving(?) honestly, that was the main reason I watched this season\n\nOverall, I feel like the story doesn\u2019t completely wrap up, leaving me hoping for another season to tie up loose ends\n\n",

        "content": "This is an informative post and update for those that watch Netflix on their Windows PCs. I'm writing this update since I've saw there were few other people experiencing this.\nPrecisely two weeks ago I discovered, out of the blue, that I wasn't able to watch Netflix in 4K/Dolby Vision anymore but only in 1080p SDR at max. After a lot of tampering and reinstalling drivers, apps and extensions (DV would always work outside of netflix) I've finally found the culprit: the current versions of Microsoft Edge.\nStrangely enough, DV/4K streaming are broken and don't seem to work in my system when using the normal version of Edge or the Netflix app (which is not a standalone app anymore but a wrapped version of the Netflix page in the browser).\n\n*Using Edge Dev (which is a stable development version) everything works as intended.* \n\nSo for the time being, I'd suggest to download that version and watch Netflix there. The Netflix app can only use the normal one but it's a workaround in the meantime that it will be updated. \n\nI hope this post of mine can help someone, ofc I dunno if my case can be applied to anyone but it's something at least, especially considering that Netflix/Microsoft customer supports were not useful to say the least.

Also what is happening in that school?? could they have not shown a few classes atleast happening like just for a second or two, the school in this series is more useless than the school in the Riverdale series and we all know that was just bad.

The main characters are solid. Isaac Reed is a total mystery, and the tension between settlers, Native tribes, and religious groups feels so real. It also ties in actual historical events, which makes it feel even more grounded.\n\nNot gonna lie, it\u2019s dark and violent, so don\u2019t expect any warm, fuzzy cowboy vibes. It\u2019s like if Yellowstone and The Revenant had a gritty baby. Definitely worth the watch if you\u2019re into intense Westerns or just want a break from the usual predictable shows. \n\n",

        "content": "I'm not sure if this will work for everyone but I was able to watch a downloaded series (Castlevania Nocturne season 2) on my brother's account.\n\nI have a profile created before the ban, if I try to watch on my home wifi it blocks me and asks to request a one time code since it thinks I am traveling.\n\nOn my phone however using mobile data, I'm able to login, browse shows and download for later.\n\nThen I turn on airplane mode and I'm able to watch the show.\n\nYes I know it's extra steps and might be troublesome if you're out of storage. But it beats having to keep asking my brother for the OTP everytime I want to watch a show.\n\nThis work for anyone else?",
