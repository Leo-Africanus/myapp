You could scroll for 10 minutes and still feel excited about what to watch.\n\nNow?\n\nWe\u2019re paying more than double that (for the cheapest plan), getting slapped with ads, and somehow the selection has gotten worse instead of better.\n\nHow does that even make sense?\n\nEvery time I open Netflix now, it\u2019s the same recycled \u201cTop 10\u201d list, half-finished original series that get canceled after one season, or movies that look like they were made for a middle school media class. If you do find something decent, congrats \u2014 it\u2019ll probably be gone next month due to \u201clicensing issues.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n\t\u2022\tPrices keep going up\n\n\t\u2022\tPassword sharing gets cracked down on\n\n\t\u2022\tAds are creeping in like we didn\u2019t specifically pay to avoid cable\n\nAt this point Netflix feels less like a premium streaming service and more like cable TV with an app and worse content.\n\nI honestly miss when Netflix felt fun instead of frustrating. Now I spend more time scrolling than actually watching anything \u2014 and half the time I just close the app.\n\nIs it just me, or did Netflix completely lose what made it great in the first place?",

I\u2019d really appreciate something that balances romance with a thoughtful storyline\u2014maybe with a touch of humor, warmth, or even a bit of life realism mixed in. It doesn\u2019t have to be extremely intense, but it should leave a lasting impression and make me feel emotionally connected to the characters. A romance that explores themes like love, timing, personal growth, or second chances would be ideal. If possible, I\u2019d also love a movie that has good music, beautiful visuals, or a comforting vibe that makes it enjoyable to rewatch. Overall, I\u2019m hoping for a romantic movie on Netflix that feels genuine, memorable, and satisfying, and that can make me smile, reflect, or even tear up a little by the time the credits roll.",

Some of my opinions may be slightly biased here BUT I don\u2019t think she did it\u2026 or at least for the most part. I do believe that nursing wards can be quite a cliquey area like mentioned earlier in the documentary. You\u2019d be surprised but I do feel clinical and laboratory environments can be more toxic than you\u2019d imagine. The stress, the grief and maybe the overall mental work these staff perform brings out the worst in them. I believe the ward may have been understaffed, there may have been mistakes made by other nurses in the unit and ultimately Lucy was the scapegoat for them.\n\nOn top of this, I think the documentary also had A LOT of loopholes. Where was CCTV evidence in all of this? Were there not other staff and nurses present during these cases? If so where are their interviews or testimonies? I don\u2019t know, I felt there was a lot missing to really analyse this properly as a viewer as well. I do think Lucy is a bit sketch, some of her comments and her behaviour is odd but I also believe nurse units can be extremely toxic and there is a very good chance they used her as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone\u2019s thoughts?",
