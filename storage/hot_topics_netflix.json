I thought the acting was great (especially Toni's and all the Tall Pines Academy kid(?) actors), however the flow was a bit too draggy. I sat through the whole thing and binged without any skips, but I wished I did, or at least watched it in a faster speed. I saw a lot of people having so many questions after watching, and I get it. I feel the same way too, and how I truly wish it could've been a movie instead. not the best series, but it's dragging me to watch it enough even though with a very loose thread. interesting concept though!",

        "content": "Hi,\nNetflix streaming quality sucks. Yes, they have lower bitrate on their streams than competitiors, but i am talking about resolution. It's just inconsistent, what shows or episodes in a series are 1080p, and which are not.\n\nI have the standard plan and watching on the built-in Netflix App on LG TV (WebOS) and can also watch over the Fire TV Stick 4K 2nd Gen. Both can stream up to 4K, and are not limited like streaming on PC (except Edge?). On both devices i have the same result. For example, some episodes of \"Outlander\" are just streamed in 720p, others in 1080p. And on the movie side, \"Ready Player One\" would just play in 720p, no matter what i do. You can't tell me, that Netflix just got a low quality copy of that movie?! And yes, my network speed is more than capable.\n\nI understand, that some shows are not streamed in 1080p, if the movie/series itself is old and of bad quality. For example, Deep Space Nine wouldn't look much better in Full HD, because of the quality of the orginal scan.\n\nBut it seems, that Netflix just favor their own \"Original\" content, that is shown pretty much all the time in good quality. They just don't care, and obviously a lot of people don't care either (Well, if you just watch on your Smartphone or Tablet, you wouldn't mind it so much).\n\nIf you want streaming quality, Netflix is just cheap, because even Big Bang Theory has bad quality (720p and no high bitrate), it's only getting better in the later seasons. Disney Plus on the other hand has on the same series a whole other watching experience (there is much difference in the first seasons, it looks pretty much if it is a different scan).\n\nDo you know other examples like that?\n\nSo i think the problem is on the Netflix side, can't think of anything than writing to thier support, live with it or just cancel.\n\nPS: Feel free to discuss. If there is some technical explanation for this, i'm glad to hear about it.\n\nIf the topic doesn't fit here, just remove it another community.\n\nPSS: Typo in the topic, i'm a non-native speaker, but don't know how to edit it.",

        "content": "EDIT : I think posters are vastly missing the point that weekly episodic lasts JUST AS LONG as bi-monthly \"chunking\". The argument that \"chunking\" keeps more viewers couldn't be farther from the truth because 8 weeks is 8 weeks no matter what way you slice it up. Also, I do not advocate for weekly episodic. I am, however, stating the lesser of 2 evils. As you were ...\n\n\n\nJust found out that Stranger Things 5 will be airing 4 episodes in November, 3 in December, and 1 in January for \"viewer retention.\"\n\nWhy don't they just start on Thanksgiving with weekly episodes that go throw 3 core holidays? Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years?\n\nPeople talk about it on social media, share their opinions, sometimes it's on talk shows, Game Of Thrones did this best, I don't know why Netflix doesn't do this. WEDNESDAY was the same.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nObviously, just give me the entire season all at once. The premise is that they \\*DONT\\* do that anymore. And honestly, splitting up the seasons of these shows a few episodes MONTHS apart is so much worse than week-by-week episodes for a few months sraight.\n\nAlso, people tend not to give a @#$% anymore after binge watching half the season and then having to wait another month for the rest. Am I only in this way of thinking?",

V.D Tyagi is a senior and well established advocate at Pratparganj court. He clearly earns a lot and he is a grown up man still he is not at good terms with his father due to these resentments. Is it okay for him to do so? And at the end of 5th of episode in answer to his resentments his father said something like \"Maa baap bachon ko haath pakadkar chalna seekhate hain par jo maa baap kabhi haath chhodte hi nhi unke bache kabhi duadna nhi seekh paate\", while this justification stands true for networking it doesn't really explain the reason behind sarkari education. In the series we can clearly see that although B.D Tyagi is very cunning, street smart and sharp he struggles with English. He is fascinated by big English words - Egregious.....and want to impress others with sophisticated english essay. What are your thoughts on this? In the scene where he wears the kada given by his father while facing the dilemma of whether to accept the judgeship or not, does it indicate that he forgave his father?\n",
