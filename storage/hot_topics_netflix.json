        "content": "You\u2019ve probably seen this on your Netflix recommendations\u2014but if not, tune into  ***Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano 3***  live tonight at 8 PM EST, an all-women\u2019s boxing event with international undercards and major titles on the line.\n\nThe event features fighters from the UK, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, the U.S., and Spain, showcasing a global roster of talent. One big name on the card is  *Chantelle Cameron*, who split two fights with Taylor\u2014and never got a third, after Taylor declined the trilogy. That tension still lingers.\n\nIf you watched  ***Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson***  in November 2024, you probably agree that the co-main stole the show. Tonight, that rematch is back\u2014this time at *Madison Square Garden*. Hopefully Netflix\u2019s servers hold up better this time; last time, glitches meant a lot of fans missed key moments.\n\nAs for the main event: Serrano lost the first fight, barely dropped the second by  *unanimous 95\u201394*, and left the ring with a nasty cut. She\u2019ll be coming back for blood. Taylor, meanwhile, is looking to shut the door on the rivalry for good\u2014**this bout is billed as the final chapter of their trilogy**.\n\nFrom top to bottom, this card is loaded. This is surely going to be a night to remember. ",

Fast forward to I was on a 9 hour flight last night and downloaded \"too much\" on Netflix, within the first few mins it felt familiar. And then when I saw Lena Dunham in the second episode It hit me. The main character is Lena Dunham in \"Girls\" and this entire show is \"Girls\" repackaged and set in London. EVEN her love interest looks and acts like exactly Adam!! \n\nThe worst part is in an interview Lena Dunham said this show was meant to resonate with Gen Z. How???!!

        "content": "I decided to watch it because it\u2019s like one of the only shows left that isn\u2019t a limited series and I was like wow if Netflix approved it for 5 seasons it must be really good since they cancel really good shows(the OA) after 2. And it\u2019s probably some of the worst, most cringey shit I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of watching. \n\nThere\u2019s a scene when the characters are following a murderer who they have been trying to take down all season and finally get video evidence of him committing another murder and they are hidden, taping it and as he\u2019s leaving, one of the characters randomly stands up and yells \u201cYOUR A MURDERER!! WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH YOU?!?!\u201d. But \u201cluckily\u201d is drown out by the rain. The writing is just so bad. Like who the hell is watching this trash?\n\nI just don\u2019t understand how Netflix has gotten so bad. I remember when their originals were just hit after hit(narcos, orange is the new black, ozark, the crown, stranger things,mind hunter, the OA) . Now it\u2019s all limited series, reality shows, or poorly written shows/movies like outer banks, waterfront, old guard 2 etc. Getting ready to cancel.",

But I just can't help but wonder, what did y'all expect? You is perfect trash TV, it's corny and silly and ridiculous. It has been this way since season 2. The acting is exaggerated, the plot twists are wild, the themes are spelled out, nothing about it is subtle or refined... and that's okay!! It's fun! I love just sitting down and watching something that's manufactured to be purely entertaining. You is a show that pretends to be deep but in reality it's just fast food television, and I don't get why people are taking it so seriously and getting so upset about it, let alone expecting an amazing finale when the show has been kind of bad for the longest time. This ain't Game of Thrones guys. The finale was fitting for what the rest of the show was like, it was over the top and silly and I enjoyed it very much! :D",

Honestly, it\u2019s such a bold move to lure viewers in with such great storytelling only to pull the plug without warning. Truly inspiring.\n\nWho needs closure or a satisfying conclusion when you can just leave characters and audiences dangling in a void of unfinished arcs? The way you cancel shows based purely on streaming data instead of giving them time to grow? Absolutely visionary. \n\n\nNothing says \u201cwe value your time\u201d like pulling the rug mid-binge. Really, Netflix, thank you for reminding me not to get emotionally attached to anything on your platform ever again. Great job keeping disappointment fresh and consistent!\n\n",

You\u2019ve already seen Build-The-Band.\n\nThis show is less \u201cmusic revolution\u201d and more \u201cplaylist at a middle school dance in 2007.\u201d Every single contestant apparently got the same memo: Please sing breathy 2000s R&amp;B or pop that sounds like a rejected JoJo demo. And they deliver. Oh boy, do they deliver. The result is a sonic smoothie of the same three vocal runs and lyrics about heartbreak from people who clearly have only ever broken up with their DoorDash driver.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re untalented\u2014they can all sing, technically. But talent without taste is like bringing a salad to a pizza party. No one asked for this. We\u2019ve heard it before, and we didn\u2019t like it then either.\n\nWant to actually win over a real audience in 2025? Don\u2019t form a band that sounds like it opened for Ashanti in 2004. Try a little grit. Some distortion. A moody indie bassline. Give us angst. Give us guitars. Give us something other than another sultry cover of \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d by Mario.\n\nIn short: Build-The-Band is a fun watch if you enjoy yelling \u201cBE DIFFERENT!\u201d at your TV while eating popcorn. But if this group really wants to make it big, they need less Auto-Tune and more attitude. Grunge is calling, and she\u2019s tired of being ghosted. *sing creep or anything creed please*",

Also, do you have a favorite singer or band?\n\n1. First things first: Conor looks so much like Harry Styles to me - the hair, the face in general, the clothes, the tattoos - it was actually insane. Every time I saw him, I thought the same thing and I couldn't let it go. I was waiting for one of his bandmates to mention it when they were talking about each others' looks but they never did. \n2. I found Alison aggravating because she seemed very shallow and entitled, and she was definitely not someone I will be rooting for. Her attitude was annoying, and I understand that this is a reality show, so some of the people need to have distinct personalities, but it was grating to listen to and I disliked everything she said. \n3. Landon's eyes are legitimately the bluest I have ever seen in my life - are they even real? He was wearing a blue shirt in the beginning, so that might have been part of it, but jesus, those caught me off guard. \n4. The dialogue between Mason and Conor when they first started talking (and when they were talking about Vegemite) was really funny to me because Conor just said, \"You're an Aussie, eh?\" and then they started laughing with each other - it was something that I expected but I enjoyed it.

With Netflix shuffling the list, it is really painful to  pick the show you want\n\n3. Glad you put the 'Coming Soon' shows back. Those reminders are a goldmine.\n\n4. Can you add a category for \"Leaving Soon\"?\n\n5. I am seeing a lot of canceled and incomplete shows being promoted. These shows should be tagged as such, it's so we don't have to waste time with shows that go nowhere. I have lost 20 hrs of my life to this, but its more about investing your emotions into a show and then you are left hanging. I do Google but sometimes those results are false. We should not have to constantly research this. Just pull shows that are cancelled or have no ending. I think it makes more sense to have every season be self-contained if you are regularly cancelling shows. I think from observing, a lot of people are really frustrated by this, so it makes sense for you to have content providers fashion their content like this but perhaps give them a handful of episodes to come to a close. Some of the shows i wasted time on could have been wrapped up with 2-3 more episodes.",
