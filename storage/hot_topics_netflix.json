It was a hit show, it had a following, it wasn\u2019t hidden in the depths of the platform. It could\u2019ve grown even more if Netflix actually supported it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one show. This is about the pattern. They cancel everything good, especially original, weird, dark, or risky stuff, and replace it with endless reality shows or bland reboots.\n\nWhy do they think viewers will keep trusting them with our time and emotional investment if they pull this every time?\n\nIt\u2019s like they only care about new signups, not long-term fans. They greenlight 100 shows and abandon 98 of them. How is that sustainable?\n\nI genuinely wish I could flood their inbox with 40,000 complaints, because clearly they\u2019re not hearing how angry people are. There\u2019s no point in starting new shows anymore if we know there\u2019s no closure. Same with keeping a subscription. What a waste of a company they are. \n\nI hope I can get so many views on this post that Netflix sees this \ud83d\ude2d  \n\nAnyone else feel like this?",

        "content": "Just finished The Old Guard 2, and while I didn\u2019t quit halfway through (so it wasn\u2019t completely unwatchable), I was definitely disappointed by how lazy and inconsistent the lore is. For a story about immortals from completely different parts of the world who are actively hiding from the rest of the world, it\u2019s weirdly convenient that they all seem to find each other across centuries with no real explanation of how or why. Still with that alone I would have been ok after all they all have centuries to run into each other, right?\n\nWhat really broke it for me was the mentioned connection between the first and last immortal (further explained only by a birthmark they both have for some reason) as well as the whole \u201clegend\u201d about the last immortal which would be born with the power to remove or transfer immortality. A legend someone somehow formulated likely thousands of years before the last immortal was even close to existing. How can there be legends about someone completely unique among a group of already special people nobody should even know about in the first place? The writing just didn\u2019t try at all to make the world feel coherent or believable, which is a shame because IMHO the premise definitely had some potential. If only they made the story based on a somewhat plausible lore (written first) rather than creating a garbage lore based on what they needed it to be to accomodate a raise of stakes for the sequel or whatever.\n\nAnyway what are your opinions random redditors?",

I really wanted to like it, I tried to like it\u2014but somewhere between the recycled plot points and painfully predictable twists, I felt like the magic of the first season just vanished.\n\nThe original had unpredictability, emotional stakes, and that gritty commentary on capitalism and human desperation. But this one? It felt like they were trying to shock us, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The tension just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAlso, character development took a nosedive. Instead of complex personalities making morally grey choices, we got caricatures running through a checklist of betrayals and \u201csurprises\u201d that weren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\nEven the games lacked originality this time. One of them was so absurdly over-the-top that it felt more like a bad parody of Squid Game than the real thing.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Was I expecting too much? Or has the show just become another victim of its own success?",
