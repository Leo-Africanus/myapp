        "content": "So I'm in a long distance relationship and I'm usually talking to my SO through the phone, with headphones on, in front of my computer. Sometimes I want to watch something on Netflix while I have her in the background on my phone. But if I were to play Netflix through my computer speakers, she would be able to hear and it would disrupt the call/degrade the audio connection between us.\n\nI'm an engineer and I had the idea of making a Bluetooth device that would make it such that I can connect my headphones to both my phone and my computer at the same time. \n\nThat way, she isn't able to hear the movie in the background and I'm still able to watch my Netflix. Maybe there could even be a feature where the audio from Netflix lowers when she is speaking and returns to normal after she is done speaking (audio dimming)\n\nThis all can sort of be achieved through by buying two sets of ear buds, and wearing one earbud that is connected to the phone and the other connected to the computer, but you don't get the audio dimming feature.\n\nI'm trying to understand if this a decent idea and whether there would be interest. \n\nWhat do y'all think?",

        "content": "The tiger and the magpie were easily my favourite characters in the movie, and if you\u2019re also into art and mythology like I am, here\u2019s a little background on their historical references.\n\nIn traditional Korean art, the white tiger and magpie often appear together in a style called [Jakhodo](https://exhibitions.asianart.org/exhibitions/jakhodo-today/#:~:text=The%20tiger%20and%20magpie%20pairing%20appears%20so%20frequently%20in%20Korean%20art%20that%20it%20comprises%20its%20own%20genre%3A%20jakhodo%2C%20paintings%20depicting%20tigers%20and%20magpies) (*jak* = magpie, *ho* = tiger, *do* = painting). These images were used as talismans to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe tiger was intentionally given those ridiculous, bulging yellow eyes to make it look dumb. That\u2019s why it\u2019s traditionally nicknamed \u201cidiot tiger\u201d (\ubc14\ubcf4\ud638\ub791\uc774), and the paintings are often called *\u201cIdiot Tiger and Scolding Magpie.\u201d* So, in its introduction scene when the magpie looked annoyed and judgmental that was on purpose.\n\nThis art style is part of a genre called [Kkachi Horangi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhwa#:~:text=Kkachi%20horangi%20(%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4)%20is,structure%20of%20Joseon%27s%20feudal%20society), and it\u2019s basically satire. The goofy-looking tiger represents authority (intentionally depicted as silly and clumsy like corrupt officials or clueless aristocrats), and the magpie is the voice of the common people, calling them out.\n\nWhen Jinu mentioned he made the hat for the tiger but the bird kept stealing it, that was a reference to a real J[oseon-era Minhwa painting that shows a tiger smoking a pipe and wearing a top hat](https://korelimited.com/blogs/korelimited/the-korean-tiger-a-hallmark-of-korean-identity#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking%20features%20of%20art%20portraying%20the%20Korean%20tiger%20is%20the%20eyes%3B%20they%20are%20often%20bulging%20and%20painted%20a%20bright%20yellow.%20This%20is%20a%20recurring%20aspect%20of%20most%2C%20if%20not%20all%20art%20with%20the%20tiger%20as%20its%20subject), while a magpie stands nearby.\n\nThe White Tiger (Baekho in Korean) is also one of the Four Holy Beasts in Sino-Korean mythology, symbolising the West and the element of metal. It\u2019s a powerful, protective figure with deep cultural significance.\n\nI actually did a breakdown of the movie and shared some theories about the tiger in a separate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lmhs7a/kpop_demon_hunters_movie_analysis_theories/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) if anyone\u2019s interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8slwt5zaz2af1.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813ed2ffe493193302e9f83b02839916a0229094",

        "content": "As title says. Friend and I used to share Netflix account, I had my debit card connected to monthly fee. Recently we realized none of use it that much so couple of month ago I cancelled the membership. And obviously got logged out. Yesterday my friend was like for fun went to netlix website and was not logged out and he could see the whole feed, watch anything, etc. We were both like wtf how is this possible. \n\nNo, he has not reactivated the membership or put another card details. I'm not being charged neither does he. But the account works in his computer, where he has always been logged in.\n\nAnyone experienced anything like this? ",

        "content": "Hello I recently upgraded to a Samsung Odyssey G9 and ever since whenever I'm in fullscreen mode in Netflix I get a \"flicker\" where the screen moves left and right. This only happens in fullscreen mode and only in Netflix. \n\nThe only \"fix\" I've found from others is disabling \"hardware acceleration\" but this breaks HDR and 4k content.\n\nThe other \"fix\" is not viewing content in full screen mode which isn't really a fix.\n\n[Another Reddit User with same issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/comments/1kyiq9g/netflix_screen_glitch/)\n\nIs there any way to open a ticket with Netflix about this?",

        "content": "We all have that one show or movie we loved on Netflix, the one you tell people about constantly, but for some reason, nobody ever seems to give it a shot. Mine is \u201cThe OA\u201d ,weird, emotional, and absolutely brilliant. Every time I recommend it, people nod politely and go right back to rewatching The Office for the 6th time. So let\u2019s hear it: what\u2019s your underrated favorite? Could be a foreign film, a forgotten limited series, or a random docuseries that blew your mind. ",
