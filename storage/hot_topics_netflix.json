So instead of my \u00a311 (already most expensive sub) each month, I\u2019ll probably use it a few times a year now. ITV now has loads of comedies (which is what I use Netflix for the most) and is much cheaper. \n\n\nI hope others will also cancel and it will affect their profits. \n",

For a while it was actually set up with my household as primary (I use it more than she does) but then she swapped it over to her house. Over Christmas when I was at her house, I used the method where I watch a show on my phone on her wifi and netflix account and then watch a show on the same account from my house on the same device. It worked and re-enabled netflix on my TV at my place.\n\nShe came to visit me for my birthday earlier this month and I had her use the same method (watch on her phone at her house, then connect to my wifi and watch on her phone at my house) to keep it working. However as of midnight today I am once again unable to access it on my wifi.\n\nDoes anyone know why this might be? She followed the same steps as me but it doesn't seem to have worked? This is already super annoying :(",

Maybe by removing that command somehow? I'd rather not have to reset all of my browser settings if I can avoid it. Thank you :)",

I\u2019ve come across some information suggesting that this house could be located in the Cologne area in Germany, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s accurate. The design of the house, with its clean lines and spacious feel, is definitely very reminiscent of mid-century modern homes found in the United States. I\u2019m really curious if anyone knows the exact location of this home or has more details on where it was filmed. Is it a real house or just a set built for the show? If anyone has any insights or further information about the home, I\u2019d love to hear from you. Thanks in advance for your help!",

I know the \u201ehumor\u201c of the show is built entirely on this and the exaggeration of the character\u2018s flaws is used for comedic effect, but I feel like this show could\u2018ve been funny without this, too. I started watching the new season and not even half an episode in I was like, ok, I can\u2018t do this lmao. Valeria trying to seduce Bruno at the caf\u00e9 and not letting him have his coffee? Cringe. Also the writer\u2019s block trope is getting so old, I DONT CARE THAT SHE KEEPS HAVING WRITER\u2019S BLOCK. ITS SO BORING. \n\nThen, Nerea being unnecessarily rude to that person at the apartment viewing. THAT WOMAN LIVES THERE AND CAN HEAR YOU. Not to mention that a lot of people couldn\u2019t even afford to live there, and you\u2019re walking around crinkling your nose bc it\u2019s \u201edirty\u201c. And then, being unable to communicate that she doesn\u2018t want to live alone but with her gf? Girl, you\u2018re a grown ass woman. Also her gf not picking up on the facial acrobatics during that scene?? Aren\u2018t you supposed to be a couple??? \n\nThen, Lola forgetting her (considerably younger) bf needed the flat for his work when he had told her about it, and then having the nerve to be annoyed. DUMP HER. \nAnd Carmen\u2026 oh, Carmen. Control freak of the century. \n\nIdk if this show is popular or not but am I alone in feeling like this???? They\u2018re the same annoying people they were at the beginning of the show and there\u2018s been zero character growth. Idk, I\u2018m sure there are other ways to build tension bc this is just not it for me",
