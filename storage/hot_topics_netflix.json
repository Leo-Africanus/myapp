After watching the last episode and finding out that there won\u2019t be a third season, and that Wolf King Season 2 is the final season, I think they could have just made the ending differently, giving us viewers closure on the story. But instead, they leave us on a cliffhanger and imply that another season might come. But no, there won\u2019t be a third season, \u2019cause it\u2019s canceled according to news outlets. So, given this info, the people who made the second season shouldn\u2019t have done that at all. Now I\u2019m just disappointed.",

        "content": "The first season had all the charm anyone could want in a show like this. It was quirky with a darker tone and I greatly enjoyed all the slight nods to the original Addams Family. It seemed like such a strong show. Every episode was good until the season final which I felt was a little over the top and lame. I thought it would pick back up for season two but my gosh was I wrong. The episodes are uncreative and unnecessarily long and to my dissatisfaction all the characters were butchered to an extreme. It hurt so bad to witness Eugene and Pugsley spend all there time causing issues with Slurp. Also, don\u2019t expect Wednesday to show any signs of improvement she seemed to have sorta gained at the end of the first season. Not only is that work erased but it actually feels like it\u2019s declining steadily. It\u2019s like she\u2019s supposed to be a badass but her character seems to have a bad case of main character syndrome. Bringing Tyler back to continue being a whiny jerk was not pleasant either and it was made worse for leaving Zavier out. Don\u2019t even get me started on the writing. It\u2019s some of the cringiest stuff I\u2019ve heard in a while. This is a lot of negative stuff but I can say some good things about the show too. Season 2 was mildly entertaining. Oh, wait. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Feel free to disagree with my opinion but for me this season was a joke.",

I don\u2019t enjoy teenage romance in fantasy shows\u2014it usually feels forced, inconsistent, and honestly a bit cringe when they start kissing. I\u2019d rather see romance handled with more maturity and subtlety.\n\nActing quality is really important to me. I\u2019ve tried some Netflix shows where the performances felt too forced or awkward, and it completely pulled me out of the story. If the acting isn\u2019t excellent, at least I\u2019d prefer it to be decent and natural.\n\nI\u2019ve already watched *The Witcher* and *Wednesday*. I was planning to watch *Sabrina*, but I\u2019ve heard she has too many love interests, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d enjoy that. The acting seems decent, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it.\n\nFantasy is my first choice, but if there\u2019s nothing that fits these preferences, I\u2019m also open to non-fantasy shows.",

This is a bit \u201ctoo much into your face\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s all folks. What do you think? ",
