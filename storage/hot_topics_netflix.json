However, the commercial success of the series seems to have driven the decision to prolong it, resulting in a less organic continuation.\n\nThe voting scenes are excessively drawn out, feeling more like filler to extend the runtime than meaningful content. \n\nThe music in Season 2 has also taken a dramatic shift, attempting to inject a sense of comedy into the show. This feels completely out of place, especially when compared to the darker, more atmospheric music of Season 1, which enhanced the tension and served the narrative. Now, the music turns pivotal moments into something childish, undermining the tone that made the original season so compelling.\n\nAdding to the decline, the new actors and actresses often overact, making their performances feel unnatural and unconvincing. This exaggerated acting further detracts from the immersion and realism that Season 1 excelled in delivering. \nOverall, Season 2 feels like a significant step down in quality.\n\n",

        "title": "SPOILER: My thoughts on Squid Game Season 2",
        "content": "I'm not going to go super in-depth or make this spoiler-heavy but I thought I'd give my honest review on season 2 so... let's begin.\n\nFirst off, what would I rate this season? In comparison to the first season, I'm going to be generous and give it a 6/10. The pacing of the show felt slow at first. Starting off with scenes of Seong Gi-Hun then fast forwarding 2 years later. Pretty much emphasizing that Gi-Hun's on the hunt for the front man/the one in charge of the games to begin with. Puts up money and sends grunts to go on a wild goose chase to find the recruiter he came across in the subway back in season 1. After a long 2 years, they finally spot the recruiter then secretly follows him but things don't go as planned. Stuff happens, Gi-Hun then formulates a plan which failed and now we end up with end getting back into the game. Pretty much the \"I will find you, and I will kill you\" cliche except he doesn't plan on killing the head??... so... yeah. I'll leave it at that.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's fast forward. The failed plan that became an even bigger fail since there was a snake amongst him as he planned on going in and infiltrate the island with a group of people. This was realized during the first game that his backup no longer had a trace on him so his backup is... well... back on another goose chase. But instead of finding the recruiter, they're trying to find the island. And that's pretty much all we got out of them. Again, I'm not trying to spoil much.\n\nDuring the first game, Gi-Hun insists on helping everyone make it out in one piece. A lot more survived this time around compared to season one. Cool. After this, we now have a better look at the new players, a lot of which, are either just wimpy or plain annoying/obnoxious. Season 1 had its annoying characters too but they were done in a way where it felt just right and not over the top. A ton of \"high school bully\" type of characters. The new player(s) that were written well enough was the mom &amp; son duo. That's all I can say about the characters.\n\nNow, onto the primary reason people are watching season 2, the games. We're first introduced with red light green light since it's a staple of the show. The games that followed after that were different which was quite nice. But that's where it kind of stops being nice. The game now introduced a new thing where players could vote to either stay or leave after EACH game. If I'm going to be honest, I feel like this took away what made season 1 so good. The weight/burden of choice. In season one, players had only ONE opportunity to vote, it made scenarios a lot more impactful and gave the players an option of joining. With that, players bared the weight of \"the point of no return\". Once you were in, you're staying until the end. In this season, with players given the option to vote after every round, it eliminated that impact and made it more of a \"Don't join them, join me\" ordeal. Pair that with the high school bullying, you're left with kinda of an \"meh\" feeling. There isn't much fear since players can just stay for the money or they'll just pair with Gi-hun since he's played the game before. Follow the leader. \n\nOnce the games began, the pace suddenly sped up, leaving less room for you to have any sort of attachment to some characters. The games felt rushed/sped up making them not as fun and suspenseful to watch. With that, we're then back to scenes with Gi-Hun's muscle for hire are still looking for a way in and very little clue as to what's up with Triangle 11. The ending, being Gi-Hun's final plan which ALSO fails. Lots of gun fire, players are \"offed\", aaaaand we're left with a cliffhanger. \n\n  \nHonestly, I would have preferred they made an additional 2-3 episodes to flesh it out a bit more and conclude it all as a whole but nope... many questions a left unanswered and it seems we may have to wait for season 3. Wasn't a bad season, but it wasn't exactly great either. To those who are well-versed with celebrities in K-POP, you may enjoy it a bit more, maybe. Even then, it was okay. I'm not sure if I'll stick around for season 3 but yeah... what are your thoughts?",

Same is happening with other shows and not just on his profile but on my in laws profile and my profile and my husbands. We have checked all tvs and phones and same problem is happening. My mother in law wanted to watch a film the other day and it came up add to wish list. Has anyone else had this problem and if so how did you solve it? We have logged out, uninstall edited the app, restored phones and tvs and the problem is still occurring. Any help would be appreciated. ",
