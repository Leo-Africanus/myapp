He doesn\u2019t fight his way out of trouble, he just outsmarts everyone. One second he\u2019s a janitor, the next he\u2019s walking out like a millionaire, and nobody even realizes what happened.  \nWhat I love most is how he uses information. It\u2019s not about hacking or gadgets, it\u2019s about reading people, noticing the small things, knowing how systems work. He uses the kind of details most of us give away every day without thinking twice. That\u2019s what makes it feel so real.\n\nIt kind of made me think about how hard it is to stay invisible in real life now. Cameras everywhere, online tracking, data leaks all the time. He\u2019s changing disguises and I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to stop apps from following me around. Privacy feels like the real superpower now.  \nAnyway, I loved this season and I\u2019m curious if others did too. Did you like how they wrapped things up? Or did it feel a little too over the top?",

Never had any problems up until a couple days ago. I've been watching Formula 1 - Drive to Survive, wife and I binged all 7 seasons a few months ago, and recently started re-watching. I'm about half-way through season 3 and a couple days ago, every time the show cuts to race footage, or crowd footage, anything \"live\" I guess? It looks like absolute dog shit. It's like everything is being playing in fast forward or something. I've spent about 5 hours total this week troubleshooting. I've tried DDU and re-installing drivers 12 times, I've tried different browsers, different resolutions, if I manually set my refresh rate to 24Hz, the show plays fine, but clearly that's not a solution, it's a very VERY annoying workaround. For shits and giggles I just tried logging into Netflix on my company computer, the playback is exactly the same. So what the fuck did Netflix change this week, and how do I turn it off or make it go back the way it was before? ",

        "content": "A lot of people have discussed this documentary already, but I just got around to watching it. Aside from all the insane criminal activity, I think people ignore the behaviour of other people in the documentary because they do not know what it was like to live in a small town and the type of behaviours that arise.\n\n\nFirst of all, any speculation that Lauryn was involved clearly comes from this weird ingroup thing small towns do. You're telling me that in the opening of the documentary they talk about how everyone knows everyone but Lauryn isn't invited to this huge annual Halloween party?\n\n\nSpeaking more on the party, it was a party for children and adults which is strange, and Lauryn was in grade eight or maybe even grade seven when she wasn't invited. That's just disturbing.\n\n\nIn the documentary we hear testimony from Khloe and Khloe's friends and Owen and all their parents and it seems to me that they are a very weird type of clique that is never fully acknowledged. They say everyone knows everyone, imply Lauryn is a vapid sociopath with no emotion, and deny bullying some other girl.\n\n\n\nWhen we hear from Lauryn and Owen's cousin, we can see that they are more reserved and in the cousins case not as conventionally attractive. I feel like the culture of this town was brushed over. I grew up in a small town myself and everything was an exact dead ringer for what I experienced.\n\n\nA final anecdote: there is no way Lauryn has recovered from this situation. She was already \"weird\" to these people and this is just another thing they're going to pin on her and alienate her for. I truly hope she can move somewhere else and live a happier life.",

The counter-strike dilemma was that if the US didn't launch its own nuclear weapons, the missile silos would be destroyed by the incoming attack. In House of Dynamite, that is not an issue. There was only one incoming missile, which might malfunction. The president still had no idea who launched the attack. And even if Chicago got nuked, the president would still have the full arsenal of missiles to launch 15 minutes later, an hour later, or two days later.\n\nIt felt like it was an artificial and unnecessary deadline to create tension, but maybe I missed something that explained it. If this was Independence Day I would just brush it off but Dynamite is (generally) a smart film. Any insights?",

        "content": "9950x3d, 5080, 64gb of ram, hardware isn't the issue afaik, new build, no other issues other than this one. Fresh install of windows.  \nMultiple monitor set up, I have chrome running with netflix, periodically, could be in 5m or 50m, the video will freeze and audio keeps playing, after 10-20s all 3 monitors go black for a second and come back and i have to refresh the chrome tab with netflix to get it to play again. This ONLY happens with netflix, not hulu, peacock, etc.\n\nIs this just a netflix bug, I can't imagine i'm the only one here. No issues playing graphic demanding games, no issues with GPU that I'm aware of. I've installed multiple version of and latest graphic drivers. I'm ready to just unsubscribe to netflix.\n\nI do have hardware acceleration turned on in Chrome, don't really want to turn it off, everything performs better and more fluid with it on.\n\nAnyone else run into this and know how to fix it?",
