I\u2019ve contacted Netflix support twice today and a few other times in the past about this dumb household limitations. You can only request a vacation code in advance and only a few times a year. I travel for work often and Netflix ALWAYS force closes every minute in all  hotels. At first I thought it was Marriott hotels all having shitty TVs but finally caught onto the pattern that it is a NETFLIX issue. Prime and Max work perfectly fine in all my hotels. But I cannot use Netflix in my hotel rooms while my husband uses it at home. (I pay for more than 1 screen btw.) even if my husband is not at home and I log out of every single device and only log into my mobile phone and the hotel tv, Netflix still force closes every minute on the tv. There\u2019s no option to update household on the TV Netflix. It just doesn\u2019t exist. Does ANYONE have anything they\u2019ve done that has helped with this or advice? Do I just cancel Netflix atp?\n\nTL;DR Netflix \u201cset household\u201d isn\u2019t an option on my hotel tv, I cannot stream Netflix while I travel for work, and I travel often. Any tips/advice?",

Outside of the usual \"thank you\" and \"name drop shout outs\" he gives, he had a few jokes that went on for way too long (the gun shop bit with Jim), along with some recycled jokes from past specials, like the themed weeks and Krispy Kreme jokes, as well as the story about how he flashed the old couple.\n\nPlus not to mention the constant bragging about having fans, being famous, being rich. Like, we get it, dude. I swear, it seems like his material hasn't been interesting since he got the divorce and Frankie moved out, and I think plenty of people probably feel the same way also. And the crowd got annoying at times during the special too. Like almost ever word he said evoked an applause from the audience, and I think he got more cheers than laughs that night there were so many!",

        "content": "Wow. The initial episode and scenes before the games were kind of a drag and I immediately looked up online \"Season 2 Squid Games boring\". I saw a lot of people complaining so I almost didn't want to watch and lost interest. I kept watching through my boredom, and once it got to the games, I was so glad I didn't quit. This season was extremely edge of your seat, anxiety inducing, and emotional.\n\nI cried multiple times and became attached to some characters hoping that they would survive. Some scenes I quite literally had to skip through, because they gave me so much anxiety and heart racing anticipation I couldn't stand it... in a good way. I felt sick to my stomach at points and felt like I was almost there in the games. It was a great mix of fear, sadness, and desperation. The characters were developed with such personality.\n\nI was kind of disappointed at the cliff hanger and hoping for more soon. I can't say it was better than the first season because I felt like the first was interesting throughout and left such a lasting impact. But for a second season... I am pleased. I was a little confused about the story line but I think it's funny that the characters I ended up liking, became the main characters.\n\nThey did great with the development and action. They kept me guessing what was going to happen. I rate it an 8/10! It would be 10/10 for me, if the beginning was shortened a little and more to the point. It's amazing that a show and actors can cause you to genuinely feel for the characters and root for them and that's something I always look for in a show.\n\nWho was your favorite character(s)? Mine were #222, #120, #095, and the mother son duo. I liked #456's whole squad! ",
