I\u2019m wondering why it was never on my radar when it came out. It must have been overshadowed when it debuted? Hoping there\u2019s some possibility for a season 3, but that\u2019s unfortunately just wishful thinking after some quick google searches :(",

She meant William saw the man with the cap and not that he identified Lyle considering both lingaard siblings couldn't have remembered how Lyle Jennings looked like now\n2) Lyle acts extremely stupid when he's with his mom. Is this something to do with being abused? Because it is a little difficult to believe he pulled off all those crimes\n3) they never show the motive behind why Lyle targeted Sam. Was that because he ran in similar circles with Merritt or he just wanted to get back at Sam for punching him. Also, did Lyle pretend to be Sam H to know Merritts whereabouts or was he eventually going to know because he was stalking her.",

The screenplay is absolutely terrible, making the characters deliver the most cringe-worthy dialogue ever (I saw the show in Spanish, I'm a native Spanish speaker, and I'm well acquainted with the idiomatic expressions and cultural references used in the show). Scenes that are supposed to be emotionally charged are underwhelming at best. Scenes that are supposed to be shocking have no shock value whatsoever. I wasted 6 hours of my life expecting this show to get better and it never did. I cannot believe they are going to do a second season!\n\nI haven't read the comic this show is supposed to be based on, but I believe it can't be worse than the show itself. \n\nOk, rant over.

But they have clearly stated that if this happens the world economy will get destroyed...

        "content": "I have two PC's, a better and an older one. On the better the quality is normal, but it keeps jumping back a few seconds (2-3 seconds) while I'm not even touching anything. On the older one the quality is unwatchable most of the time, even with a 30 MB/s network, and the same jumping back problem is happening here too. Why is it so broken why can't I just watch my movie?",
