I\u2019ve read complaints about the poor acting, but I couldn't care less because I actually enjoy a bit of trashy love triangle drama. However, one thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between the sisters, Adriana and Elise. They literally went from loving each other to being die-hard enemies wishing the worst on each other within five minutes. It didn't just happen once, it felt like it happened every single episode. It was laughable and made zero sense. Another thing that bothered me was how unrealistic the money situation was. Being 30k in debt is laughable if ALL of your pro athletes are going to the World Finals. I don't know exactly what figure skaters make, but I do know what sponsorships pay for a whole roster of World Champs. It made the debt plot point feel really weird. Also, why was there no winning party at the end? That felt like a huge missed opportunity!",

I have however read in another comment that Susan was taking a strong painkiller called Belbuca. Now I don't in any way defend her, she was a narcissist and is somewhat evil, but I think the effects of medications are never taken into account in these cases. Susan was a lonely old lady with some trauma from life, and I think people underestimate the effects of medicine and how It can mess up with your head over a period of time. I started thinking about that because when I saw her later at conviction time, she looked skinny and she looked relatively normal. While in the police footage she looked like a deranged schizophrenic, distant eyes, let herself go, paranoia, obsession with kids in this case. As I said, I am happy she will spend the rest of her life in prison, but I just wonder what role could the medication have played, if any, in her slow degradation. \n\nThere was a documentary I saw once, guy was taking Zoloft or something, killed his whole family during dinner, doesn't remember a thing.
