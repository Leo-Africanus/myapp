I\u2019ve contacted Netflix support twice today and a few other times in the past about this dumb household limitations. You can only request a vacation code in advance and only a few times a year. I travel for work often and Netflix ALWAYS force closes every minute in all  hotels. At first I thought it was Marriott hotels all having shitty TVs but finally caught onto the pattern that it is a NETFLIX issue. Prime and Max work perfectly fine in all my hotels. But I cannot use Netflix in my hotel rooms while my husband uses it at home. (I pay for more than 1 screen btw.) even if my husband is not at home and I log out of every single device and only log into my mobile phone and the hotel tv, Netflix still force closes every minute on the tv. There\u2019s no option to update household on the TV Netflix. It just doesn\u2019t exist. Does ANYONE have anything they\u2019ve done that has helped with this or advice? Do I just cancel Netflix atp?\n\nTL;DR Netflix \u201cset household\u201d isn\u2019t an option on my hotel tv, I cannot stream Netflix while I travel for work, and I travel often. Any tips/advice?",

Its actually like a real show w/ real characters, and not even really about what i thought (or what anyone would think probably) Its so good, so much so i dont know what to compare it to, as its unlike anything korean or japanese, but its also not entirely american either. I mean its spoken in korean, so that much makes it korean. But the cinematography and everything else is so good. The special effects are the classic korean/japanese horror, like the walking dead but better, is how i would classify their film/and camera effects. They specialize in that, but this show is like, the best of everything, all in one, and not really like anything else....\n\nSo my question is, who created this show? Or what is going on with the writers, artists, directors/producers etc. (actors, choreographers, special effects teams, etc) that have culminated into, what has become, this riveting squid game, which is almost like, a mystery/thriller\u2014disguised as a game- Its like, Squid-Island, the Mystery that keeps Unrolling.",

Again, how did no one question why he was boarding with these particular items, I mean i think this must be a valid reason to be questioned.\n\nIf we suppose he somehow found a way to sneak his backpack without the X-Ray scan, couldn\u2019t they do the same exact thing for the luggage with the bomb?\n\nLastly, how can the FAA not ground every plane departing from LAX when it was declared a threat at the airport?",

Like, we get it, dude. I swear, it seems like his material hasn't been interesting since he got the divorce and Frankie moved out, and I think plenty of people probably feel the same way also. And the crowd got annoying at times during the special too. Like almost ever word he said evoked an applause from the audience, and I think he got more cheers than laughs that night there were so many!",

And I am in absolute love with Netflix documentaries. But damn did they do a horrible job on this documentary. I mean everyone on this project has to be fired it was horrible.\nFor 25 years all they got was, JS in a 3sum, a murder that took place after the show and criticism of hate about the show for cancellation. That\u2019s it!? That\u2019s all this crew got? Disrespectful. Shameful. I disliked this documentary and Netflix was like whaaaaaat? You disliked this doc? lol cause it wasn\u2019t saving my dislike. Jerry springer episode was more interesting than this trash of a documentary.
