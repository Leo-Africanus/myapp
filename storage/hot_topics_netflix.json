But the point is, we were on our own profile, so why is Netflix recommending it on other profiles as well? What's the point of having separate profiles if they're going to leak into other ones?",

Netflix was vocal about making a TV channel that was cultivated for people to offset the enormity some find with the catalogue, and as it keeps on expanding, it might become worse for people who have this feeling.\n\n  \nWhich then means an AI Agent would be perfect for the streaming services because you could just tell it to find the best movies of an actress or whatever genre you were feeling, and then it could go and search through the huge catalogue for you :D",

        "content": "Recently built a new PC, added a 4K display to my existing 2K one and saw the only way to get 4k Netflix on PC was with the Microsoft Store windows app. Downloaded this, used the Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q trick to see the stats and was excited to see it streaming at beautiful 4K. Once I went full screen I then noticed consistent stuttering, but strangely if I come out of fullscreen and play it in window (even maximised) it doesn't stutter at all.\n\nEndless reddit/googling has lead me to try the following, none of which worked:\n\n\\- Disabled HAGS (made no difference)  \n\\- Disabled AMD Freesync (wasn't enabled in the first place, tried enabling, disabling, no difference)  \n\\- Referenced against other programs, YouTube 4K stream no issue, VLC 4K media playback no issue. Issue seems isolated to Netflix alone.\n\nFor reference specs are 9800X3D, 9070XT, 32GB DDR5, 2TB M.2. This is literally a fresh build with all latest drivers installed, thinking possibly:\n\n\\- As the GPU only launched a couple days ago maybe the drivers are so new this is a bug?  \n\\- I run a 4K 60Hz (on HDMI) and a 2K 165Hz (on DP) as my monitors (the 2k being my primary for gaming etc) I've read there's issue with windows and different Hz monitors, but I feel like I've gone down an endless rabbit hole of things it could be related too including HDCP? Any other ideas? I can watch maximised as a workaround for now, just really strange that the stutter only happens when it's fullscreened (as I understand it the windows app is built on edge so maybe related to that too?)",

I\u2019ve deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, neither have worked. I can\u2019t even watch it on the internet browser as it just goes to a page that forces you to go to the app or manage account info. After even more troubleshooting, I have deleted the app and restarted my phone, no fix. Restarted my phone and left it off for ~5 minutes, no fix.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know any fixes? Help would be much appreciated. \n\nEdit: after dealing with 3 agents, no amount of troubleshooting has resolved the issue. Clearing cookies from my browser, cookies from Netflix itself, nothing will work. I\u2019m going to open a ticket tomorrow and will keep this post up in case anyone has a similar issue",

        "content": "So I recently just got a new laptop that supports Dolby Vision and its driving me absolutely insane that Netflix just cranks the brightness all the way up every time I start watching. Any way to turn this off? It sucks when I'm just trying to watch a show at night in the dark and get blasted with full brightness. ",

        "content": "As we can see the information of the currently running stream on netflix's tv app by click on information option, i've seen a few 4K movies have their video codec mentioned as DV5 and few others are HEVC, AV1. The latter ones are quite popular but there is not much info about DV5 on internet.\n\nIs it a proprietary codec developed by netflix? Does anybody else use this? Is it a completely new one or a modified form of HEVC? And why nothing about it on the internet?\n\nAI apps say DV5 is dolby vision, No you dumbo, it was an SDR movie.",
