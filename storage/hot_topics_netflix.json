I started the show (burst of download for the buffer) and then let it stabilize for 2 minutes. \n\nHow can netflix get away with a 6-15 TIMES WORSE bitrate than apple tv? I knew their bitrate is shitty, but this is crazy bad. Apple tv shows look great, on Netflix I can see color banding and lack of detail from 3m away... Such a shitty service - and that's their highest tier too. It sucks so much that such cool looking content is completely destroyed by a shitty low bitrate streaming service. ",

        "content": "There are some curious things I've observed watching this show. I am very intrigued by it and the intersex dynamics between the contestants. \n\nThe men seem to lack [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!the aggression to claim their woman and I find it a bit comical but also frustrating at times. The guys lack confidence! They're overly cautious when they approach the women treating them like they're fragile. It's so gentlemanly to a fault. It's just not how things are supposed to be done. Their approach simply gives power to the women. It's so unusual for men to put their fate in the hands of a woman. It's so clumsy and awkward seeing men waiting with bated breath for a woman to pick them.!&lt;\n\nWhen the women experience rejection, it's just excruciating. It's painful to watch because they wear their emotions on their faces and that's just awful. [Single's Inferno Season 2]&gt;!One of the girls was so unfavoured by the men, she broke down in tears because she wasn't being picked. That was painful. I feel like the producers of the show had to step in to intervene as she eventually gets picked by a guy that's a twist entrant in the middle of the show. It's so against the grain of events it's clearly manufactured as the girl may have been contemplating leaving the show.!&lt;\n\nAnother problem that seems to be a societal norm is the [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!inability to move on. This criticism is levied against both men and women. When they are clearly not their targets favourite, they engage in this self destructive \"I refuse to move on\" thing that's so problematic. It's so twisted! That means that it's an obsession rather than a love interest. This is a critical flaw.!&lt;\n\nOverall the show is great. The women are beautiful and the men are good looking. It's nice seeing how things are done in a conservative society albeit frustrating at times. I do think that the episodes are too long and [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!I'm not a fan of the physical challenges that earn people first choice rights. I think they made a mistake here and should've gone with a random system instead.!&lt;",

Instead of, you know, just disconnecting the call.\n\nI realize these show writers have to now be sensitive to the delicate sensibilities of 5 year olds or whatever, but surely not having your mother take a call or two would be less traumatizing than seeing her brains get blown out on a video call.

Was acting as a friend but really wanted to turn her over to the government,bcshe was a \"known Assassin\". \n\nThey traveled from European country to country in hiding. And fighting....but caring about each other. And sharing life experiences. About their kids, and lovers and families. \n\nThere was a secret message written on the inside of a car that could only been seen by breathing hot \ud83d\udd25 breath onthe windows.\n\nShe was known to be killed in the end but most likely secretly got away.\n\nI loved this series and wanted to share with friends and family. Or see if there was a 2nde.\n\nI meant / mean no disrespect with this post. I am just looking for thr name of the series.\nI thought it was based around a \"Book of Jinns\" or the female being referred to as a \"Jinn\". Google was no help.\n\nThank you. \n",
