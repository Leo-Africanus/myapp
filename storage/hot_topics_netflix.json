No child should ever go through that and be exposed to such sexual content at such an young age. Specially all the SA allegations.\n\nWhat Tiffany is doing is wrong and how is she getting away with all this?? Why didn\u2019t these parents file a criminal complaint against her if she SA\u2019d your child? \n\nThese parents who filed the lawsuit settled as soon as they got the money. Throughout the series them and the kids keep on saying they are worried for Piper and they wanna save her but, they stopped the fight when a settlement came. Shouldn\u2019t they have continued the case till Tiffany was held accountable by the court? Like why would you wanna make money of this too? \n\nFor anyone\u2019s child who had being SA\u2019d, the better thing would be to see the person who did this face justice rather than take money and forget it. I\u2019m baffled by it. \n\nWhy can\u2019t the law enforcement look into this and investigate all these claims and get the people responsible for this accountable? ",

        "title": "Million Dollar Secret Winner",
        "content": "This is one of the best reality game shows in Netflix. I was hooked from the beginning.\n\nThere were plenty of times I wanted to scream at the contestants, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell them this\u2026\u201d to convince them you\u2019re not the millionaire, but they end up getting emotional, defensive and raising voices. I learnt that getting defensive like your \u201clife\u201d is on the line can be a truth / honestly signal instead of a signal for deceit. It happened every time in the game (eg Chris, Jaimi) \n\nFor example, Jaimi was twice a suspect. One for voting Lydia and telling the truth. (Sam and Sydnee lied so they wouldn\u2019t be targets) No one believed Jaimi. To me, if I was the millionaire (or not), I would lie about voting Lydia because it instantly puts a target on my back because that was the clue. Jaimi admitted to voting Lydia. So it was obvious she was telling the truth! If you were worried of being caught, you would lie.\n\nStill, no one believed Jaimi. When they found out from the clue that she wasn\u2019t the millionaire, Jaimi could have used that as proof to the group for the next time they suspect her.\n\nAgain, when she was the suspected millionaire, everyone thought it\u2019s her because she told Sam to having two sisters (clue) and everyone refused to believe that another person would conceal it or lie about it. They would always target truth tellers (eg Jaimi or Corey in this case) When Jaimi was in the chopping block, again, she just screamed and cried to defend herself which we already know does not change people\u2019s minds.She could have used the last time she was suspected as proof that she was telling the truth (eg Last time you didnt believe me, and you found out I was telling the truth. This is a game of deception, someone is lying. Anyone who has been honest has been an easy target and has been pinned as the millionaire)\n\n Next, I feel terribly bad for Corey in a way. I don\u2019t think he would ever be able to trust anyone after this show. Lol but in a way, he was naive and his intuition was off throughout the show. He always suspected easy targets instead of thinking deeper (if I was the millionaire, how would I act?) this was missing from him throughout so in a way he was easily manipulated by Cara.\n\nFinally, I feel conflicted about Cara winning because she wasn\u2019t that exciting to watch. But by the end of episode 6, I had a feeling she would win or at least play big in the finale. Why? Because she flew under the radar, everyone trusted her, and she actively kept information about herself hidden. She chose not to share. Her intuition was correct almost all of the time too (Sam was asking info about her sisters because she knew she had the clue, Corey and Sam would vote Sydnee out, Sydnee had immunity, Corey took her box etc) She played the game so very well because of her intuition but I so wanted the winners to either be Sydnee or Sam. They just actively played the game and revealed just enough, but because they were threats that put them in everyone\u2019s radars to be voted off either way! \n\nSam was correct most of time but her emotions got in the way in which she trusted Cara. She kept saying she didn\u2019t have it in her to think Cara would even ever be the millionaire because she wouldn\u2019t let herself go there - that Cara is capable of deceit. This was Sam\u2019s downfall and toxic trait lol Had she kept people at bay and not let her emotions cloud her I believe she would have won. Corey was the same but Corey was off throughout lol \n\nI wonder how they are and what they think about how they were all duped as Sydnee would put it.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Over the past 10-15 years, it seems that European productions, both in cinema and television, have been gaining increasing visibility on a global scale. Whereas it once appeared that everything had to go through Hollywood, now a German, Spanish, or Italian series can become an international success.\n\nI believe this is partly due to streaming platforms. Netflix, Prime, Disney+, and others have made the world more \u201cmultipolar,\u201d even in cinema. Productions are happening everywhere, not just in Los Angeles, and audiences have become much more open to stories told in other languages.\n\nI think of titles like Dark (Germany), La Casa de Papel (Spain), Lupin (France), Suburra (Italy), 1899, The Rain, etc. But also more recent works like Cassandra from Germany, or Adolescence (UK), which has just been released and is already topping the charts on Netflix. And even though it\u2019s a few years old, Zerocalcare\u2019s Strappare lungo i bordi has had a strong impact, even outside of Italy.\n\nSo, do you think this is just a passing trend, or is European cinema truly experiencing a golden age?",

        "content": "Hi, I am sure this is a pretty frequent discussion here, but why does Netflix keep doing this? I think it\u2019s already been proven many times that weekly release is better. Arcane was releasing 3 episodes per week and this kept the discussion fresh and constant, while also building up the hype even while releasing. Weekly releases also keep people subscribed for more time. For example an anime with 24 episodes could keep someone subscribing for almost half a year. We also saw this with Severance where people were discussing an episode for an entire week until the next one came. On the other hand Netflix releasing everything at once really kills the hype. With this people watch it all at once, talk about it for a week and then few people talk about it. Still remember how Netflix killed Jojo\u2019s season 6 by releasing it in bunches and even I didn\u2019t know it came out. The main reason why I am talking about it is because I noticed that Moonrise was released with all the episodes all at once and just had to get my frustration out. Does Netflix keep doing it because it\u2019s what they were known for before, or is there some other reason? Really hope they stop.",
