        "content": "I get that Stranger Things: The First Shadow (Broadway / West End) is meant to deepen the lore, but honestly it feels like it introduces major information that should not be locked behind a stage play that most fans will never see.\n\nThere are things in the show that already felt like loose threads, and now it turns out they are \u201cexplained\u201d in the play:\n\n1. Henry\u2019s cave memory in Season 5, where he\u2019s clearly interacting with / absorbing Mind Flayer-like particles. In the show, this is presented as something mysterious and significant\u2026 but never really followed up on in a satisfying way. Apparently the play adds context, but the series itself doesn\u2019t.\n\n2. The Oklahoma poster in Max\u2019s hand during one of Henry\u2019s memories strongly suggests Joyce, Hopper, and Henry all went to school together. That\u2019s a huge implication; yet across four seasons, Joyce and Hop never say a single word about knowing Henry Creel? Not even a hint?\n\n3. Henry\u2019s early connection to the Upside Down, Brenner\u2019s involvement, and the timeline of how everything starts are apparently much clearer in the play but on screen, it still feels incomplete or oddly rushed.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t expanded lore. It\u2019s that the main TV series feels like it\u2019s missing chapters unless you\u2019ve seen a West End/ Broadway show that:\n\nA. isn\u2019t accessible worldwide,\n\nB. isn\u2019t cheap,\n\nC. and won\u2019t be seen by the vast majority of viewers.\n\nAt this point, it feels like they should\u2019ve done a limited prequel season or special between Season 4 and 5 to properly set this up. Relying on a stage production to carry essential canon just makes Season 4 feel retroactively unfinished.\n\nWith only one episode left, I\u2019m worried the finale will have too much ground to cover, and that casual viewers will never even realize why certain things don\u2019t quite add up.\n\nEnd rant. Curious if this bugs anyone else or if I\u2019m just overthinking it. ",

It's not just one dude with crazy powers\u2014it\u2019s this force that controls the entire Upside Down.\n\nIf Vecna had been taken out earlier, leaving the Mind Flayer as the final big bad, it could\u2019ve made for an epic conclusion, especially with the whole \"creature from another dimension\" vibe. Plus, we\u2019ve seen so much of Vecna already and defeated him once, so a new, final enemy could've really upped the tension.\n\nThe final season could've had a nice twist if they just focused on the Mind Flayer and made it a true battle for survival. I think it would've given the show even more of a chaotic, \"can they even win?\" energy. What do you think peeps?\n\n\n",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed something that\u2019s been bugging me lately: Netflix will still show a movie with localized artwork/title for my region, but then the expected audio tracks aren\u2019t available anymore.\nAfter thinking this for the last months, I've seen it again today when trying to watch \"The Grinch Stole Christmas\" (Jim Carrey, 2000; Der Grinch in German). I\u2019m in the German-speaking region and I\u2019ve watched it in German on Netflix before. Now the German audio track is gone for us and I only get German subtitles.\n\nI understand licensing/rights are probably the reason (regional contracts, changing agreements, blablabla). But for a huge international company like Netflix, it feels like a quality issue when a title is clearly marketed locally and the obvious local language track just isn\u2019t there, with no clear explanation.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t feel like a one-off. I\u2019ve had this impression more and more: Movies and series that used to have certain language tracks suddenly don\u2019t.\nSometimes even the original language options feel inconsistent depending on the region, which feels especially weird to me. I fear it might get even worse, where I can't even watch English originals in English anymore (like it is on Sky/HBO and Amazon at times).\n\nHas anyone else seen this? Did you find other affected titles? What\u2019s the best way to actually get Netflix to address this beyond contacting support?",

        "content": "I recently watched Stranger things from first season because of all the hoopla around it, and I honestly can not believe why this show has gotten this much traction. There is WAY better acting and way more nuanced plot points that keeps viewers guessing in other tv shows including Game of Thrones (think Better Call Saul, Good Girls etc.) . I can understand season 1 plot was intriguing yes, but the story is rinse and repeat ever since (not to mention the extremely \u201cmid\u201d acting of most of the actors, understandably because they are underage). However none of these other shows (except GoT) got as much popularity as Stranger Things. \n\nIs it due to more kids watching Netflix? Is it due to 80s nostalgia? I am still puzzled by the disproportionate popularity this show has achieved ",
