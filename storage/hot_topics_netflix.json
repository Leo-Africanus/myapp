This last one, a detective inspector blags her way into prison to question the cold blooded assassin that murdered her father. She proceeds to cry and beg him to tell her why sir, why'd you kill my daddy??, which unsurprisingly doesn't work. Then the nurse drugs him, tells her she only has a few minutes to get the truth out of him.  He reveals he was paid to take the fall for the murder, and she decides to argue with him. But you confessed! They found the weapon on you! I am guessing a DI doesn't know what paid to take the fall means?  Only after a few minutes does she finally ask \"who paid you?\" Of course too late, he has passed out. Then she crys more.  Christ on a cracker, are the books this stupid too? How does this guy have a career.  ",

Believable characters, great actors! \n\nFrom Netflix:\n\nBased on a true story, the crime drama series The Breakthrough follows the second-largest criminal investigation in Swedish history. In the early 2000s, the small city of Link\u00f6ping was rocked by a double homicide in broad daylight. Two people \u2014 a child and a woman in her late 50s \u2014 were stabbed to death. But with no motive or suspect, the case eventually grew cold. Nearly two decades later, the police made headway after a genealogist entered the fray.  Starring Peter Eggers and Mattias Nordkvist, the series was directed by Lisa Siwe (The Bridge) and written by Oskar S\u00f6derlund (Snabba Cash). \u201cThough this is a fictional drama series about a crime, it is, above all, a depiction of a human tragedy \u2014 where we place our focus on the victims and the investigation rather than the perpetrator,\u201d Siwe told Netflix. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about the compassion and care for one another that is needed to move on when terrible things happen.\u201d",

As soon as there's motion, the picture quality gets a bit blurry, similar to the issues so many had with the Tyson vs Paul fight. \n\nI've tried to do my homework. I have the premium subscription. HDR is turned on. My internet is high speed and I have no issues with anything else. I'm watching a hockey game in 4K right now and it's running just fine. On Netflix, I have no issues with anything but WWE that's supposed to be HD. It's not the fact it's live either, as I tried watching Monday's Raw episode the next day and Survivor Series from November and experienced the same problem. I turn on a movie in 4K with HDR and it looks incredible. I turn on something WWE HD and it looks like shit.\n\nWhy is this an issue for me only with WWE programming on Netflix?",
