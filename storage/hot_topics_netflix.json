        "content": "I have been saying for YEARS that Netflix has the best layout of any streaming service and have been annoyed that other streaming services have an inferior layout. Now, Netflix seems to be copying other services rather than the other way around. Why? Does anyone here actually like seeing fewer options on the screen? When you go to your list, rather than seeing multiple rows of all the things you like to watch, not you have to scroll endlessly to make it through what used to be a single screen's worth of content info. I hate this.\n\nSeriously though, does anyone know why? Are there metrics that make this make sense?",

        "content": "As described in the title, I opened Netflix on Roku yesterday to an announcement of the new UI and how wonderful it would be, etc., etc.\n\nDamn, is it ever bad. Of course, the \"worst\" label is 100% subjective and just one person's opinion. But, for me, it is objectively less usable than before. Its cramped design actually gives me a slight sense of clostrophobia to the point where I actively dislike being in the app. I find it very unwelcoming. \n\nWhen I open Netflix, most of the time I'm not going to in to watch anything in particular. I like browsing and hunting for something that, based on the title and/or image, I think might interest me. I've heard a lot of people complain about the quality on Netflix but there are still quite a few gems that I would often stumble on. The Residence and The Gentlemen are perfect examples of this - shows that I liked that I came across while scrolling through the app and hadn't previously heard of. \n\nThe new interface makes this process much more difficult. It's much easier to visually scan a screen with a lot of items and scroll when necessary. When you see something you might like you can choose to explore further and then look at the details.   \n\nNow, you are hit in the face with details of a single show taking up a large part of the screen that, odds are, you don't care anything about with a handful of other shows around the edges. \n\nGiven my typical use of Netflix, it will now take me much longer to find something than it did before. And given how being in the app makes me feel like I'm in a box, I can see my usage dropping significantly. Cancelation is likely right around the corner. \n\nFirst world problem, I know, but I only have so much money to go around. It doesn't make sense to spend it on something that will likely now sit idle most of the time. \n\nOk, rant over. On with my day. \n\nEDIT: I really am curious to hear from people who do like the new UI and what specifically they find better about it. While it's always fun to vent, I would like to hear others' perspectives just in case I'm missing something. ",

I feel like Netflix should consider renewing these shows again as they were originally renewed but the decision was reverted due to the pandemic.  Would love to know the community\u2019s thoughts about this and if Netflix should revive these shows that were originally renewed for at least 1 more season.  One major flaw about this i can think of is casting back the same casts for these shows because they might have projects currently so filming would be difficult to plan and also different looking casts (with them looking older than what their characters are suppose to be, though Stranger Things managed to make that work).

Every second in Season 4 matters. The \u201ctoo many characters\u201d complaint is ridiculous too \u2014 it\u2019s the freaking apocalypse, not a cozy drama, and most new characters are actually amazing (Eddie? Robin?). People say it repeats the same formula, but so do most great shows \u2014 One Punch Man blows up a city every episode and no one cries about that. Don\u2019t like it? Don\u2019t watch. Complaints about tone (\u201ctoo funny for horror\u201d) ignore what makes the show unique: a perfect blend of creepy, emotional, and nostalgic. And the \u201880s vibes? It\u2019s not nostalgia bait \u2014 that\u2019s literally when the show takes place. It all fits. At the end of the day, this show is smart, emotional, and clearly made with love. If you\u2019re too busy trying to sound like a film critic with 4 Godfather posters in your room, maybe Stranger Things just isn\u2019t for you. The rest of us are still blasting \u201cRunning Up That Hill\u201d and crying over Max.\n",

        "content": "A lot of people loved *'Heartstopper'* and are understandably broken up about the show not getting renewed. **But** there is one shimmer of hope: *'Smiley'* is a netflix show from a few years ago that did not make a big splash **(sadly**) that has a lot of the same appeal however. If there is one thing that people liked to criticise about *'Heartstopper'* it is that it's a bit \"too clean and whimsical\" (not my opinion just something that I saw online a few times). Now *'Smiley'* is definetely more raunchy and adult oriented.\n\n  \n\\[Yes, I know there is movie supposedly coming out next year to wrap up things with Charlie &amp; Nick - but that is likely more than a full year away\\]. Anyhoo, I hope this post can get people to give *'Smiley'* a well deserved watch and bring some happiness to the world. Bye!",

        "content": "There are lots of movies on netflix that I like. However, the thumbnails sometimes change to something boring that I don't like. As in, just a character's face. Lots of times, the films thumbnail won't have much to look at other than a random persons face which sucks out any incentive to watch it. Is there a way to turn this off?",

The suggestions feel more on point as well. I wish there were a way to immediately scroll up to the top of the page, though using the back button.\n\nMy biggest issue is that the \"Coming This Week\", \"Coming Next Week\" and \"Wait For It\" bars are all gone now. There is no longer any easy way to keep track of what is coming in the future and set reminders.\n\nI hope Netflix rectifies this in the future. But on a positive note, let me say again I like the new UI design.",
