I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

        "content": "The new\u00a0*Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight*\u00a0mini-series on Netflix is a real treat. It\u2019s a five-part animated adaptation of the classic comic, directed by Alain Chabat, what he's done with this series is genius!\n\nThis version stays true to the heart of the original while adding a fresh, modern touch. The humor is sharp, the animation is beautifully done, and the voice cast fits perfectly. The story follows Asterix and Obelix as they stand against the Roman forces, while their druid Getafix finds himself in trouble, struggling with memory loss that causes him to forget the magic potion recipe. Naturally, chaos follows.\n\nWatching this took me straight back to afternoons spent in the Hornsby library, pouring over Asterix comics, getting lost in their sharp wit and playful satire. Those stories always had a way of making the world seem a little brighter, balancing clever historical nods with lighthearted humor. No matter how many times I read them, they were a source of comfort and a guaranteed laugh.\n\nThis adaptation captures that timeless comic feel, and the jokes remain packed with satirical charm and modern pop culture references. Whether you\u2019re revisiting a childhood favorite or discovering Asterix for the first time, this is well worth a watch\u2014Alain and Netflix have done a fantastic job bringing these characters to life!\n\nNaturally, I think they've done a bangup job but these are just my thoughts but I'd love to hear what you think of the mini-series and if you think they should they bring out more. What do\u00a0**you**\u00a0think?\n\n[Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight - Season 1 Promo poster](https://preview.redd.it/9fzt5g5x7bye1.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddae755e30e15e3da7f6110fc554f0e287e26ee)\n\n  \n",

She\u2019s deadpan the entire time, shows little depth, and it\u2019s hard to connect with her emotionally. She mostly just snaps at others and loves birds. She\u2019s essentially the main character of the show and is just boring, bland, and rude the entire time. The trailer made her seem almost goofy, which would have been great. If she was goofy and ditsy but also a brilliant genius detective. But that is not at all how she is portrayed in the show. \n\nThe storyline drags from episode to episode without much happening. I got a few laughs\u2014Harry Hollins was funny early on\u2014but overall it just feels bland, and I\u2019m losing interest fast. Watching the show feels like a chore at this point. \n\nThat said, the White House set is incredible. Huge credit to the production team on that. Just mind blowing on the amount of work that must have taken.\n\nIf you\u2019re into this type of show, The Afterparty on Apple TV is a way better execution of the concept. It\u2019s funnier, better written, and the storytelling is on another level. Highly recommend. Two seasons and both impossible not to binge through. ",

        "content": "Look, I know there are plenty of more important things to worry about, but this just annoyed the fk out of me and I need to say something somewhere. \n\nAs I was trying to find something new to watch before I went to bed, I see there\u2019s a show that\u2019s supposedly top 10 or whatever on Netflix, and the name of the show is an extremely small town next to the one I grew up in. (Like close enough that some kids went to my school who lived there). Ransom Canyon is the name of the show and the town, both located in Texas.\n\nSo, I\u2019m exited and interested to see what it\u2019s all about. Seconds into episode 1 it\u2019s clear that this is not only NOT the very real town of Ransom Canyon, Texas, it\u2019s immediately obvious that it isn\u2019t even filmed in Texas at all. \n\nGoogle confirms it was filmed in New Mexico and based in a \u201cfictional town\u201d. \n\nSure, it\u2019s not a huge deal, but my question is why? \n\nIf you\u2019re making a TV show about a \u201cfictional\u201d town in Texas (or any state/country), use a fictional name. \n\nI was so excited that a show had been made about a place I grew up knowing so well and visiting often, just to be severely disappointed less than 1 minute into the pilot when it becomes obvious this is not about the real town that it\u2019s named after. \n\nJust name it something else? And if you lack the creativity to come up with the name of the town for your show on your own, why would I want to watch it? The lack of imagination is palpable from the title alone. \n\nBit of a rant, sorry, and maybe im being too negative, it just really disappointed me and rubbed me the wrong way. ",

Any ideas? Thanks\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for sharing your experiences with this issue and suggesting fixes. I think I figured it out eventually when I found out that signing in via smart tv seems to be what activates the household thingy. Our smart tv is connected to a different WiFi network, so that would explain why Netflix now is not accepting my devices as part of the household. I'll switch them to the same WiFi network as the tv and that should fix it I believe",
