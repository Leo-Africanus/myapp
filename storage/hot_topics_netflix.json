The film\u2019s strength lies in its authenticity; every laugh, heartbreak, and quiet moment feels genuine, drawing you into their world. It serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting and impactful those youthful adventures can be.\n\nI really miss road movies like this, where a group of friends embarks on a journey to discover something meaningful.\n\nWhat did you think about this movie? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and feelings after watching it!\n\nAlso, if you have any recommendations for similar movies, please share them below!",

This documentary is so extremely devastating, a bunch of piss poor excuses working as government servants. The only one with integrity and honor being General Honor\u00e9. Its always better to be safe then sorry, mandatory evacuation of ppl in below sea level neighborhoods should've been 1st and not even second guessed.

I know this show has a lot of complaints about the actors not suiting the ages they\u2019re supposed to be, but at the same time he\u2019s the one that sticks out the most for me, especially next to Danny who is supposed to be his twin.\n\nThe show seems like they\u2019re trying to have Damon and Stefan the remake, but it\u2019s not working because those two were ancient vampires.

Aswell as coming up to rodger at the funeral asking if he was \u201chearing music\u201d etc\u2026 if it was never rebooted then why did it even come up at all? This really bothered me and kind of ruined the show, I haven\u2019t seen anyone else discussing this either.",

Or the rise and falls of certain social media personalities/ YouTubers as well.\n\nI honestly enjoy the, \u201cTrainwreck\u201d series quite a bit. Entertaining (if often shocking) documentaries with a bit of twisted/ dark humor thrown in there as well.",

        "title": "My Life With the Walter Boys - season 2 issues. Jackie and Cole",
        "content": "I love My Life With the Walter Boys so much!! The whole cast seems so lovely and like a genuine family. But I have a few issues with season 2\u2026\n\nFor me, the actress who plays Jackie can not act at all. Her character did not land. A lot of the scenes of hers felt stiff, flat, disengaged and unnatural. Take the final scene for example when the ambulance comes, her reaction just didn\u2019t feel natural. It felt laboured and half hearted and I noticed it enough that it effected my overall feeling \n\nBy comparison the actor who plays Cole I thought was fantastic this season. I loved the delivery of that portrayal of the actor, really shined, especially this season. He did such a beautiful, seamless transition that  made him more likeable, vulnerable and understandable. It\u2019s such a lovely light hearted family show that reflects the beauty and complexities of family subtly, and his character adds depth and rawness, which is really refreshing. He\u2019s doing a great job\n\nThe love triangle though\u2026.is driving me crazyyyy. I honestly feel like it\u2019s so obvious that Cole and Jackie are meant to be together. Their chemistry feels so natural, and they bring out the best in each other, it\u2019s real relationship energy and intimacy where they feel like an in love couple with an unsaid understanding \n\nI really don\u2019t enjoy Jackie and Alex as a couple. At all. It\u2019s frustrating that season 2 ended on basically the same cliffhanger as season 1\u2026 but at least there\u2019s clear growth with Cole this time around. His character feels more grounded and less arrogant, which I loved seeing\n\nI  want Jackie to finally settle down instead of bouncing between the brothers. Alex might be the \u201cgood boy\u201d type, but it\u2019s obvious Jackie\u2019s heart is with Cole. That\u2019s the relationship I want to see play out in season 3\n\nIt\u2019s a great show and I adore the family essence of it but I have issue with season 2 not being much growth in the story and the actress who plays Jackie not being really present in her delivery. For me it was Cole\u2019s character who really shined this season but I\u2019m hoping everything steps up for everyone in season 3\n\nWhat does everyone else think?? ",
