        "content": "I watched the documentary in full and there\u2019s so much to say, but I\u2019ve honestly found other posts on it as well. \n\nOne thing I can\u2019t seem to find is about their \u201cfriend\u201d with the black hair.\n\nSomething about her feels off to me? I understand maybe nerves, and obviously she had known them prior to this happening.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know, the energy she gives me is that she actually had feelings for Brian but was embarrassed about it, so she pushed it away, and wasn\u2019t actually friends with Gabby, or was jealous of her. There\u2019s times where she seems normal talking about them, like the engagement, but then other times not so much.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me that she\u2019s in this documentary about him killing Gabby, and she\u2019s yapping about Brian saying the friend thing or being the love of his life, and the bluebird text. She smiles a lot when talking about him, and then when she talks about him playing guitar for Gabby and \u201chow could I be so blind?\u201d Gives me the feeling he didn\u2019t tell her about Gabby until they found out and she thought he was her lover boy-regardless if they were dating or not.\n\nShe isn\u2019t actually crying at the end.\n\nIdk. I always think I\u2019m reading too much into something and then something comes out and I\u2019m like \u201cI KNEW IT\u201d, lol.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure what this means, I guess I wonder if she knows more than she\u2019s letting on? Gabby had reached out to her ex, and if I know anything about abusive bf\u2019s, they\u2019ll come back around to old \u201cloves\u201d to get an ego boost. Makes me wonder if he ever reached out to her when he and Gabby were fighting, or after Gabby\u2019s death. She seems like she had that relationship with him. \n\nDid anyone else get this vibe from her or am I nuts?",

        "content": "All the content I watch on netflix on PC (I use chrome) is mastered in 24 fps, should I turn my monitor down from 180hz to 120hz when I go to watch stuff? \n\nI feel like I can feel a difference in frame pacing, but I honestly have no idea. Sometimes at 175hz, though, I feel like something is wrong with what I'm watching. Like it's different to my TV downstairs somehow. \n\nDoes changing my monitors refresh rate do anything? \n\nThanks",
