        "content": "I saw this come up again in a post, and there isn't a lot of good info out there on how to fix 4k streaming... so here's what worked for me.\n\nThe issue is that all streaming sites limit quality to prevent people from *'the unmentionable act of yo hoing and yarring with a parrot on your shoulder that gets your post auto moded'*. They do this through a few different types of DRM. Most notably AV1, HEVC, and Playready.\n\nCurrently the only browser capable of being DRM compliant is Microsoft Edge. To see if you are DRM complaint type \"Edge://gpu\" into your MS edge address bar and look for this section\n\n    Media Foundation Rendering Capabilities\n    =======================================\n    PlayReady Hardware DRM disabled: false\n    Direct Composition             : true\n    Dolby Atmos support            : false\n    AV1 installed                  : true\n    AV1 activable                  : true\n    AV1 version                    : AV1:2.0.6.0\n    HEVC installed                 : true\n    HEVC activable                 : true\n    HEVC version                   : HEVC:2.4.39.0\n    Display:                       : Scaled: [0,0 1920x1080] Scale: 2.00 Actual: [0,0 3840x2160]\n    GPU Index                      : GPU0\n    HEVC - Dolby Vision support    : false\n    HEVC - HDR10 support           : true\n    HDCP 2.2 support               : true\n    HEVC - 4K support              : true\n\nWhat you care about is Av1 being true, HEVC 4k being true, and Playready disabled being false (double negative, it means your hardware is not being disabled because it is playready compliant).\n\nYou can download the HEVC and AV1 codecs in the MS store if you need them. If your playread is set to true... well that's going to be a fun rabbit hole for you to go down to see if your Monitor, Cable, and GPU are PlayReady supported.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "content": "When I first found out about it, I thought it's gonna be interesting. Either she's gonna be an important character, or Netflix wants star power (as usual) to hype up the final season.\n\nThen it became as bland as it could be: She's the new \"Papa\", trying to restore \"the program\". She even does exactly what was shown in the trailer, shooting at Eleven &amp; co.\n\nI know that being Sarah Connor in those 2 terminator movies is the only career highlight of her, but being in Stranger things doesn't change much either (for her &amp; the show)",
