        "content": "Attention: spoilers ahead.\n\nAm I the only one who found this movie completely unrealistic? I honestly have no idea how they managed to convince keira knightley to sign on to this story.\n\nFrom the very moment the woman expressed her desire for giving away all her money for charity, it was obvious her husband was going to kill her. Beyond that predictability, the entire plot felt absurdly implausible.\n\nEven if we assume a billionaire could somehow use facial recognition to find a woman who looks exactly like his wife, the execution still makes no sense. Maybe he could have staged a distant public appearance to deceive people but having her pass as his wife up close, in broad daylight, on a boat, surrounded by her friends? Completely unbelievable. Let alone that she just shaved her hair and put on some make-up by herself instead of having a professional MUA do it. And how is a poor Polish woman suddenly able to speak flawless British English and perfectly imitate another person\u2019s voice? That alone defies logic.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ridiculous idea of having her impersonate the wife to sign a contract. A contract involving an inheritance of that magnitude would absolutely require handwriting verification something that\u2019s standard practice. The whole plot feels like it was written by a teenager with no understanding of how the real world works.\n\nExtra minus points for the way women are portrayed as hysterical and foolish in situations like this. An award-winning journalist, in particular, would not react so irrationally upon realizing something deeply suspicious is happening, nor would she make herself such an obvious target.",

Other sites with awful UI still manage to do that. Am I just missing something?",

I love watching shows that we're done in the 2000's. It'sike a sense of nostalgia. It was greatly done!! The ending is bitter sweet but I think it was a good way to end the show...sad but at least it had an \"ending\" most shows just end and were left hanging. Officer Cooper deserved better! Sammy too!! &amp; Moretta died wayyy too early \ud83e\udd7a Lucero went through so many close calls!!! So sad how Cooper finally told someone his secret and then they go through hell together... they all deserved so much more!!! I'm still in shock! Still feel so connected to them!! This show literally had me on the edge of my seat!! Any recommendations on a similar show???",
