Payed streaming service with ads was something I simply could not believe. \n\nThis was the most fundamental difference between Cable and Internet: you don't pay for ads.

Now it just looks akward in my opinion and it's obvious that it's altered.\n\nMy question is whether this is a common Netflix thing ? In some cases if a sex scene is too long or too explicit i would understand their reason. But in this case neither of the two applies.\n\n",

        "content": "\n(Yes Japanese audio is usually better, but sometimes I want to watch the show while doing other stuff, and the English dub helps because I can still know whats going on without having to read subtitles. And I like subtitles with the dub because sometimes I like to read, it helps me with comprehending the plot)\n\nOn a lot of anime series on Netflix, the English captions simply don\u2019t match up with the English dub. For this reason it\u2019s very distracting to watch with English captions over English dub, which basically means that English captions are useless without Japanese audio. \n\nThis seems like such a huge and obvious oversight and design flaw.  Like a big deal. Like a cheeseburger without cheese. I assume it\u2019s this way because the English captions are translated from the original language, but like, it\u2019s such a huge flaw and it seems so damn lazy. Wouldn\u2019t it be super simple to hire someone to re-do the captions to the actual dub? Or even cheaper just get AI to transcribe the dub and fix the small mistakes by hand??? Why are they all like this? Is there a good reason that Netflix anime is so flawed in this way, other than laziness? And it\u2019s not a small flaw by any means; it makes the English caption/dub combo useless, because it\u2019s so distracting. They are dramatically different a lot of the time. That seems like a huge UX issue.\n\nA lot of other shows and movies are not like this; the dub matches up perfectly with the subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s been like this for years too. I just started a new anime after not watching for a while and, surprise surprise, i can\u2019t watch English dub with captions because they don\u2019t match??? Like hello??",

Of course there's the inevitable time-skip to compensate for the actors aging, but I don't really see it as that big of a deal.

Again, I'm only two episodes in right now, but so far, I like it a lot. It could be that I've been starved of any Stranger Things content for a while now, but it's just nice to watch it again. In episode one I got so scared cause I thought they just killed off Dustin. They for real had me concerned. Besides that, I'm enjoying it. What do you think?",

        "content": "Been thinking about the sea of unfinished shows, the one maybe two-season cliffhangers. There are two things that should happen that add to the long-term value of the network.\n\nIt's just too hard to be sure what will work. It's why cable did pilots.\n\nWhy can't streaming platforms have pilot seasons, maybe two a year? Perhaps they even change each month. They can produce a sitcom pilot season on say march, a sci-fi fantasy series in november, an anime month, a game show month, etc. Have a few of these a year for different sections, see what's popular and work from there. \n\nThey can make a big deal of it, such as voting and public engagement. People are watching to see what gets funded for a full season. There is potential for some actual sitcoms that people want to watch. \n\nThen, on the other side of the coin, a commitment to finish what they start. Mini-series, three episodes for any Netflix show to finish off their stories. Then nothing feels like a wasteland, as even if a show is cancelled, you know it will get wrapped up with perhaps quite limited funding. \n\n",
