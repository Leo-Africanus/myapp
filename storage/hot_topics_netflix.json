With these half season releases I\u2019m just going to wait until the full season is out and avoid discussions of the first half as best I can, which I think defeats their goal of trying to make series be in the spotlight longer. Either way, between this and their show cancellation decisions, it seems like Netflix figures out the worst thing they could do and then do that thing. ",

A boy that just became an adventurer and a group of monsters (a bunny girl, a goblin and a slime I think, maybe more)\n\nThere\u2019s then the evil/dark Lord who is actually just a good guy who became sympathetic to monsters, he looked like a very cartoony much and had a sea creature wife.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all I remember from it.

        "content": "I\u2019ve just sat down to watch the new season of Wednesday \u2014 I\u2019ve noticed yet again Netflix has split the season into part 1 and part 2. Why do they keep doing this?  It\u2019s actually super annoying to me, long gone are the days you can just sit and binge a new series on your day off. \n\nDo you guys prefer them split into 2 parts? I lose interest waiting for the second part of anything.. is there specific reasons for this like stretching out views etc? I don\u2019t think it builds suspense like Netflix thinks, it\u2019s actually just annoying \ud83d\ude02 ",

I don't have a specific budget, but if possible, I want to save money. Also what is the frequency that the ads come on?\n\nWhy did I get downvoted? I'm genuinely confused",
