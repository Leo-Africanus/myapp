The male juror basically put all the blame on Cassie and showed absolutely no sympathy for her. He immediately gave me the creeps. Seems like he really didn't value women at all.\n\nThe woman was even worse. She couldn't even hide her delusional love for Diddy. You can tell she was jumping with joy every time how she explained how Diddy would make eye contact with the jurors. She's so delusional I wouldn't doubt if she thought he was making eye contact with only her.\n\nThose two were absolutely vile in their reasoning for only counting him with two charges.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the grammar error in the title. It was suppose to say \\*The documentary",

        "content": "I\u2019m so frustrated because this happened right after I installed the latest system update for my Samsung smart TV\u2014before the update, Netflix worked perfectly fine for years without a single glitch. Last night, my TV popped up a notification saying a software update was available, and I figured it would just fix some minor bugs, so I let it install while I grabbed dinner. When I came back and tried to open Netflix, the app either freezes on the loading screen with the red logo or crashes immediately back to the home screen.\n\nI\u2019ve tried all the basic fixes I could think of first: restarted the TV three times (unplugging it for 30 seconds each time like some guides suggested), checked my Wi-Fi connection (it\u2019s stable at 50 Mbps, and other streaming apps like Disney+ and Hulu work flawlessly on the same TV), and even updated the Netflix app itself through the TV\u2019s app store\u2014though it said it was already on the latest version. I also tried signing out of my Netflix account and signing back in, but I can\u2019t even get to the login screen most of the time. When it does briefly load, there\u2019s no error code shown, just a black screen before it closes.\n\nMy TV isn\u2019t that old\u2014got it in 2022\u2014and it\u2019s always been compatible with Netflix before the update. I checked Netflix\u2019s status page and there\u2019s no server outage reported in my area. I even tried clearing the app\u2019s cache through the TV\u2019s settings, but that didn\u2019t help either. Has anyone else had this issue after updating their TV\u2019s system? I\u2019m not tech-savvy enough to mess with advanced settings, so any simple solutions or advice would be amazing",

I've seen a couple people post about how they were watching the Wolf of Wall Street and it suddenly refused to play with a \"title not available to watch instantly\" error. This happened to me too, so I used the chat feature to ask about it. I cant post the screenshots, but the agent said: \n\n\"About your concern regarding the title. I checked and confirmed that this title is not available in your location.\"\n\n\"Currently we do not have issue but can you send us a report regarding this title\"\n\n\"As I checked the title lists based in the US, this title is not seen meaning it's not available.\"\n\nI live in Texas, so im wondering if there's local laws that banned the movie or something like that. There are articles online from like 5 days ago saying it was coming back on the 1st of December, so i know im not crazy!\nAlso, what I was able to watch was censored in weird spots, and I know for a fact it wasn't like this a couple years ago. Does anyone else find this fishy??\n\nEDIT: The movie is back on Netflix, uncensored. False alarm everybody lmao",

Now the option to remove from Continue Viewing is gone.\n\nAnother issue with the most recent update is that when scrolling shows and movies clicking on one brings you right into the show instead of seeing more detail.\n\nIt seems like every successive Netflix update it just gets worse and worse.  The show icons are huge, you can only do a horizontal scroll instead of a grid list, and so on.\n\nIf anyone knows the solution to fixing the issue of the lost \"remove from Continue Viewing\" it would be appreciated.\n\n",

        "content": "I literally can't believe how so many people are not only personally mad, but also think it is objectively a fault / an issue that priority 1 Netflix productions (ST, Wednesday, etc.)  take 1-2 years per season. Take Stranger Things as an example. You get like 5-6 high end production movies per season. Makes 25-30 movies in total in a span of 9 years. Tell me how many franchises released 25 movies (that people actually are still eager to watch after like movie 20) in 9 years. The amount of sets, hours of acting, effects, editing, cutting, music and sound design is insane and honestly above some stuff that runs in cinemas. This isn't against those that are genuinely / personally sad or angry or that say that it's weird how the cast ages up, but against people that think there is an issue with production-time, while in reality Netflix original output is absolute insanity and I can't even begin to understand how this is possible (prolly money, but yeah xd). I also can understand (and personally think it is a neutral to good thing) why they split up seasons in the age of bingewatching, but that is a different discussion. \n\nI guess I will get a lot of hate for this, but it is just something I saw with Wednesday S2 and now with ST S5 that really confused me. If I am in the wrong or don't seem to grasp something, please let me know, but stay kind &lt;3",
