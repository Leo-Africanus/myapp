None of the other devices I know are used to access Netflix, including: iOS (iPad &amp; iPhone), xBox (my Son's xBox both at my house and his Mum's) or my LG TV.\n\nAs a bit of a test to see if i could force any of these devices to show in the list, I changed my password &amp; forced a logout.  Not only did the LG TV get logged out, the only device which were forced to input the new password was the browser based devices.\n\nCouple of questions:\n\nDo any of you have an idea as to why the device list is incomplete?\n\nHow quickly, following a password change will a user be logged out of the account?\n\nCheers!!",

Honestly, I don\u2019t watch Netflix that often, and I\u2019ve debated whether it\u2019s worth keeping given the price. But when a show I\u2019m excited about drops, I expect it to be available in top quality, that\u2019s what I\u2019m paying for.\n\nSo when Drive to Survive came out, I was really looking forward to downloading it and watching on my iPad Pro while on vacation. But the quality has been massively disappointing. I\u2019ve double-checked my settings, my Wi-Fi, and even looked up discussions here and elsewhere to troubleshoot. I see that there might be some factors outside of Netflix\u2019s control, but the bottom line is that other streaming platforms (Apple, for example) don\u2019t seem to have this issue.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a Netflix-side problem or something with the service provider, it\u2019s frustrating. At this price point, I expect reliability. If I can\u2019t count on getting the high-quality experience I\u2019m paying for when I actually want to use it, it\u2019s hard to justify keeping my subscription.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing the same issue?",
