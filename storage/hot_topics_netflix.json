        "content": "Context: I fell if love with Vietnam  as I travelled across the country last year. Till date, it is one the best experience in visiting a foreign country I've had. Food, Culture, Nature and the People are all fabulous. \n\nDuring my visit to Cu Chi Tunnels, I befriended my tour guide who was super informative. We spoke a lot about the culture and history of Vietnam with more focus on the war. He was from the North and his family were part of the communist party. But he was neutral and explained the whole scenario. One thing I was clear, that there's no good guy or bad guy here. Both the sides had committed war crimes. But then I visited the War Memorial, I felt the US did horrific attrocitices. They equally killed civilians as did the communists. So all in all, I had a belief that all 3 parties, The communists of North, South Vietnamese and The US were all equally guilty of inflicting so much pain to common people and created so much disruption that no one could live happlity during that period in time. \n\nBut after watching this series, I feel the South Vietnamese were the neutral guys who got stuck between the North and the US. Is this a right way of understanding the whole scenario?",

Now don't get me wrong elise had one of the best audtions but hear me out.\n\nOn American idol she sang aretha Franklin, while on on btb she sang tate mcrae those are two VERY DIFFERENT songs.now she made it work and it was AMAZING however if you listen to the original version of the song she sang on btb...SET UP.(and this is coming from someone who likes that song)\n\nNow Haley, the songs she sings on tiktok alot of belting yk meanwhile on btb she sings feather and they want to believe she picked that no what are tou supposedto do with that... also on her tiktok she said she wanted to sing sia for her mum AGAIN two VERY DIFFERENT songs.\n\nAnd wennely and nori to choose water by tyla and greedy for an AUDITION SONG.They made  it work but there's other songs that could've showcased their vocals (which I've seen outside of the voice.)like when nori sung a victoria monet song on the 3quency tour that suited her voice unlike greedy cause she actually can sing but that song was not doing \nHer justice And wennely, singing water...what are you supposed to do with.\n\nI Don't think she was set up but you'd think brianna would sing a beyonce song considering she's huge fan or and rnb song considering she said she grew up on shirelles,destinys child etc.\n\nI could go on for ages but you get the point.",

Each actor gets a profile of their character and only the \u201cmurderer\u201d knows they\u2019re the killer and has to lie and fool the others. There are these elaborate sets with different \u201crooms\u201d where the contestants find evidence and debate sections where they each can sway opinion.\n\nThere are a few things in the first 2 episodes I couldn\u2019t culturally follow but that\u2019s to be expected. The stories are really elaborate and it\u2019s a super fun guessing game. High recommendation. ",
