I thought it'll be something like, idk, someone inventing the Queen's Gambit and using it against other players and publishing it yada yada yada.\n\nI didn't have high hopes for this. Fortunately, today I took myself to go and watch it. Glad I did.\n\nWhen watching, I genuinely thought that it'll overwhelm it's viewers with chess technicalities but thankfully no. It blends the thrill of playing with personal drama and so all. Chef's kiss, the best way they could've done it.\n\nThe realities of child prodigies and the 'curses' it comes with it was beautiful portrayed as well.\n\nTruly a masterpiece.",

At no point do I want French or Spanish stuff being suggested, and at no point do I want children's progamming offered to me unless it is he-man or scooby doo.  Also I don't like the 3D rendered stuff in animation.  AND because the algorithm can't get it's understanding of me, I am getting some terrible suggestions.\n\nThat is bad enough, but now Netflix is suggesting stuff to me as if I have not already watched it.

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019m a Master\u2019s student in Marketing working on my dissertation about how people perceive AI\u2011driven personalization on streaming platforms like Netflix, and how that affects brand loyalty and privacy concerns.\n\nI\u2019m looking for streaming platform users willing to answer a short, anonymous online survey (about 2 minutes). Your responses will be used for academic purposes only and no identifying personal data is collected.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help, you can access the survey here: [https://forms.gle/WrYjwbCh7CAvkxA86](https://forms.gle/WrYjwbCh7CAvkxA86)\n\nThank you very much for your time and support!",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always family shared our streaming services with each other but I\u2019ve been cut off from Netflix cuz of the sharing rules and whatnot, but I was going to just suck it up and get my own plan.  I rock with an 85\u201d oled Samsung. Is it really that big of a difference between standard and premium or is it just minute.  I\u2019m 40. Kinda out of touch with a lot of technology. Just curious if premium is worth the price or if id just be satisfied with 1080p\n\nThanks! ",
