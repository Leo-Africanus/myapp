They should come with a warning at the beginning letting viewers know it's a 1 season show so you can decide if yiu even want to bother or not. \nIf Netflix wasn't free with my T-Mobile service I would have canceled it. I'm getting pretty tired of Prime doing the same, or maybe worse, taking years to come out with new seasons. And even then they only have 6, or if you're lucky, 8 episodes. I really miss when shows had a new season every year, right around then same time as the last, and where 12 to 20 episodes depending on whether it was cable or network tv. ",

The young cast were also very reliable and it had some great recurring characters especially Paul Walter Hauser as Stingray.
