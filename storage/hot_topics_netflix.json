        "title": "Ginny&amp;Georgia mental health problems discussion",
        "content": "It will be my thoughts about TRAITS not diagnosis!!!!\n\nI\u2019ve got diagnosed with multiple mental health issues during my life, so I could relate with the carather\u2019s problems (and maybe this is the reason why I am addicted with this show, it is so refreshing to see in an american show that they try to talk about mental health, even if it is just a series).\n\nGinny - early signs of BPD, panic disorder (fun fact: my symtomps also started when I was 12 w selfharm and panic attacks) the crashout to Marcus, when he tries to be caring, splitting to people, see everything black and white, and the abondentment issue, in some way Favourite person tendencies (Another fun fact at this age I had the same combo, my first love was also depressed, and it was the same dynamic). My fav part while rewatching (I try to be ironic a bit with the word of fav) when Ginny starts to feel owerhelmed by her emotions, instead of self harm, goes to Marcus and tries to have sex, she wants to distract, and in the third season with Wolfe also, I am very familiar with this feeling. And if we are at Wolfe careless sex, and Ginny also has tendencies to overuse anything is a big waving flag for BPD. Oh, and the realitionship with her mother is a big big trigger, Georgia always flips the narrative about herself, she flips the blame, she doesnt see Ginny\u2019s feelings and also invalidates them, because he runaways from the feelings as from problems (Third fun fact, it was the same dynamic with my mom, still this day, but without murder and stuff, but I lived 6 places til I became 18, and she always lied to \u201csave me and my little brother\u201d this shit is traumatizing) And also, she likes to write - which means she feels a lot - most of the artistic persons dealing with mental health issues - it is just a note.\n\nMaxine - ADHD, quiet depression I was diagnosed with ADHD also, and in the third season they perfectly show how it feels like, with Maxine carachter, you want to be everywhere, you feel to much, you have so much thoughts, and in a sudden you you just get exhausted, and you freezed, get depressed, and you realize burnt every bridges around yourself - it can be some bipolar traits also, but that is not my first impression about Maxine. There\u2019s the episode where she switch off and on the lights, lot of people said that it is OCD, yeah it can be, but I think ADHD sometimes includes OCD, and if you check the whole episode, it is def ADHD demonstraition.\n\nMarcus - depression Oh dear Marcus! I had two big love in my life, as I mentioned I had my \u201cMarcus\u201d when I was 17, and in that time honestly was so hard, because I didnt understood depression (discovered latley I had also that time, but not in that way in Marcus). It is hard to write about it because depression sometimes seems selfishness, but the other person is dying inside, I think the series tries to show this both side of this mental health problem. They say it out loud he has depression. Depression is something you see in the other eyes. You feel nothing but the darkness. You know you love someone, but sometimes you can\u2019t feel it. Because you belive you are a bad person, you are acting like one, and push everyone away who loves you, because you are someone who unloveble. Til that they I couldn\u2019t figured out how to handle it, the one who has it\u2026 It fckn sucks. And addicton I think it comes with it\u2026 or with any other mental health issue. You want to be normal. And you feel yourself normal with any addictive mind altering thing, until you not. When nothing is enough, and you find yourself in the rabbit hole - Marcus is great example for it.\n\nAbby - Eating disorder Abby is pro example of someone who deals with eating disorder, most likely bulimia, and in the world of social media it got so much worse in the last years, so much more teenager, starts to develope the traits, not because it became a fashion, as some stupid people says, it is because that looking good became more public than ever. But I also think, it is also about being traumatized in every age. Abby\u2019s parents divorce can be a trigger, and also that she never feels to being fit anywhere.\n\nGeorgia - narcissistic traits, avoidant attachment style, cpstd, panic disorder The question is on every social media platform that Georgia is a good or bad mom. My opinion is def that she isn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t say that she has a narcissistic personality disorder, because she feels empathy, but she brings to the table lots of narcissistic traits. I mentioned at Ginny\u2019s phrase. But you can relate with this character, because you know how much she got traumatized in the past, that\u2019s why I think she have CPTSD, or actual PTSD, the memories are hunting her. But if we speak about her as a mom - she says that herself doing everything to their kids - which is true, but in one hand, she doesn\u2019t do it that the way the kids needs, in the other hand she always wants to good in the others eyes. The list could goes on, I was crying in every Ginny&amp;Georgia fighting scene, because my relived my childhood traumas\u2026\n\nAustin - Autism I don\u2019t know much autism, but I saw some example in my life, and Austin shows traits. Even Paul mentions in season 2 that maybe Austin has the similar issues that his little brother, which Georgia instantly denies, but it can be. And Paul\u2019s brother clearly has autism.\n\nI didn\u2019t wrote about panic disorder at the mom and daughter phrases, but it is also a hell, I\u2019ve been there also, and now I developed a generlized anxiety disorder, and I think it hard to point out on the screen, maybe that Georgia is always in a flight or fight, and drinking about every day can be a working sign of it, but it is not clear.\n\nI think the author seen a lot in her life, because it is a well fckn well written script about mental health issues.\n\nLet me know if you noticed something else, I am corious what\u2019ve may seen based upon your experience.\n\n(English is not my first language so sorry if it is not correct somewhere \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb)",

What makes finding a title easy is to categorize and condense the list so you can see a lot of things at once; that's what makes for a good experience. I'm now literally browsing to find something 3 titles at a time I have no comprehension of what I looked at a few clicks back.. no ability to see a group of titles at once and make that nerve wracking decision of should I watch John Wick again or Interstellar? I fucking hate having to decide on a movie sometimes and always love when I find just what I'm looking for, and right now I'm not even going to attempt to find anything on this constricting layout that's just going to frustrate me and not provide literally the experience I'm paying for which is to REALX. Whoever thought this was a good idea..I hope you're reading the feedback. At least give me an option to switch back to the old layout. Shopping other streaming services immediately after I post this.",

I followed the process, not really understanding it, and made my office my primary household.  So now this morning, at my actual household, I tried to watch Netflix and I had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get logged in.\n\nI do completely understand that account sharing is a problem they are trying to solve.  But I also have to believe there was a better way to do that than this.  I've had a membership since 2010.  I've never account shared once in 15 years.  Netflix just made it tougher for the honest customer to watch a web-based service from wherever they are.  I think that's crazy.\n\nSo I cancelled.\n\nAm I the only one?",

Georgia, as usual, was busy with her endless rants and chaotic sex life\u2014constantly yapping without much depth.\n\nGinny looked sexy but stayed low-key throughout the season, which felt like a missed opportunity to develop her character. As for Paul, I couldn\u2019t tolerate his forced masculinity and lack of real emotions. He seemed to be living in a bubble of idealism\u2014felt bad for him at times, but not enough to care deeply.\n\nOn the brighter side, I loved Lynette\u2019s character. She was a truly supportive mother and mother-in-law, probably one of the few genuine personalities this season. Meanwhile, Georgia\u2019s so-called friends proved they\u2019re not even loyal to each other, let alone to her. That dynamic felt hollow.\n\nOverall, compared to the previous seasons, this one gets a 6/10 from me. Wouldn\u2019t recommend wasting time on it.\n",
