Now they can appear as very realistic AI avatars. Is this a good thing or a bad thing?",

I\u2019m especially interested in series that focus on crime bosses, drug trades, gangs, or undercover stories \u2014 anything that gives the same kind of tension and world-building as the shows I already love.\n\nCan you suggest crime or mafia-style Netflix titles that would be a good fit for someone who enjoys dark, character-driven stories with moral complexity?",

How in the Howie Mandel doing handstands on a handkerchief did this limited series trend at #1? I\u2019m genuinely shocked at how bad this acting, writing, and over all production turned out to be. It\u2019s so bad I stopped at the start of episode something or other to write this Reddit and I\u2019m already having exceptionally more fun with my limited time on a work night. This series is like someone farted in a closed room with no ventilation after eating at Joes dinner sub 4:00 am. I believe watching the history of how man made Velcro shoes in the 1980s would have been a substantially more valid use of my evening. Who in the wide world of sports memorabilia watched this and gave it a thumbs up? Walking down 22nd street at 3:00 am hitchhiking a ride to New Port Richey would be a more productive use of thumbs or ups. I paused the TV with an \u201cI\u2019m not mad I\u2019m just disappointed\u201d expression and pondered my viewing choices or wondered if I should donate my TV to help educate underprivileged tribes in Papua New Guinea. I think the parents and entire community of people that raised the individuals responsible for making this \u201climited series\u201d monstrosity should be forced to pay a tax and plead guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. I\u2019m beyond words for how incredibly underwhelmed I am at the thought of this dumpster fire to continue. When in the Men are from Mars women are from Venus did Netflix decide \u201clet\u2019s go with this one.\u201d? I would rather go back to the recent Gasparilla parade wearing a thong while eating Icecream than watch this nonsense any longer. Please just say no to drugs and this series, it\u2019s honestly that bad. I may delete my subscription to all streaming platforms and go pray in the Himalayan mountains for a solid year after this waste of hours, minutes and seconds with no purpose.

        "content": "Why did Michelle Obamas documentary movie that was climbing in the ratings again this weekend get moved to a kids movie list?  It\u2019s #4 by the way.  Is Netflix owner compromised by the demand of the orange blob?  I thought NF was a good guy not controlled because they want approval for their purchase/merger?  I thought this company took a stand for good, but this latest move has me wondering.  Do tell if you know.  I don\u2019t want to support a caver.  ",

        "content": "Like many documentaries it went too much into the weeds. I found the background material about Providence, building the mall etc. interesting. Also the artistic community emanating from Risdy. I was very interested in the tape art project + I was inspired by what art can do to heal and reach others. A central question the documentary raises, is the secret apartment art? I would say, No. It comes off more like a kids\u2019 secret playhouse, a free place to live after the free spaces they lived in Eagle Rock were destroyed by builders. I would be interested in knowing more about the divorce between Michael and Adriana. Obviously, his obsession with the secret apartment is what drove them apart. I was going to recommend it to a friend who lives in Providence and my niece who went to Risdy, but changed my mind.",

        "content": "I was laying in bed and accidentally hit the  Netflix button on my remote and it showed me their Valentine's day special.  I was curious and clicked my profile and immediately went to the \"Love Is In The Air\" section.  I scrolled and I saw a biographical drama movie called Priscilla.  It's about 24 year old Elvis Presley's 14 year old girlfriend/wife. I got weirded out and took a picture.  I wish I could show it.\n\nTL;DR: Am I dramatic for thinking Netflix putting a movie about the relationship between a 14 year old girl and a 24 year old man in the Valentine's day section is weird and gross?  \n",
