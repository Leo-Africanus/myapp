        "content": "If you\u2019re into gritty, no holds barred Wild West stories, this is it. Set in 1857, it throws you right into the chaos of frontier life, no sugarcoating, just raw survival. The landscapes are insane, the action hits hard (not just shootouts, but brutal hand-to-hand stuff), and the story actually moves.\n\nIt\u2019s not all talky drama, but when there\u2019s dialogue, it matters. The main characters are solid. Isaac Reed is a total mystery, and the tension between settlers, Native tribes, and religious groups feels so real. It also ties in actual historical events, which makes it feel even more grounded.\n\nNot gonna lie, it\u2019s dark and violent, so don\u2019t expect any warm, fuzzy cowboy vibes. It\u2019s like if Yellowstone and The Revenant had a gritty baby. Definitely worth the watch if you\u2019re into intense Westerns or just want a break from the usual predictable shows. \n\n",

I called them up &amp; they said the first charge was a hold to see if there was enough funds &amp; would be refunded in 3-5 business days. Well it's now the 14th &amp; still not refunded &amp; I still have the double charge on my credit card but Netflix says they only charged me once &amp; that I would have to call my credit card company to get a refund but then it would cancel my service. So I disputed the charge, my credit card company refunded me one of the charges &amp; the other charge is still there. So I try to watch Netflix just now &amp; they want me to restart again &amp; make another $7.68 payment even though I paid that already.\n\n\nWTF is going on? They still want to double charge me again to provide services that already paid for. Has this happened to anyone else? ",

        "content": "Hi everyone \u2013 my name's Kate and I'm a social journalist at Metro. My colleague Asyia has written a very interesting opinion piece about the powerhouse that is Ambika Mod, and I wanted to hear your thoughts on the subject. \n\nAsyia points out that after starring as Emma in Netflix's One Day, Ambika marked herself as one of the biggest TV stars of 2024 \u2013 yet she has not starred in anything in almost a whole year.\n\n'As someone who is eager to catch anything she is set to star in, I'm quietly devastated by this,' she writes, adding that it is made all the more disappointing by the fact her co-star Leo Woodall is currently promoting not one, but two new high-profile projects and is now a favourite to play the next James Bond.\n\nDespite it being announced that Mod was cast in a forthcoming Disney+ show Playdate, and she is also set to star in the Romain Gavras-directed thriller Sacrifice, neither project seems to have announced a release date yet and she seemingly has no other upcoming projects.\n\nAsyia says that this is 'not good enough,' arguing that a breakout star like Mod 'deserves the Hollywood treatment, with advertising and back-to-back jobs.'\n\n'Instead, it's Leo Woodall I see constantly splashed across my feed, newspapers and the screen at a far bigger rate than Ambika.'\n\nDo you agree that Ambika should be getting more attention and appreciation? Asyia argues that while, of course, Leo Woodall deserves all his success, Ambika deserves the same. \n\n**You can read Asyia's article in full here:** [https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/15/not-giving-this-breakout-netflix-star-enough-credit-22365652/](https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/15/not-giving-this-breakout-netflix-star-enough-credit-22365652/)",
