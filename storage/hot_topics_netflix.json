The only basis of an argument her lawyer can make for the retrial is the fact that Jason had mentioned to a counselor that he was more angry, and the secret voice recordings. But I feel like 1) if someone who doesn\u2019t even have guardianship of your own kids is actively trying to separate you from your kids, you\u2019re going to be very stressed ? Also, the secret voice recordings don\u2019t even show any abuse IMO ? They are arguing, and they both raise their voices, but Jason does NOT seem as aggressive as they are trying to paint him as. And the fact that they called it a threat that he was threatening Molly about taking the kids away\u2026 THEY ARNET EVEN HER KIDS ? Legally or biologically !! She never adopted them !! The other argument was regarding Jason\u2019s first wife. But professionals from Ireland who worked with the autopsy said that it still was not strangulation that caused Mags death. It could\u2019ve been a different medical condition that appeared to be an asthma attack at the time, but that does not warrant that Jason strangled her. Am I on the wrong side? Do people seriously think Mollys innocent ?",

This ambitious show need not end with the clich\u00e9 of Mulaney waking up from a deep slumber, relieved to find that it was all just one long fever dream. But the show must come to an end\u2014and not because all good things come to an end, but because it\u2019s totally insane. \n\nDeath by three fourteen-year-olds would spell violence for the sake of authenticity, in the name of outdoing the insanity of the internet and exposing final form internet brain rot for its deeply dangerous implications.",

        "content": "A Prophet (2009), directed by Jacques Audiard, is a gripping French crime drama that follows Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French-Algerian sentenced to six years in a brutal prison. Illiterate and alone, Malik, played by Tahar Rahim, navigates a dangerous world divided by Corsican and Muslim gangs. Initially vulnerable, he\u2019s coerced by Corsican mob leader C\u00e9sar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to kill a Muslim prisoner, earning protection but entangling him in the gang\u2019s power structure. As Malik learns to read and secretly studies Corsican, he gains cunning and ambition, balancing loyalty to C\u00e9sar with covert alliances, including with Muslim inmate Ryad.Through gritty realism and intense performances, the film charts Malik\u2019s transformation from naive outsider to calculating player, orchestrating drug deals and manipulating rival factions. Haunted by visions of his victim, Malik grapples with guilt and identity while seizing opportunities during prison leaves to build his own criminal network. The story explores themes of survival, power, and cultural tension in a claustrophobic prison setting. As Malik outmaneuvers C\u00e9sar, he emerges as a new kind of leader, blending ruthlessness with strategic brilliance, setting the stage for his inevitable rise in the criminal underworld upon release.",

Maybe it is because of the serie I was watching (Vikings Valhalla) but I can't really tell if I lose quality or not.

        "content": "I was in a discussion about vampires and\u2019s struggling to find a vampire production I liked I wanted to recommend a werewolf series I loved on Netflix.\n\nI went to search it out, and got frustrated (again) with the Netflix interface and search results. The interface always can\u2019t figure out whether it wants to a) get you to watch something from their current lineup b) get you to watch something from their catalogue c) brainwash you with their latest or d) purposely misunderstand you for unknown reasons.\n\nFor example, I can\u2019t remember either the name of the series I\u2019m looking for, nor the names of any of the actors. I have never found a function for reviewing the list of shows I\u2019ve watched on Netflix. I\u2019m easily able to enter the genre.\n\nMy results are many pages of basically unrelated top ten lists. Among possibly 200 results, maybe 20 for into my genre selection. All of those are perhaps the ones with the highest watch counts, I wouldn\u2019t know. The rest of the results are so far off the mark that they would be laughable except that I was there with a purpose.\n\nSearch werewolf: results: Judy Garland biopic, two weeks notice and a bevy of completely irrelevant titles, plus out of 200 results perhaps 30 are unique results. The rest appear multiple times in each of the rows of ten.\n\nSo, thanks for listening. Now, does anyone remember the name of the werewolf series from about ten years ago about an extended family of wealthy werewolves  that included V several main male characters but also one younger blonde female, played by a young martial artist who did all her own stunts?",
