There is no character build up. \n\nThis series is very vague and all over the place the only reason I kept watching was because users on here said the ending was a plot twist. Honestly the whole reason why I watched was waiting for this twist that never came. I was expecting some psychological thriller by the way people talked about it and this series was so BLAND.

        "content": "I just finished the last episode, and I believe the show was intended to be more of a social commentary, almost borderline satire. I didn\u2019t hate it but didn\u2019t love it either. At first I was getting annoyed by the clear inaccuracies, or embellishments and what seemed like lazy writing. It feels more like the show was designed to critique modern fascination with blood lust, and the twisting of stories by the media, authors, writers, movies, etc. for entertainment. The girlfriend seemed more like a schizophrenic hallucination or possibly a symbol of a textbook female lover in a horror story. She didnt feel like a real character. Her dialogue was off, she was inconsistent, and unrealistic. I think that was the point. They didn\u2019t want to spell the underlying message out for the viewers. \n\nNow with all that said, I wish they didn\u2019t go about it this way. This show had real potential to be great. It was shot well, the music was good, good actors, interesting dialogue at times, the real story was crazy enough. But there were many scenes that were forced in there with no significance. Pulling you out of the story and into one of Ryan Murphy\u2019s strange fantasies. Also the title is misleading, the title \u201cThe Ed Gein Story\u201d gives the impression this is a somewhat accurate representation of the actual Ed Gein Story. It is far from that. While i finished the show, i lost interest halfway through episode 6. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Watch Mindhunter or American Primeval instead lol. \n",

ESPECIALLY in season 2 episode 7, where we had Heiya straight up take a full mag of a machine gun and survive HOURS later (while funnily enough, Ann \"died\" from two shots).\n\nNiragi was by far the craziest example. Dude got lit on fire, fell off the building into the pool, tackled into a burning building, was coughing up blood all of seaosn 2 and then took a shotgun blast, ALL of which he survived.\n\nWhat I love so much is that the show ACTUALLY has an explination for such insane plot armor; the will to live. The Borderland's are a test of how much each character wants to survive (the games). The stronger your will, the more likely you are to live. That's why someone like Heiya can take so much punishment, because she's made it clear she does NOT intend to die\n\nIt makes moments when you're on rewatch hit different, like when Usagi tells Arisu in episode 2 \"I know I'll do anything to stay alive\".",

        "content": "First off, all of these girls are much more talented than 99% of people in the world. They are the most talented of the talented, and would completely blow average joe or sue out of the water in terms of musical ability. So when I am criticizing these girls, i'm criticizing them relative to other girls on the show.\n\n**Brooklyn:**\u00a0Brooklyn always seemed out of place compared to the other girls. She was like a cross country runner in a room full of sprinters, she just seemed like she didn't belong. That doesn't mean she was untalented, it just meant that she didn't fit the overall vibe compared to other girls. I think that's a big reason why she was eliminated so early.\n\n**Iliya**: She was similar to Brooklyn in that she seemed like a cross country runner trying to be a sprinter, meaning she seemed out of place compared to the other girls. There's no doubt that Iliya is a talented singer, but she doesn't fit the k-pop vibe. I feel like she'd have been a more successful solo artist instead.\n\n**Emily:**\u00a0Emily has a very distinctive look about her. Her face is distinctive looking but not in an unappealing sort of way. No doubt, she is a very talented dancer and was easily the best out of the entire group. I could see her becoming a very good backup dancer somewhere.\n\n**Karlee:**\u00a0I think she was eliminated simply because she's a step or two lower compared to other girls. She didn't stand out as being attractive, didn't stand out as being a really good dancer, or stand out as being a really good singer. There were girls who were simply better looking and more talented compared to her across all aspects. Her chances of making the final squad were going to be low.\n\n**Lexi:**\u00a0Lexi had such a cute and innocent looking face and demeanor about her. Her face is quite cute and neotenous and when combined with her soft spoken personality, this made her stand out in terms of charisma and star power. While not a top singer or top dancer, she was good enough to not look completely out of place. If she'd have never left, she probably would have made the team.\n\n**Hinari:**\u00a0I didn't see anything wrong with Hinari but I think she was a little bit too young. If she'd have been a couple years older, she may have had a better chance of making it.\n\nThat's everyone who stood out to me.\n\n",

        "content": "Just finished rewatching Catch Me If You Can and I keep getting stuck on how much of Abagnale\u2019s success relied on people trusting a confident story and paper records. He forges checks, pretends to be pilots and doctors, and basically wins on smooth talk, timing, and exploiting gaps in how institutions verified things back then. Looking at 2025, there are two clear directions. Modern banks, airlines, and employers have more automation, KYC checks, instant database lookups, and cross-referenced ID services that can flag fakes in seconds. A fake resume or a paper letter seems much harder to use to fool those systems. Digital trails and audit logs make it easier to trace and stop suspicious activity.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a huge amount of real personal data out there from breaches and data brokers, and that can be stitched together to build very believable identities ( I myself try and remove and monitor these with privacy apps like Cloaked). Deepfakes and AI can clone voices or make convincing video snippets. Human trust is still a major vulnerability: social engineering works because people rush, want to help, or assume an authority figure is legitimate. A modern operator could combine old-school charm with new tech  build an online persona first, then use carefully timed phone or in-person moves to close the deal. Some targets would be harder today and others are still shockingly soft. Big finance, enterprise HR, and major airlines are much tighter. Small hospitals, local businesses, and customer-support teams at smaller services often rely on phone calls and quick checks, which feels like low-hanging fruit. Logistics and delivery systems can also be manipulated if you know the right touchpoints.\n\nMy mental image of a 2025 Abagnale is someone who layers things: scraped data to bootstrap a backstory, polished social media and LinkedIn history, AI-generated voice clips for cold calls, and then a confident in-person moment where people fill in the blanks. Or it could be less theatrical and more distributed: exploit gaps in onboarding flows, trick CS systems, and collect many small wins across dozens of targets instead of one big caper.  \nWould a charismatic impersonator still pull it off today, or has tech made that kind of con obsolete? If someone tried something like this now, where would you expect them to succeed first and where would modern verification stop them quickly? Any examples of modern scams that felt like a Catch Me If You Can remake but for the internet age?",

        "content": "First, I\u2019d like to say there have been far too many shows canceled\u2014not because they were bad, but because they were either poorly marketed or not well produced. And trust me, I\u2019ve watched plenty of discontinued shows in my life that deserved a second chance.\n\nWe often talk about books\u2014some people read them, others don\u2019t. But think about Game of Thrones and the impact it had once it became a TV series. Now, we\u2019re seeing something similar with Halo.\n\nUnlike Game of Thrones, Halo began as a video game\u2014one with a rich, well-written story, deep characters, and an expansive universe. It\u2019s unfortunate that the show was discontinued, but with the right creative vision and marketing\u2014especially now that it\u2019s on Netflix\u2014it has the potential to be reimagined into something incredible.\n\nSo, to get things moving toward a potential Season 3, the first two seasons need to attract strong viewership numbers. That\u2019s the key factor studios will look at before making any decisions. Ultimately, it all comes down to marketing\u2014not just the fact that it\u2019s now on Netflix, but how it\u2019s promoted and presented to draw in both longtime fans and new audiences.\n\nThe real test lies in how future seasons are produced and promoted. That\u2019s what will either bring Halo back to life or cause it to fade away. The story itself is already solid; it all depends on how the storyteller chooses to tell it.\n\nHalo has one of the most cinematic and emotionally layered storylines in gaming\u2014packed with lore, complex characters, and massive world-building potential. The original TV adaptation didn\u2019t fail because of the source material; it struggled due to uneven pacing, inconsistent tone, and marketing that didn\u2019t capture what made the games special.\n\nNow that it\u2019s on Netflix, the opportunity is huge. Netflix knows how to build global hype and reach audiences at scale. If they focus on storytelling first\u2014treat Halo with the same level of seriousness as Game of Thrones or The Last of Us\u2014and back it with smart, emotional marketing, Halo could easily become a breakout hit.\n\nIn short:\nThe story\u2019s there.\nThe fan base is there.\nThe potential is there.\nIt just needs the right storyteller and direction to bring it to life.\n\nThe humanity of the story is there. The Halo universe is massive enough to keep viewers fully immersed. The visuals already capture grounded realism. What\u2019s needed now is a simplified plot, stronger character focus, and refined storytelling that stays true to the heart of the game\u2019s lore.\n\nIf Netflix follows those steps\u2014focusing on storytelling, authenticity, and emotional depth\u2014Halo could genuinely become the next Game of Thrones for sci-fi fans.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Current Situation\n\t\u2022\tHalo has completed two seasons.\n\t\u2022\tThe series was canceled by Paramount+ in mid-2024.\n\t\u2022\tNetflix has picked up Seasons 1 &amp; 2 for streaming, giving it a much wider audience.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s renewed fan interest and a growing buzz now that it\u2019s on Netflix.\n\t\u2022\tHowever, there\u2019s still no official confirmation that Season 3 will be greenlit.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2699\ufe0f What Needs to Happen for Season 3 to Take Off\n\t1.\tData &amp; Viewership: Netflix will monitor performance metrics like viewership, watch time, and retention. Strong numbers will strengthen the case for renewal.\n\t2.\tRights &amp; Deals: Since the show originated from Paramount+, negotiations over rights, funding, and cast contracts would need to be resolved.\n\t3.\tBudget &amp; Cost Control: Sci-fi is expensive. Season 3 must balance spectacle with storytelling efficiency.\n\t4.\tCreative Direction: A unified vision is essential. Addressing past criticisms\u2014like pacing and lore accuracy\u2014will help regain fan trust.\n\t5.\tMarketing &amp; Messaging: A fresh campaign should highlight the emotional and epic scale of the story, while promising resolution to lingering threads like The Flood and Installation 04.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udded Story Directions for Season 3\n\nIf Season 3 moves forward, it should build on what\u2019s been established while setting up the long-term arc of the Halo universe.\n\nMajor story threads to carry forward:\n\t\u2022\tThe Flood has been introduced\u2014this should become the central threat.\n\t\u2022\tThe Halo ring (Installation 04) must now take center stage, with its mysteries and dangers explored.\n\t\u2022\tThe moral and emotional journey of John-117 and his bond with Cortana should remain at the heart of the story.\n\t\u2022\tGrowing tension within the UNSC and ONI, with political and ethical dilemmas that challenge every character.\n\t\u2022\tThe Covenant\u2019s internal conflicts, adding new layers of intrigue and perspective.\n\nWith the right production, storytelling focus, and creative leadership, Halo has the potential to span 8\u201310 successful seasons\u2014a true sci-fi epic that could redefine video game adaptations for television.",
