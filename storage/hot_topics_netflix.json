Stories that aren\u2019t just entertainment but actually make you think about how messed up the world can be. I know *Dopesick* and *Apple Cider Vinegar* fall into this category, but I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others out there.\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d like something available on Netflix, but if there\u2019s something really good on another platform, I\u2019d still be interested in hearing about it.

        "content": "I mean, stop. Just stop. This show takes the deadpan to a whole new level - everybody gives absolute knock-out performances, and the seriousness with which they deliver some of the best one-liners in Netflix history is just so fun to watch. I'm on episode 6 and I just got to Randall Park saying \"His name is Fgwlpskr Pif\" and I'm just losing it. I'm glad this isn't a background show for me because I know I'd be missing the point of it all ... a lot of the humor is nonverbal and in the pauses and cuts so it's been way better to watch it straight up. \n\nConsider giving this show a watch - it's been a real banger. Heck of a cast and they all seem to play well off of one another. ",

I mean, I don't even see that much of a \"temper\".\u00a0\n\nI guess that's one aspect of the show I don't quite get. Are people in the UK (I am American) looking at that family and saying \"yup, I can see how that kid turned out that way?\"\u00a0\n\nI DON'T THINK that's what we're supposed to come away feeling but was curious what other's felt.\u00a0\n\nYeah, he ain't perfect, he has some stuff he regrets (if you are a parent and are not thinking from time to time about times you fell short of expectations you are doing it wrong) but in the 3rd episode they really seem to be trying to link Jamie's attitude to his relations with his had and I just don't make much of a connection myself.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/?f=flair_name%3A%22Question%22)",
