        "content": "I remember when 'Kinda Pregnant' with Amy Schumer released last month and for like two weeks straight it was showing as #1 on the trending movies and I just, straight up don't believe it. This isn't like some big takedown or the tired trope of \"Amy Schumer is horrible and no one likes women comedians\". Her movies aren't usually my cup of tea but I'm not here to hate. \n\nThis one though, I just cannot believe it was actually number one. Especially with the scene that auto plays when you stay on it too long. It's hard for me to even imagine a demographic that would see that and decide to spend the next hour and a half watching it. Let alone enough to make it #1 for 2 weeks straight. So I guess I'm asking if anyone else feels like they just lie about the numbers to push their newest originals? If they put it as #1 someone might at least give it a try. Or do y'all think I'm just way off base here and imagining things or out of touch. \n\nAgain to reiterate, I have a wide range of movies I'll watch and enjoy, even some of the Netflix original movie slop has its merrit for just turning your mind off and having a little fun. See 'Red Notice'. All this to see I don't just hate the actress or the genre, but still, this looks even worse than their normal original slop. ",

The documentary is one hour and 20 minutes.  The couple were eventually married and one of them, if not both, have passed on now.  They faced anti-gay bigotry throughout their lives.",

For those that don't know, this is based on an Italian 1963 film of the same name, that more or less follows the story of the Italian uprising, and documents how the rich are able to hold onto their power and position even after large scale upheaval. \n\nThis is definitely worth the watch, and I am surprised that Netflix is just digging out these old films that no one expects them to remake and actually does a really good job of recreating them. While I have been in a slump with netflix at the moment, this is definitely a show that's worth the watch.",

Shea Whigham is impressive as always and must be one of the best character actors working today. Also nice performance from Dane Dehaan who always delivers a memorable performance and really should be a bigger name in Hollywood.

Like 40% of 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is spent watching basketball/at the basketball game, where the colors are similar to those in 'Running Point'. Second, the 'Game 7' importance. I'm not a basketball nerd, so that term has no importance to me, but it was a key piece in both movie and show. \n\nI had 2 more points that I forgot, so I'll edit it later when I remember, but if anyone has found more similarities, please tell.

When Sean reminds her he is in the middle of an interview, she casually drops, \u201cJust tell whatever wife-beating Dagestani MMA fighter they can wait.\u201d\n\nWhat do Dagestani fighters have to do with this show? Why was this even written? Why did Netflix sign off on such blatant racism and Islamophobia? It was completely unrelated and totally unnecessary, just a throwaway smear that served no purpose except to push an agenda.\n\nThis was not an edgy joke or satire. It was straight up defamation. If this line had targeted any other group, the backlash would be immediate.

        "content": "Ok for years I have used my moms netflix (she knew) and we live in the same city. After netflix cracked down on that my devices like Roku said I could not log in since I was not at the registered home address. Thats fine. My pc netflix still let me log in. Now that no longer works either. I was thinking of getting my own netflix account, but wanted to ask about the new thing to add a second account to her existing account where I can register at my home. \n\nMy questions are...\n\n1. Is there any real benifit money saving wise if I have an extra account under her?\n\n2. I would pay for my own, but wondering if it would make her pay for my new account if I made one under her? Can I use my own cc card or paypal?\n\n3. Does netflix servers still screw up when its an extra account under someone else? Does it still want me in the same address?\n\nIf I get my own, that is fine. I just wanted to ask first.",
