The pedophilic thread was the boiling point for me as I've never been this uncomfortable in even a disturbing movie, let alone a so-called \"action\" film. I'm familiar with the director's personal life as well as the extended cut and the disgust relating to it just goes on more by the day. Do let me know what is your opinion on this film as well as the films you hate which received critical acclaim.",

        "content": "It is so well put together, and I was blown away by the fact that a lot of what happened in the show was pretty faithful to what actually happened, Charles Guiteau did become apart of a free loving commune, and was a failure at everything he did in life. Garfield was a Civil War hero and a abolitionist, and he didn't initially want his parties nomination, and is considered one of the last 'log cabin' Presidents, because he like Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Guiteau had hidden the gun in his pocket and the police only found it after taking him to the police station, and the first metal detector was used on Garfield. Guiteau's brain was actually studied, and its thought that his actions may have been due to syphilis, though of course in the 1880s medical tests like that were very unreliable. And Chester Arthur passed a lot of Garfield's corruption reforms. The score was great, made by the same composer that did Game of Thrones and Iron Man. I also thought they nailed Michael Shannon's look, his beard looks very similar to Garfield's pictures. Betty Gilpin's performance was so convincing.",

Her dad and her def got off easy, she\u2019s not even crying in the documentary..\n\nhowever i find it hard to understand the kids.. i understand wanting a mom.. as i lost a parent.. and tho molly took that roll it\u2019s just crazy in that they chose to lie for her. I think she def played her victim role setting up the recordings. but a dad youve had your whole life over the new wife? It\u2019s just hard to grasp..and them deciding to interview him over zoom was pure laziness, and i can see why they thought it was coerced. the government dropped the ball on this case! I feel she\u2019s good at manipulating her father for sure, as he\u2019s been around longer to her games so he\u2019s probably brain washed to her antics since she was young\u2026 she cried wolf and her dad fell for it and they over did it. her constantly saying my kids is so cringy too.. \n\nit\u2019s just a sad situation all around! however she\u2019s free i do think karma will spin the block and she will either try again with another family or slip up and tell on herself and opening up the case again. but i feel so bad for their dad, not protected in life and wasn\u2019t even after death! \nbut the center block being there coincidentally just looks bad. but the motive was there. i also can\u2019t imagine him being bold enough to try to kill her with her dad being there. and why allegedly would he try to strangle her when all he had to do was take his kids? i just dnt see why he\u2019d make that attempt on her. so what do yall think? is it over kill of self defense or out right premeditated murder?

Reason? the mastercard attached with my netflix account since 2023 had a problem because of which it stopped working.\n\nI didn't knew at the time so i tried adding it 2 or 3 times manually but it kept giving \"there is something wrong with payment method please try a different method\". but when i switched to a different payment method (this one was Visa card), the error now has changed to \"we cannot complete the action at the moment please try later\". \n\nSince then i have tried multiple things with 4 different payment methods from different banks (1 mastercard and 3 visa debit cards).\n\n1. I have deleted my account, tried to signup with same email again.  \n2. used a different gmail to signup.  \n3. used multiple payment methods, and FYI i have tried these payment cards on different other services like spotify, crunchyroll, EA play even and they are working. even the mastercard that started this whole drama.  \n4. Used different device, used incognito. no solution.  \n5. i've even waited more than 48 hours.\n\n  \nive contacted neflix support team and they say all of my payment methods are not eligible which is why its failing, despite the error stating \"we cannot complete the action at the moment please try later\". I've contacted the banks of all 4 cards, and they say that:  \n1. They have not received any transaction request from Netflix.  \n2. All banks are saying that they allow their customers to pay for their netflix subscription through their payment methods.  \n3. The cards have allowed online transactions.\n\nThe payment methods i've used:  \n1. HBL conventional account mastercard (debit).  \n2. Bank Alfalah Visa (debit).  \n3.
