        "content": "I just watched the Netflix documentary on the murder of Gabby Petito.  I'd like to say a few things and pose a few questions.  First of all, let me please say what a devastating &amp; senseless tragedy this was.  Good god, this got under my skin.  \n\nFor several reasons, primarily, of course, being the terrible &amp; tragic murder of such a young, vibrant woman who could have done so many things with her time on this earth, but also the anguish &amp; pain her loved ones have had to (and still have to) endure. I can't imagine the pain &amp; fear she went through as her life was ending.  \n\nI take no sides when I pose these questions.  I am merely interested in the experiences and feelings of others when it comes to this story.  First &amp; foremost, Brian Laundrie's family has been under massive attack since everything came to light, especially for the burn after reading letter where his mother says no matter what he did, she would do anything outside the confines of the law to assist &amp; protect him.  Because he is her child no matter what happens, for better or for worse, she is there to help him.  I want to know the opinions of other parents on this.  And I mean raw, honest opinions on how you would handle a terrible situation like that:  how would you respond to your child admitting to you they'd done something terrible, something unforgivable, something life ruining? If your child admitted they killed someone, would you choose to help them or would you turn them in?  Or would you tell them they're on their own?\n\nAs for the police who pulled Gabby &amp; Brian over after their domestic dispute:  did the police do the wrong thing in not filing criminal DMV charges, or was the end inevitable, and was Gabby living on borrowed time just by staying with Brian?  Could the police really have stopped these forces of nature that brought these two back to each other?  If this particular incident of him killing her would have been avoided, would another situation have come up in the future where he may have killed her?",

So instead of my \u00a311 (already most expensive sub) each month, I\u2019ll probably use it a few times a year now. ITV now has loads of comedies (which is what I use Netflix for the most) and is much cheaper. \n\n\nI hope others will also cancel and it will affect their profits. \n",

For a while it was actually set up with my household as primary (I use it more than she does) but then she swapped it over to her house. Over Christmas when I was at her house, I used the method where I watch a show on my phone on her wifi and netflix account and then watch a show on the same account from my house on the same device. It worked and re-enabled netflix on my TV at my place.\n\nShe came to visit me for my birthday earlier this month and I had her use the same method (watch on her phone at her house, then connect to my wifi and watch on her phone at my house) to keep it working. However as of midnight today I am once again unable to access it on my wifi.\n\nDoes anyone know why this might be? She followed the same steps as me but it doesn't seem to have worked? This is already super annoying :(",

I thought maybe it's just not available in the desired language so I tried Spanish but nothing was in Spanish either. I am almost certain that all these movies should have a Spanish dub. Not only is there no dub but also no subtitles in Spanish, only English. So something has to be wrong here I just don't know what. I tried deleting cookies and cache but that did nothing.

The design of the house, with its clean lines and spacious feel, is definitely very reminiscent of mid-century modern homes found in the United States. I\u2019m really curious if anyone knows the exact location of this home or has more details on where it was filmed. Is it a real house or just a set built for the show?
