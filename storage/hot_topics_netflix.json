I enjoy every storyline, which I can't say about a lot of shows where each character is off doing their own thing. They really managed to connect everything in a way that I found satisfying. And while it has a pretty run-of-the-mill take on life in the future, with some sillier elements like transparent smart phones, I do like that it takes place in the NEAR future (2029,) as opposed to 2058 or 2082 or something like that. And you can't mention Better Than Us without mentioning Arisa, the main character of the show who, despite being a robot, ends up being one of the most likeable and emotionally complex characters out of everyone.  \n  \nI'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're into sci-fi or robots. The story is definitely more of a slow burn, so if that isn't your thing you may not like it. There was never a season 2 unfortunately (but the first season has quite a few episodes). I heard something about another company renewing it for a second season but I'm not sure if anything ever came of that.",

But you know who was the absolute king of exploiting women in the 90s/00s, and who has never had a documentary made about him, or had his disgusting reality radio/tv shows exposed to the younger generation? Howard Stern. Anyone who was alive back then knows exactly what I'm talking about. I don't even want to describe the misogynistic filth that man did to young women on his shows. If Tyra Banks is going to be raked over the coals for her middling at best reality tv show, which actually wasn't even the worst of the lot, then someone really needs to take a hard look at the biggest offender of them all: HS.

        "content": "Are the scripts generally AI it\u2019s like each show they make is compacted into like 2-3 sub plot twists that cohesively have nothing to do with each other and water down to the most thrill killing conclusions. It\u2019s so in your face that you think it\u2019s not what\u2019s happening but it is. There\u2019s some amazing actors without doubt but you\u2019re so overwhelmed by the flashbacks and the connections all for them to lead back to nothing. The subplot about the secret child of the detectives husband in the show \u201c The Stranger\u201d got given about 30 minutes of focus even though we literally didn\u2019t care nor did it add to the actual plot.\n",

It literally causes my specific game lately to crash because it gets cranky when alt tabbed sometimes",
