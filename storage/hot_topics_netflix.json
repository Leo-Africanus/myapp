I\u2019m sure a lot of you have the same problem, so I usually **check IMDb scores before committing**.\n\nChecking IMDb works, but it can get messy with too much info. So over the past few months, I built this small web app myself. It loads super fast - **just copy &amp; paste a Netflix movie link into the search box and it\u2019ll show you everything: IMDb score, Rotten Tomatoes, movie summary, and user reviews all in one place**.\n\nAnd if you finish the movie and still feel confused, there\u2019s also a direct link to **Reddit** so you can look up **plot discussions** right away.\n\nThe app is already available on the Apple App Store, and there\u2019s also a web version if you prefer. I\u2019m a self-taught dev, so I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could try it out and leave some feedback. The app also supports multiple languages (French, Spanish...) for anyone who needs it \ud83d\ude03\n\nThanks a lot to the admin for approving my post!\n\nOn Apple Store: apps.\\[ \\]apple\\[ \\].com/us/app/movies-rating/id675623927  \nOn Web: netfliximdbscore\\[ \\].com\n\n(Remove the \\[ \\]) or view **the comment below \ud83d\udc47**\n\n**Sorry in advance, mods, I know sharing links isn\u2019t usually allowed, but I genuinely believe this app can be useful for the community, so I hope you\u2019ll consider making an exception.

That uncertainty created real suspense. However, by Season 5, this theme feels largely lost. We already know about the Upside Down, Vecna, and the Mind Flayer, their origins, motives, and how everything connects, so the tension that came from the unknown is no longer there.\n\nAnother small nitpick is how the Upside Down is treated now. In the earlier seasons, it was shown as literal hell, with characters needing hazmat suits to even go in there. The narrative made it clear that you couldn\u2019t stay for long, with deadly air and demogorgons everywhere. But now everyone is just roaming around the Upside Down, chilling, telling each other stories, and taking their time without a worry, which honestly feels ridiculous. \n\nAnyways just wanted to share my thoughts here have a good day.",
