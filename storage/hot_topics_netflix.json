I thought Season 1 was excellent, but this season felt all over the place.\n\nFirst off, Rose was incredibly annoying. She couldn\u2019t decide if she wanted to stay or go back to California; she flip-flopped like four times in a single episode!\n\nThen there\u2019s the whole Iranian involvement\u2026 which left me completely confused. What exactly was their role in all of this? It felt like they were introduced, but their purpose wasn\u2019t clearly explained.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me: they never mentioned the name of the mysterious country the Bala family is from. Why keep that a secret?\n\nAnd speaking of the Bala family; why would Vickor Bala use the chemical KX on his own people? That made no sense to me. Now he suddenly wants revenge on the U.S.? For what exactly? His motivations just felt weak.\n\nOverall, the season didn\u2019t make much sense to me. But back to my main question: What was the Iranians\u2019 involvement? It really confused me, and I\u2019d love to hear what others think.\n",

No fights are high adrenaline scenes. Just conversations that feel meaningless to the plot. Rose is actually unbearable with her storyline of constantly changing her mind about staying or leaving was so frustrating to watch and it just feels ljke theyre forcing her into the show. Big boss lady is awful and horribly acted. Peter feels like a shell of himself in this season and half the episodes is just his relationship with rose. Its all awful. The final problem with this season is the muslim people always speaking that language. I dont have any problem with muslims or their language but o hate that half the episode isnt captioned and half of it is and when it is the conversations still feel pointless. Who else agrees?",

        "content": "Anyone have any recommendations for a new show for the hubby and I to binge watch together? We have finished Supernatural and The Walking Dead (I know there\u2019s spinoffs of each I just have mixed feelings starting those tbh). We also really enjoyed Mindhunter but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coming back. So something similar to that dark / suspenseful vibe probably, but open to hearing what other people have enjoyed!\n\nEdit to add: also enjoyed X-files, and the streaming services I\u2019m working with are Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock",
