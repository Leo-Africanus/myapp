It's a pity they didn't make it 8 episodes as it's a very interesting period in American history especially the evolution of the Mormons and their bloody past. The cast was excellent especially rhe always reliable Betty Gilpin and Taylor Kitsch who is good in most things despite some of the hate he gets from critics. Shea Whigham is impressive as always and must be one of the best character actors working today. Also nice performance from Dane Dehaan who always delivers a memorable performance and really should be a bigger name in Hollywood. A quality show that stands out amongst all the rubbish on Netflix.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I need to vent about something wild that just happened. I went to fire up Netflix on my TV last night, only to see my account was signed out. Weird, right? I figured it was a glitch, so I tried logging back in\u2014bam, denied. Okay, no biggie, I\u2019ll reset my password. Except when I tried, Netflix hit me with \u201cno account exists\u201d for my email. This is an account I\u2019ve had for over five years.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh great, I\u2019ve been hacked.\u201d So I call Netflix support to sort it out. I\u2019m assuming five years of payment history tied to my card, watch history, all that jazz would make it obvious I\u2019m the real owner. The rep I talked to was nice enough\u2014she even admitted she could see the new email on the account looked fraudulent (some random string of letters and numbers). But then she drops the bomb: there\u2019s nothing she can do. Apparently, because the email got changed, I\u2019m locked out for good unless I want the whole account wiped. Years of watchlists, recommendations, and profiles? Gone.\n\nLuckily, my Netflix password was unique, so this won\u2019t spiral into other accounts getting compromised. Still, it stings to lose it like that. I\u2019m just baffled they couldn\u2019t verify me with all the data they have\u2014payment records, IP addresses, something! The only option they gave was to nuke the account and start fresh. I get that security protocols exist for a reason, but this feels like punishing the victim instead of the hacker.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did I miss some secret way to reclaim it? Or am I just stuck rebuilding my Netflix life from scratch?",

I am screaming at the screen on how gullible they are, next minute I just have tears from laughter.\n\n90% of these people who get scammed is because they behave like gold diggers. Just like the tinder swindler victims. Rich guy likes them, and they lick their lips by the thought of having a relationship with them, which blinds them for the obvious scam. They are promised riches and instead get scammed out of all their money and more. All by the promise of living a rich life, in an expensive house in an exotic location.\n\nAnd then the glaring red flags being ignored. Like this woman who's bank accounts were frozen as the bank told her the transactions were flagged as fraud. She wouldn't have it and told the bank to unfreeze the accounts, and kept sending money to her love rat. Friends were screaming at her to stop it but no, this was true love.\n\nThen the woman with the guy telling her his daughter had died. She then finds out he is a scammer because he told her she was stupid for getting scammed by him. He then makes up with her and scams her out of even more money. HOW?!\n\nThe woman who flew to Sri Lanka to meet up with a hotel bus boy, ended up being proposed to and  then ended up at the dudes parents in a metal shed and no one spoke English. She then gets confused into marriage and flies home, sells her house, takes early retirement, sends funds to build a house in Sri Lanka and when she arrives nothing is finished. Guy then asks for 31,000 pound for  a second hand hi-ace van, which she pays. And is now no longer even talking to her. She then finds postcards from another woman he is married to. Oh my word. \n\nThe woman who broke up with her husband because he cheated on her, but after the divorce kept him on to do her books and defrauded her in the process.\n\nThe woman who was talking to a guy online, didn't really go anywhere, he was rude to her, she cut if off, but he then send her a screenshot of an investment. And she immediately had her head turned, fell for the fake investment app, and got scammed out of 50,000$. LOL\n\nThe woman who met a millionaire, guy was in Dubai for business, but she ended up sending him money because his GB bank account were frozen. She asked him if there was no else who can lend him money. He literally said, yes if I need a million pounds, but not for these small amounts. LOOOOOOL\n\netc et etc.\n\nYou cannot be this stupid.

I say to her straight away, \"I haven't seen it yet, so please no spoilers or info!\" She says, \"Okay, I will just tell you what everyone already knows.\" I interrupted her and said that I don't know anything, nada, zip, and I want to go in blind. She assures me she won't give anything away and just dives into the story. She goes on to tell me everything from the first episode.
