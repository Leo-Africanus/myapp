        "content": "Just finished watching. First I feel bad for his daughter Kerri and can see the turmoil and how he is still haunting her. Judging from the postings here, many have been harsh on her. She does look a lot like him and I am sure is suffering from the guilt of knowing she lived with a killer and could not save those women, is carrying his DNA which helped find him. Lots of complicated feelings. I respect her for expressing herself publicly. I am not sure if that is the BEST way to move on but I do feel she is sincere about her reason for doing this and it is not for profit. She is a victim too.  She has kids and likely this has impacted negatively her ability to earn a living in the same way most of us do. \n\nCan you imagine seeing yourself referenced in your serial killer dad's notes?  I also heard that Gary Ridgeway, the Green River Killer actually had his son in the car when he picked up some of his victims.  \n\n\nWhat I don't understand is how could she and her mom not find the stuff in the shed. The kill kit in the house could just be tools etc. I have duct tape and rope string etc in a closet and I am not a killer. But the stuff in the shed is bizarre. He also stalked many of his victims for endless hours sometimes at like 3am. Did his wife not notice him missing or soiled clothes, smells, the jewelry.  To sit on the couch and say to him \"He writes like you.\"   WTF?   Reminds me of that movie \"The Dead Girl\" with Brittany Murphy where this one woman played by Piper Laurie , realizes that her husband is a serial killer when she finds all that stuff in the storage shed.   BTK's wife had to know something was amiss. \n\nEven Ted Bundy's girlfriend was one of the anonymous callers to tip police about him. \n\nBTK's  words when he was caught were \"Tell my wife I won't be home for lunch.\"  \nOn its face sounds harmless enough but to me that sounds like a code. Could she have known and was in some sort of Stockholm syndrome hold with him? \n\nI also find BTK odd in that several times he killed with children present. Stalked women who were home alone with small kids. Can't help but think that somehow represented what he thought of families. He had two types of victims middle aged women living alone and women alone with children.   \nOne poor woman he was hiding in 2nd bedroom in her house. I think she even had a guest over and BTK sat in her house the entire time until person left for the evening.\n\nGet a dog everyone. ",

It has great character work.  Both in the teen characters and the adults.  They create multi layered performances that feel real and I can say for people like Alex, George, Kathrine, Nathan Danny and Cole. I've known people like them in my everyday life the actors do a great job of making them believable.  My aunt has a ranch in Ontario, Canada  and raises horses so I connected with that as well. \n\nThis is a great cast who does fantastic work but I find myself connecting most with the characters of Alex and George.  I had to be responsible for my family in elementary school and High School and I love George's struggle with wanting to preserve his land while at the same time wanting to provide and secure his families future.\n\nI encourage a lot of people to give this show a chance.  I think a lot of the actors on this show have a big future.\n\nThe actor who plays Alex would be very good in Disney's MCU as either Cyclops or Nate Grey (X-Man).",

It felt out of touch somewhat, as many people have to work jobs they don\u2019t like, for no money, where quitting isn\u2019t an option. \n\n*Although they did kind of skirt around the whole affair situation where David was literally sleeping with the family Nanny\u2026 anyway.\n\nWhat were other people\u2019s thoughts? \n",

They sounded helpful but after a while and after resetting just about everything, I still had trouble getting into my account. This is when I decided to just cancel everything and I told the Netflix customer service to cancel my entire subscription and account. They then told me not to log in because this would reactivate my subscription. Fast forward to today, when I noticed a Netflix payment on my bank account and I was shocked. Apparently I had been paying 19 euros (instead of the 9 euros I was paying before cancelling) for the last months since cancellation. \n\nNaturally, I called customers support and they told me there was a completely different email address registered to my bank account. They did direct this to me as someone must have been able to access my email (which has 2FA so that must be impossible). Hopefully, they did cancel everything now and I do feel stupid for not noticing this earlier but it did not cross my mind to double check as I assumed it was cancelled. My question is, how is this possible and is there any way I can get my money back? Netflix told me the services were used so this won't be possible, but obviously they were not used by me as I did not have access to this account or email. What do I do? ",
