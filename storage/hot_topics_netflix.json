        "content": "The recent multi-year deals that Netflix made with all these podcasts is going to be the downfall of the podcasts. The podcast companies hold blame as well for being greedy. But this was a major miscalculation by both sides. Completely pulling the full content from YouTube, Apple etc to instead place it all on Netflix and only clips on the previous platforms was a bad move. I\u2019m never gonna go to Netflix to watch a podcast. I\u2019d rather just not watch the podcast. The numbers will reflect the sentiment because I know I\u2019m not alone. ",

Bringing in wannabe models, coach them, learn about them, share their stories of how they got here, be their big sister, erase the \"vapid stereotype\", get them good contracts. Save them. \n\nIt could've even been like Shark Tank where some judges are still hardasses. \n\nInstead, she continued the trauma cycle. It's unbelievable. \n\nAnd she's unapologetic. Honestly, I feel like everyone just blamed it on the times and moved forward. So I know everyone is saying that the J's and Nigel were apologetic but I technically don't see that. Where's the direct \"I'm sorry for literally creating a hostile environment in multiple ways\" from any of them? \n\nLook, don't get me wrong, I like the J's and Nigel more than Tyra and I think that they did a little better than her in this doc, but they are not blameless either. \n\nAnd that dude? Ken? Equivalent to Tyra. Despicable!!!!!!!! ",

It's set in Hialeah which it isn't a backwoods town, it's a dense urban/suburban major city in South Florida with over 220,000 residents. I'll cite one example of what I am referring to. How many rounds were shot into the house and outside yet not one call was ever made from any resident. Yeah, they said the homes in the short cul de sac were all stash houses or cartel owned but that kind of machine gun fire and # of rounds would be heard for blocks. Affleck &amp; Damon are the draw for sure but this was a B-movie compared to Affleck's \"The Town\", which was good but not great",

        "content": "I enjoyed H&amp;H and would conditionally recommend it to others. However there are a few plot holes that I can\u2019t wrap my head around. Maybe someone here has read the book which may have more details, or just has a plausible theory on these questions.\n\n1.\t\u2060Rachel and Helen were attempting to blackmail Lexi/Catherine, but for what? They couldn\u2019t have known about L\u2019s sister. What then?\n\n2.\t\u2060When Richard took Anna to the lake house to clear the air / bury the hatchet with Lexy, what was their true intention? Did Richard confess to Lexy that he banged Anna? When Jack beat him up at the bar and Anna told him she\u2019d tell Lexy they slept together if he pressed charges, he seemed to genuinely not want Lexy to know and agreed not to press charges if Anna kept quiet. Were they planning on murdering Anna? Was that why the bleach and other stuff was on the pool table? He had purchased that stuff days before so there must have been some kind of plan to harm her, but if so what was their motive?\n\n3. Here\u2019s the biggest hole for me. How did the mother know that cancelling their hotel reservation would make both Anna and Richard go to the lake house and how did she know lexi would be there? How did she know it would lead to an altercation in which the cops would come, search the house and find the planted evidence? That seems like a big reach. Seems like a lot of ifs, conditions and leaps of faith to make that all happen the way it did. Seems like anna would have been more likely to go to Jack or her mom\u2019s house, after all her and Jack had just recently somewhat reconciled (aka banged in his truck). Maybe if that didn\u2019t work out, if Anna didn\u2019t go to the lake house, she would have tried again another day another way?\n\nTLDR\n\n1. What did Rachel and Helen have on Lexi?\n\n2. Was Lexi and Richard planning to harm Anna and why?\n\n3. How did the mother know the stars would align and the cops would find the planted evidence?\n\nThanks for reading this far and thanks for any insight offered.",

        "content": "Although I've seen new ads for Mexico, and they look interesting, I get the feeling that everything related to Latin America is always heavily focused on drug trafficking, light comedy, telenovelas, and reality TV. But I think we have the resources to explore many more themes. Instead of teen comedies, we should focus more on romance stories with intergenerational female drama, for example, because we have great potential. We need stories of healing that blend people's resilience, as happened with Acapulco, but without forgetting the contrast with the luxury villas and resorts on our beaches, as well as the Mayan and Aztec culture of the interior, because we have so much richness. We need to contrast that with the rebirth of Mexico City and other major cities that offer a blend of history and modernity, all the gastronomy, art\u2014all that potential that sometimes seems to be overlooked as a character in the stories. Now that it seems more will be invested in Latin America, we want stories that travel and showcase our full potential abroad, but that also bring something new to our catalog here.\n\n\n\nDo you agree, or do you think there's already enough new material?",

        "title": "Why do people see the Money Heist gang as heroes?",
        "content": "I see everyone praising the professor and making him a hero (I am not talking about the show. I am talking about the audience) and I find it extremely hard to sympathise with him and the gang.\n\nFirst of all, he is not doing a heroic act by printing the money because he is not distributing it among common people. And to justify that by saying that other huge corporations and governments have also done it doesn\u2019t make it right. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Right?\n\nAlso printing money like this doesn\u2019t have zero consequences. It leads to overall reduction in value of the currency affecting the general public so it is not a good act.\n\nNow, in the last season he was ready to plummet the entire stock market as if it would not affect the common man? Millions would lose their jobs and so many would commit suicide. How is this heroic in any way?\n\nAlso, these heists lead to so many deaths, injuries and emotional pain to so many people.\n\nI am fine seeing them as smart people but to portray them as heroes who are here to save the world is nonsense. Your thoughts?",

        "content": "I grew up watching ANTM.\n\nAt the time, this show was considered \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cleading edge\u201d.\n\nObviously looking back, these women were mistreated. However, it was representative of the beauty industry as a whole, and even this was a step up from treatment within the beauty industry at the time.\n\nThis is the same era where TV hosts and tabloids would discuss Britney Spears\u2019 virginity, and call women whales at the beach.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make it right, but I don\u2019t think Tyra should be scapegoated. She opened up plenty of doors for these women - although they claim otherwise, some did go on to continue modelling or \u201cgot keys to their cities\u201d etc. Similar to American Idol, not all winners hit the big time.\n\nThe production crew should have stepped in when Shandi was clearly too drunk and blacked out. However, she chose to go into a hot tub as an adult and makeout with someone who was not her boyfriend. As ruthless as it seems, when you sign up to be in front of cameras, the world (including your partner) will see your actions.\n\nI enjoyed watching this but to be honest, I am not convinced that Tyra Banks is some monster.

Which is funny, because I've been watching YouTube on it for years and it always played ads, BUT NO, THE PROBLEM WAS MY TV AND NOT THIS SHITTY STREAMING SERVICE THAT PUTS ADS ON A PAID SERVICE.\nI have no choice. Thanks Netflix, you led me to the good side of the force, I'll never use your service again.",

They filmed and aired a crime, put many through unnecessary surgeries as well as mentally and physically humiliating them. To then have the gall to justify it all by saying they didnt realise they were hurting them at the time and that they were helping them!!\n\nThe documentary was a hard watch and I hope all the women involved have been able to find some happiness after the trauma they were put through.",
