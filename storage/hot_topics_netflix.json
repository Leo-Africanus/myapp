And then in episode 8, I felt like it just didn't deliver. I think it just wasn't good as a limited series. The mystery that was built was too big for the wrap up. I wanted to understand by the end something about the inner world or workings of the townspeople. In general, for a show which centered so much around emotions, the deeper we got into the series the more shallow the characters seemed to become. It was really disappointing. We never were let into the characters internal experience. \n\nI wanted so badly to see Laura and Alex actually TALK about things. Like the relationship was never sold as functional or emotionally intimate. I get if at first they were freaked out but when they got on the same page, why was the most we got was a a couple arguments? No real conversation. Alex is obsessive and won't let things go about work but his wife is obviously going through all this and not  actually planning on leaving town snd he's not bothering her constantly about it? \n\nThe timeline just felt wonky and poorly conceived following the set up. A great concept with poor follow through. I was left wanting more, but not in a good way, but in the way that I felt they would have to undo what they had done to answer things in a satisfying way.

It's creepy as hell. And as disturbing as the previous 2 seasons were, I found them to be quite educational in a way. What signs to look out for, like it's teaching us what to be cautious of. I also heard that the next season has been green lit and will focus on a female killer which is kind of a relief in a way, cause I'd like to see how these people became who they are from both sides of the gender.
