        "content": "I would like to preface this by saying I\u2019m no fan of Meghan (Sussex is it?). I did find her escapades during her stint with the royal family and after trying. \nBut the vitriol directed towards her in this show is excessive, inaccurate and unfair. \nThe show itself is charming. For those who say it\u2019s \u201cun-relatable\u201d she never claimed to try to be. She\u2019s doing her, and surprise, surprise she\u2019s rich. Shocker. I don\u2019t know how people are so offended by her choice of cookware, the fact that she has a large garden, time on her hands to harvest berries, and elaborate utensils when that\u2019s literally her life. If you can\u2019t relate have you considered that you\u2019re not the target audience? I think it would be worlds more offensive if she tried showing people how to bargain hunt or use coupons to seem relatable when clearly that\u2019s not her life. \n\nMeghan comes off as warm and genuine and you can tell the people in her life who she invites on genuinely care about her. The show is used to discuss their friendships and their lives and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s scripted to hype her up. The conversation goes both ways and it\u2019s a show about connecting with people. \n\nShe clearly knows her food. It might not be to everyone\u2019s taste but you can tell she derives genuine enjoyment out of food and preparing it. \nFolks mad that her recipes are not groundbreaking, guess what? None are. Even Pinterest regurgitates recipes that have been around for eons. She is just sharing what she likes. \n\nI think in the first episode she mentions that the kitchen she\u2019s in is not hers, but there\u2019s another main kitchen she cooks from for the majority of the show and that\u2019s in her house, no? \n\nAnyway as much as I\u2019ve never really liked the lady, the amount of vitriol she\u2019s receiving for this show is unwarranted and unnecessary.

I'm getting pretty tired of Prime doing the same, or maybe worse, taking years to come out with new seasons. And even then they only have 6, or if you're lucky, 8 episodes.

If you haven't seen it, the premise and synopsis is that an overnight shock jock DJ named Elvis enjoys playing cruel practical jokes on other staff members, and there is a new member of the staff named Dylan who is the board operator.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A deranged listener calls in and tells Elvis that he has his family held hostage and might kill them because he blames Elvis for his girlfriend's suicide due to them sleeping together while she was working on Elvis's show. This listener proceeds to gain entry into the radio station, killing many staff members and wiring up the building to blow up.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Elvis and Dylan traverse the building trying to find the listener and corner him in the broadcast room. The Listener produces a detonator and says that if his finger depresses the button on the detonator, and the bombs wired to the building and wired to Elvis's family will blow up, killing everybody. The show convinces The Listener to remove the bomb vests from Elvis's family and the listener forces Dylan to put on one of the bomb vests. The Listener then depresses the detonator button and drops it, and nothing happens.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It turns out that the entire scenario was an elaborate practical joke aimed at Dylan, the new board operator. All of the staff members who had been \" killed\" come back into the broadcast room and everyone including Elvis and the listener and are all laughing and congratulating themselves on pulling off such a feat.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Dylan, upset and traumatized, leaves but accidentally falls down the stairs, dying in the process. The next morning, Elvis gets into the vehicle of his boss, lamenting his decision and guilt-ridden, states that he will never work in radio again. The driver of the car turns around, revealing himself to be Dylan, whose real name is Max. Max is a stunt performer who specializes in these kinds of scenarios and the entire time, everybody was actually pranking Elvis instead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It was such a complete rug pull of an ending that left a terrible taste in my mouth. There was nothing funny about this scenario, it was just cruelty for cruelty's sake. There was one part where the listener told Elvis that if he didn't jump off of the top of the building and kill himself, he would murder his whole family. How could they be so sure that he wouldn't actually jump? It left me with tonal whiplash that I guess was intentional? The one good thing I can say was that the acting was pretty good, especially Mel's. Other than that, a completely terrible movie and a waste of everyone's time.!&lt;",

Nam-ra jumped of the roof and they all came near the edge to see the other surviving hambies and all of their reactions had been changed which is normal. Everyone was shocked but Su-hyeok smiled a bit with the shock. It was like \"damn mf, you made it\". And On-jo was in total shock like she didn't expect that. The reaction on her face doesn't justify seeing other hambies made her shocked. It was a shock of something dear to you which you never expected to come being infront of you. I personally belive it's Cheong-san among the survivors who made them surprised. What do you guys think?",
