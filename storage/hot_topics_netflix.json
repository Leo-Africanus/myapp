Charlie Hunnam and Laurie Metcalf's performances were great but what really grinds my gears are the portrayals of the actual known murder victims. I get writers take artistic liberties for entertainment but what they came up with was just so perverse. Mary Hogan was a former madam in Chicago? Bernice was a desperate old kinky cougar looking for a sugar baby? Was this to make us feel less sorry for them? Like maybe they deserved it bc they weren't \"virtuous\"? There's very little background online about either of the victims, at least nothing I could find, so I cant understand why they made these choices for these women? The only thing I could come up with was Ryan Murphy really doesn't like women.",

She married him, she has 4 beautiful children and she maintained her silhouette (I know her eating problems, but she's lucky to have a good health and not being affected by a hormonal problem, as many women are going through).

If not, im not interested in some murder porn fantasy that isnt made in good faith to the people who actually suffered that freak.

        "content": "After the second episode, I started to doubt how accurate the show would really be (I hadn\u2019t read any spoilers, but I knew a lot about the real case). At first, I was honestly annoyed by the whole Adelaine storyline \u2014his supposed girlfriend and accomplice\u2014 and the murders of victims that were never actually proven to be his. Even the depiction of the *real* victims wasn\u2019t that precise (Bernice\u2019s death scene was\u2026 embarrassing, omg).\n\nBut around episode six or seven, I started to *get it*. It finally clicked that everything we\u2019d seen before was meant to show what it\u2019s like to be **inside Ed Gein\u2019s head**: confusing, hyper-sexualized, disturbing, and suffocating. What\u2019s real? What\u2019s a lie?\n\nThe scenes that directly referenced horror films \u2014like the chainsaw one and the babysitter Evelyn (clearly nodding to *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*)\u2014 added a clever extra layer. They reminded us that we\u2019re not only trapped in Ed\u2019s confusion, but also in **Hollywood\u2019s own distortion** of reality through the \u201ccreativity\u201d of its horror movies inspired by killers like him.\n\nFor me, the turning point \u2014and the reason I ended up really appreciating the show\u2014 was the final stretch. It hits you with a cold dose of reality, showing the heartbreaking truth about mental illness and how it gets minimized and worsened in a violent, repressive family or social environment.\n\nPsychiatric disorders are not only hard for others to understand \u2014they\u2019re also hard for the person living with them. And the way the show portrayed his schizophrenia diagnosis (wow) felt incredibly authentic. The imaginary communication with Ilse and Christine Jorgensen \u2014with them saying things that were actually coming from his doctor and his own mind\u2014 was such a genuine representation of a brain desperately looking for answers but simply not working right. It truly felt like a drowning man reaching for anything to hold on to.\n\nMaybe we all expected it to follow the same style as *Dahmer*, but the fact that this one actually makes you **think** (and even research what was real and what wasn\u2019t, instead of just buying whatever a show tells you) really impressed me. I\u2019d even say it\u2019s more suited for *true crime* and horror fans \u2014the kind of viewers who can catch those deeper layers more easily.",

Getting all the newest movies in the mail for me and the gang to watch was epic and being able to stream on my Xbox was epic in its own right.

        "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished watching Boots on Netflix and wanted to share some thoughts.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how the show treats LGBT characters in a natural, realistic way. Unlike series like Heartstopper, it\u2019s not overly sweet or romanticized  it has humor and light moments, but it doesn\u2019t sugarcoat everything. The LGBT aspect feels like one part of the characters\u2019 lives rather than the sole focus, and, at least from my perspective, it avoids stereotypes.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think about this approach. Did you notice how the show handles LGBT representation without making it the only focus? Did this affect how you connected to the characters and the story? Personally, I found this more realistic style refreshing compared to more \u201cfeel-good\u201d shows, and I\u2019d love to know if others felt the same. Were there particular moments that felt especially natural or well-balanced to you?\n\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts and hearing how others experienced the series!\n",

This was before the Household Restrictions really came about so we never had issues. \n\nPost Netflix introducing the Household Restrictions, my mother and I bought an apartment about 50 metres from my family home in the other direction.

It will disable at either our house or at the apartment semi constantly. Every single time we try and use it, no matter which house we\u2019re using it from, we have trouble getting into it.

Can be binged in one evening. The plot just gets more wild and sad and baffling. \n\n2) The Keepers - just incredibly good - the women in the show who never gave up were inspiring and the editing etc is sooo good. I\u2019ve re-watched easily around 4 times. Absolutely love it. \n\n3) Tell me who I am - a haunting and chilling documentary about twin brothers and their vastly different recollections of what it was like growing up in an upper class family in England within an abusive family unit. The one brother had an accident and had complete memory loss, the other was burdened with a complete memory of their childhood \n\n",

        "title": "The Woman in Cabin 10 - the movie is good, but misses major points of the book",
        "content": "!!!Spoilers for both book and movie!!!\n\nI'm a huge fan of the book. If was one of the first that got me into the mystery/thriller genre.\n\nOverall, the movie was pretty good. I think that I would've enjoyed it way more if I hadn't read the book beforehand. The changes to the plot really bugged me\ud83d\ude05\n\n1. Lo's arc is completely different but I find her more likeable in the movie.\n2. I think the movie should've included the home invasion and Lo's inability to cope with it. In the book, Lo gets drunk the evening before witnessing the body being thrown overboard, which is a major reason why people don't believe her. She's implied to be in a mostly sober state in the movie, which makes the gaslighting from Bullmer and the crew much more obvious.\n3. The movie completely changes Carrie's character. The movie makes her very innocent and fragile. In the book, she's a very morally grey character - she's much more in on Bullmer's plan and is harsher with Lo. I liked her character way more in the book and felt like her personality was much more interesting.\n4. However, something that the movie did perfectly was capturing the unsettling, too-flawless, cold vibes of the boat. The scenery was gorgeous. They did a great job with the aesthetics.\n5. Didn't love the ending change. I would've kept the original ending of the book but didn't leave it as open ended.\n6. The evil doctor felt like an unnecessary character.\n7. I did love how the movie really humanized Anne.\n\nAnyways, that's my review :)\n",

        "content": "First of all, kudos to Kerri Rawson for her attempt to decently navigate an impossible situation. It\u2019s a reminder that oftentimes the family are victims too. I respect how she tried to come to terms with her experience honestly and with awareness. \n\nThat out of the way, I still cannot get over the neighbor of BTK\u2019s family lot having the nerve to say \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to live with this every day!\u201d when griping about Kerri and the crew\u2019s visit to get footage. It seems like if anyone had the right to return, it would be the people who lived in that house. She\u2019s not a gawker, she\u2019s a living victim of her father\u2019s insanity. \n\nSeriously? SERIOUSLY? I\u2019m trying to give the person the grace of she probably specifically means the cars driving by because the idea that she doesn\u2019t live with who her dad is every day is just ridiculous. \n\nThat was all I had to say, thanks for coming to my Ted talk \ud83d\ude02",

I was not expecting the depth of emotion. \n\nWhat I love most is how it beautifully portrays how masculinity can still have softness. \n\nI love how beneath the tough exteriors and anger, all the characters have a kindness, depth and realness. You see that we\u2019re all human - we feel, grieve, and love in our own ways. Our backstories, traumas, and insecurities may differ, but kindness exists in all of us. \n\nI just loved it so much!!
