        "content": "What\u2019s up r/netflix! I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

According to the Netflix website, I need to cancel my account, wait till the end of my billing period, then restart my account. A few years ago, Netflix introduced the extra members fee where anyone outside your household has to pay for Netflix or something along those lines. As far as I can tell, this never took affect for me. I have friends in other countries, who use my account with no issues. And I'm still able to use it when I travel and stuff.

I looked over my PayPal account to realize they had been charging me for 3 months previously while also charging my card days before. I called Netflix to ask why this had happened. Got nowhere. Basically they told me that couldn\u2019t have possibly happened because they could see only one account under my information and that account charged my card not PayPal.\n\nI admittedly was not in the best mood and told them to cancel my account. They did and then discovered the second account and the reason I was being overcharged. The CSA admitted that they had never seen a double account with the same information including the same login but told me that I had to get refunded by my card and or PayPal.\n\nI laughed and said \u201cI\u2019m not hanging up with you until you tell me both accounts are canceled.\u201d They canceled the second account while trying to convince me to stay with the service. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if you give me 3 months of free Netflix\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry miss that\u2019s not something we are authorized to do\u201d\n\nAs you can imagine I have not given Netflix a $1 since then but exactly one year later I see a charge on my card for Netflix and I call my bank they saw the charge and also the immediate refund of that charge that hadn\u2019t been processed yet when I started the call to them. They asked if there was something else they could do for me and I said yes \u201chave any other Netflix charges on the account that may come after this flagged as fraud please.\u201d They were more than happy to do that.\n\nSo here I am 18 months later with no Netflix and happier for it.

Problem is, I have the worst arachnophobia and the first thing that pops up is a woman eating a tarantula. I'm guessing I'm clearly not the only one with a horrible fear of these things.\n\n  \nI tried turning on auto preview and it made it even worse, now it's just frozen on her about to take a bite on it.\n\n  \nAny way to get this the hell off of my screen? It's PMO crazy right now. They were SO smart about making one of the most common phobias the first thing on their preview screen.",
