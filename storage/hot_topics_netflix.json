        "title": "Netflix urged to prepare for 'long and messy' Baby Reindeer legal battle\nThe woman who claims to be the real life Martha from the hit Netflix show Baby Reindeer is suing the streaming giant for $170 million, with a pretrial conference taking place",
        "content": "Article - A woman claiming to be the real life Martha from Baby Reindeer [is suing Netflix for $170 million](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-real-life-martha-524997) and one legal advisor has warned [the streaming giant](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/netflix) to expect a \"long\" court battle.\n\nFiona Harvey [filed a lawsuit against Netflix last year for defamation](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/golden-globes-netflix-baby-reindeer-882144), intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and violation of her right of publicity, according to court documents obtained by The Mirror US. She alleged Netflix \"created an easily accessible road map to allow viewers to track her down in real life and connect the dots to her identity.\" In the show, the character Martha is played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nHarvey claimed she was \"tormented\" after [the show, in which she isn't named](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-richard-gadd-issues-462748), was released. She said she suffers from \"anxiety, nightmares, panic attacks, shame, depression, nervousness, stomach pains, loss of appetite and fear, extreme stress and sickness,\" according to the court documents. She's seeking $170 million in damages.\n\nA pretrial conference will be taking place in regards to the case today. Legal advisor James Pipe has spoken to The Mirror US and shared what he thinks Netflix could expect as the case begins.\n\nPipe told us, \"This lawsuit between Fiona Harvey and Netflix is already making headlines, and honestly, it's got all the ingredients of a long, messy legal battle. Harvey is suing for $170 million, claiming Baby Reindeer is basically a version of her life, and that Netflix defamed her, violated her privacy, and acted negligently by letting it air. But is she likely to win? That's not so easy to say.\"\n\nHe continued, \"First, she\u2019ll need to prove that viewers could clearly tell she was the inspiration behind the character, and that what was shown was both false and harmful to her reputation. That's a tall order.\"\n\nThe expert explained, \"Netflix hasn't named her, and the show is billed as a dramatized 'true story', meaning some parts are based on real life, but others are fictionalized.\" When suggesting how Netflix will respond, Pipe said they will \"likely lean hard on freedom of speech.\"\n\nHe added, \"They'll argue that the show is protected artistic expression, that names and details were changed, and that no reasonable viewer would assume the character was a 100% accurate portrayal of a real person, especially someone never named.\"\n\nPipe also suggested Harvey might find it difficult to win the negligence parts of her case. \"They'll argue they didn\u2019t act recklessly and took steps to fictionalize the story,\" he said.\n\nThe trial could be a long one, according to Pipe. \"With a claim this size and the level of media attention, we're probably looking at least a year or two before there's any final decision, unless they settle early, which can happen if both sides want to avoid a drawn-out court fight,\" he suggested.\n\nThe expert concluded, \"Bottom line: Harvey has a shot, but Netflix has deep pockets and strong legal arguments. It\u2019s going to come down to whether the court sees this show as storytelling, or something more damaging.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer tells the dramatized story of comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked, with the character Martha ending up with a nine-month jail sentence for her harassment against him. In a statement shared with The Mirror US, Harvey previously said, \"Earlier in 2024, Netflix released a program called 'Baby Reindeer', which they billed and marketed as a 'true story'. One of the two main characters, 'Martha', was clearly intended to be based on me.\"\n\nJames Pipe is a legal advisor who spoke with The Mirror US on behalf of [Free Grants For Felons](https://www.freegrantsforfelons.org).",

        "title": "Why am I sure Amy Bradley fell off board",
        "content": "\nI personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. \n\n And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her. In many trafficking operations victims are asked to bring along such documentation, especially cash money. Also, I found it weird her friends and family didn't mention any past history with drugs. The brother said she just smoked and drank, but not even a single thing about weed or some stronger stuff. Nor did her friends. Even there were some pictures in which she held pills, I wouldn't take that as a definitive hint.\n\nAnother important point, the pictures on the prostitution website were proven not to be her, since the tattoos don't match with other pictures that weren't shown on the doc. I don't know why they left that out. I feel like they left a lot of things out \n\nThe easiest explanation is that she  fell off the board, (maybe she felt a bit sick and wanted to puke or something), but then the two girls that saw her would have been confused or lying. If these girls are being truthful, then the father never saw her in the balcony, since one can't just teleport in so little time. They recently interviews yellow, who I noted didn't appeared on the doc, and some people noted that he lied about when he came back to his room. I haven't watched the video so I can't confirm myslef. That's something I read on the brother's X, who talks about scientology and shit... how the hell does someone get to that conclusion?\n\nThe trafficking narrative is overly complicated and has so many gaps were one has to fill with wondering and subjective eyewitnesses that might have been influenced by the phycosis of the media surrounding the case. It's not new people coming forward claiming to see someone who was already dead by then. The taxi driver, the tourist, the navy and the woman... I don't know, the way they told their stories was too fantastical to believe. \n\nBut if she did in fact fell off board, why haven't they found the body? Some people say she was eaten by fish, but I don't believe that. They mentioned in the doc that some mafias, more likely drug dealers or traffickers of all sorts (remember Curacao is relatively near to Venezuela and Colombia) operated there. Perhaps the body was found by someone who didn't report to the authorities, maybe because of fear of because they worked with this associations.\n\nPerhaps there are more witnesses who either are afraid to come forward or just didn't know it was her, or didn't care. I just found out about the case on Netflix. I hope the doc brings more leads to the case, and justice is brought to her and all similar victims. My family after watching the doc blamed Amy for her stupidity, selfishness and nativity. But I don't believe she was the kind of person to leave for drugs in such a shady situation without at least telling someone she was leaving, or writing a note. \n\nEDIT: I also forgot, was her key card in the cabin? That would be the first question I'd ask her brother. If the key card was missing, she either \n\nA) left and planned to come back\n\nB) fell off the balcony with the key card\n\nIf the key card was in the room\n\nA) she either left and didn't plan to come back, which doesn't make sense since she wanted to stay in the boat\n\nB) she left and forgot about it \n\nC) she fell off the balcony \n\nDoes anyone know whether her key card was found and if Brad knows about it?

        "content": "Just finished Blue Eye Samurai and I\u2019m honestly blown away. The animation is absolutely stunning \u2014 every frame feels like a piece of art, blending traditional Japanese aesthetics with a cinematic, modern flair. The fight choreography is some of the best I\u2019ve seen in adult animation \u2014 fluid, intense, and grounded in real emotion. But it\u2019s not just eye candy. The storytelling is layered and powerful, exploring identity, vengeance, and isolation with remarkable depth. The voice acting (especially Maya Erskine) brings so much weight to the characters, making them feel heartbreakingly real.\n\nWhat really impressed me was how Blue Eye Samurai balances action with emotion. The writing never talks down to the audience \u2014 it trusts you to understand the character\u2019s internal struggles without spoon-feeding exposition. The historical setting adds another layer of richness without feeling forced or preachy. It\u2019s raw, mature, and unafraid to be brutal when the story calls for it. Easily one of the most compelling shows Netflix has dropped in a long time, and I truly hope it gets the recognition (and second season) it deserves.",

        "title": "A Deadly American Marriage - the bizarre lies",
        "content": "I just watched this documentary on Netflix, and I am thoroughly disgusted with the outcome. While I understand that it would be distressing for Molly to think that the children she was helping to raise could be taken away from her, particularly after experiencing a miscarriage. I also can empathize with the fact that the refusal to formally adopt the children made her feel illegitimate and sidelined in their role as mother figure (even though Jason\u2019s family maintained that he *was* taking steps to move forward with the adoption, but he was concerned about custody - which I find to be completely legitimate). \n\nHowever, trying to effectively erase the biological mother of two small children and late wife of her current husband is inexcusable. I believe both of the children\u2019s accounts that she was overbearing and needed constant reinforcement that they loved her and saw her as their mother. It\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but she displayed such utter disrespect (to put it lightly) to the memory of Mags that I just cannot fathom this. I myself lost my father to illness at a very young age, and I cannot imagine my mother trying to replace another man as my father. That doesn\u2019t mean a child can\u2019t accept a new person as a parental figure in their life, but it should never be at the expense of someone\u2019s memory and legacy. \n\nMy real discussion point, however, is the bizarre lies she told about going to Ireland to be their godmother, as if they already had a very close relationship with the family prior to Mags\u2019 death. Why was this just mentioned and then glossed over? That is a HUGE lie! Then also telling a book group that she gave birth to Sarah?! I found these to be very significant details that speak to her propensity to tell flat-out lies that she could never back up. That is just pathological. \n\nWhat does everyone make of this omission? They mentioned it and then didn\u2019t elaborate at all. There was also something, if I\u2019m not mistaken, about him being a professional boxer or something? What the hell? ",

        "content": "This afternoon, i came home from work, decided to chil on the sofa, and watch some netflix. To my surprise, it looked likea cheap knockoff of google AndroidTV. \n\nTo make things worse, it's impossible to find anyhting, you literally scroll endlessly and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order of things. on top of that, you are subjected to oversized posters for everything, sucking up all of the available screenspace, leaving you with little to no informaiton. The older format allowed you to quickly and easily breeze through the offerings at lightning speed, looking at the small poster icons for each one, stopping on one for the synopsis. Not anymore. Now it's dumbed down so far, that i'm pretty sure it was created just so Netflix's C-Suit would be able to use it. (Old people with no technical skills)\n\nI'm sorry, but after being subjected to price hike after price hike, and the content getting worse and worse. Now they're doing weekly episode releases, and making the UI UNUSABLE.   \n (Literally why did you buy all of the old garbage shows from history channel like \"ancient aliens\"??) \n\nFor all of these reasons. I cancelled my netflix subscription, and i'll be using literally anything else from now on. Netflix got big because it's customers like it. Now there's no reason not to push a better platform up the ranks. Netflix no longer deserves my money, or my patronage. They refuse to listen to their users, and defend this horrendous decision (among MANY others) That just shows how little they even care, just as long as they get that monthly sub. ",

This one has its good moments, but I actually found it ended up being way too gratuitous than it ever had to be and lost the story pretty quickly along the way. \n\nIt\u2019s almost more something you might expect to watch in a 2nd or 3rd year class in a pre-med program in college. I actually even enjoy good horror movies and I had to fast forward a ton because it ended up just being big stretches of watching the full on surgery and long shots of the injuries and wounds.\n\nWatch it if you really get off on fucked up injuries, I know some do, but skip it if you enjoy the stories and getting a vibe for what\u2019s happening in a hospital the 99.99% of the time you aren\u2019t there. Instead watch the aforementioned doc. ",
