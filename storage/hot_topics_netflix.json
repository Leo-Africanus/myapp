It makes me wish we would all evolve as humans and live peacefully together. If you hate someone, who is not bothering you or does nothing to affect your life in any way, you have a problem. I really enjoyed this film. Old archives from the Nazi days and a different subject than most Nazi movies. It is wild. I knew Nazis didn't like gay or trans people, but I didn't know to what extent they didn't like them. Now, trans are the enemy, again. Without getting too political, it really looks like we are repeating everything that happened in 1933.\n\nEdited to add: A chilling quote from Hitler, in this documentary. \"Homosexuality has to be combated at all costs, otherwise it will be the end of Germany, the end of the Germanic world.\"\n\nCan't we all learn from history?\n\nIf you want a thought-provoking film, I recommend this one!\n\n",
