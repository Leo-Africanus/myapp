First off, presenting Sean Penn as \u201cmiddle aged man\u201d is like saying Donald Trump is a centrist. It\u2019s a gross mischaracterization and immediately sets the wrong vibe. While I get he\u2019s not supposed to ultimately be sinister, it\u2019s impossible to not see the red flags that any sane woman alone at night in a car with him would not have waving in her face furiously. \n\nThe conversation is interesting and not dissimilar from some I have had in my many (mostly Uber) rides with a driver. I generally prefer dead silence, but if the ride is longer than 30 or 45 minutes it\u2019s almost impossible to avoid. \n\nIn my experience through a variety of avenues, guys that tend to be this blunt and aggressively open right off the bat end up having not great intentions. It\u2019s the \u201cfly off the handle\u201d type that expects some result that if it does not go right to plan it\u2019s the nuclear option. \n\nThe movie is ok, the scenario is hard to keep realistic in your head and the casting is bad. Someone like Ruffalo or Renner would have been far more palatable because, you know, they are actually middle aged and not 60+ year old men with sexual violence histories in real life. \n\nWatchable but not award worthy by any means.

        "content": "Morgan crashing the bar mitzvah knowing she was not invited and knowing the family did not want her there, and that a grieving woman would suffer by her presence is a good example. Or at the very least they knew that Morgan\u2019s presence would stir up drama. This event was an important rite of passage for the teenage niece and should have been a time for the family to focus on her. It was not about Morgan or her drama. It was not about Joanna or her drama. \n\nJoanna crashes Noah\u2019s sermon unannounced (place of work) and is pissed she has to wait 15 minutes for him. He did his absolute best to rush out of there, but by the time he finds Joanna, she has already had her sister show up to bitch and *rescue* her. Maybe this isn\u2019t narcissistic as much as a weird combo of needy, insecure and demanding. \n\nYes, Joanna confessed to going through the private box. But she failed to mention that it wasn\u2019t just her snooping, but she was with her mom and her sister, all of them sitting around mocking Rebecca and laughing and making a show out of looking through somebody\u2019s private belongings. That is more than just letting insecurities get the best of her, this came across as a symptom of a pathological lack of empathy and a casual disregard for personal boundaries, two signs of narcissism. \n\nIn the ick episode, Joanna leaves Noah alone with her nutty parents because she gets the ick. When you are introducing a new dating partner to your family, your role is to make that person feel comfortable around all these new people and support them. But she disappears, leaving him to wonder what the hell happened and then he eventually finds her out by the pool, where she\u2019s in some sort of crisis about his blazer. If someone I was newly seeing did that to me, I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019d be some boundaries drawn. \n\nThis last example is a bit harder to explain, but I\u2019ll try. Why was Morgan completely morally expunged once Joanna finds out she had \u201ctold the truth\u201d about what Rebecca had told her at the bar? Morgan\u2019s behavior itself was callous and cruel. That is what should have been addressed. \n\nObviously characters shouldn\u2019t be perfect, but the lack of awareness from the writers is what bothered me. They seemed to think that Morgan and Joanna were the quirky, sassy, loveable kind of flawed, not like an untreated personality disorder kind of flawed. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t give a shit, except for the fact that I just keep hearing about what an emotionally aware show this is, how healthy the relationship is, how much people identify with Joanna. I feel alone in this and so I thought I\u2019d throw it out there to see if anyone feels the same way. ",

        "content": "Just curious if anyone else ran into this problem. \n\nAfter watching the first three episodes this weekend, I can't watch Arcane (or lots of other shows) today while connected to my network. It works on my smart phone mobile data, but not the network. \n\nCS said it's a VPN, but I didn't change anything since the weekend (and nothing in several months). Also my ip location is in the correct part of the country (US). \n\nAny advice or commiseration? Netflix says it's Xfinity and Xfinity says nothing is wrong ",

        "content": "**No Spoilers**\nThe show was actually pretty good. It had a lot of celebrity appearances in the world of fighting. For only a 5 episode series, the production team did an amazing job grasping my attention and intertwining an impactful story into MMA fighting. I completely recommend the show for anyone who has minimal interest in combat sports.\n\nNow for the discussion (still no spoilers from me):\n\nI usually complain about predictable endings \u2014 this one took me by surprise. After such a dramatic story and background surrounding the main character, you really hoped for the outcome presented. Or, at least I did.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the ending?",

What if frosty the snow man turned into some hot shirtless guy. Bit of the plot is that this lonely woman put a magic scarf around a buff snowman statue then it turns into a human.\n\nThe merry gentlemen. Where a family is struggling to get visitors to their hotel/BnB so they hire some hot men to dance for the guests. Then the main female protagonist falls in love with a one of the dancers.\n\nThis is too much.\n\nWhat are they going to do for the other holiday movies.\n\nHalloween a pumpkin turns into a hot guy name jack.\n\nEaster. The bunny is some hot dude in a bunny suit.\n\nThanksgiving. Not sure if coming when skipping thanksgiving. Turkey the animal turns into a hot guy.",

        "content": "The range of words, characters, etc. seem all similar to one another.\n\nFor instance, Lo from Stoked is this rich girl with a very attractive brother just like Rafe, and she is hanging out with teenagers who aren't as wealthy as her instead of hanging out with teenagers coming from sophisticated families. Reef reminds me of JJ and John B. Johnny is pretty much like Pope\u2014the smartest one in the group. Fin is a tomboy just like Kiara.\n\nThe setting and the fact that it's about hanging out with your friends in summer and facing adversities as well as experiencing new adventures seem more than just a coincidence. What do you all think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibuqb4x8612e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=409d0f4cdd0aa3a83490e745c405a3f59ae47699\n\n",
