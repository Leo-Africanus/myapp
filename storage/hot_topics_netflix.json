Like many expat families, we travel frequently - we\u2019ve lived across multiple countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nLast week, my wife traveled overseas to care for her sick mother. Meanwhile, our children and I stayed home for school. We continued using Netflix on our various devices as we always have.\n\nNetflix\u2019s automated system flagged this as \u201cunusual activity\u201d and permanently cancelled our account. When I contacted customer service, I was told:\n\n\u274c There is no appeals process\n\u274c There is no formal complaint procedure  \n\u274c The decision cannot be reversed\n\u274c Seven years of customer history means nothing\n\nThe representative literally said: \u201cOnce the system detected the issue, then there\u2019s no option to recover it.\u201d\n\nSo Netflix\u2019s algorithm is judge, jury, and executioner. No human review. No consideration of our account history. No recognition that international families exist. No way to appeal an automated decision.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fraud prevention - it\u2019s punishing legitimate customers for living globally.\n\n@Netflix - Is this really how you treat long-term international subscribers? Where\u2019s the humanity in your customer service?",

That time has been replaced as of recent by some pretty big misses.\n\nEven the shows I can think of from this year like Untamed, Wayward, Waterfront, Hunting Wives, Black Rabbit etc are all lacking a lot. It feels like the only shows Netflix sometimes hit on are British dramas. \n\nSo if you are reluctant to check it out, don\u2019t be. (In my opinion of course) ",

It's absolutely fascinating and amazing, and there were some that were truly mind-blowing to see the intensity and also some of the games where these underdogs beat these obvious leaders or at least who look like obvious leaders. \n\n  \nAnyway, I'm personally enjoying it. I encourage you to also check it out. Definitely, I think episodes 2 and 3 onwards it becomes very intense, so if things feel a little slow in the first episode, don't give up. I highly recommend it. \n\n",
