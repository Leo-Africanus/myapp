Is there still no way to do this?\n\nI'm in this situation because I shared my family account with my sister in another state. At the time, the version of the Netflix app on her cable box was only able to use the primary account. Her show preferences were polluting my watch history and recommendations so I set up a new profile for myself. With me an the rest of the local profiles, I've reached the maximum number of profiles on the account. Now that Netflix is cracking down on shared accounts, and wants me to use the \"add extra member\" option, they need to find a way to allow the primary profile to become the extra member.",

        "content": "I remember when 'Kinda Pregnant' with Amy Schumer released last month and for like two weeks straight it was showing as #1 on the trending movies and I just, straight up don't believe it. This isn't like some big takedown or the tired trope of \"Amy Schumer is horrible and no one likes women comedians\". Her movies aren't usually my cup of tea but I'm not here to hate. \n\nThis one though, I just cannot believe it was actually number one. Especially with the scene that auto plays when you stay on it too long. It's hard for me to even imagine a demographic that would see that and decide to spend the next hour and a half watching it. Let alone enough to make it #1 for 2 weeks straight. So I guess I'm asking if anyone else feels like they just lie about the numbers to push their newest originals? If they put it as #1 someone might at least give it a try. Or do y'all think I'm just way off base here and imagining things or out of touch. \n\nAgain to reiterate, I have a wide range of movies I'll watch and enjoy, even some of the Netflix original movie slop has its merrit for just turning your mind off and having a little fun. See 'Red Notice'. All this to see I don't just hate the actress or the genre, but still, this looks even worse than their normal original slop. ",

For those that don't know, this is based on an Italian 1963 film of the same name, that more or less follows the story of the Italian uprising, and documents how the rich are able to hold onto their power and position even after large scale upheaval. \n\nThis is definitely worth the watch, and I am surprised that Netflix is just digging out these old films that no one expects them to remake and actually does a really good job of recreating them. While I have been in a slump with netflix at the moment, this is definitely a show that's worth the watch.",
