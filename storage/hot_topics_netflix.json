It was painful, sure, but the eventual drop was a single, glorious binge-fest. We adapted. We endured the long waits for the return of hits like the final run of *Stranger Things*.\n\nBut now, the streaming overlords have added a new layer of torture: **Volumes**.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that we waited for what we were promised as \"Season 5\" of *Stranger Things*, only to get Volume 1\u2014a cruel, tantalizing fraction of the story. You get four episodes of vital plot, a massive cliffhanger, and then... nothing. Back to the waiting game for Volume 2, which is essentially just the back half of the same season. The same happened with the highly-anticipated return of *The Family Man*, only for fans to have to wait again between parts.\n\n  \nWe signed up for the convenience of binge-watching, the freedom to control our viewing experience. Now, we are being forced back into an anticipated, staggered release schedule, only without the benefit of the traditional weekly TV model that kept the community discourse alive for months. Instead, we get an initial flash of binge-mania followed by a frustrating, momentum-killing pause.\n\n",

Yesterday I finally tried a fix that actually worked flawlessly for me.\n\nFor reference, I tried the most popular fixes, such as disabling audio devices in Device Manager or Content Type Reported to the Display in NVIDIA Control Panel (as I don't have that option appear), but to no avail.\n\nI stumbled upon this [forum](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/disable-hdcp-regedit.442563/), discussing how to disable HDCP with a registry edit. And it worked flawlessly for me.\n\n**DISCLAIMER: Editing the Windows Registry carries significant risks. Disabling HDCP may cause other issues with compatibility in other software and services.**\n\n1. **Get your GFX Class GUID** (*Open Device Manager, right click your graphics card under Display adaptors, go to details, select Class GUID, right click the number that appears and copy and paste somewhere!)*\n2. **Open Command Prompt** (*Press Windows key, type Command Prompt, right click and open as administrator*)\n3. **Disable HDCP** (*Paste in the command below to update your registry, checking that the ID matches your GFX and then press enter)*\n4. **Restart your PC**\n\n`reg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0000\" /v \"RMHdcpKeyglobZero\" /t \"REG_DWORD\" /d \"1\" /f`\n\nI hope it can help others - it was driving me mad!",

The third episode is especially glaring. I\u2019m so confused on what happened, like thank god I\u2019ve watch the show before so I wasn\u2019t confused when the subtitles during the therapist\u2019s and Ran\u2019s conversation shows the therapist (via subtitles) saying that he SHOULD be telling Ran the things Magna had just told him, when in reality the actual conversation (via audio) says that he shouldn\u2019t be saying these things. My fiance was confused though so I had to pause to explain. And that\u2019s just one of many translation issues in this episode.\n\n\nI\u2019m so confused, this show was pretty well translated about a year ago? What happened?",
