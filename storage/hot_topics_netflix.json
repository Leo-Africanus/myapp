The production cooked; shooting and editing were elite. One reason that I found it so entertaining was that the first two episodes set up such a satisfying twist in the last episode.\n\nKC and Everett are hysterical foils of each other, not to mention they're both absolutely fucked as individuals. Everyone interviewed are such good storytellers, having a certain southern style humor/charm that doesn't get old quickly. The ending is so good too; there's a feeling of a hero's redemption with KC which ties the story very nicely. All in all, super impressed and grateful to see Netflix invest in this show. What a treat.",

I know I'm probably an outlier, but I would have 100% been on the 1st boat out after&gt;!the plane crash especially because there had already been a group of tourists who died on a boat in the first scene of episode 1.!&lt;\n\nMost of us would have been catatonic/devastated/&gt;!on the ground screeching at the idea that our kid was in a plane that we just saw crash before our eyes, and if not then, at the very minimum at the hospital when it was mentioned that she was missing because she was at the front of the plane and most likely dead.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Side note, I would have probably gotten slapped into another plane of existence had I pulled the little skit Sara pulled, trying to run away by boarding a plane without my parents! Also what are the odds of her getting on that 1 plane of all planes?? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!When they get to Eric's small boat, Eric starts struggling with the guy trying to steal it from them, while Marie and Fredrik just...stand there?? But they could miraculously let go of the boat once he gets shot, right?? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jennifer also doesn't seem very devastated that her husband Fredrik is left behind. Every time they show her, her face pretty much screams \"oh damn, that sucks\"! !&lt;\n\nIdk, after a certain amount of bad decisions, you just start hating everyone and not rooting for a single character, so why should I keep watching?!",
