I get that they have their reasons, but it's awful.\n\nIs everyone else less bothered or what? I figure it would have changed by now if everyone dislikes the auto-preview as much as me. Google TV version btw - but I'm pretty sure it's implemented on most Netflix apps..",

        "title": "2 reliable methods for Picture-In-Picture (PiP) on Windows 11/10",
        "content": "If you're anything like me, you often have Netflix on while you do routine tasks or play casual games. Picture-in-picture (PiP) was wonderful. The \"upgrade\" away from version 6.99.5 has effectively crippled the Netflix app -- downloads are no longer supported, and PiP is not readily available.\n\nThere are 2 reliable methods to enable PiP with Netflix in its current state. I expect these solutions to continue to work, since they're supported by Microsoft/Google/Mozilla developers for non-Netflix applications too. Here's your options:\n\n1. __Use web browser's built-in PiP functionality. (Prefer MS Edge)__\n\n   - Microsoft Edge has the same video quality as the Netflix app, though subtitles will not show in the PiP window, nor will the arrow keys function to skip forward/backward. \n   - Firefox/Chrome/Chromium is intentionally capped in bitrate by Netflix. Reduced video and audio quality compared to the app/Edge. Specifically, it tags video for lower quality and older codecs, and often 128kbit vs 192 kbit audio. It may not make a difference in every show/movie or in conjunction with windowed mode and mixed audio.\n   - Firefox specifically supports subtitles while in PiP mode, a must-have for foreign languages or quiet dialogue.\n   - Browser PiP often needs to be reset when playback skips to a new video (next episode). Close PiP window and re-open it for the new episode.\n\n2. __\"Always On Top\" function provided by Microsoft PowerToys.__ Install first, then enable via setting and shortcut keys.\n\n   - To enable this module, turn it on under the Context Menu (Windowing &amp; Layouts) or Dashboard (Disabled Modules).\n   - To put Netflix above all, have PowerToys open in the background/minimized, click the Netflix window so it's focused in the foreground, and use the \"WIN + CTRL + T\" shortcut to enable \"Always On Top\". Change the shortcut bind if you must, in settings.\n   - Borders generated by PowerToys can be disabled by clicking on AlwaysOnTop header to open settings in the PowerToys interface. \n   - However, the Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons and the window title bar cannot be hidden without editing the Netflix app itself.\n\nMicrosoft PowerToys on Microsoft Store: [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld)\n\nREMINDER: Games and other apps must not be in exclusive Fullscreen mode. Windowed or Borderless will allow Netflix to stay on top.\n\nIMPORTANT: Microsoft Edge's PiP button is occasionally hidden unless you pause-play the video. Something about the menu option depends on playback being started by the user (not auto-played). When in doubt, pause-play the video first, right-click on the window tab for Netflix and choose \"Enter picture in picture\"; specifically it should be nestled between the \"Mute\" and \"Send to device\" options.\n\nHappy multi-tasking!",

It's always nice to see Lindsay Lohan and Kristin Chenoweth, and there were parts here and there that were enjoyable, but I think this leaned a bit more toward rom-drama than rom-com. \n\nThe high-at-church bit was probably the highlight (no pun intended), but an accidentally-on-drugs scene isn't exactly breaking new ground. The dog thing just gave me anxiety (I always worry about ppl feeding my dog things he can't eat, so even her pushing the cookies near the dog made me uneasy), so no laughs for me there.  The end honesty reveals with everyone was fun for a second before it became really sad.  I guess like a lot of downers in this one between all the cheating and the mom's death, so just not exactly what I was expecting going into this kind of movie. \n\nSo yeah, at this point, I don't know if anything is going to be topping \"Nobody Wants This\" this year for my favorite rom-com.  Recommendations very much welcome! ",

Additionally, the plot felt rushed and convoluted, failing to build upon the strong foundation established in the first season.
