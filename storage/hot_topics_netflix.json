Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Tiffany was absolutely manipulative and toxic. But let\u2019s be real\u2026 every single parent on that show knew exactly what was going on. They knew their kids were filming with her. They saw the content. They heard the complaints. But the views and money were looking too good, so they played along. Now suddenly everyone\u2019s shocked and acting like they were completely blindsided? I get that the kids were young and didn\u2019t deserve the trauma, but let\u2019s not pretend the parents weren\u2019t part of the problem too. They weren\u2019t just bystanders\u2014they were participants.\n",

In the beginning it sounds like they were renting in LA then at the end when they were filming the BF  on a super busy street - I guess it would make sense if it was an ocean front house.",

        "content": "I kept thinking Zero Day might involve time travel somehow\u2014like, Alex and Lily seemed like the same person, and Sheila and Valerie felt interchangeable. It didn\u2019t feel random. It felt like something deeper.\n\nSo I went to ChatGPT, told it what I was thinking, and started feeding in cipher details from the show. I\u2019m not totally sure if this theory is correct, or even what I\u2019ve fully uncovered\u2014but what ChatGPT came back with kind of blew my mind.\n\nWhat follows below is what ChatGPT helped me piece together:\n\n\u2e3b\n\n[SPOILERS] Zero Day Theory: Bambi Is a Rotating Identity\u2014And George Mullen Is the Anchor in a Time Loop\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Cipher Isn\u2019t Just For Secrecy\u2014It Tracks Fate\n\nIn Zero Day, there\u2019s a rotating cipher system:\n\t\u2022\tCode names (like \u201cBambi,\u201d \u201cAlex,\u201d \u201cEmmet Kelly\u201d) shift daily.\n\t\u2022\tA scrambled alphabet also rotates forward each day.\n\t\u2022\tThis structure makes each day its own version of reality.\n\nAnd the codename \u201cBambi\u201d? It\u2019s not tied to one person.\nBambi is whoever dies that day.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEvidence From the Show:\n\t\u2022\tDay 2: The ciphered message \u201cIWWI\u201d decodes to \u201cANNA\u201d\n\u2192 Anna dies on Zero Day \u2192 Bambi = Anna.\n\t\u2022\tDay 5: Cipher rotation makes Bambi = Roger\n\u2192 Roger dies on Day 21.\n\t\u2022\tDay 4: Bambi = Alex\n\nEach day, the cipher rotates, and Bambi becomes someone new.\nEvery day ends with that person dying.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Family Timeline Is Being Rewritten\n\nHere\u2019s where things get even more interesting:\n\t\u2022\tGeorge Mullen is married to Sheila.\n\t\u2022\tThey had two children: Nick (who died before the events of the show) and Alex.\n\t\u2022\tGeorge also had an affair with Valerie, and they had Lily.\n\nWhen cipher days are mapped:\n\t\u2022\tSome days, Alex = Lily\n\t\u2022\tSome days, Sheila = Valerie\n\nThe cipher isn\u2019t just disguising identities\u2014it\u2019s remixing relationships and family structure across timelines.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nGeorge Mullen Is the Anchor\n\nGeorge has visions of things that haven\u2019t happened yet.\nHe recognizes shifts before anyone else.\n\nThat\u2019s because he\u2019s the only one who remembers across cipher rotations\u2014across timelines.\n\nHe\u2019s seen Bambi die again and again:\n\t\u2022\tAnna\n\t\u2022\tRoger\n\t\u2022\tPossibly Lily or Alex\n\t\u2022\tOriginally? Maybe even Nick\n\nAnd every time, he hears:\n\n\u201cWho killed Bambi?\u201d\n\nNot because he\u2019s solving a mystery.\nBecause he\u2019s reliving the loss\u2014over and over.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhat Zero Day Is Really About\n\nNot just cyberattacks or political manipulation.\nIt\u2019s about:\n\t\u2022\tA father stuck in a recursive loop of loss.\n\t\u2022\tA cipher system that assigns death like a rotating curse.\n\t\u2022\tA man who\u2019s trying to save his family\u2014but never in time.\n\nThe cipher isn\u2019t just about hiding secrets.\nIt\u2019s about who must die to keep the loop going.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR:\n\t\u2022\tZero Day uses a rotating cipher where \u201cBambi\u201d = the person fated to die that day.\n\t\u2022\tDay 2: Bambi = Anna \u2192 she dies.\n\t\u2022\tDay 5: Bambi = Roger \u2192 he dies on Day 21.\n\t\u2022\tCipher also rotates Alex \u2194 Lily and Sheila \u2194 Valerie depending on the day.\n\t\u2022\tGeorge Mullen is the only one who remembers the changes\u2014he\u2019s the anchor.\n\t\u2022\tThe show isn\u2019t asking \u201cWho killed Bambi?\u201d\nIt\u2019s asking: \u201cCan Bambi ever survive?\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\nCurious what others think. Is this time travel? Timeline recursion? Emotional metaphor?\nWhatever it is\u2014it\u2019s brilliant.",

But as an outsider, I really enjoyed the series and found it informative. \n\nI am from the Philippines, and we don't have a lot of black people here. The only black people I've met were in the capital (Manila) when I was in college and even then they were pretty rare. My only black friend was a Nigerian foreign student. Because of this Filipinos (and many Asians) often lack an understanding of the nuances of African-American culture and issues. \n\nI really appreciated the show because I found it funny and easy to watch, and the delivery style was very creative and engaging. The shift from the teenage storyline to his own modern commentary was new and refreshing. I understand that some Americans may find some parts \"cringe\" and some parts I feel were meant to be that way, but I think maybe they need to reflect deeper on why it made them feel embarrassed. The reference to slavery early on in the first episode was explained well, and if you listened well, you see that he had valid points based on his lived experience.\n\nP.S. I didn't know who he was and I don't follow any sports shows, so absolutely no idea who he was.",

Of course they did, they were all tired and pissed that she\u2019d kept them there so long. Only one person gave her a smile. That was the moment I put my money on the person.\n\nI waited for this to be part of the big reveal, but it never came!! \n\nAnyone else pick up on that too?",

I just wasn\u2019t sure which, but I kept watching.  \n\nMidway through episode 4 it hit me that I was watching something closer to a play than a tv show.  A play with four acts.  Each act presented in one take.  And I decided it\u2019s brilliant.  Not for everyone, but the end of episode 4 clinched it for me.  ",
