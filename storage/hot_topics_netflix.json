I love that (it seems at least) she has not done any fillers, botox, or other procedures. I love that she can be fully expressive, she can fully emote, and be comfortable as a woman who is growing and aging. No shade to actresses who do get cosmetic work, the pressure to look young and beautiful all the time must be immense. I was wondering if you noticed how expressive she is as Aggie Wiggs, and if you too felt it refreshing to see a woman in all of her glory take space with her aging face in this show.",

By chance, I accidentally started playing the game first, and then I decided to check out the series (I also ordered the book). I became an overnight huge fan of this genre, as well as the entire saga surrounding this series. I watched the first three seasons very quickly, and I finished the last one yesterday. I read that there was a change in the main actor, and my expectations for the series didn't change. To be honest, the first three seasons had me glued to my seat, while the last season, in my opinion, wasn't anything special (I hope no one takes offense, that's just my opinion). I have the impression that the series has gone in a different direction, and if it continues to be made, it might not be at a very good, strong level in terms of the story itself!",
