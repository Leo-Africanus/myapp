Any recommendations for shows that are comforting and uplifting that can be binged?\n\nScripted shows I\u2019ve watched in the past i liked enough to actually finish the whole series (this is a big deal for me if it\u2019s not a reality show):\n\n- Schitt\u2019s Creek** (Fav)\n- Dead to Me** (fav\u2026 until the sad end)\n- New Girl\n- The Office \n- Gilmore Girls \n- probably forgetting some but maybe these help give guidance?

I grew up in a 50% Jewish community and you get sick of this dishrag very quickly. It's even lower hanging fruit than Seinfeld.\n\nIt is very disappointing, given how original and nuanced BJH was.

The film\u2019s strength lies in its authenticity; every laugh, heartbreak, and quiet moment feels genuine, drawing you into their world. It serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting and impactful those youthful adventures can be.\n\nI really miss road movies like this, where a group of friends embarks on a journey to discover something meaningful.\n\nWhat did you think about this movie?

It makes me think about it, are our systems really that vulnerable nowadays that something like this can just happen to anyone?
