I don\u2019t know how popular the shows were when they first aired, but Suits was in the Netflix top 10 for weeks and I just happened to see White Collar one day while scrolling through shows. ",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I need to vent about something wild that just happened. I went to fire up Netflix on my TV last night, only to see my account was signed out. Weird, right? I figured it was a glitch, so I tried logging back in\u2014bam, denied. Okay, no biggie, I\u2019ll reset my password. Except when I tried, Netflix hit me with \u201cno account exists\u201d for my email. This is an account I\u2019ve had for over five years.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh great, I\u2019ve been hacked.\u201d So I call Netflix support to sort it out. I\u2019m assuming five years of payment history tied to my card, watch history, all that jazz would make it obvious I\u2019m the real owner. The rep I talked to was nice enough\u2014she even admitted she could see the new email on the account looked fraudulent (some random string of letters and numbers). But then she drops the bomb: there\u2019s nothing she can do. Apparently, because the email got changed, I\u2019m locked out for good unless I want the whole account wiped. Years of watchlists, recommendations, and profiles? Gone.\n\nLuckily, my Netflix password was unique, so this won\u2019t spiral into other accounts getting compromised. Still, it stings to lose it like that. I\u2019m just baffled they couldn\u2019t verify me with all the data they have\u2014payment records, IP addresses, something! The only option they gave was to nuke the account and start fresh. I get that security protocols exist for a reason, but this feels like punishing the victim instead of the hacker.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did I miss some secret way to reclaim it? Or am I just stuck rebuilding my Netflix life from scratch?",

It's cheesy, full of generic-sounding fluff/filler dialogue to get that pesky exposition out of the way, full of what stinks like recycled \"witty\" dialogue, almost like a disney channel kid's TV sitcom, except its a fully serious movie. I'm genuinely curious. \n\nDid anyone else watch it? I've long since clicked off, but let me know if this is the vibe you got. It says it came out 2025, so at this point I am fully willing to believe they sent an idea into Chatgpt and gave the actors the cheesiest, most generic-sounding lines ever known.
