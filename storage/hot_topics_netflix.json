It had me laughing, crying, and just feeling all the feels.\n\nSerious credit to the actors, producers, and screenwriters for real.

Garfield was a Civil War hero and a abolitionist, and he didn't initially want his parties nomination, and is considered one of the last 'log cabin' Presidents, because he like Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Guiteau had hidden the gun in his pocket and the police only found it after taking him to the police station, and the first metal detector was used on Garfield. Guiteau's brain was actually studied, and its thought that his actions may have been due to syphilis, though of course in the 1880s medical tests like that were very unreliable. And Chester Arthur passed a lot of Garfield's corruption reforms. The score was great, made by the same composer that did Game of Thrones and Iron Man. I also thought they nailed Michael Shannon's look, his beard looks very similar to Garfield's pictures. Betty Gilpin's performance was so convincing.",

She also offers no color commentary or anything interesting besides her plasticy faces she makes. It seems the only reason she got the job was because shes semi known by people and considered pretty.\n\nThe blonde judge seems to want to funk the contestant Sidney the whole time in a weird way\u2026 on top of that, he was saved in a situation where he shoulda been chosen to leave over a more capable chef. Then in another challenge for the bottom 3, the judges chose something that he was very good at as he exclaimed proudly that he started off his careeer doing just that for many years\u2026 which they all had to know! I feel like this was planned to purposely save him. \n\nCarla should have been booted a while back for not listening to feedback from the overseer chefs like 3 different times. \n\nWhen they chose Courtney to be head chef in brigade challenge, she clearly didnt kno what the fucc to do. Yet they didnt put her on the chopping block.\n\nNikki is lowkey hot af. When she is wearing jus her tanktop for in between shot interviews, holy crap she looks like a pornstar.\n\nThe clear standout in this entire show is Andrew. He is leagues beyond any of the contestants. \n\nIlke always seems like the bottom contestant but always surprises everyone. ",

I thought to myself 'finally, an accurate depiction of the book!'\n\nNope.\n\nThe book is not even that long and I saw a very accurate depiction in a graphic novel so there's no excuse in terms of time constraint. In fact, they could've accurately depicted the book in less time than the time they took to produce the version they did.\n\nThe only true thing they didn't get wrong was that the monster was very large, athletic and intelligent. However, he wasn't wolverine and didn't have the ability to heal himself.\n\nThere was no old dude that was his friend and taught him everything. He watched a family from a barn for a long time and learned to be human that way. When he revealed himself to them to be 'a part of their family' they all screamed and he ran off.\n\nThey dragged the romance between Elizabeth and Victor and the monster far too long. In actuality Elizabeth was Victor's adopted sister that he ends up marrying and she is killed by the monster in the middle of the night after their wedding as seen by no one except Victor himself. He actually did agree to make him a companion but had a change of heart and destroyed it which made the monster get revenge, 'a bride for a bride'.\n\nThey also never 'made up' at the end... Victor Frankenstein hated the creature until his dying breath and the creature self immolated at the end of the book. There was no happy ending.\n\nThe actual events, far more cool and interesting, could have been made into an accurate movie and been shorter than the shit they made.",
