Either have a rule that all first seasons have a closed story arc or give shows time to build viewership.\n\nGood example - dead boy detectives = I'm devastated there's no season 2, but it was a closed arc, all major ploy points resolved and I don't feel that netflix stole 8 hours of my life.\n\nBad example - the midnight club, or a whole bunch of others that I had on a watch list and then removed when I found out they were cancelled but left on a cliff hanger. I have no incentive to watch them now. \n\nAt least where there is a closed arc, I may still go and watch a cancelled show.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

I\u2019ve tried logging out and back in, restarting my device, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but nothing seems to fix it. It happens across multiple devices, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem with just one. Has anyone experienced this, or does anyone know what\u2019s causing it and how to fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated \u2013 I just want to be able to watch my shows again! Thanks in advance!",

I remember him with brown hair and kind of looked like the actor who plays Kronk? He was friends or became friends with this other middle age man with blonde hair (I see his face so vividly but do NOT know where he\u2019s from). \nI\u2019m pretty sure the \u201cfriend\u201d the detective made was actually the father or step father of this girl who was killed by the serial killer. There\u2019s a plot twist at the end that I don\u2019t want to say, but the show was so damn good. \nI think they took it off Netflix, I can\u2019t find it. I think the title was like one word?

As well as the excellent new show Territory was only 6 eps. I was also looking ahead and 2 shows I'm insanely excited for Black Doves and American Primevil are also going to be only 6 eps. It's insane that every few years it feels like they push the ep count lower. Which is extra crazy because they count shows on minutes watched which basically sets new shows up to fail and is the reason we have no new shows.",

Just to rule out network issues on my side, I upgraded to a 750 Mbps plan and receive a steady 940 Mbps via Ethernet, so speed limitations aren't a factor here.\n\nDoes anyone else see the same with *Alita* or other Netflix titles? If you have access to Netflix's \"Stats for Nerds\" menu, it'd be interesting to compare results!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3anw95aatm0e1.png?width=1938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2708dc9676d68a801737675e500530b44f344b14",

It was presented as simultaneously menacing and titillating, and it was rather drawn out. &gt;!The character is ultimately rescued before anything really happens so it was okay, but still. There's a giant metal phallus brandished with the promise to hurt and ultimately kill her with it while she's strapped to a table in her underwear - it's really triggering.!&lt;\n\nI need to know if this is a theme that's going to keep recurring, and how bad it gets. If you can give me an idea while minimizing spoilers, that would be great. Like\u00a0*many*\u00a0people, I have SA in my background. My love for good animation is strong, but not enough to retraumatize myself.\n\nEven if the answer is \"Yes it comes up repeatedly, but only in X number of episodes, and no one\u00a0*actually*\u00a0gets sexually assaulted\" I can handle it.

There was a between time when Netflix made great shows before it gave in to reality slop and it still has access to shows from other sources. \n\nBut these days I turn on Netflix, do the equivalent of a channel surf, and then leave without watching anything. This is exactly what happened with HBO /Max before we cancelled it. I'm thinking about taking this staple service and putting it on the rotation of on for a month off for 11.\n\nI have no interest in reality, sitcom, or live programming. \n\nWhat does my family like? Witty, adventure, and scifi/fantasy. We're up for a good procedural cop story too - but we'd be in it for the characters/mystery and not have much interest in gore/horror.\n\nMy wife and I just started big door prize and just finished severance on Apple tv. These both look like they were probably low budget (no special effects dominating the screen), though maybe the talent cost some money. The thing that really marks these shows as interesting is that they have good solid writing and story telling chops.\n\nOutside of stranger things, Netflix doesn't appear to know how to pick shows that are what most of us would call good. (Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to finance the man who ruined the DC universe?) At this point it appears to be a strategy and that I'm simply not in the target market. If this is wrong, well here's one anecdote from one guy who can't care anymore and certainly can't justify the recurring payment anymore. 5 episodes every 3 months isn't enough.\n\nYou're not pulling your weight anymore.
