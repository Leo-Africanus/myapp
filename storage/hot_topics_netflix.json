It's been around for a few years.\nLoudermilk is an addiction counselor with a motley crew of devotees that attend his regular meetings in a catholic church.\n\nThe cast are mostly men, and there are some gross moments (doll episode).\n\nAnja Savcic is the only regular woman casted. They manage her presence nicely without being overly sexual, which I can appreciate. \n\nThe show also mingles comedy with hard topics such as living with disabilities, misogyny, and failure really well. \n\nI've rewatched it several times, especially when winding down at night or if there's nothing else to watch (skipping the doll episode). \n\nAnyone else find this show oddly comforting?

Not even the gorgeous soundtrack the series boasts and brilliant editing could save the two from being borderline unwatchable.\n\nI hope the Way brothers direct more episodes in the future because they are some of the most talented and exciting filmmakers at the moment.  \n\nJust a personal opinion of course",

I felt such a void watching all 10 of them.\nThe Red Hot Chilli Peppers, amazing animation... But it's not even close to being my favorite band and what I am watching is just another video of song. The cat episode and the alien episode made me appreciate 3 robots and The Drowned Giant so much more. Night of the Mini Dead is fun and hilarious but Close Encounters in season 4 feels like fanfic. \nCompare How Zeke got Religion to The Secret War, or Shape Shifters to Spider Rose or The Screaming Tyrannosaur. \n\nAm I the only one who feels that Netflix exploits the popularity of a show all the way to oblivion?

This is despite the fact that my system and display support much higher quality \u2014 I\u2019m using a **1600p OLED** panel with a **240Hz refresh rate** and **Dolby Vision** support.\n\nJust so you know, my system has an **RTX 4070** GPU and an **Intel Core Ultra 9 185H** processor, and I\u2019m on the **Netflix Premium plan** that supports **Ultra HD playback**.\n\nInterestingly, on **Google Chrome**, the bitrate can reach up to **18,000 kbps** (18 Mbps) and **4K resolution**, even though Chrome itself is capped at 1080p in some cases. Still, the quality and bitrate are noticeably better on Chrome.\n\nHowever, I prefer using Microsoft Edge because **Chrome doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision**, and I\u2019d like to take advantage of that feature while still getting the best possible bitrate and resolution.\n\nCould you help me figure out why Edge is limiting the quality and how I can unlock higher bitrate and resolution when streaming?\n\nThank you in advance!",

He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

People should be able to use their profile if a family member is paying for the subscription, and I know I\u2019d let my family use their profiles on my account too if that were the case. I\u2019ve seen people who move for military reasons complain, and I am in college out of state so it\u2019s super frustrating to be kicked out of my family\u2019s subscription.\n\nIt\u2019s such an egregious cash grab as well as a petty attempt to discourage password sharing that affects people who aren\u2019t even doing so that unfairly (ie children on their parents\u2019 subscription). It\u2019s a genius business decision and you almost have to give it to em\u2014forcing people into paying for more individual plans just so they can watch makes Netflix wayyy more money\u2014but it\u2019s just sooooo frustrating. Anyone else?? I just had to rant \ud83d\ude2d",

        "content": "(I'm just four episodes in so NO SPOILERS PLEASE.)\n\nI'll admit I slept in this one too. It only turned up because I looked up _Blood of Zeus_ (stupid, cringey show) and I suppose the name sounds vaguely mythological?\n\nBut it's really well written sci-fi with great voice acting. Just two episodes in and I'm hooked. It's still blowing my mind that I've never heard of it so I think 'heavily underrated' fits here. \n\nEdit: Really hoping the quality doesn't decline but so far so good!\n\n",
