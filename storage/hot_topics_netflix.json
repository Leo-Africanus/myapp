        "content": "This started as a reply to a comment, but after seeing so many threads blaming the \u201cpermissive\u201d parents or portraying Susan as a harassed senior defending her turf, I had to make it a post. The doc shows Susan\u2019s actions were calculated, not reactive self-defense. \n\nI get the parental angle, I\u2019d be extra vigilant too and would keep my kids away from someone like Susan with her cursing, petty aggressions and escalating beef. You never know what people are capable of so you should trust your instincts, but blaming the parents overlooks Susan\u2019s premeditation.\n\nSusan told AJ\u2019s kid to fetch his mom (knowing it\u2019d bring AJ over), called 911 then shot AJ unarmed in under two minutes. Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground might cover perceived threats on your property, but why not wait for cops? Lock the door? Retreat inside? Aim non-lethally? The body cams, timelines and forensics scream intent, not fear.\n\nShe escalated from verbal abuse to physical by throwing skates and swinging umbrellas at AJ\u2019s kid to provoke AJ. That\u2019s baiting, not being \u201cfed up.\u201d Any parent would confront that. The trespassing and door-banging excuses ignore how Susan orchestrated it betting on the law to shield her.\n\nParents could\u2019ve chosen differently in hindsight, but Susan had clear alternatives to killing. Someone that determined would\u2019ve found a way regardless. \n\nAccountability\u2019s on her.",

        "content": "So the show really seemed to suggest that Salvatore Vinci was tge monster. He had no alibis for any of the murders, one of 11 guns like the one used in the murders sold in his region belonged to his family member and was unaccounted for, his first wife died suspiciously\u2026 What I\u2019m wondering is how much of his story that the series put forth was actually true/proven? Is there any public knowledge of his family/early life? Was he gay? Did he have a relationship with his first wife\u2019s brother? Did he have a relationship with Stafano? Did he tell Stafano he killed his first wife and did Stefano make a statement to police about that eventually? And then recant that at Salvatore\u2019s trial? Was he really married to someone who left him twice, each time lining up with a murder?\nThere seems to be a strong commentary about the homophobic, machismo, sexist culture at that place and time having fostered the misogyny of this psychopath. Almost like he learned from his father but also everything around him that he must dominate the women around him in order to be able to have relationships with men. As though women were such a threat to him that he hated them, murdered them and literally excised what made them female. The fact that his victims were  heterosexual couples having sex (except the one where they say one of the men was probably mistaken for a woman), further suggests that his motivation was borne of distain for a culture that accepted hetero sex and rejected gay sex. \nIt felt like a really strong assertion of that narrative to me but I wonder how much of it is actually true.",

        "title": "Unpopular opinion: Boots does not need a second season",
        "content": "All of their comments on socials are people asking for a second season, and the actors have been vocal about wanting one as well. But as much as I loved all of the characters and wouldn\u2019t be mad at seeing more things explored, I also feel like the show is already a complete story. Netflix has a tendency of milking things at the expense of quality, and I think we need to normalize leaving shows at one season and not dragging out projects just because we can. \n\nAs someone who was in the military, there\u2019s something really special about boot camp and I think that specific setting was very vital to the storyline. You\u2019re thrown into this new world, cross paths with all of these incredible people and DIs that completely change your life, and then you never see them again. Everyone gets separated for job training and then different assignments all over the world and moves on with their careers and lives. But there\u2019s something so special about it while you\u2019re there and it\u2019s a memory you look back on forever. I think the show does an amazing job at capturing that, and it\u2019s a complete story to me. \n\nIt would be really hard to keep the same characters when everybody would be in a different place. They would either need to find a new cast of people for wherever Cope ends up stationed or pan back and forth between all the current characters and their storylines. The GW storyline wouldn\u2019t really work because they have job training and wouldn\u2019t just get deployed straight to the conflict. \n\nSullivan ended up being dishonorably discharged (something he\u2019s not getting around) so although he was a great character it would be hard to make him work in the story when he\u2019s no longer a Marine. A lot of people didn\u2019t like his ending but I think it was a really good depiction of someone living through the DADT era, and how it can eat you alive. He suppressed himself to that extent and it ended up not even being worth it, because the anger from all that suppression caused him to get kicked out anyway. It\u2019s a complete arc, showing how damaging (and pretty ridiculous) these policies were and how they even caused the military to lose out on great soldiers. Perfect, model Marine with a silver star but ultimately gets kicked out just because he\u2019s gay.\n\nI know the memoir this is based on covers many more years of Cope\u2019s career beyond boot camp, so they could make it work if they wanted to. But I feel like it isn\u2019t necessary and don\u2019t really see it working without a significant dip in quality. There\u2019s nothing worse than amazing shows being cheapened by weaker and weaker follow up seasons. Reminds me of Squid Game which had no business having a second and third season, the director himself said it was only because he needed money lol.",

        "content": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m in the mood for some intense, edge-of-the-seat thriller movies on Netflix and could really use your suggestions. I love films that keep you guessing till the very end \u2014 with smart plots, psychological twists, or a touch of mystery. I\u2019ve already seen the big ones like Gone Girl, Prisoners, The Call, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I\u2019m hoping to discover some hidden gems or underrated thrillers that deserve more attention. I enjoy both slow-burn psychological thrillers and fast-paced crime mysteries \u2014 something gripping enough to binge in one sitting. If you know of any Netflix originals or international thrillers worth watching, drop them in the comments! Bonus points for unexpected endings or brilliant storytelling. What\u2019s the best thriller you\u2019ve seen lately that left you completely stunned? I\u2019d love to make a weekend watchlist!",

        "content": "They did it for the brothers, but I feel like it didn't really matter since people don't like rich people anyway so it had a bit of a White Lotus vibe to it.\n\nI think a good subject would be the case of Darrell Brooks, not for his stunts in the courtroom but rather exploring the lives of Erika Patterson and the Waukesha victims of the attack to show how these people lived their lives before Darrell Brooks drove through the Waukesha Christmas Parade in his mother's Ford Escape and killed 6 people.\n\nYou could take a look into underprivileged communities via red-lining, which was the main focus of the defense's claim during sentencing, as long as you emphasize that what Darrell Brooks did represented a heavy outlier in the community and that might have been caught sooner if not for the fact that most of it happened at the time when we were dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nI think it would be interesting to see how the Monster series handles the COVID-19 crisis, they could make a whole episode about just that. Maybe show a person dying of Covid in a prison cell, I don't know, maybe the *true* monster was Covid-19 all along.",
