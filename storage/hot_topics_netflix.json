        "title": "Just watched Thirteen on Netflix and it\u2019s one of the darkest movies I\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s not even horror",
        "content": "So I watched Thirteen on Netflix recently and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. It might be the darkest movie I\u2019ve ever watched and it\u2019s not even classified as horror. That\u2019s how heavy it is. It\u2019s disturbing because it\u2019s real. There\u2019s no supernatural force, no jump scares or anything like that. Just raw, spiraling human behavior, especially from young girls trying to find their place.\n\nWatching Tracy\u2019s downfall was infuriating. The way she gets pulled into Evie\u2019s world. It\u2019s such a gut-punch because deep down, you can see how much of it is her trying to find validation. It\u2019s not just rebellion for rebellion\u2019s sake. These are kids. They don\u2019t know right from wrong, they don\u2019t understand long-term consequences. They only know what\u2019s cool, what gets them attention, and what numbs the pain they\u2019re carrying.\n\nWhat made me the angriest was the parenting, or the lack of it. Tracy\u2019s mom just stood there so often. Blank-faced. Passive. She\u2019d watch her daughter scream at her, curse at her, break down in front of her and she\u2019d just exist there, like she didn\u2019t know how to act. She said at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s not how I raised you,\u201d which shows she had tried before, but once Tracy spiraled, it was like the mother was too scared or emotionally paralyzed to intervene. And the father? Barely even there. Useless.\n\nThere\u2019s also this eerie transformation that happens with Tracy. At the beginning, she\u2019s just this sweet, insecure girl. But by the end? Her face, her body language \u2026. it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a completely different person. There\u2019s a moment where she doesn\u2019t even look human anymore. Her pain and trauma show up physically on her face. She looked evil. Terrifying, even.\n\nAnd Evie,  I have a lot of thoughts. She\u2019s manipulative, yes, but also clearly broken herself. And somehow, she hides it behind that innocent, \u201ccute\u201d look. But she absolutely destroyed Tracy's life and enabled everything terrible that happened.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an easy watch. In fact, it was painful to sit through. But it\u2019s one of those movies that sticks with you. It\u2019s a reminder that adolescence is fragile, and if adults around don\u2019t step in, don\u2019t really parent, then kids are going to fall into dangerous hands.",

        "content": "I honestly blame TikTok's hype culture for how movies are turning out these days. One of my favorite genres has always been romcoms, but over the years, the quality has noticeably dropped. If you look back, there are so many classic romcoms that still hold up BECAUSE that was the standard for the genre back in the day. Nowadays, it feels like movies are being made with specific actors or tropes just so they can get the TikTok treatment. People know some influencer is going to make a reaction video with exaggerated expressions and fake gasps to hype it up. So they continue spitting out shitty films because this group is so easy to satiate. I see the same exact thing happening with books. Anyone can become a writer these days. All it takes is a few edits and slideshows. \n\nA perfect example of this is My Oxford Year that came out recently. Honestly, that movie was a mess. Sofia Carson's acting was so cringey that I had to pause the film. Yet, all over TikTok, I keep seeing posts about how \u201camazing\u201d it was and how people \u201ccried so much.\u201d I couldn't even muster up any emotional response because the film felt rushed, and the acting was just... not it. I just miss the days when movies were good BECAUSE they were good, not because they were trending on a platform. Thankfully, I was never really one to watch movies or shows when I was younger so there\u2019s tons of classics I haven\u2019t watched. It\u2019s just bothersome that I never see criticism for these terrible movies. ",

Before we got to the big reveal (those who watched it know what I\u2019m talking about), the movie was a hard watch. \n\nEvery single scene she had the same exact facial expression and you know when you\u2019re watching a movie and you can clearly see that a person is acting? That\u2019s exactly what she felt like. \n\nEvery single moment her facial expression was seductive and flirty, literally every second she talked. There\u2019s a scene where she\u2019s asking how someone died and her face looks exactly the same as when she was flirting with the love interest. Like what. It\u2019s like she\u2019s always trying to keep herself pretty, if that makes sense. But this is not an ad or a beauty campaign. A good movie doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re watching a movie, but this was the exact opposite whenever Sofia was on screen. \n\nAlso she made zero effort to have any sort of chemistry with Corey. You could see in his eyes, the passion and the longing, but nothing from her. \n\nThe movie is honestly pretty good but Sofia Carson\u2019s acting really ruined it for me. ",

The part where she said she had a library fetish and the faces she was making when saying professor\u2026..I paused the movie several times because of her. I also noticed she acts the same in every movie? I\u2019m so upset because people made it seem like the book was actually good. The movie was just rushed honestly would\u2019ve made more sense to put it in a show. Though im not sure I could sit through an entire series with Sofia\u2026. ",

I've had it closing Opera before and now realise it's because I had a Netflix tab at the top",

        "content": "As the title suggests. \n\nI recently moved cities due to university, but I used to visit home almost every other week. However, a few months ago, I stopped doing that and switched to visiting home every month, primarily due to work. Unfortunately, this time around, I was away for so long that I was greeted with the dreaded \u201eYour device isn\u2019t part of the Netflix Household for this account\u201c screen.\n\nThis made me realize, that should I decide to keep up this habit of mine, I would have to pay for a new subscription because all extra members are already added and temporary access is limited to 14 consecutive days. If that wasn't enough, Netflix doesn\u2019t offer any other options for people who live outside the household but still rely on the family household, like a student plan of some sorts.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder then, how is this system supposed to make sense? Do they genuinely expect two extra members to be enough for larger families? Like seriously. Let\u2019s ignore the cost of the premium plan plus two extra members for a moment and focus on the practical implications. What if three kids move out and go to different places? Which one will have to live without Netflix? Or what if you already added both grandparents (maternal and paternal sides) to the account and then got a kid or more moving out? There isn't an option for a plan for people with no consistent household. And these are not unrealistic scenarios either.\n\nDo they expect everyone who no longer lives in the household to pay for their excessively expensive and, let\u2019s be honest, recently disappointing service all alone when the original plan is already full? Even if people are willing to pay, everyone ends up paying more than they should.\n\nWhere is the student plan you can find at almost every other service provider? Why are we limited to only two extra members? Why are we getting more and more limited on what we can and cannot do with our accounts, yet being charged more?\n\nI'm sick and tired of anti-consumer practices. Something needs to be done.",

I am so fucking tired of this network, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s become. A money seeking vacuum of culture. \n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing that at 15 I campaigned to my parents to start funding what I thought was a progressive company with an interest in changing the narrative. How pathetic.\n\nMy candid thoughts. Thanks for reading. \n\n",
