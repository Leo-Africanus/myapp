Totally not what I was trying to do. \n\nSame thing happened picking the Panasonic TV as the target. Obviously I don\u2019t want to sign in my account on someone elses device, and that\u2019s not the way casting works for, say, Amazon Prime Video. \n\nSo is this not a thing? Is the casting only to an existing logged in Netflix account?\n\n(Edit: just adding I tried netflix support chat and they had me verifying the chromecast was on the same network, despite me telling them Amazon Prime streamed fine. Then trying to tell me how to log in. Seemed more like an AI chatbot so I gave up)",

The first one was slow to get through, granted, but by the end it was easily one of my favorite horror/suspense shows. CANCELLED.

The thing is, whatever I do, there is no HDR on my PC with Windows 11 Pro. It is only working on my TV.\n\nI have already contacted Netflix support 3 times with no luck, no one was even close to help. Believe me I have already tried what I could. I installed the HEVC video extensions from the Microsoft store, I have tried with several browsers like Edge, Opera, Firefox and of course Chrome. The weird thing is that it was working on Chrome then it stopped there too and I can't make it work again. There's just no HDR indicator anywhere.\n\nI have disabled and enabled the GPU hardware acceliration several times with no luck. I have enabled forced HDR in Edge and it is still not working. I have Auto HDR enabled on Windows and still doesn't make a difference. I am using HDMI 2.1 cable if that matters with a RX 7900 XT if that matters. I have even tried with DP and it is still not working.\n\nI am using HDR in games and Youtube content all the time so I know it is working, it is not wokring only on Netflix. I have installed the Desktop App too and it is not workinig there too. I have set the playback settings quality to \"High - Best video and audo quality etc\". \n\nSo I was just wondering if there is anything else I could try before downgrading my plan. Any advice would be of help, thanks!",
