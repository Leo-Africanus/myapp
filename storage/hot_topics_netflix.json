Then, they described the recording devices she had set up. \n\nThe fact that the worst example of his 'abuse' that they shared from the recordings was that argument over the dinner sealed the deal for me. That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

But what really convinced me was later it they said Mollys parents were aware of the \u201cdomestic abuse\u201d and that her mom gave the children specific safe words and her phone number and had the children hide it because Mollys Mom believed he was that dangerous. There is NO WAY you would roll over and go back to sleep in that situation. She would have been awake and 911 called or ready to be called. ",

I went to the support website &amp; followed all of the suggestions from closing all Netflix tabs &amp; restarting my browser &amp; my PC. I've also cleared all cookies &amp; checked if my PC needed any updates. I lastly contacted support directly both yesterday &amp; today after waiting 24hrs as they suggested without any improvements. :( The issue only seems to be on PC, it works perfectly on my TV &amp; phone.  \n  \nI think sometime yesterday I might've left my gaming controller on my keyboard, and it could've possibly spam refreshed the netflix website. I'm not sure if this could be related to the issue.  \nBy chance does anyone have any suggestions? Is this a temporary ban or permanent ban? Thank you",

        "title": "Problems and plot holes in 1899 (Netflix)",
        "content": "Just finished\u00a0 1899\u00a0and loved the atmosphere, but the more I think about it, the more the plot holes and unresolved mysteries bother me. Here\u2019s my breakdown of the biggest issues\u2014let me know what I missed or if you have theories!\n\n# 1. The Simulation Twist Undermines Everything\n\nThe big reveal that it\u2019s all a simulation (or layers of them) makes emotional moments feel weightless. If nothing\u2019s \"real,\" why should we care about character deaths or trauma? Even worse, the rules of the simulation are never clear\u2014why do the black crystals, memory bugs, or the Prometheus ship behave so inconsistently?\n\n# 2. Character Backstories Go Nowhere\n\n1899\u00a0set up really interesting character stories but then forgot about them. The French couple Clemence and Lucien had a troubled marriage with hints of cheating or maybe an abortion, but none of it went anywhere. The French lady who seemed to be forcing Ling Yi into prostitution just disappeared from the story. Ling Yi and her mom did something horrible - they killed another girl to steal her identity - but the show never explained why this mattered. They also hinted Ling Yi might be pregnant, then dropped it completely.\n\nThe little girl Ada died suddenly for no clear reason. Krester's story about his scar and being gay started strong but went nowhere. Why did so many people jump off the ship? Was the simulation breaking? Miguel, the stowaway, had strange visions and a connection to the boy Elliot, but we never learned his backstory. Angel and Ramiro's secret about Ramiro killing a priest to pretend to be him also didn't lead anywhere.\n\nIt's frustrating because all these stories felt important at first, but in the end, none of them really mattered or got explained. The show made us care about these characters, then left us hanging.\n\n# 3. The Pyramid, the Black Goo, and Elliot\u2019s Role\n\n* The\u00a0black pyramid/archive\u00a0is treated as a big deal, but we never learn what it actually\u00a0*does*.\n* The\u00a0black substance\u00a0spreads like a virus, but is it code? A metaphor? Who knows.\n* Elliot\u00a0exists as a child in the simulation, but why? Is he a glitch, a memory, or a failsafe?\n\n# 4. The Ending Creates More Confusion\n\nMaura wakes up in\u00a02099\u00a0on a spaceship, implying the 1899 simulation was just one layer. But:\n\n* Why is\u00a0Ciaran\u00a0suddenly in control?\n* Are the other passengers real people or AI?\n* If this is \"reality,\" how does it connect to the 1899 simulation?\n\n# 5. Cancellation Left Us Hanging\n\nNetflix axed the show after one season, so we\u2019ll\u00a0*never*\u00a0get answers about Ciaran, the spaceship, or whether any of it mattered. The creators (*Dark*\u00a0fans know this pain) love complex mysteries, but without payoff, it feels like wasted potential.\n\n# Was It All Just a Video Game?\n\nSome theories suggest\u00a0 1899\u00a0is a\u00a0psychological experiment\u00a0or a\u00a0*Matrix*\\-style VR game, but with no S2, we\u2019re left guessing.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014did the plotholes ruin it for you, or was the ride worth it?",

I am two episodes in on what I think is a British tv series about girl who goes to a sleepover and when the parents go to pick her up the house is empty and a cleaning woman tells the parents it's an empty vacation rental. I've tried searching several times and I can't find it and it's not in my \"continue watching\" Only one episode released every week. Anyone know what it is? ",

It\u2019s like the TV Show version of playing the board game murder mystery. So entertaining to watch with your friends on a pizza night lol",

I even had to watch it dubbed into English from Spanish because I am having some eye issues at the moment, and I thought the dub was much more natural than usual.  I;m sure there will be \"experts\" who decry plot holes and the like, but I thought it was overall put together very well as far as the mystery.",
