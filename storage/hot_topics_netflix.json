The way they gather people\u2019s data, hack accounts, clone phones it\u2019s way too realistic.  \n  \nNow I\u2019m just sitting here thinking about how much of my info is floating around considering I've had the same phone number and email for years, signed up for hundreds of sites probably and no clue where half that data ended up. You hear of data breaches as well and it feels like anyone with enough motivation could piece together my whole life.  \n  \nLowkey freaking out about it lol.",

With these half season releases I\u2019m just going to wait until the full season is out and avoid discussions of the first half as best I can, which I think defeats their goal of trying to make series be in the spotlight longer. Either way, between this and their show cancellation decisions, it seems like Netflix figures out the worst thing they could do and then do that thing. ",
