        "content": "So recently, there's been a massive misconception being spread. Netflix released a post saying how season 3 was the \"final\" season of Alice in Borderland. Somehow, people saw this and immediately started spreading online \"the show's been cancelled\" or whatever.\n\nSeason 3 was ALWAYS marketed as the final season. Its not the show being cancelled, it reached its natural conclusion. Hell, season 2 alone was a perfect ending and even though season 3 was flawed and unecessary, I still thought the ending itself was good. This is one of the better places to \"cancel\" a show if anything.\n\n\"But there was the teaser at the end\" yeah, which at MOST was hinting towards a US spin-off or at the least, that the games were continuing across the world as the Watchman warned Arisu. Season 3 made MORE views than season 1, its foolish to assume the mixed reception got the series \"cancelled\".",

        "content": "I recently contacted Netflix to ask why there are quite a few titles I cannot block on parental controls. I spoke to a Netflix customer service person who asked me to do a lot of resets extra on all my devices.I kept explaining that many of the titles did in fact block without problem and the issue was not my end, but rather Netflix\u2019s. Still, I spent almost an hour doing resets, etc. In the end, he told me to just tell my kid he couldn\u2019t watch specific titles (clearly not a parent himself!) He said he\u2019d referred the issue, so I asked for a reference to our call so I could check on the progress. He said that\u2019s not something they do. He said to just keep checking if the title had been added to the remove list. I have done this - still nothing. I really don\u2019t want to waste another hour of my life to a rude Netflix customer service dude, so do any of you have any idea how to chase this? There are many titles that can\u2019t be blocked under parental controls - shows that are within the age limits. I\u2019m an early years educator, so maybe I\u2019m taking this issue more seriously than I need to, but some of the shows they\u2019ve added on there for young children are absolute cesspools for developing brains. Not nearly as bad as Amazon kids, but still not great. So the powers to block these titles is pretty important I feel. I promise I\u2019m not normally this neurotic, but I can\u2019t face another fight with my six year old, after a long day of working with other people\u2019s kids, over why he can\u2019t watch Catch!

        "content": "Attention: spoilers ahead.\n\nAm I the only one who found this movie completely unrealistic? I honestly have no idea how they managed to convince keira knightley to sign on to this story.\n\nFrom the very moment the woman expressed her desire for giving away all her money for charity, it was obvious her husband was going to kill her. Beyond that predictability, the entire plot felt absurdly implausible.\n\nEven if we assume a billionaire could somehow use facial recognition to find a woman who looks exactly like his wife, the execution still makes no sense. Maybe he could have staged a distant public appearance to deceive people but having her pass as his wife up close, in broad daylight, on a boat, surrounded by her friends? Completely unbelievable. Let alone that she just shaved her hair and put on some make-up by herself instead of having a professional MUA do it. And how is a poor Polish woman suddenly able to speak flawless British English and perfectly imitate another person\u2019s voice? That alone defies logic.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ridiculous idea of having her impersonate the wife to sign a contract. A contract involving an inheritance of that magnitude would absolutely require handwriting verification something that\u2019s standard practice. The whole plot feels like it was written by a teenager with no understanding of how the real world works.\n\nExtra minus points for the way women are portrayed as hysterical and foolish in situations like this. An award-winning journalist, in particular, would not react so irrationally upon realizing something deeply suspicious is happening, nor would she make herself such an obvious target.",

        "content": "The first thing that really impressed me after watching Guillermo del Toro\u2019s *Frankenstein* was Oscar Isaac\u2019s performance. He\u2019s had a very strong run overall, and as someone who\u2019s not a fan of Marvel or *Star Wars*, I\u2019ve never really seen him as a commercially pushed leading man \u2014 but absolutely as a serious actor dedicated to his craft.\n\nSince *Inside Llewyn Davis*, *Ex Machina*, *Dune*, and now this year, I honestly think the snub was huge.\n\nI didn\u2019t like *Sinners* at all. To me it felt like a copycat film, full of agendas and with pretty weak performances overall. Seeing Michael B. Jordan nominated was genuinely confusing.\n\nI love Leo, but his role in *OBAA* just wasn\u2019t his best. He did what he always does \u2014 solid, professional, even funny at times \u2014 but **leading actor**? The film focused far more on his wife, Sean Penn, and his daughter for like two-thirds of the runtime.\n\nAnd Teyana Taylor being nominated as well? Seriously? At this point, why not nominate Junglepussy too. Benicio getting nominated for what felt like 7 minutes of screen time in a very minimalistic role also made me raise an eyebrow. I can definitely see where that $140 million budget went.\n\nSo yeah \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much it. The Academy had **partial merit** this year, in my opinion, but Oscar Isaac being left out really didn\u2019t sit right with me.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve watched both episodes so far and really enjoy it! Huge props to the contestants I\u2019m so nervous for them. The only part I find confusing is how they calculate them down to 1 decimal place. For example: Chrissy 5, Jelly Roll 5, Sarah 4, World 3.7 for a final of 4.2 stars. Huh? Next one is Chrissy 5, Jelly Roll 5, Sarah 4, World 4 for a final of 4.3 stars.\n\nI\u2019m not good math but this makes no sense to me mathematically.. anyone else get it? \ud83d\ude44",

Or should I go watch No Tail to Tell first? \n\nIt\u2019s hard cause I am busy at work and can only afford to watch one ongoing series and wait weekly for new episodes and I would probably watch the other eventually",
