I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

She\u2019s deadpan the entire time, shows little depth, and it\u2019s hard to connect with her emotionally. She mostly just snaps at others and loves birds. She\u2019s essentially the main character of the show and is just boring, bland, and rude the entire time. The trailer made her seem almost goofy, which would have been great. If she was goofy and ditsy but also a brilliant genius detective. But that is not at all how she is portrayed in the show. \n\nThe storyline drags from episode to episode without much happening. I got a few laughs\u2014Harry Hollins was funny early on\u2014but overall it just feels bland, and I\u2019m losing interest fast. Watching the show feels like a chore at this point. \n\nThat said, the White House set is incredible. Huge credit to the production team on that. Just mind blowing on the amount of work that must have taken.\n\nIf you\u2019re into this type of show, The Afterparty on Apple TV is a way better execution of the concept. It\u2019s funnier, better written, and the storytelling is on another level. Highly recommend. Two seasons and both impossible not to binge through. ",

Any ideas? Thanks\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for sharing your experiences with this issue and suggesting fixes. I think I figured it out eventually when I found out that signing in via smart tv seems to be what activates the household thingy. Our smart tv is connected to a different WiFi network, so that would explain why Netflix now is not accepting my devices as part of the household. I'll switch them to the same WiFi network as the tv and that should fix it I believe",
