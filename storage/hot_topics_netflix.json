Easily among my favorite movies of the year and both George as Jay Kelly and Adam Sandler as his manager Ron were absolutely brilliant in it.  Clooney was tailor made for Kelly and I don\u2019t think anyone else could have played him as brilliantly as he did.  The movie itself is such a fun rollercoaster ride of emotions and depth that nearly brought me to tears towards the ending.  I think partially cause of how many of my own memories are tied to movies throughout the years and how film and/or movies were a big part of mine and my Dad\u2019s (R.I.P. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc) relationship over the years prior to his unfortunate passing a little over 5 1/2 years ago.  Without giving away too many spoilers, if any, for those who have not watched it yet.  What are people who have seen its thoughts on the movie and what did you like or not like about it?",

Is there not a judge present or a team of judges that gets to decide the final verdict?\n\nI find the two jurors in the episode don\u2019t seem that smart and like they could easily be coerced/ that their subjective values played a huge role in their decision. I always thought that the foundation of a solid legal system is that we have highly intelligent professionals who have been trained and educated for years, who chose to dedicate their lives to upholding the law, and have gone through a rigorous process to become a judge, making important decisions over people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m quite shocked by the idea of just choosing random people from the general population, to make decisions like this..\n\nBut maybe someone can explain more about the legal side of how the jury system works and why it is in place in the US.",

Shows like Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, The Crown, Stranger Things, etc. Or, more recent films like Jay Kelly, Train Dreams etc. Then there are also a lot of shows that are aired on other streaming platforms or networks but are labelled as \"Netflix Originals\" in other countries (like Riverdale etc). \n\nI just like to watch more Netflix originals (movies + shows) that are really by them. There are a lot of movies released on Netflix almost weekly and I'd just want to make it easier to search. Thank you!",

        "content": "I assume everybody here is aware of the release of the new season of \"Stranger Things\", so I'm no different and decided to watch it as soon as someone told me about it.\n\nI'm not a big a fan of watching any kind of TV shows \u2014 at most I would watch a movie once a month and that's pretty much it. And the thing that got me really confused about this new season of Stranger Things is that it's not even the plot, or atmosphere that makes you binge watch it as soon as you finish 1st episode \u2014 it's the effects, cuts, timing and how it's put together that makes you want to watch it.\n\nLet me cllarify it for you: when you watch movies (or some TV shows too, like Better Call Saul) from 10-20 years ago like Matrix, Inception, Shutter island you just want to keep watching it because of how amazed you are by the plot and the twists are so unpredictable that you have these \"a-ha\" moments where you picture the whole image in your head with the wow effect.\n\nIn case with this new season though, the plot itself seemed okay to me, but while watching it I had a feeling that I'm watching tiktok lol. Just how fast-paced it seemed to me and the constant change of the enviroment, going back and forth between characters. As soon as you supposed to get bored and chill, produecer hits you with another dopamine hit to keep you engaged. So after watching first episode I turned it off as I knew where it was leading \u2014 watching it until 4 am.\n\nIf that't the case, it's not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 they are just evolving to attention span of its users and that's it.\n\n**Is it just my observation or there's somebody else who also felt that way? How do they make them so addictive to keep watching and what are the tricks that are using?**",
