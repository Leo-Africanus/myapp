That is not enjoyable to me/\n\nAnd Dune is not the only example of this.  John wick film series is also not complete. For example.\n\nSurely im not the only one with this frustration right? Sometimes i set something aside to watch later. Maybe a month goes by. Since live is busy. And... its gone. It really is now or never sometimes now with netflix. This isnt how it used to be. I have netflix since... 8 years ago? 9? And it was complete freedom of watching whatever you wanted whenever. Now it feels very limited. And having the part 2 movies and not part 1 being available. Is very frustrating. \n\nI get it. Licences and all that. But to be honest. As a consumer. I dont care about that. I care about having the freedom to watch whatever i want. Whenever i want. Binge watching some movies. Like i was planning this evening. I wanted to binge watch dune 1 and 2. Sadly not possible...\n\nAnyone else get this frustation? Any specific series you had this with?",

Such a great cast, and such a unique storyline. What I love even more is that I can feel the chemistry with the characters, Elijah Woods and Samuel Barnett together was something I didn't know I needed in life. Shame that it got cancelled. After s2 I really wanted to know what happened after especially my favorite characters Bert and Ken. But we have to move on. It's been almost a decade since it was cancelled, maybe if it's still possible even a little possibility of a book or comic but it's been so long, I get it if the show runners or writers moved on.\n\nAnyway what are your thoughts on the show?",

        "content": "**Hi everyone,**  \nI\u2019m genuinely losing my mind over this Netflix situation. My credit card expired this month, so I went to update it with my new one. That part works fine, *great*. But then it asks me to verify my phone number by sending a confirmation code\u2026 and here\u2019s where things go completely off the rails.\n\nFor some reason, I *cannot* change the country prefix. It\u2019s stuck on Ecuador, even though I live in Austria and the number saved in my account is my *Austrian* number. No idea how or why Ecuador got involved here, or why I can\u2019t switch it.\n\nObviously, I\u2019m frustrated. I\u2019ve tried contacting customer service, but no luck so far. My payment is due *tomorrow*, and I really don\u2019t want to lose my subscription. I use Netflix all the time. But at this point, I honestly don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this kind of issue and managed to fix it? Any advice would be massively appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "I've been meaning to watch the new Spanish show \"Superstar\" based on the life of Tamara, an early 2000's Spanish Icon. But I saw that Netflix released a documentary on her life \"I'm Still a Superstar\" at the same time... I don't know what to watch first.\n\nThis is sort of a Netflix trend. Like the Men\u00e9ndez Brothers Show and the doc coming out the same year. Or the other way around with the doc show \"This is the Zodiac Speaking\" and adding Fincher's \"Zodiac\" to the platform around a similar time. \n\nI'm curious for the doc watchers out there which way do you go??

        "content": "I\u2019ll put on a show I binged when I go to sleep - typically a small rotation of series - but it\u2019ll get to a point where instead of playing an episode start to finish and then starting the next episode it will just run the episode plus the entirety of the credits in different languages.\n\nThen when i go to hit \u201cwatch next episode\u201d or what have you when I come back to it, it just plays that same previous episode and does the credits thing all over again.\n\nA couple of things have temporarily fixed this but for the most part it\u2019s been recurring for the majority of this year.\n\nhow do I fix this??\n\nalso this is happened for \nBreaking Bad / Better Call Saul / Your Honor / Squid Games / and Ozark in case anybody asks",

Okay so if you listen throughout the movie when things get intense with Rumi you can hear the song playing in the background, with words and maybe without. One big scene is when Rumi goes to Celine and she has her emotional breakdown. Listen and you can hear it.\n\nPlease tell me im not the only \ud83d\ude4f \n",
