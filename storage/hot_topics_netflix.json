This wasnt a OOPSIE moment. And no Kendra, we have not all broke the law but got away with it, and certainly not to this level. Please, the rationalization of it all. People try to logically rationalize their actions as if it makes them understandable. Girl, Hitler had his reasons too, and was very convincing in his rationale, he still was a monster. That woman gives me chills. I have strong reasons to believe her daughter will cut her off way later in life, when she is going to become more aware. At the moment, she\u2019s too young to fully process it and have perspective. She\u2019s in a bubble. She clearly doesnt seem to fully understand.",

But she was also obsessed with the boyfriend! And then we learn that she lied about having a job! And then we hear her skirt accountability blaming it on her trauma, and then we see how manipulative she is at every level. Like\u2026 I have questions. Weigh in on any:\n\n1. WTF did we just watch?\n2. What mentally illness do you think she has? And what makes you think that?\n3. Why was she fired?? We need a follow up on this. Sounds like Casey Anthony at Universal Studios..\n4. We\u2019re all in agreement that she was obsessed with Owen right? \n5. HOW DID THIS PSYCHOPATH GET FREE IN 18 MONTHS?",

She literally told her to OFF HERSELF. She broke up her daughter\u2019s first relationship, she listened to her daughter cry, beg for it to stop, &amp; still did it. That\u2019s sick, that\u2019s not \u201cthat wasn\u2019t me\u201d \u201ci dont know what i was doing\u201d. She harassed her for almost TWO YEARS. You being assaulted does not excuse you to harass your daughter, it doesn\u2019t even correlate. &amp; then to do it for almost 2 years. \n\nNot to mention her obsession with Owen, that\u2019s disgusting &amp; predatory. She could have just called her daughter ugly, annoying blah blah but she said vulgar things about him. THATS WEIRD. I know this whole thing is weird but it\u2019s even weirder that she was obsessed with him. \n\nI personally would never talk to my mother again. &amp; my mom is by best friend. You told me to off myself everyday multiple times a day. Then said \u201cwell I knew she wouldn\u2019t do it\u201d, I could never trust her again. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

        "content": "Reading the comments here, most people agree Kendra is a psychopath and pedophile, which: yes absolutely. And yes I think she needs to be locked away for a much longer time (and studied).  But there are some other takes I had that I don\u2019t see reflected. What do you think, and what unpopular opinions do you have? Please share:\n\n1. Yes, obviously Kendra was fixated on Owen, even when he was still a little prepubescent boy (sick). And she was jealous of Lauryn for being with him. That\u2019s all the comments I\u2019ve read. But I believe it went much deeper than that. She was also deeply jealous that her daughter was growing into a pretty teenager who had her whole life ahead of her and hadn\u2019t fucked up her marriage, finances and life like Kendra had. Owen was the target of her fixation but It wasn\u2019t only about Owen. There\u2019s a lot more going on. \n\n2. I\u2019m sorry but Owen\u2019s parents/mother are not the heroes people are making them out to be. Why in the free world would they not take the kid\u2019s phone away? He was being harassed into a place of suicidal ideation. They are terrible parents for letting him just deal with it. \n\n3. Lauryn\u2019s dad was an incompetent father. I believe Kendra is a master manipulator but what the hell must he have been doing to not see signs that something was terribly wrong? I think he was having affairs/a double life or at the very least was willfully burying his head in the sand. What do you mean you trusted your wife to handle your daughter\u2019s severe sexual harassment and abuse? You didn\u2019t think you should help? You didn\u2019t think the situation warranted all hands on deck? Where the hell were you? And all he could say about Lauryn now is that she\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d and will be a \u201cbeautiful woman.\u201d  Something is also off with him. \n\n4. Lauryn never had close friends and was always quiet and withdrawn, per all her peers. Owen said she was trying to isolate him from his friends so it was just \u201cthe two of us\u201d. As far as we saw, Kendra was her primary parent, with barely any paternal involvement. Kendra\u2019s sociopathic ways are normal to Lauryn because it\u2019s all she knows. I hope she gets a lifetime of therapy. ",

These were brightly colored points, like white sand.\n\nIt happened the other day too but I don't remember what movie I was watching.

        "content": "I move states about twice a week (once to my work place for 3 days and then back), but not that regularly in holiday season and when I\u2018m jammed with work. So wherever I live I would love to have a Netflix account (even if just on mobile). But because of the forbidden account sharing and Netflix thinking I am some user from another household, my log in on my phone and other devices got blocked since I couldn\u2019t log in in my home wifi in the required time period. \nAny advice what I could do?",

        "content": "I am in the middle of season 4 and am enjoying Bonus Family very much.  So much happens in each episode that it is mind boggling.  Someone is always arguing with someone else, almost everyone is very opinionated and most are selfish. Clear communication with both of each child\u2019s parents is often problematic.  It is a chaotic lifestyle.\n\nI am curious if others find the married therapist couple helpful or not.  It seems like the writers are mocking them and their therapeutic techniques.  With such a large family, I see the therapists seeing years of therapy costing their clients thousands of Kronor.  When Patrik had the serious incident in school and was distraught, he broke protocol and arrived at the therapists\u2019 home without an appointment.  She was annoyed and couldn\u2019t make an appointment sooner than his next scheduled appointment, which I found cold and insensitive.",
