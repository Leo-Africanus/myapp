Later she's on the phone with her dad and he gets kidnapped and she goes on trying to find him.\n\nShe meets this guy with a criminal record working in a ski shop I think who is being blamed for the murder(or disappearance) of a different girl. The join teams and start uncovering information that leads them to learn about a clut.\n\nThus cult revolves around a guy that a bunch of people support and they do smth with ashes like mark people, I think.\n\nI think the dad had like a video storage thing a.d they start watching these cult videos and see the guys mom when she was younger, and how she was in the cult.\n\nThey later found out that this lady was also the girls mom (after birth had fucked I'm pretty sure, idk weird plot) and they want to get it over with.\n\nThere's a subplot with an officer and her kid where he goes on a field trip into a cave and wanders into cult territory.\n\nThus may be wrong but I needed to finish this series it was so good.\n\nAny help would be great!",
