Why didn\u2019t these parents file a criminal complaint against her if she SA\u2019d your child? \n\nThese parents who filed the lawsuit settled as soon as they got the money. Throughout the series them and the kids keep on saying they are worried for Piper and they wanna save her but, they stopped the fight when a settlement came. Shouldn\u2019t they have continued the case till Tiffany was held accountable by the court? Like why would you wanna make money of this too? \n\nFor anyone\u2019s child who had being SA\u2019d, the better thing would be to see the person who did this face justice rather than take money and forget it. I\u2019m baffled by it. \n\nWhy can\u2019t the law enforcement look into this and investigate all these claims and get the people responsible for this accountable? ",

Best thing I watched in a while. Welcome to Eden? Amazing thriller like so many amazing plottwists and such a great series. Dead Boy detectives? Such a cool concept and imo so well made. Julie and the Phantoms? The music is literally still playing in my head I mean Unsaid Emily is so beautiful and I am a punk fan through and through. Do yall wanna know what these and many other amazing, well written, new concepts, great acting and just overall new and interesting shows have in common? THEYRE ALL CANCELLED. ALL OF THEM. CANCELLED. WHY? \u201cNoT eNoUgH vIeWeRs\u201d SHUT UP. Tell me why I can\u2019t get any closure but Big Mouth gets another 50 season, why Riverdale could go on as long as it did and why so many shows can go on for 5199362 season with 5% if the viewers (thag being 5) are actual fans and the rest are hate watching? Im so over the money hungry sob Netflix headquarters or wherever they make these decisions. And I say that as someone who LIKED Riverdale and watched Big Mouth. Like Im not asking for 5 more seasons, honestly you don\u2019t even have to give me 1 more season just like a closing episode or a closing movie or ANYTHING. Im so over this, Im so over all these uncreative a$$holes using actually talented people for one season shows while they let bored out of their mind zombie writers bring out as many chatgpt shows as they want. Don\u2019t even get me started about Disney Im going on another rant in that sub. Every ounce of originality is being grabbed at the neck and suffocated in that industry because it doesn\u2019t have as many viewers as the $hit reality tv shows.

        "title": "Million Dollar Secret Winner",
        "content": "This is one of the best reality game shows in Netflix. I was hooked from the beginning.\n\nThere were plenty of times I wanted to scream at the contestants, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell them this\u2026\u201d to convince them you\u2019re not the millionaire, but they end up getting emotional, defensive and raising voices. I learnt that getting defensive like your \u201clife\u201d is on the line can be a truth / honestly signal instead of a signal for deceit. It happened every time in the game (eg Chris, Jaimi) \n\nFor example, Jaimi was twice a suspect. One for voting Lydia and telling the truth. (Sam and Sydnee lied so they wouldn\u2019t be targets) No one believed Jaimi. To me, if I was the millionaire (or not), I would lie about voting Lydia because it instantly puts a target on my back because that was the clue. Jaimi admitted to voting Lydia. So it was obvious she was telling the truth! If you were worried of being caught, you would lie.\n\nStill, no one believed Jaimi. When they found out from the clue that she wasn\u2019t the millionaire, Jaimi could have used that as proof to the group for the next time they suspect her.\n\nAgain, when she was the suspected millionaire, everyone thought it\u2019s her because she told Sam to having two sisters (clue) and everyone refused to believe that another person would conceal it or lie about it. They would always target truth tellers (eg Jaimi or Corey in this case) When Jaimi was in the chopping block, again, she just screamed and cried to defend herself which we already know does not change people\u2019s minds.She could have used the last time she was suspected as proof that she was telling the truth (eg Last time you didnt believe me, and you found out I was telling the truth. This is a game of deception, someone is lying. Anyone who has been honest has been an easy target and has been pinned as the millionaire)\n\n Next, I feel terribly bad for Corey in a way. I don\u2019t think he would ever be able to trust anyone after this show. Lol but in a way, he was naive and his intuition was off throughout the show. He always suspected easy targets instead of thinking deeper (if I was the millionaire, how would I act?) this was missing from him throughout so in a way he was easily manipulated by Cara.\n\nFinally, I feel conflicted about Cara winning because she wasn\u2019t that exciting to watch. But by the end of episode 6, I had a feeling she would win or at least play big in the finale. Why? Because she flew under the radar, everyone trusted her, and she actively kept information about herself hidden. She chose not to share. Her intuition was correct almost all of the time too (Sam was asking info about her sisters because she knew she had the clue, Corey and Sam would vote Sydnee out, Sydnee had immunity, Corey took her box etc) She played the game so very well because of her intuition but I so wanted the winners to either be Sydnee or Sam. They just actively played the game and revealed just enough, but because they were threats that put them in everyone\u2019s radars to be voted off either way! \n\nSam was correct most of time but her emotions got in the way in which she trusted Cara. She kept saying she didn\u2019t have it in her to think Cara would even ever be the millionaire because she wouldn\u2019t let herself go there - that Cara is capable of deceit. This was Sam\u2019s downfall and toxic trait lol Had she kept people at bay and not let her emotions cloud her I believe she would have won. Corey was the same but Corey was off throughout lol \n\nI wonder how they are and what they think about how they were all duped as Sydnee would put it.\n\n\n",

Whereas it once appeared that everything had to go through Hollywood, now a German, Spanish, or Italian series can become an international success.\n\nI believe this is partly due to streaming platforms. Netflix, Prime, Disney+, and others have made the world more \u201cmultipolar,\u201d even in cinema. Productions are happening everywhere, not just in Los Angeles, and audiences have become much more open to stories told in other languages.\n\nI think of titles like Dark (Germany), La Casa de Papel (Spain), Lupin (France), Suburra (Italy), 1899, The Rain, etc. But also more recent works like Cassandra from Germany, or Adolescence (UK), which has just been released and is already topping the charts on Netflix. And even though it\u2019s a few years old, Zerocalcare\u2019s Strappare lungo i bordi has had a strong impact, even outside of Italy.\n\nSo, do you think this is just a passing trend, or is European cinema truly experiencing a golden age?",

How do you make sense of this...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Netflix Rep (Live Chat):**\n\n\\- Yes as checking with your concern please be rest assured and need to worry as checking March 26 your partner payment has started and ended on april 8 2025 okay wait.\n\n\\- Kindly please check the billing details and let me know once will be in the chat! Yeah thankyou please check the email and tell me\n\n\\- Have you checked the billing details in that there is partner payment ended on april 8 from T\\_Mobile\n\n\\- Okay as charged with your back up card be rest assured I am on immediate cancel and provide you the refund Okay I will issue the refund by as checking as you have been charged I can cancel the account and refund you the money is that okay?\n\n\\- But here I cannot see it is been charged with your back up card only and with 24.99 USD.",

I'm not from TikTok generation I have no problem to watch a 3 hours good movie. But when the movie is just half good I want to do this faster.  \n  \nIt's sad it's not available in a service I pay for. I can do that easily in videos I have the archive downloaded. But I have a worse experience paying for a service.",

She will be holding the phone and her fingers will trigger the speed control to make the video play at 1.5x speed. Is there anyway to turn off this feature so the video doesn't speed up just by her holding the phone and having a her fingers on the screen? Thanks ",
