They asked for my email and then they prompted me through an automated system where I had to prove my Visa card number that was used for the payments and I did so. \n\nI\u2019ve changed password and email address of course and ended up recovering my account and got a free upgrade from the hacker \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f\n\nWhat I\u2019m still confused about is \u201cwhy would someone hack a Netflix account \u201c ? To what ? \n\nI\u2019m presuming I\u2019ve logged in using someone\u2019s computer and they just tried to cause problems but instant karma worked well \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd73",
