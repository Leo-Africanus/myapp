        "content": "Just finished the last season of The Sandman, and something struck me that I can't stop thinking about: there\u2019s no clear villain. Actually, there\u2019s no real villain at all.\n\nSure, we have Lord Azazel arguably the closest candidate. But can you really call a demon a \"villain\" when evil is literally his nature? He\u2019s doing what demons do. There's no moral twist, no manipulation, just raw, elemental ambition. Even Lucifer, who I fully expected to be the looming big bad this season, didn\u2019t take that role. And honestly, I was a little disappointed she didn\u2019t even show up at Morpheus\u2019 funeral. I kept waiting for her to appear, one last move, one final word but no. Her absence almost said more than her presence could have.\n\nThe beauty of this season, I think, is how conflict arises from duty, grief, pride, and change rather than a singular evil force. Morpheus isn't fighting villains; he's navigating consequences. Everyone's following their nature, their role in the grand cosmic dance, even when it clashes with others. And that makes it all feel more... mythic? More tragic? Definitely more human.\n\nCurious if anyone else felt the same. Did you miss having a \"main antagonist\"? Or did the lack of one make the story hit harder?\n",

After the first few episodes my tops were 1)SZN4, 2) Soulidified, 3)3Quency and Sweet Seduction could have fought for 3 if not for Allison\u2019s attitude cause they all really could sing. Overall I appreciated the judges eliminating bands based on chemistry and their overall blending. By the last episode though I loved the powerhouse voices of SZN4, I definitely believed they could have been more dynamic. I wanted to see a little 1,2 step. 3Quency brought we their voices, entertainment, and chemistry. They deserved the win.  \n\nIn comparison I think about Season 2 of Rhythm and Flow. Watching that felt so frustrating in comparisons. It felt like quite a few mediocre acts moved along too far in the competition. Why was the ultimate winner given kudos for getting the basics of his craft right while his opponent was giving A+ performances from day 1. The premise of the show was to find the best rapper, not go on potential. It felt like the judges were focused on their own preferences rather than what the premise of the show was based on. ",

        "content": "**A bit of context first:** I was one of those people who watched *Squid Game* as soon as it dropped back in October 2021. I was genuinely thrilled that the show was getting the attention it deserved, and I was really hyped for the upcoming seasons.\n\nThat said, I have to admit\u2014I\u2019m disappointed with how *Season 2* and *Season 3* turned out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re outright bad, but they lost the original theme and depth that made *Season 1* so impactful. The first season was a sharp commentary on Korean society, particularly capitalism. It portrayed a world where the lives of the poor were reduced to entertainment for the ultra-rich\u2014a brutal but honest reflection of societal inequality.\n\nIf Netflix plans to create a U.S. spinoff\u2014or one based in any other country\u2014I hope they do more than just swap Korean actors for American ones. They need to research and present social commentary that fits that country\u2019s context. Otherwise, it\u2019ll just feel hollow.\n\n*Season 1* worked because it explored the darker side of capitalism and the widening gap between rich and poor. Even the twist with Player 001 being the mastermind added a layer of complexity that elevated the story. *Season 2* tried to pivot toward themes like democracy and how easily the masses can be manipulated when money is involved, which had potential, but the execution fell flat. By *Season 3*, the games didn\u2019t feel as engaging, and the characters were far less memorable. It felt like people were dying left and right without much emotional weight.\n\nEven the subplot involving the soldier with PTSD, which initially added a sense of mystery, ended up being disappointing\u2014especially when it turned out he was lying the whole time. The police officer, who had so much intrigue in the first season, felt completely useless across the next two. And Gi-hun\u2019s death, all for the sake of the baby\u2014only for him to never meet his daughter\u2014felt like a bitter conclusion that didn\u2019t land emotionally.\n\nNow there\u2019s talk of a *Squid Game USA* and even a whole cinematic universe. Honestly, I think that\u2019s a bad idea, especially considering how the quality dipped in *Season 2* and *3*. I don\u2019t want this to turn into a franchise where the core idea becomes nothing more than \u201crich people watch poor people suffer,\u201d stripped of any real message or nuance.\n\nI can talk about this more",

        "content": "A key part of the series is Jamie\u2019s stubborn pleas of innocence despite his murder of Katie being clearly captured on camera. \n\nHe\u2019s so adamant that most people spend much of the series assuming there must be more to the murder than just Jamie doing it (there isn\u2019t, as is clear is episode 1).\n\nA take I haven\u2019t seen anywhere else is that Jamie\u2019s pleas of innocence are another impact of his online incel/red pill exposure: fundamental to redpill, alt-right culture is a type of postmodernism. All mainstream narratives are false, institutions can\u2019t be trusted and aim only to mislead and control the public, presumably a shadowy global organisation controls everything. This is epistemological framework is central to Andrew Tate\u2019s shtick and all reactionary public intellectuals (like Bret and Eric Weinstein) who repeatedly refer to \u201cthey\u201d.\n\nJamie is brain deep into this stuff and subsequently is effectively delusional when he comes crashing into reality after committing murder. When he\u2019s saying he didn\u2019t kill Katie, it\u2019s not so much that he\u2019s lying as that he genuinely doesn\u2019t understand the typical concept of truth in which he\u2019s being judged upon.\n\nThis theme is spelt out more clearly in the final episode when the youth who sells Eddie the paint confides that he\u2019s a part of an online community who believes Jamie to have been framed by some conspiracy of \u201cthem\u201d - he says something like \u201cthey didn\u2019t even make the stab wound anatomically correct\u201d\n\nThe final brilliance of the show is it manages to elicit this type of conspiratorial attitude from some section of the audience who feel it remains open by the end whether Jamie was the killer.",

        "content": "I usually don\u2019t put my two cents out here on the internet but I really wanted to have a discussion about this.\nPersonally, I watched this movie a month after it was released. I had a good time, really enjoyed the animation and the songs like everybody else.\nBut the plot felt off to me. And after a few days of letting that marinate, I understand why I\u2019m so frustrated with it.\n\n(This is a long rant so bare with me! No tldr because I\u2019m shit at recapping things)\n\nFirst of all, I get that the run time was short. 1 hours to squeeze everything in, and they still managed to make a compelling and visually stunning movie. Thats very impressive.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t excuse the execution to me. The lack of time really flattens the message they wanted to achieve with this movie. It had its highs and lows. \nThe high would be Rumi\u2019s crash out infront of her aunt. And also Jinu\u2019s character writing, it was quite consistent imo (but I don\u2019t like him, not as a character, but as a person.) \n\nThe low would be the end. The way both Jinu and Rumi\u2019s big climax/resolution moment doesn\u2019t have much substance to it. Jinu chosing to sacrifice himself while on the surface is like him chosing to no longer live selfishly, it is imo, the easy way out. I get that at that time there wasn\u2019t anything else he could do to help out though. But if he had to go through the slow process of actually working through the guilt and shame, that would\u2019ve felt more satisfying. I guess that\u2019s the tragic part of Jinu\u2019s story.\n\nNow Rumi\u2019s whole turnaround arc feels very disjointed to me personally. Especially from the point where she went \u201cif this is how the Honmoon is, I want it destroyed\u201d then suddenly she\u2019s at the stadium singing her fight song, rebuilding the Honmoon again. I get that she wants the foundation of perfectionism the Honmoon is built on destroyed, not the Honmon itself. But we never get to see her actually have a cathartic breaking moment. The actual ugly but necessary part of healing where you go scorch earth on the thing hurting you before actually replanting the seeds.\n\nShe sings perfectly, her friends join her, and they get their power ups (very predictably). What really gets on my nerve is that we don\u2019t see the difficult conversation afterwards. The girls literally turned on Rumi, and they themselves felt betrayed too. That should\u2019ve been explored more. Atleast just through a quick montage at the end showing all three of them slowly working through it, talking through it, being honest with each other about their feelings.\nBut no it again, hard cuts to them hanging out like nothings happened. Its like this movie gives us all the positive side of healing but never show the ugly and hard side of it. Healing takes time, that kind of bone deep shame and guilt from childhood takes so much time to heal.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it if this didn\u2019t cause problems but imo it is harmful. Even if unintentionally, the message you get out of that ending is that healing happens in one glorious moment. While in reality, it doesn\u2019t. And this disparity causes people to feel ashamed for not fixing their problem as quickly as the character they see on screen. \nAnd when I say people I mean kids too, I\u2019ve seen people say that this is a kids movie so it doesn\u2019t have to be that deep but I think thats just so stupid. \nWe\u2019ve seen so many movies with that same kind of surface level fight song endings that left you feeling good in the moment but ultimately didn\u2019t teach you much. \n\nAnd the fact that this movie came out in 2025, after the media has been saturated with that kind of cheese, is unacceptable. Kids deserve better, hell, everyone deserves better. Why are we still calling this deep when its barely taking any steps forward? \n\n\nSorry for the rant, I know I\u2019m a month late to the party but I really want to know what others think of this movie and the message behind it. \nThings can be fun for funs sake but I personally think we should hold fun things to higher standards if they\u2019re trying to deliver a message about something as real as the struggle of living with guilt and shame. \n\n\nAlso feel free to argue with me, thats the point of this post lol. Come at me with your opinions, I\u2019d love to hear them. \n",
