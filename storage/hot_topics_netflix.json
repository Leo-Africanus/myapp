It was a hit show, it had a following, it wasn\u2019t hidden in the depths of the platform. It could\u2019ve grown even more if Netflix actually supported it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one show. This is about the pattern. They cancel everything good, especially original, weird, dark, or risky stuff, and replace it with endless reality shows or bland reboots.\n\nWhy do they think viewers will keep trusting them with our time and emotional investment if they pull this every time?\n\nIt\u2019s like they only care about new signups, not long-term fans. They greenlight 100 shows and abandon 98 of them. How is that sustainable?\n\nI genuinely wish I could flood their inbox with 40,000 complaints, because clearly they\u2019re not hearing how angry people are. There\u2019s no point in starting new shows anymore if we know there\u2019s no closure. Same with keeping a subscription. What a waste of a company they are. \n\nI hope I can get so many views on this post that Netflix sees this \ud83d\ude2d  \n\nAnyone else feel like this?",

        "content": "Just finished The Old Guard 2, and while I didn\u2019t quit halfway through (so it wasn\u2019t completely unwatchable), I was definitely disappointed by how lazy and inconsistent the lore is. For a story about immortals from completely different parts of the world who are actively hiding from the rest of the world, it\u2019s weirdly convenient that they all seem to find each other across centuries with no real explanation of how or why. Still with that alone I would have been ok after all they all have centuries to run into each other, right?\n\nWhat really broke it for me was the mentioned connection between the first and last immortal (further explained only by a birthmark they both have for some reason) as well as the whole \u201clegend\u201d about the last immortal which would be born with the power to remove or transfer immortality. A legend someone somehow formulated likely thousands of years before the last immortal was even close to existing. How can there be legends about someone completely unique among a group of already special people nobody should even know about in the first place? The writing just didn\u2019t try at all to make the world feel coherent or believable, which is a shame because IMHO the premise definitely had some potential. If only they made the story based on a somewhat plausible lore (written first) rather than creating a garbage lore based on what they needed it to be to accomodate a raise of stakes for the sequel or whatever.\n\nAnyway what are your opinions random redditors?",

        "content": "Edit: if you downvote, please leave a comment why, so I learn something.\n\nRecently I subscribed to the Premium tier to watch content in quality 4k HDR format. While shows like Squid Game actually display in 4k HDR and look great, I find that the vast majority of big movies are only offered in 1080p, and a few 4k ones often without HDR. These are movies that have commonly available Blueray 4k HDR releases, so it's not a matter of the content not existing. One example would be 1917, which has been released on Blueray in both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, but only seems to play at 1080p. The television is configured to display 4k HDR content, the Chromecast 4k is as well, and the subscription is the Premium tier. Some content is offered in 4k HDR, so the technology seems to work as intended.\n\nIs something wrong on my end, or is Netflix not offering 4k HDR versions for a lot of movies, even on the Premium tier?",

I really wanted to like it, I tried to like it\u2014but somewhere between the recycled plot points and painfully predictable twists, I felt like the magic of the first season just vanished.\n\nThe original had unpredictability, emotional stakes, and that gritty commentary on capitalism and human desperation. But this one? It felt like they were trying to shock us, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The tension just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAlso, character development took a nosedive. Instead of complex personalities making morally grey choices, we got caricatures running through a checklist of betrayals and \u201csurprises\u201d that weren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\nEven the games lacked originality this time. One of them was so absurdly over-the-top that it felt more like a bad parody of Squid Game than the real thing.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Was I expecting too much? Or has the show just become another victim of its own success?",

There seems to be an issue when I enter Netflix on my tv where I can\u2019t see some shows that are definitely on in the uk- for example Black mirror, killing eve, shera, and arcane. \n\nI can access all of these on my phone and it\u2019s only happening with certain shows (these are just the ones I\u2019ve noticed but I\u2019m sure there is more).\n\n As well as this some of my profile pictures have defaulted to that fluffy smiley face profile picture- these avatars are from the shows mentioned above (Catra, jinx, and glimmer) so seems to be linked to the issue. These profile pictures appear on my phone fine. \n\nIs anyone else having this issue? Perhaps it is an issue with Sky or something? \n\nI have no idea why this glitch has suddenly occurred- I was watching Netflix fine a few hours ago. \n\nI\u2019ve tried resetting Netflix and my skybox but so far nothing has worked. As far as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s only my Netflix that has been affected and no other streaming apps.  \n\nUpdate: ok we\u2019ve worked out it is just one profile that is glitched? For some reason mine is broken but all the other accounts (my family) are fine. We are all under the same roof so I don\u2019t see any reason to why this should be happening??",

Or was the movie genuinely bleh? \n\nBarely any Joe and Nicky screen time, no actual communication happening between people, Andy just looking away deeply at every moment, underwhelming fight scenes, a stupid ending. \nTo be fair, there were some good parts. I did like seeing Andy a little happier. I loved Quyns angst. Booker made me cry. But overall it was a disappointing sequel.\nI mean if you're going to take 467866 years to make it, at least get it right??\n",

I usually don't have a lot of time, but my girlfriend is currently pregnant and we're trying to slow down a bit and would like to start on a short series, but we have nooo idea where to begin? We watched the new *Department Q* on Netflix and enjoyed that a lot, so something similar to that if anyone can recommend something? \n\n\n\nthanks in advance!! :) ",

As soon as the song starts, the episode minimises to the top left, pausing all music, and tells me to watch next. I try to click on the minimised thumbnail on top but it doesn't let me.",
