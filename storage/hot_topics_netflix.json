        "title": "Adolescence (groyper, incel)",
        "content": "Okay, I have a few things to say. So, first of all this was a super weird coincidence that I watched this today because I\u2019ve been learning about the alt-right incel groyper pipeline on TikTok literally all week after the you-know-who assassination because I was totally ignorant to all of that, and I watched Adolescence today literally not knowing AT ALL that\u2019s what it is about. I started watching it because that kid was the youngest to ever when an Emmy, and I was like oh must be good. Well it was good, and it was objectively the best time I could\u2019ve watched it and deeply understood it. I need to lie down. \n\nSecond, media literacy is literally dead methinks. I was on a different subreddit and this girl said she didn\u2019t like how the show propped up the killer and diminished the victim and other female characters, but that was LITERALLY the entire point. It even pointed out that the killers are always remembered and the victims are forgotten. Again, maybe if you\u2019re not super familiar with the alt-right incel groyper stuff which I also wasn\u2019t aware of until this week, I can see where you wouldn\u2019t totally fill in all the gaps, but the entire point was to show this normal kid who you could chalk his actions up to bullying when in reality, even if he was bullied (2 things can be true at once) he clearly displayed woman-hating, aggressive, and isolated tendencies that the girls in his class could recognize via his Instagram posts and behavior. Why would a girl want to hang out with someone like that? She also could see right through his little \u201cclever\u201d scheme of asking her out when she was at her weakest when it wasn\u2019t clever, he just thinks women are stupid and sub-humans that are just a means to a sexual end. To incels, they always look outward, never inward. This was also highlighted by the fact this was clearly a cute, not ugly at all little boy saying \u201cI\u2019m ugly\u201d over and over, so his scapegoat was his looks when that wasn\u2019t the problem at all. A lot of these incels who claim they are unattractive are actually attractive on the outside but behave in such a way that their physical appearance doesn\u2019t matter at all which is really the reason they can\u2019t get girls. It has nothing to do with looks at all, but the online chat forums and the rejection by girls reinforces their untrue ideas.\n\nThird, which pretty much I\u2019ve already covered more or less is that there was no twist which ended up actually being the twist because this is simply reality. It\u2019s these kids who are by all means normal at first but then fall into this echo chamber they can\u2019t get out of because their behavior reinforces their perception, and the parents are not sitting down with them and having important conversations about women and sex and simultaneously letting them stay on the computer all the time. The truth is right in front of us, which in this case is a double truth (1. we can clearly see him committing the crime on camera, so there is no plausible deniability at any point even though we want to believe there will be some big twist. 2. we know why young men are growing violent and discontent i.e. groyper chat rooms and unchecked internet use), but we don\u2019t want to see the truth. We the audience and we society. This was covered in the end with the parents pretty well. Tell me your thoughts. ",

John Oliver could take the Friday slot since he\u2019s used to one show a week anyway, or just have them all stream every night at the same time and folks could just watch the ones they want at their own leisure.

        "content": "I have some really wild theories after watching it's latest episode and I wonder if someone else also has thought about them + how come I can not find anything related about over internet.\n\nIf you haven't watched ep 4&amp;5 better skip it because it might spoil few bits for you!\n\nWe can see mention of\u00a0**stella young**\u00a0in ep 5 (an American arms lobbyist named Stella Young has been purchasing the materials required for a submarine. But she entered South Korea ten years ago and has been there ever since) and\u00a0**my theory is**\u00a0that this stella young is non other than our Munji (Jun Ji Hyun).\n\nMy few assumptions are - 1) See how Junik in his last mail with Miller says \"that he believes that he knows who Stella is and is trying to sort it out\" and in the first episode when Munji was getting ready for going to the church she asks Juniks what's wrong and he says to her that we will talk after this and sort out everything but he died that day. I believe that he knows who Munji was and he died because she figured out that he knows her.\n\n2) Munji was raised in America and she came back in Korea around 9-10 years back I guess when she got married to Junik? IDK the exact time but she cam to korea around that time too, backing up my Hypothesis a bit.\n\nAnother Assumption- Munji being pregnant - I believe that bastard child of Juniks is actually of Munji and Junik's (as we can see how she was also pregnant 9 years ago and how that child is also about the same age, but something happened and she lost her child, we are yet to know that) but I believe Junik got to know about Munji being Stella around the time when she was pregnant with his child and he purposely stole their child from her so he can keep him safe from Stella.\n\nI may have comprehended something differently or may have missed few bits and pieces. Maybe I am completely wrong about all of this and maybe I guessed it right, only time will tell! Please tell me your theories or if you can also relate with mentioned theories? LMK\n\nThanks for reading\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igjgqs9r23qf1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96749dec26ac81847b7cb8da21a2914c8287c09d\n\n",

My biggest struggle is something I can watch for a while. For example I\u2019ve watched supernatural (15 seasons) or vampire diaries (8 seasons) but all I can find that looks remotely interesting is only between 1-3 seasons with episodes that are like 20 minutes each. I prefer episodes anywhere from 40min to an hour. \n\nSide note: game of thrones is not really for me. I don\u2019t think I could get past the first season but I might give it another shot. If anyone has any recommendations I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nI also enjoyed shows like bojack, Rick and Morty, and inside job so I\u2019m no stranger to more of the cartoony stuff but a lot of the recent stuff I\u2019ve seen just kind of seems boring or stupid.

        "content": "I heard a lot of good things about Adolescence. I tried watching Line Of Duty but couldn\u2019t get into it but I loved Happy Valley. Crime Dramas were never really my thing but I decided to give this a try and OMG, I absolutely loved it! I have watched through the whole thing 3 times already and already like rereading scenes by reading a bit and then watching a bit more. It feels like the show has been out a lot longer than it actually has.\n\nMy favourite episode was the first one. I really love the process of how Jamie goes into the police station to getting the solicitor, doing the tests and then the investigation. It makes me want to commit a crime just so I can go through a similar process (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not actually planning on doing that, just a positive to how good the show sets it up)\n\nThe second episode at the school was fine enough, nice to see some of the students but I don\u2019t find it particularly memorable.\n\nThe third episode also stood out to me as it really shows Jamie\u2019s inner turmoil. Whether Briony was intentionally trying to provoke him or it just goes to show how aggressive Jamie can be and it could show how him murdering Katie can see the evil side of him. I can relate to a lot of his frustrations about being self-conscious and wanting reassurance.\n\nThe fourth episode I initially thought was the weakest but I think the weakest is now episode 2. I really like how it shows a bit more insight into the family and just how broken everything is. \n\nWhen I first watched it, I wished for a 5th episode to tie up some loose ends and see Jamie get sentenced but as I\u2019ve watched it more, I think it does make sense to leave it where it was. The 4 episodes kind of show everything the viewer needs to know without showing or explaining everything.\n\nI would pray for a second series, even though that isn\u2019t the intention. If there was, maybe some gaps to fill in or side stories. Like, maybe showing how Jamie was before the crime took place, any more advice from the solicitor, how Paul and Adam\u2019s father son relationship is doing etc\u2026 \n\nI think I would rather see more shows like this rather than a second series entirely. Let the series remain as the legend it deserves to be! Well done, you\u2019ve delivered a winner here! \n\nScore: 9.9/10",

Might as well be a hobbyist. The show goes to great lengths to say how great she is, but nobody tries harder to say how great they are than our protagonist.\n\nIt doesn't feel earned. She's snarky and unhelpful to everyone except one particular employee, who... is obviously involved in this, but there's not really much of a reason for why only the newly appointed first in command of housing gets a pass when nobody else does, even when they're trying to be helpful.\n\nThey compare her to other fictional detectives, including Benoit Blank from Knives Out, but Benoit Blank feels different than this- he makes no effort to promote himself, and is kind and civil on the outset, only really dropping the mask and giving his actual opinions on people towards the end of each case. I think there are better choices for this mystery than Cordelia explicitly because of how horrible she is at dealing with people.\n\nAlso the actress talks in a dry monotone without much body movement while everyone else is putting their heart and soul into this.\n\nIt's a bit rough to watch but I love this kind of thing- does it improve?",

        "content": "ey everyone,\n\nMy cousin recommended this show to me, saying it was on par with *Mare of Easttown*. I binged all 6 episodes, and... wow, what a frustrating mess. I had to come here to see if I'm the only one who felt this way.\n\nThe concept is solid gold: a detective has to team up with his estranged mother, a famous serial killer known as \"The Mantis,\" to catch her copycat. It's got that classic *Silence of the Lambs* vibe, and I was completely on board.\n\nBut the execution is just painfully slow. It feels more like a boring soap opera than a thriller, with characters just talking endlessly while nothing happens. The plot is full of holes you could drive a truck through\u2014the copycat's motivation makes zero sense, and there are entire subplots with red herring characters that are completely pointless and could be erased from the show entirely.\n\nI was so baffled by the writing that I wrote up a full, no-holds-barred review on my blog, **Freddy's Cine IT**. If you're interested in my full takedown, you can check it out.\n\nAlso, if you've seen it and were as confused as I was, the post has a **complete episode-by-episode explanation** to try and make sense of the convoluted plot. I'll drop the link in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else felt this way or if you actually enjoyed it!",

Wife and kids each have their own profile, and they don't have anything on them. \n\nWhen I address this to netflix, I get an automated reply saying I need to check my downloads, yeah right, or get another subscription.\n\nAny tips?",
