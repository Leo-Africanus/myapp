        "content": "Cassandra was an interesting story that I couldn't help but wonder what happened next. By the time we get to the end, we get that bitter sweet ending. But I was curious on what I missed on the first watch knowing what I know now. I found that the story is actually very sad when you watch it a second time. It lets you see everything from Cassandra's perspective. In the past, the last thing that happens is Cassandra watches her son die and shorts out. Her daughter then starves to death in the room and 50 years past. When she wakes up, she first assumes the boy is Peter. She is obviously very hopeful that her last memory was wrong. But then she notices that it's not Peter and a new family is in her house. What's the first thing she does? She goes to the master bedroom and enters the closet to check on her daughter. You can see when she enters the room and when the wife looks, you can see the closet door close with no one else around. Cassandra went into the secret room. Now at this time the rest of the house starts coming on with an expressionless Cassandra. I believe at this point, the robot is mourning her daughter and losing her mind. You next see Cassandra standing by the pool where I believe she's thinking about killing herself and wondering if she can just fall in and end it. But then she sees the mouse and that's when you know she's gone crazy. She talks to it and runs it over. When the family wakes up, she's not acting like herself anymore. She's pretending to be a house servant for them so she can take over the family and replace the ones she lost. The rest of the story plays out as normal, but now you know where her madness comes from.\n\nI'm glad I took the time to watch it all. It was very interesting.",

All you needed to do what stop the auto play so that one could read about the title.  Prime's UI is so annoying to navigate the way it expands the tile your on, make it harder to scroll and see what's available.  If Netflix does the same, this might be it for me.
