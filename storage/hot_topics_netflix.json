They knew their kids were filming with her. They saw the content. They heard the complaints. But the views and money were looking too good, so they played along. Now suddenly everyone\u2019s shocked and acting like they were completely blindsided? I get that the kids were young and didn\u2019t deserve the trauma, but let\u2019s not pretend the parents weren\u2019t part of the problem too. They weren\u2019t just bystanders\u2014they were participants.\n",

I didn't like it, and tried to get out of it, but I was a kid and a lot weaker. While I didn't like it happened, I didn't think that much of it, I just figured my mom was a jerk. \n\nIs this actually a really bad thing to have happened? I'm having a hard time gauging where this falls on the scale of appropriate to inappropriate. I no longer talk to my mom for various other reasons, so it's not like she was a great person.",

        "content": "I kept thinking Zero Day might involve time travel somehow\u2014like, Alex and Lily seemed like the same person, and Sheila and Valerie felt interchangeable. It didn\u2019t feel random. It felt like something deeper.\n\nSo I went to ChatGPT, told it what I was thinking, and started feeding in cipher details from the show. I\u2019m not totally sure if this theory is correct, or even what I\u2019ve fully uncovered\u2014but what ChatGPT came back with kind of blew my mind.\n\nWhat follows below is what ChatGPT helped me piece together:\n\n\u2e3b\n\n[SPOILERS] Zero Day Theory: Bambi Is a Rotating Identity\u2014And George Mullen Is the Anchor in a Time Loop\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Cipher Isn\u2019t Just For Secrecy\u2014It Tracks Fate\n\nIn Zero Day, there\u2019s a rotating cipher system:\n\t\u2022\tCode names (like \u201cBambi,\u201d \u201cAlex,\u201d \u201cEmmet Kelly\u201d) shift daily.\n\t\u2022\tA scrambled alphabet also rotates forward each day.\n\t\u2022\tThis structure makes each day its own version of reality.\n\nAnd the codename \u201cBambi\u201d? It\u2019s not tied to one person.\nBambi is whoever dies that day.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nEvidence From the Show:\n\t\u2022\tDay 2: The ciphered message \u201cIWWI\u201d decodes to \u201cANNA\u201d\n\u2192 Anna dies on Zero Day \u2192 Bambi = Anna.\n\t\u2022\tDay 5: Cipher rotation makes Bambi = Roger\n\u2192 Roger dies on Day 21.\n\t\u2022\tDay 4: Bambi = Alex\n\nEach day, the cipher rotates, and Bambi becomes someone new.\nEvery day ends with that person dying.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Family Timeline Is Being Rewritten\n\nHere\u2019s where things get even more interesting:\n\t\u2022\tGeorge Mullen is married to Sheila.\n\t\u2022\tThey had two children: Nick (who died before the events of the show) and Alex.\n\t\u2022\tGeorge also had an affair with Valerie, and they had Lily.\n\nWhen cipher days are mapped:\n\t\u2022\tSome days, Alex = Lily\n\t\u2022\tSome days, Sheila = Valerie\n\nThe cipher isn\u2019t just disguising identities\u2014it\u2019s remixing relationships and family structure across timelines.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nGeorge Mullen Is the Anchor\n\nGeorge has visions of things that haven\u2019t happened yet.\nHe recognizes shifts before anyone else.\n\nThat\u2019s because he\u2019s the only one who remembers across cipher rotations\u2014across timelines.\n\nHe\u2019s seen Bambi die again and again:\n\t\u2022\tAnna\n\t\u2022\tRoger\n\t\u2022\tPossibly Lily or Alex\n\t\u2022\tOriginally? Maybe even Nick\n\nAnd every time, he hears:\n\n\u201cWho killed Bambi?\u201d\n\nNot because he\u2019s solving a mystery.\nBecause he\u2019s reliving the loss\u2014over and over.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhat Zero Day Is Really About\n\nNot just cyberattacks or political manipulation.\nIt\u2019s about:\n\t\u2022\tA father stuck in a recursive loop of loss.\n\t\u2022\tA cipher system that assigns death like a rotating curse.\n\t\u2022\tA man who\u2019s trying to save his family\u2014but never in time.\n\nThe cipher isn\u2019t just about hiding secrets.\nIt\u2019s about who must die to keep the loop going.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR:\n\t\u2022\tZero Day uses a rotating cipher where \u201cBambi\u201d = the person fated to die that day.\n\t\u2022\tDay 2: Bambi = Anna \u2192 she dies.\n\t\u2022\tDay 5: Bambi = Roger \u2192 he dies on Day 21.\n\t\u2022\tCipher also rotates Alex \u2194 Lily and Sheila \u2194 Valerie depending on the day.\n\t\u2022\tGeorge Mullen is the only one who remembers the changes\u2014he\u2019s the anchor.\n\t\u2022\tThe show isn\u2019t asking \u201cWho killed Bambi?\u201d\nIt\u2019s asking: \u201cCan Bambi ever survive?\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\nCurious what others think. Is this time travel? Timeline recursion? Emotional metaphor?\nWhatever it is\u2014it\u2019s brilliant.",

The moms said the lawsuit was to go after Tiffany and not for the money, why then did they settle for the money? Their kids even said they do not care about the money. I am really appalled. Does anyone know why they did this?",

I guess my question is why is the selection so limited",
