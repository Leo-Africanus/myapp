This last one, a detective inspector blags her way into prison to question the cold blooded assassin that murdered her father. She proceeds to cry and beg him to tell her why sir, why'd you kill my daddy??, which unsurprisingly doesn't work. Then the nurse drugs him, tells her she only has a few minutes to get the truth out of him.  He reveals he was paid to take the fall for the murder, and she decides to argue with him. But you confessed! They found the weapon on you! I am guessing a DI doesn't know what paid to take the fall means?  Only after a few minutes does she finally ask \"who paid you?\" Of course too late, he has passed out. Then she crys more.  Christ on a cracker, are the books this stupid too? How does this guy have a career.  ",

HDR is turned on. My internet is high speed and I have no issues with anything else. I'm watching a hockey game in 4K right now and it's running just fine. On Netflix, I have no issues with anything but WWE that's supposed to be HD. It's not the fact it's live either, as I tried watching Monday's Raw episode the next day and Survivor Series from November and experienced the same problem. I turn on a movie in 4K with HDR and it looks incredible. I turn on something WWE HD and it looks like shit.\n\nWhy is this an issue for me only with WWE programming on Netflix?",
