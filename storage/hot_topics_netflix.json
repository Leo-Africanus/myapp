It\u2019s actually super annoying to me, long gone are the days you can just sit and binge a new series on your day off. \n\nDo you guys prefer them split into 2 parts? I lose interest waiting for the second part of anything.. is there specific reasons for this like stretching out views etc? I don\u2019t think it builds suspense like Netflix thinks, it\u2019s actually just annoying \ud83d\ude02 ",

        "content": "To be honest, that's where I'm at. And this doesn't just apply to Netflix, but Amazon and other streaming services as well. I'm tired of them pumping out series like candy, some of which in my opinion are really good, only for them to eventually get cancelled often times after just one or two seasons.\n\nIt's annoying. It's a disservice to subscribers. And frankly, I've been reading books of any series I find online now instead anyways because I've been so conditioned to just assume anything I like will eventually get cancelled anyways. \n\nAnd honestly? The books have been offering me a much better experience overall. I feel better, even if I spend all day reading a book or two, than I would've had I spent it binging a show. I also have the added confidence knowing that I'll be able to finish the series without getting pissed off after wasting so much time watching it only to find out it's cancelled later.\n\nSo yeah... books for the win! Depending on how into books I go I may honestly just get rid of my Netflix subscription altogether.",

When you play Netflix on those TVs, the credits play. It\u2019s just the main box that doesn\u2019t play them. I was at one point told to turn the Sky Box off and on again to reset it, I even did a hard reset where I cut the power, and rebooted it, but nothing. No change. \n\nCan you help me fix it?
