Some parts dragged worse than my Monday mornings, and half the characters are flatter than my phone battery at 1%. I\u2019ve seen X users call it overhyped, whining about the same old plot.

This documentary is so extremely devastating, a bunch of piss poor excuses working as government servants. The only one with integrity and honor being General Honor\u00e9. Its always better to be safe then sorry, mandatory evacuation of ppl in below sea level neighborhoods should've been 1st and not even second guessed. The corrupt Major Nagin, awful Governor Blanco, incompetent FEMA Director Brown, horrendous President Bush just ugh I want to vomit and I wonder if how tragically they screwed this up lives in their heads to this day.... None of them cared about their constituents or residents in the region. My heart aches.",

I know this show has a lot of complaints about the actors not suiting the ages they\u2019re supposed to be, but at the same time he\u2019s the one that sticks out the most for me, especially next to Danny who is supposed to be his twin.\n\nThe show seems like they\u2019re trying to have Damon and Stefan the remake, but it\u2019s not working because those two were ancient vampires. The dark and broody bit on a teenager without going deeper into his struggles or thought process is just cringe.",

        "content": "I love My Life With the Walter Boys so much!! The whole cast seems so lovely and like a genuine family. But I have a few issues with season 2\u2026\n\nFor me, the actress who plays Jackie can not act at all. Her character did not land. A lot of the scenes of hers felt stiff, flat, disengaged and unnatural. Take the final scene for example when the ambulance comes, her reaction just didn\u2019t feel natural. It felt laboured and half hearted and I noticed it enough that it effected my overall feeling \n\nBy comparison the actor who plays Cole I thought was fantastic this season. I loved the delivery of that portrayal of the actor, really shined, especially this season. He did such a beautiful, seamless transition that  made him more likeable, vulnerable and understandable. It\u2019s such a lovely light hearted family show that reflects the beauty and complexities of family subtly, and his character adds depth and rawness, which is really refreshing. He\u2019s doing a great job\n\nThe love triangle though\u2026.is driving me crazyyyy. I honestly feel like it\u2019s so obvious that Cole and Jackie are meant to be together. Their chemistry feels so natural, and they bring out the best in each other, it\u2019s real relationship energy and intimacy where they feel like an in love couple with an unsaid understanding \n\nI really don\u2019t enjoy Jackie and Alex as a couple. At all. It\u2019s frustrating that season 2 ended on basically the same cliffhanger as season 1\u2026 but at least there\u2019s clear growth with Cole this time around. His character feels more grounded and less arrogant, which I loved seeing\n\nI  want Jackie to finally settle down instead of bouncing between the brothers. Alex might be the \u201cgood boy\u201d type, but it\u2019s obvious Jackie\u2019s heart is with Cole. That\u2019s the relationship I want to see play out in season 3\n\nIt\u2019s a great show and I adore the family essence of it but I have issue with season 2 not being much growth in the story and the actress who plays Jackie not being really present in her delivery. For me it was Cole\u2019s character who really shined this season but I\u2019m hoping everything steps up for everyone in season 3\n\nWhat does everyone else think?? ",

        "content": "Beck, The Tubes, Prince, Madonna, Bjork, The Beach Boys, Talking Heads, Pearl Jam, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Van Halen, etc all come into my mind, but any other artists/ bands at all?\n\nThat DEVO music documentary sure was pretty cool/ insightful/ interesting for sure. Any other suggestions?",

Physically impossible to finish in time as tomorrow is in 5 hrs\n\nIs there a way similar to how you can download episodes to watch offline, but to watch after it\u2019s left?",

I\u2019m at the end of season two and the voice acting, animation, the fight scenes\u2026 it\u2019s just art. I can\u2019t get over how good this thing is and how I\u2019ve been sleeping on this. It\u2019s just so incredibly good and I had to make sure others know it exists. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read some people that have played the video games and are puritans weren\u2019t all thrilled given that it seems like the plot differed from the games somewhat, but as someone coming into it fresh it\u2019s incredibly entertaining to watch. Can\u2019t remember the last time a Netflix show hooked me like this.  ",
