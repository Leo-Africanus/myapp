But when I fired up **Netflix on Safari**, the picture looked... well, **awful**. Blurry, pixelated \u2014 nothing close to the HD experience I expected. \ud83d\ude29\n\nI double-checked my internet (blazing fast), display settings (perfect), and even tried different shows. Same fuzzy quality.\n\nThat led me down a **deep rabbit hole** of research, developer tools, hidden settings, and overrides. After hours of experimenting and tweaking, I finally found a **clean, repeatable way** to unlock Netflix\u2019s **high bitrate playback** in Safari.\n\nIf you're also stuck with pixelated Netflix on your Mac and 2K display, here's the solution that worked wonders for me \ud83d\udc47\n\n# \u2705 Step 1: Enable Developer Features in Safari\n\n1. Open Safari and go to **Settings &gt; Advanced**.\n2. At the bottom, check \u2705 **\u201cShow features for web developers.\u201d**\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 1\\]*\n\n[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/h6qhgbuckfef1.png?width=1896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3232cdb46955a14e5a13688e5f0a746f05ff28d9)\n\n# \ud83d\udd13 Step 2: Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions\n\n1. From the top menu bar, click **Develop &gt; Developer Settings**.\n2.

Go to **Develop &gt; Show Page Source**.\n3. In the **Sources** tab, look for the file named like `cadmium-playercore-*.js`. \ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 3\\]*\n\n[Image 3](https://preview.redd.it/amwu29elkfef1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c1e03f0048074721b4d4a11f2590347bc7c92e1)\n\n**4. Right-click** the file and choose **\u201cCreate Response Local Override.\u201d**\n\n5. Then click **\u201cMap to File\u201d** and choose the downloaded script.\n\n**6. Refresh** the Netflix tab.\n\n7.

Hit **\u201cOverride\u201d** and enjoy **buttery-smooth, sharp video**.\n\n# \ud83d\udd01 Step 10: Repeat on Every Safari Restart\n\nSafari clears overrides after closing. So you'll need to repeat steps 4\u20139 each time you reopen Safari. It takes \\~30 seconds once you're used to it.",

I felt like there was this big build up that ultimately just was him going to jail with no resolution really. Also, in the beginning when the woman falls off the cliff, the police were back and forth about if she was already dead before she fell or not but we could clearly see she was dead. She also had some animal tear up her knee after she had been shot. When they finally showed the chain of events, it showed her getting shot, but no animals attacking her. It only showed her \u201cjump\u201d off the cliff. So, she wasn\u2019t dead? She committed suicide? Another thing, they made it seem like the man that was showing up to see the girl was this creepy ominous guy who she trusted. The way they showed him opening her bedroom window made it seem like he was going to hurt her. Idk, this show felt like the audience was being lead in different directions with no real \u201cah ha moment\u201d or pay off. oh and, the whole drug ring side plot was incredibly unnecessary in my opinion too.

        "content": "In the last few weeks we have been seeing this issue increase and it\u2019s getting super annoying - we\u2019ll be watching a show and randomly the loading/buffering symbol and 0% pops up and nothing happens. It just sits there on 0% until we back out to the menu and reopen the show. This happens on our LG tv, our Samsung tv, and two different Xbox series X consoles. We\u2019ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling it on our main LG tv and one Xbox, and are still having repetitive issues. The only thing that has changed was that I downgraded from premium to standard without ads, but I haven\u2019t seen any reported issues regarding that. Also, my internet wifi is a steady 400mbps+ and Netflix is the only app that does this, so it\u2019s not an internet problem. Anyone have any advice or tips to try to solve this problem?",

Is there really no hack to get it into portrait mode? I tried everything. Even looked for apps that can do this for me. Even restarted phone. And yes, rotate lock is off lol\n\nSeems ridiculous of them not to allow it ",

        "content": "I just finished watching Locked Up (Vis a Vis) Season 1 and I'm a bit confused jumping into Season 2. From what I know, Season 1 has 11 episodes. The last scene I watched was Zulema trying to escape by setting herself on fire, the Egyptian getting caught by Macarena's dad, and then her dad having a heart attack. Macarena\u2019s brother was going to the house like the dad told him.\n\nBut when I started Season 2 Episode 1, it suddenly shows Zulema escaping with Macarena, like they\u2019re working together now?? It feels like I missed something in between. Was there a special episode or recap I skipped? Can anyone explain the jump or what I should know before continuing?",
