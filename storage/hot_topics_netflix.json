You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

        "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69\\_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40)\n\nin 2018, on social media, Jerry Buting (Avery's defense lawyer in 2007) proclaimed this is the first he ever heard of this audio, and that the state knew they had found human remains in the 2 quarries adjacent to the Avery property.  (One of those properties was owned the Manitowoc County. Bones found on property owned by Manitowoc County not revealed to the defense)\n\n***Some context:***\n\n1. State of Wisconsin found Human remains on top of soil near Avery's trailer. They claimed that its where the bones were burned and cremated before even testing the burn pit soil for such evidence.\n2. State also found 4 locations (and at least some burn sites) in the quarry (piles 1-4 on map below)\n3. State wrote detailed report about the bones by Avery's trailer, and told the media, public, defense, and courts about them all the time.\n4. State didn't write any reports about the human remains in piles 1-4, didn't tell the media, public, defense, nor courts about them at all.\n5. The state forensic anthropologist examined these bones from piles 1-4 nearly a half year later, was told they were from the Avery property, and she included these bones in her summary a month before trial using the evidence numbers only and no description of where they originated from. Thus, Avery's defense team had no idea she included human remains found in the quarry in her final last minute report. Hell, she was unaware either.\n6. In court, the state claimed \"nobody knows what those are\" when referring to the quarry remains. A lie.\n\nIn short, the defense was misled about the human evidence, and they were arguing the quarry was the real crime scene. If the State had told the defense about ALL of the human remains, the defense's case would have been 100x stronger given they would be able to present human remains being found far away from their clients residence. After all, Avery wouldn't burn the body in the quarry then bring back evidence by his house to incriminate himself. No jury would buy that and the state knew that. They HAD to confine the crime scene as a whole to the Avery yard.\n\nThe kicker is the state didn't end up finding any evidence in Avery's burn pit proving a primary burn location, and their own expert testified that in her opinion, if it WASNT the primary burn location ,then she would have found other small, brittle bone fragments from other locations. (They did find exactly that, but she wasn't made aware of that when the evidence was turned over to her for examination).\n\nThose remains stashed in buckets for 6 months and never disclosed to the defense in a manner they could use. Defense claimed that area was crime scene at trial w/out this info.\n\nAnd for visual reference piles 1,2,3,4 are what the phone call is referencing, with piles 2 &amp; 3 being located on the Manitowoc County quarry (same county which was being sued by Avery for framing him in 1985). Just look how far away and huge the crib\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di0ai89pynpe1.png?width=2664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd8429946c0fbc869f6afa2629d14d82c454351c\n\nEnd Result:\n\nThis map was presented by Avery's lawyer to the court in 2018/2019. The court ruled it was barred from being used because Avery once filed his own pro se (on his own, and without a lawyer) motion years before Making a Murderer came out, and the court punished Avery for not bringing this unknown information up earlier (even though the phone call wasn't released via FOIA until 2018.\n\n...This audio and Jerry Buting's admission he was never given it was not filed in court, however. Nor was it shown in Making a Murderer part 2, which was released prior to this phone call being made public.",

There's alot I can and want to say about the show but to streamline this Jamie discussion I'll leave it at I loved the show and acting.\n\nAfter finishing I started scrolling through r/Netflix and the amount of threads and comments about how Jamie is a monster, he was a psychopath, etc... was shocking to me. \n\nYes what he did was horrible and the way he did it was clearly very brutal, but like wasn't the entire point of them constantly mentioning incels supposed to be a clear indication that Jamie was not actually a \"bad\" kid, but just a victim of this Andrew Tate anti-women movement? I thought it was so incredibly in your face the entire show that it would be impossible for anyone to not realize what the message of the show was, but like I said I found an astounding number of threads and comments completely ignoring that Jamie was molded into a monster, not born one.\n\nThe 4th episode is just the parents grieving about what they may have done wrong and they even literally talk about how they thought he was safe at home on his computer, how more obvious can the writers / directors make it? Yet somehow people came to the conclusion he was just born a psychopath and all he needed was a trigger?!?!?\n\nTLDR: This show is about how the incel / anti-women movement impacts our young men correct? Not about the next John Wayne Gacey getting caught early before he could do more harm? Its shocking how many people completely missed the purpose of the show and somehow came to the conclusion that Jamie was just a natural born psycho and nothing more.",

        "content": "I just finished Adolescence on Netflix and was pretty blown away by the acting, especially since they shot each episode in one continuous take.  Specifically, in Episode 3, there's a 45+ minute scene in which the young boy (Jamie) is in conversation with the clinical psychiatrist Briony.  \n\nMy question is, how did that young actor (Owen Cooper) pull it off? Did they do a ton of rehearsals? Did he ad-lib any of it?  Did they have his lines posted up on big boards that they hand-held for his use, which they somehow managed to keep out of sight of the (constantly moving) camera?  How many full takes did they do before they determined that they had what they needed? \n\nApparently he's an unknown actor and this was his first role. Even if he's older than 13 in real life, he's pretty darned young to be able to pull off such a performance. \n\nUPDATE - found this article - [Owen Cooper in Adolescence: is this the best child acting debut since Jodie Foster? | The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/tvfilm/boy-adolescence-owen-cooper-b1217411.html)  \\- he was 14 at the time, and the 50+ minute episode took 3 weeks to film; 1 week of rehearsals, 1 week of 'tech' rehearsals, 1 week of final filming with 2 takes a day, roughly.  So maybe they did up to 10 takes and picked the best one? \n\nPretty amazing. ",
