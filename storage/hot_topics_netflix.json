        "content": "For me, it's too close to call between three things:\n\n1) The sewage everywhere.\n\n2)  The completely irrational fear so many people had of pooping in a bag.\n\n3)  The women that were there having the bachelorette party.\n\nBacked up toilets making people walk through sewage... that's pretty messed up.  I don't want to imagine the smell or the illnesses people got because of it, but it's not going to last forever.  People have had to put up with worse.\n\nPooping in a bag... It beats pooping on the floor.  It's a logical measure to take when the sewage system stops working.  Poop in bags, it can all be collected, and it can be placed and contained in an appropriate area.  Truck drivers and van lifers poop in bags all the time.  It's no big deal.\n\nThose three women...  So many things about those women...\n\nFirst, the bride-to-be seemed like she was the inspiration for Kristen Wiig's role in The Californians on SNL...she was dripping with an abundance of unnecessary drama.  \"Why isn't the bar open???\"  Then taking the Imodium, doubling down on her fear of pooping without a toilet, and complaining about a soggy lettuce sandwich when there could have been zero food at all.\n\nThen the group talking about peeing in the shower.  It's like they were clueless about the fact they were born as human animals with biologic processes.  They seemed to not have an idea about how they could squat to pee in a shower.  They were disgusted with having to do it, needing a shower after.  Jeez ladies, it's just pee... ever been camping?",

        "content": "\nJust an idea: I think Netflix should add an incognito mode feature to the app! Sometimes users just want to watch something without it affecting their recommendations or appearing in their viewing history. This would be really helpful for people who share accounts, or even just for times when you\u2019re watching something different from your usual preferences\u2014like a kid\u2019s movie, a guilty pleasure show, or a documentary for school.\n\nAdding incognito mode would allow users to explore more content freely, without worrying about Netflix\u2019s algorithm messing up their suggestions. People use incognito mode in web browsers all the time for similar reasons\u2014why not bring that privacy option to streaming too?\n\nAlso, I noticed a small typo in the original idea\u2014\u201cincognito mouse\u201d was probably meant to say \u201cincognito mode.\u201d But hey, imagine a sneaky little mouse sneaking around Netflix too! \ud83d\ude04\n\nOverall, I think this feature could attract a lot more users and keep current ones happier.\n",

It wasn\u2019t bad at all.\n\nNetflix really needs to step up their game when it comes to promoting their content. There are so many decent shows and movies buried in there that never get the spotlight.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my quick review:\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe story was actually interesting. It felt like there\u2019s more to the story that we didn\u2019t get to see enough of. I\u2019d love to see it turned into a full series. it definitely has potential to expand.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\nThe animation could\u2019ve used some work. Most of the time, only the characters\u2019 mouths moved no facial expressions or detailed movement. It felt a bit stiff.\n\nA live-action version might be even better, honestly. The concept is strong enough to carry it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIt\u2019s enjoyable. I\u2019d give it a solid 7/10. Worth the watch. ",

Without giving away any plot points, if you appreciate intense, visceral action with a truly brutal edge, you absolutely need to add this to your watchlist. I'm not saying it's the same, but it delivers an unrelenting, high-octane experience that reminded me of the best parts of action thrillers, almost like a John Wick-level intensity but with its own distinct, darker flavor.\nIt's currently climbing the ranks on Netflix, and for good reason. Has anyone else watched it yet, or is it on your radar? Would love to hear your spoiler-free initial reactions or what you're hoping for if you plan to watch!\nCheers,\n\nu/killwish_",

        "title": "I loved K-Pop Demon Hunters \u2013 but I really hope they turn it into a full series!",
        "content": "Just watched K-Pop Demon Hunters and honestly, I LOVED it. The concept, the animation, the music, the action \u2013 it was such a fun ride with way more emotional depth than I expected. But I really hope this isn\u2019t the end and they continue the story, either with a sequel or (fingers crossed) a full series.\n\nThere\u2019s just so much more they could explore. Like, we never got the full story of how Rumi's mom fell in love with a demon?? That could be an entire arc on its own. Also, how did the girls even meet and form the band? The dynamic is so strong, and I\u2019d love to see those early days \u2013 both as idols and as demon hunters.\n\nPlus, the demon threat is definitely not over. At the end, the new Honmoon wasn\u2019t gold, which I\u2019m sure means demons can still escape into the human world. That feels like a huge open door for future stories.\n\nAnd okay, can we talk about Jinu?? I know he died, but he gave his soul to Rumi \u2013 what if that means he could come back? Maybe not as a human, but as an angel or some kind of spirit warrior? I feel like his story isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just hoping enough people support the movie so the creators get the green light to keep building this world. There\u2019s so much potential!\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

        "content": "I tend to watch teenie Bopper TV shows in the original Spanish so I can practice my language skills. I just watched another show with some of the same actors called Ni Una M\u00e1s (highly rec) and I had no problem understanding them. But in the olympos series I find it extremely difficult to understand them. I know in some instances there are clearly speaking catalan, but beyond that it does seem like it's mostly traditional Castilian Spanish. I guess I was hoping someone would tell me that they're from some region where the accent is definitely different or that they're speaking extremely fast. But any insight from native speakers or otherwise is appreciated",
