I hate watching episodes like this because it always makes me think the writers are sexual predators. Like this is not a real story, some poor professor is super innocent and all these young girls keep throwing themselves at him and his life gets ruined because someone takes revenge. This is the myth that predators hide behind.\n\nThis is the exact plot of Promising Young Woman in reverse, that also came out in 2020. When I was watching it, I thought Soulmates was recent so I was shocked. But knowing it\u2019s from 2020 too makes more sense, I don\u2019t think it would have been produced in a post-Promising Young Woman world. ",

What really stuck with me wasn\u2019t just the story, but how real the underlying themes felt. The hacking, the data breaches, the constant sense that someone\u2019s always watching it all got under my skin. I ended up going down a massive rabbit hole learning about cybersecurity, privacy tools, and how vulnerable most people really are online.\n\nNow I actually use different VPNs depending on what I\u2019m doing, run privacy tools to wipe old data, and even started monitoring data leaks with cloaked just to see how often our information ends up exposed.
