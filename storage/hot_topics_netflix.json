Both I watched 13 years ago.\n\nAnd coming to comedies I don't like comedies like \"Friends\", \"Seinfeld\", \"HIMYM\", \"BBT\", etc..though I like characters like Joey, Kramer, Howard but it becomes a slog waiting for them. \n\nI liked \"Office(US)\", \"Louie\", \"Two and a half men\", \"People just do nothing\", \"Silicon Valley\".\n\nEdit : Also any show you left midway because you became \"bored/tiresome\" or it lost the edge\n\nAgain this is all personal , please don't write things like \"you are too stupid\".\n\nThanks",

It doesn\u2019t even consider the app to have been opened, as I cannot force close it like you can other apps. \n\nI\u2019ve watched it on my phone within the last week, and for some reason it has now decided to no longer work. I\u2019ve deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, neither have worked. I can\u2019t even watch it on the internet browser as it just goes to a page that forces you to go to the app or manage account info. After even more troubleshooting, I have deleted the app and restarted my phone, no fix. Restarted my phone and left it off for ~5 minutes, no fix.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know any fixes? Help would be much appreciated. \n\nEdit: after dealing with 3 agents, no amount of troubleshooting has resolved the issue. Clearing cookies from my browser, cookies from Netflix itself, nothing will work. I\u2019m going to open a ticket tomorrow and will keep this post up in case anyone has a similar issue\n\nEdit 2: there\u2019s an update for Netflix now, fixed the issue. Guess it was a bug. ",

It\u2019s giving the \u201cInventing Anna\u201d energy but with much higher stakes. A fake cure to cancer that probably killed a lot of people and is still in line with the fake \u201ccures\u201d we see today for medically curable stuff. It\u2019s so fascinating and infuriating at the same time. I love this show, I hate this happened. I love it\u2019s being put out there. I haven\u2019t been so angry/interested in a show in a long time. 9/10 I would recommend! ",
