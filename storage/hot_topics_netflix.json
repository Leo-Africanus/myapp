Why didn't anyone say to the father when he gave those lies about Mag's father: Didn't your daughter claim to be friends with Mags? If she had been murdered by Jason, why didn't she know already to be afraid of him? Why did she marry someone who she thought had killed her friend?\n\nThere were SO many opportunities here to catch these people up in her lies and to send them to jail forever, and I am just beyond disgusted that there wasn't a bigger push to expose her for the BPD lying fraud she is, and HE is.",

That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

        "content": "I\u2019ve owned this console since it was first released and Netflix has been the poorest performing streaming app by far. \n\n1.  While opening Netflix takes a considerably a longer time to boot and load. Prime, YouTube, Hulu, Paramount Plus, Peacock, HBO Max , they all boot up almost instantly. Never Netlfix, and then our next problem: \n\n2. 80% of the time it doesn\u2019t actually boot correctly to the Home Screen, rather you get an error message. \u201cNetflix isn\u2019t working right now\u201d. After 2-6 failed connecting it will finally load with that loud drum sound \u201cdun dunnnnn\u201d\n\n3. This past couple of weeks on the home page the images for the shows and movies don\u2019t load, making it impossible to browse and select, the unloading grey boxes don\u2019t have written titles so selections don\u2019t work. Useless. \n\n4. Same issue while logging into my laptop, no images load. \n\n5. With Netflix prices going up and up and poor quality from the platform it\u2019s getting really tough to justify continuing to pay for a subscription. The app has never stacked up to the speed and quality to YouTube, Prime and virtually every other streaming platform. Choices of shows are great but when the UI interface is buggy and the damn thing doesn\u2019t even load correctly it\u2019s honestly not the top streaming app it once was. \n\n",
