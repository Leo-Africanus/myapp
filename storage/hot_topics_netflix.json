Literally everyone\u2019s characteristics in this series are the same. The character designs are sooo bland. I can\u2019t sit through 9 hours of very slow burn screenplay to get the \u2018AHHHHH\u2019 moment in the 10th episode. I usually like \u2018mind-melting\u2019 series which makes me think more. Idk what\u2019s happening with this one. Should i continue it and give it a shot?",

But I\u2019ve noticed that the \u2018feel good with the fake obsticals to overcome\u2019 style is irritating me. \n\nFor example a house make over show that pretends there is a storm coming and they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll finish, while in reality there is no storm it\u2019s just editing, that combining with a lot of dramatic and over the top editing and personalities is tiring to me.\n\nI saw a show called Motel Makeover or something that was less of what I described above so I enjoyed that very much, they didn\u2019t pretend to have problems all there problems were pretty real and the brushed over it pretty quickly. Also I didn\u2019t like the final table because it felt rigged at the end and too dramatic. But food related content is also up my alley!\n\nEdit: Love all the suggestions please keep them coming so I have a list!!",

Why are they not treating the place as a crime scene? Why isn\u2019t he taken back to the station to file a formal report?\nHow does a lawman fail to recognize the difference between running over a nail and a textbook slashed tire on the side wall? Why would the reporter be considered or treated as a suspect off the bat? just because he's a writer, he's automatically a body chopping homicidal individual? this is no Jussie Smollett case,(all though even his \"assailants\" were taken under better preliminary scrutiny) it's a possible cartelish sounding case with professionals at hand, which is far more pressing. yes, there's little proof to corroborate his story, but can a real cop tell us what would have taken place if a CNN or Fox personality with news media influence came to them with such a story?\nWhy hasn\u2019t the reporter contacted his colleagues at the station? And why would he even stay near that property alone after the police left?\nThis isn\u2019t a critique of the characters in this pilot ep.\u2014it's about the story writing. It\u2019s unrealistic, sloppy, and a product of LOUSY MADNESS so far.\n\nLousy madness or keep watching it gets better? \n",

This show had that 3x over, and did so wonderfully, BUT with so much to cover, I think the amount of minutes it took to do that may have been a factor that made it hard for me to get invested in much earlier than I did.\n\nAgain, being that the amount of time it took to take off was my only real issue, I am sincerely hoping that the next seasons kind of roll on a bit more quickly.\n\nAnd anyone that was a MEGA fan of the series...\nWhich season is your favorite?\nAny recommendations for after?\nThx!",

        "content": "Hey everyone! I recently finished *The Three-Body Problem* on Netflix and absolutely loved it. The blend of science fiction, complex plots, and philosophical themes really intrigued me. Now, I\u2019m looking for TV shows that have a similar vibe something with deep world-building, intriguing scientific concepts, and maybe some mind-bending ideas.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen the show, you probably know what I mean. I\u2019m specifically looking for shows that explore big concepts, space, or even the intersection of science and philosophy (like the nature of intelligence, technology, or human existence).\n\nAny recommendations?",

        "title": "\"Our Little Secret\" (2024) | Movie Discussion",
        "content": "OK, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I can't tell if I enjoyed this more than \"Hot Frosty\". Either way, it still didn't scratch that rom-com itch like I was hoping. It's always nice to see Lindsay Lohan and Kristin Chenoweth, and there were parts here and there that were enjoyable, but I think this leaned a bit more toward rom-drama than rom-com. \n\nThe high-at-church bit was probably the highlight (no pun intended), but an accidentally-on-drugs scene isn't exactly breaking new ground. The dog thing just gave me anxiety (I always worry about ppl feeding my dog things he can't eat, so even her pushing the cookies near the dog made me uneasy), so no laughs for me there.  The end honesty reveals with everyone was fun for a second before it became really sad.  I guess like a lot of downers in this one between all the cheating and the mom's death, so just not exactly what I was expecting going into this kind of movie. \n\nSo yeah, at this point, I don't know if anything is going to be topping \"Nobody Wants This\" this year for my favorite rom-com.  Recommendations very much welcome! ",
