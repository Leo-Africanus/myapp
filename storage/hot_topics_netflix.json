I\u2019m not good at understanding themes so forgive me if some of my questions are really stupid. \n\nTHEME QUESTIONS \n\n1. What does the child being sent up represent in both movies? I understand how the platform is supposed to represent capitalism and society but what does that he children being sent up supposed to represent? \n\n2. What does the children scene in platform 2 represent? The one with all the kids fighting for the top of the pyramid? Why does the winner of the game get sent to the bottom of the platform? What is that even supposed to mean. \n\n3. What was the animal cruelty supposed to represent? The cruelty of people? There\u2019s one scene where the platform goes all the way to the bottom and we hear animals clawing and growling. What does that mean?\n\n4. What was the point of the fat guy who liked pizza. What was his representation of the theme? \n\n5. There were several biblical references throughout, like mentoring the word savior multiple times, 666 people in the platform, and the christian black guy. What do those represent? \n\n6.  Does the law and the people trying to enforce the one meal a day in platform 2 supposed to represent communism? \n\n\n\nPLOT QUESTIONS \n\n1. Was the girl at the bottom real in platform 1? Was she the message? I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not because they show in the mid credits scene the chefs reacting to the panna cotta but not the kid.\n\n2. How does the main character girl of platform 2 survive at the very bottom of the pit all the way until she is reunited with her ex?\n\n3. What is the point of the platform? Is it like the cube where we\u2019ll never know its purpose? \n\n4. Why does miharu search for her kid after willingly let her kid play in the pyramid game? She knew that there was a chance of her kid getting chosen right?\n\n5. So sending a kid up wasn\u2019t the message right? Because the girl sent up the black kid and the platform kept on going. What\u2019s the point of the kids then. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot and some of them might be stupid questions but i\u2019m a stupid person so thanks if you can answer these ",
