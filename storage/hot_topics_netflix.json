        "content": "I just finished Secret Mall Apartment and I honestly don't know where I stand on it. The story is a total 2000s fever dream. It\u2019s about eight artists building a hidden 750sq-ft flat inside a Rhode Island mall and living there for years. The lo-fi footage they captured back in 2003 is incredible, but the doc raises some massive questions that I haven't stopped thinking about.\n\nOn one hand, you have Michael Townsend and his crew, who frame this as a \"living art\" protest against corporate gentrification. You can\u2019t help but be impressed by the pure audacity it took to smuggle cinder blocks and furniture past security for four years. For the \"art is life\" crowd, it\u2019s an inspiring story about reclaiming space from billionaires.\n\nOn the other hand, the film itself acknowledges a huge elephant in the room: white privilege. The artists admit they likely only got away with this because of how they looked, and some of the \"magical\" reenactments (like using a diverse cast of actors for a mostly white project) feel like they're trying to rebrand a very specific, privileged experience into something more universal. It also touches on the heavy personal cost, showing how Townsend\u2019s singular obsession with the project eventually led to the end of his marriage.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see what everyone else thinks!!\n\nIs this a brilliant act of resistance that proves art can happen anywhere?\n\nOr is it just a case study in how \"mischief\" is only called \"art\" when the people doing it have a certain level of privilege?",

They repeat several times that they are not even sure it\u2019s a real missile that will explode, and they don\u2019t know who launched it. So it makes for a compelling \u201clet\u2019s try to fix things when we know nothing about what needs fixing\u201d plot, but how overly dramatic everyone is just feels dumb when you get to the end and there is no resolution.\n\nTrained soldiers are crying, a high level official kills himself, people advise the president to nuke random countries to show they\u2019re not weak, and it\u2019s not even presented as an insane recommendation.\n\nAgain, they say THEMSELVES they don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s really a functional nuclear missile and they have no clue who sent it\u2026 why would they commit suicide or start a nuclear war with Russia or North Korea out of the blue with that little information? This is completely crazy and an insanely stupid outcome. It\u2019s only been 2 hours and nothing has happened yet, why being so extreme so fast? Right now, the problem is to see whether it hits Chicago or not, if you can mitigate the loss or life and where the threat comes from. These are the things you need to take action on, not pressure the president to pull the trigger on someone at random.\n\nAlso everyone seems to do the bare minimum: oh too bad our attempts to stop it failed twice, well let\u2019s nuke Russia instead of using our other counter missiles when we don\u2019t even know if this is a real threat. Oh Chicago may be destroyed in 1 hour well let\u2019s not everyone try to evacuate or warn people to find a shelter that could reduce the damage, it will probably just save a few anyway.\n\nAnd the NSA guy just discussing classified stuff in the street and the hallways?\n\nThe ending just made me feel the movie thought it was smart and asking tough question, showing a Shakespearian dilemma\u2026 And I could get the dumb responses when you\u2019re under pressure and have no information. But honestly, the fact it ends there just feels like a dumb plot while it could have looked much smarter with either different options presented to the president or someone showing the president say \u201clol no this is insane, if we can\u2019t prevent it anyway, let\u2019s take time to gather intel and I\u2019ll decide to nuke someone or not later\u201d.

        "content": "Please recommend me a good romance movie on Netflix that I can enjoy during a relaxed evening or a quiet weekend. I\u2019m looking for a film with a strong emotional core, meaningful character development, and a story that feels heartfelt rather than overly dramatic. A movie where the chemistry between the leads feels natural and the relationship grows in a believable way would be perfect. I\u2019d really appreciate something that balances romance with a thoughtful storyline\u2014maybe with a touch of humor, warmth, or even a bit of life realism mixed in. It doesn\u2019t have to be extremely intense, but it should leave a lasting impression and make me feel emotionally connected to the characters. A romance that explores themes like love, timing, personal growth, or second chances would be ideal. If possible, I\u2019d also love a movie that has good music, beautiful visuals, or a comforting vibe that makes it enjoyable to rewatch. Overall, I\u2019m hoping for a romantic movie on Netflix that feels genuine, memorable, and satisfying, and that can make me smile, reflect, or even tear up a little by the time the credits roll.",

        "content": "hi!\n\n  \nsorry for asking in advance! I've recently discovered Netflix Puzzled, and kinda love it, and really wanna get a full experience out of it. but everything, from levels to streaks, is locked behind Netflix membership. I, sadly, can't even create an account, let alone purchase a membership (region lock stuff, not available in my region), not do I really want to pay for Netflix subscription just for this one game. so I was wondering, is there any way to play it without subscription?..\n\n  \nthanks in advance!\ud83e\udd27\ud83d\ude4f\n\n",

        "content": "I\u2019m watching stranger things on Netflix and the screen randomly faded to black for a split second. It was very random and abrupt in the middle of the characters talking, it didn\u2019t fit the scene at all which is why I noticed it.\n\nI refreshed the Netflix app and the original black flash was gone from the scene, but then the screen faded black again about two seconds later instead.\n\nI recorded it when it happened both times but I didn\u2019t realise I can\u2019t post videos on this subreddit. \n\nI\u2019m not really bothered by it, just curious what could be causing it. I\u2019m watching on an Ipad. Could this be an app glitch, buffering, something else?\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",

        "content": "I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m really drawn to movies that have a very raw, immersive atmosphere or a certain kind of vibe to them...Let me give you some examples. I\u2019m a huge fan of movies like American Honey, Victoria, The Florida Project, Girl Interrupted, Nerve, Wild Orchid, Under the Silver Lake, Sex Lies and Videotape, Thelma &amp; Louise, Silver Linings, Fall, The Notebook, Promising Young Woman, The Age of Adaline, The Lake House, Gasoline Rainbow. Series: Euphoria, Behind her eyes, The OA, Scenes from a Marriage, Poker Face.\nI\u2019m basically looking for anything that captures that same atmospheric feeling or intensity, engaging vibe, whether it's a series or a single film.\nThank you so much!!!",
