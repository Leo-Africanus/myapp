I love horror, but I don't watch it that much anymore so some horror suggestions would be nice, but more so on the serial killer type of vibe rather than supernatural. I also have started to enjoy romance, especially when it is kind of forbidden or unique, like the film 'The Tearsmith' I thought that was amazing. Maybe drop some of your favourite movies and series and let me know why you liked it!  I'll list some stuff that I have watched and enjoyed. \n\n\\- Vampire Diaries\n\n\\- Stranger Things \n\n\\- Heartstopper\n\n\\- Lost \n\n\\- I enjoy Harlan Coben's limited series\n\n\\- All of us are dead\n\n\\- Alice in borderland\n\n\\- Young royals\n\n\\- You\n\n\\- The summer I turnt pretty\n\n\\- Big fan of the Texas Chainsaw massacre franchise\n\nThanks in advance! :) ",

        "title": "Another Post about the new Horrible UI change ... with suggestions",
        "content": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!!\u00a0**That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

The only reason I have a Netflix account is so I can use a specific extension in conjunction with Netflix (Lingopie). This extension works just fine when watching on my desktop.\n\nJust so you can understand the limitations I'm trying to work around, I'll list them out here.\n\n1. I have to use a tablet (or other mobile form-factor) so I can use it while travelling\n2. I cannot use the Netflix app, it doesn't allow extensions at all\n3. I cannot use Chrome, it doesn't allow extensions while on mobile/tablet\n4. I cannot use Firefox, my extension isn't available as an add-on\n5. I'm using Lemur browser. I haven't tried other browsers such as Kiwi, Brave, etc but I'm like 90% sure the issue isn't the browser.\n\nWhile using Lemur browser, I've gotten to the point where I've logged in to the desktop site, and I have the extension downloaded and seemingly working just fine alongside the site. I can browse my shows and I can see the extension the same way it works on my desktop. \n\nHowever, once I press play on a show, I get an error:\n\n    This title is not available to watch instantly. Please try another title.\n    \n    Error Code E100\n\nI've tried everything on the Help Page, but nothing has worked. I'm open to whatever can allow me to use my Netflix extension while travelling, even if it means going back to the drawing board.",

        "content": "As I muse upon my viewing habits whilst performing my daily constitutional, within the hulk of a service that playfully calls itself Streamberry, a grey cloud haunts my brain, such as the grey cloud that haunts almost every UK series I\u2019ve watched in the few months, The Terror and Dept. Q. This may not be a new phenomenon, but today felt more overcast than a thick London fog. \n\nAt first, I considered that I was the problem, knowing full well that my mental and physical health dwindle at an ever increasing pace, due to age, economics and the travesty we call politics. My therapist confirmed that my self diagnosed early onset dementia was not producing visual impairment and my optometrist reviewed the test results and ruled out glaucoma or macular degeneration. I consulted with Seth Rogan who\u2019s depth of the industries inner workings is beyond measure, reassured me that it\u2019s not a common issue, and is likely due to a poor understanding of post production processes. Lastly, the geopolitical storm I\u2019m told does not affect or is an effect on image quality, the oligarchs and despots are too occupied with 4-D chess than to meddle in a $100B industry; it\u2019s a battle that no one wins. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve concluded, after much debating with the factions in my brain, and just before I blot my nethers dry post a thorough washlet blasting, that I refuse to watch another visually depressed, smoke filled, grainy darkness while clearly filmed in broad daylight travesty. No matter the depth and nuanced interpretation of a Pulitzer novel or a gripping horror where tension is built with the lack of knowing what\u2019s around the corner or behind the billowing curtain, I cannot, no, will not be bothered with the crap eye strain that comes from this channel that tags itself as Moody or Dark. \n\nRaise your arms in protest, nay raise your finger the next time one of these disappointments catch your attention. Do not give to the promises of rich storytelling and star studded casts. \n\n/s, so much /s that Monty Python would cringe. \n",

Like I said we managed to get in but we have to do damage control and I don't know what to do from here. Is the Netflix customer support actually helpful with this or will we need to figure it out ourselves? \n(This is a hacking that happened after my moms Instagram got hacked, under the same email, so if you guys could give tips for her to try and stop the email hacker that would be great too tysm)",

        "content": "I need help finding a movie that came out 1 or 2 years ago. It was a Spanish speaking movie and started off with a little kid who has a variety of different hats. He also has like a bunch of wild animals I think?? I don't really remember much but there was a scene where his uncles come over and gave him gifts. I think it was his birthday. \n\nI'm pretty sure his uncles are part of the cartel or mafia. The movie looks great visually and is so vibrant from what I remember. I've only seen like the first 20 mins so I can't really explain much more. \n\nPls help someone has to know which movie this is!!!\n\n\n\nEdit: the kid was dressed somewhat resemblance to the style of a Mariachi band member.\n\nEdit: The movie is \"Down The Rabbit Hole\"",

The guy is obviously inebriated and starts getting handsy, which she tries to put a stop to. Things get physical, and as she tries to escape him she falls off the cliff and hits her head on the ground. The guy runs off and she isn\u2019t found for a couple of hours by her friends.\n\nSorry that\u2019s all I can remember! I can\u2019t put any names or faces to the scene unfortunately. TIA!",

He thinks everyone around him is stupid but Doakes, LaGuerta, Debra, and even Quinn all start catching on he\u2019s just lucky lmao",
