The landscapes are insane, the action hits hard (not just shootouts, but brutal hand-to-hand stuff), and the story actually moves.\n\nIt\u2019s not all talky drama, but when there\u2019s dialogue, it matters. The main characters are solid. Isaac Reed is a total mystery, and the tension between settlers, Native tribes, and religious groups feels so real. It also ties in actual historical events, which makes it feel even more grounded.\n\nNot gonna lie, it\u2019s dark and violent, so don\u2019t expect any warm, fuzzy cowboy vibes. It\u2019s like if Yellowstone and The Revenant had a gritty baby. Definitely worth the watch if you\u2019re into intense Westerns or just want a break from the usual predictable shows. \n\n",

I would absolutely not waste time watching something with this person in it, in fact I would thumbs down it on Netflix without watching it, and I don\u2019t do that. If something was playing at the dentists office with this person in it, I would ask for the remote.\n\nSo if I don\u2019t watch the movie, will I be sent any other previews? I really want to be in the preview club, but this is worst case scenario. I would rather watch a presidential debate. How ironic is it that I\u2019m open to literally anything but this dumb b. \nSo do I skip\u2026 or watch it, bleach my eyes and ears, and then shit all over the survey? ",
