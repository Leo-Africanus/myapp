        "content": "Heya,\n\n  \nBeen having these issues for a while now, and can't seem to find a permanent fix for them:  \nWhenever I play Netflix in Brave (Chromium based browser) the quality lowers repeatedly once every \\~10 seconds, the quality gets lowered every \\~10 seconds in this order:  \n1080 -&gt; 720 -&gt; 540 -&gt; 432 -&gt; 342\n\nThis is exclusively with Hardware acceleration disabled (which I have to have off more often than not as it causes other issues at times), and if there's a solution for the above where I can leave it off that'd be grand. I could live with having to relaunch the browser for this (probably) but would prefer a permanent fix that doesn't require this as it can be a bit of a pain and feels unnecessary.\n\n  \nAs for the other issue: \n\nI am completely unable to use Netflix in any other browsers or in the app:  \nThey will forcibly log me out upon starting a video, it doesn't even get to play a single frame, usually accompanied with an UI3012 error code, or it just hangs on the loading symbol and a black screen forever. I'm always logged out of the app/browser (Edge) no matter if I signed in 5 seconds before upon restarting it or even hitting the home button.\n\n  \nThe only thing I can come up with is that it's somehow related to being Windows 11 Pro N, but I couldn't find anything regarding that and Netflix having issues when I googled just now (googling for Windows 11 Pro N seems to basically ignore the N part). \n\nHardware acceleration enabled and disabled makes no difference for this issue.\n\n  \nHoping someone knows a fix for either or both of these issues!",
