It\u2019s one of those shows that I really want to like. But it\u2019s embarrassingly awful. The whole Rats storyline is annoying and boring and all the characters dull as rocks with not a good actor in the bunch. I hope the last two episodes at least have a decent payoff. Hemsworth is doing an ok job as Geralt but I def prefer Cavill. I\u2019m not even up to speed on the future of the series but if a season five is planned I may have to nope out at this point. I can see why Cavill wanted out.",
