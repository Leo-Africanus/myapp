What they eventually found in his house is wild. And the connection to Lewis is super sketchy.\n\nHonestly feels like this should\u2019ve raised way more red flags back then. Makes the Tylenol case even creepier in hindsight.\n\nAnyone else still thinking about that part? Curious what others make of it, coincidence or something bigger?",
