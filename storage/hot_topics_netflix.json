        "content": "!!!Spoilers for Sirens!!!\n\nOkay I just finished Sirens and I need to rant (I apologize this is long)\n\nI hate Devon. Like with a burning passion.\n\nShe called her sister a wh\\*re for sending fruit then sucks a guy off because she can't smoke??? And then licks the guy who drives her to a hotel???? Goes to a bar want just wanting to f\\*ck?? Then f\\*cks a gardner. And not to mention she's been sleeping with a married man. Pot is calling the kettle black here.\n\nShows up to her sister's work and threatens to basically cause trouble for her instead of just waiting later to talk like her sister asked.\n\nIs rude to her sister's boss before even really knowing her and then says that she should have been told her sister got a nose job as if Simone isn't an adult and can make her own choices.\n\nDemands her sister move back and help with their father. I get siblings should but she offered to help with money which would be good cause it sounds like he needs a home nurse or go to a place where they can take care of him full time or someone who can take care of him full time. Either sibling spending all their time taking care of a parent is not it. And let's not forget the dad neglected and abused Simone, so why would she want to help in the first place.\n\nSays personal stuff about their life to random people SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW!!!!\n\nGoes to the party after Simone told her to stay in the house until she was done with work and she shows up causing problems. No respect for Simone at all.\n\nThey give her money to take care of her dad because Simone doesn't want her there and demands her sister come home???? Like what. She clearly doesn't want to go. A sibling showing up to their siblings work and demanding their grown adult sibling to go home with them when it's clear the sibling doesn't want to is beyond wild.\n\nTalks about how her boss is controlling AS IF DEVON ISN'T. Girl is trying to force her sister home to take care of their dad because she doesn't want to do it alone and thinks Simone's owes her and wants her on meds. Says \"You're going to buffalo with me\" like huh?!?! How is that not controlling?\n\nBelieved strangers about gossip and ran with it. Gossip she heard in jail by a drunk lady who couldn't even remember Devon's name.\n\nSimone doesn't owe her anything. Simone was in an abusive environment before Devon come back and when her sister was somewhere else she shows up demanding she return home to help take care of their dad. And tries to guilt her into coming back when she refuses multiple times. What person wants to help someone who neglected and abused them and furthered their trauma?? And even says \"You don't feel any responsibility for him?\" um no. Since when are children supposed to be indebted to their abusers. And then she tries to tell her \"You sound like a b\\*tch off your meds\". You mean her anxiety meds? The ones her doctor told her she doesn't need to take because you can heal from it. Then says \"you are only alive because of me\", and that means she owes you? She then left her to be abused/neglected and are actively trying to manipulate her, she owes her nothing. And then storms away saying \"You don't need me anymore well good f\\*cken luck\" as if Simone hasn't been doing things on her own for 10 years!!!! Like dear lord.\n\nLater kinda blames her drinking and DUI on someone else as if they forced her to. Like you chose to drink he just drank with you. And got mad when he offered her a drink, which is what she normally does and she yells at him. He didn't even know she was sober when she yelled at him!! Like girl you are the problem.\n\nSimone isn't a saint at all but dear god why is Devon so insufferable. The ultimate victim mentality. I get she's mad and has trauma but dear lord above.\n\nAnd honestly I don't see how Peter is a monster either. The ending seems like Devon and Michaela are calling him one. But like what did he do that's monstrous? Sure he lied about going to see his son and grandchild, not exactly a terrible thing and completely understandable. Yes he kissed Simone and it wasn't right but neither pursued it after until Michaela fired her. And Michaela then fires her knowing what the job means to her and lies about it because she wants to get the upper hand on Peter or to keep her marriage that isn't exactly working anyway cause neither are very happy (wasn't very clear to me). Like no one in this situation is really a monster or all that terrible. Honestly the worst people to me are Devon and Ethan. Devon for all the reasons above and Ethan cause man over stepped his bounds  and didn't respect her privacy then acted like a man child and wouldn't take no for an answer at first then was being a jerk.\n\nEnd of rant.",

        "content": "I just saw my mother watching some foreign nonsense called The Sea Beyond earlier today. Not sure what it's all about, didn't really give a dang to find out. All I know about it was that it's another random foreign show Netflix has in its catalog, and it is one with horrid translation issues. And with this one, it's the worst I've ever seen with any of them as the subtitles were on as she watched it and literally NOTHING was matching what the actors, or rathe yet the DUBBED actors, were reciting or saying AT ALL!\n\nThat's been a major issue I've had with Neflix for years now when it comes to how they handle captions and subtitles for foreign shows and here, it's far more worse than any other one I've seen. I don't know why they never fixed that issue, but when it comes to the hard of hearing, it really does them a disservice more when they don't realize what they're reading doesn't match of to what they're watching.\n\nEspecially when they're charging nearly thirty bucks a month for the bloody thing. With all that they could've been able afford to improve their subtitle tech. Use AI on that for improved accuracies or something , if they want. ",

After and after the murderer gets on of the kids till no one is left over. The acting was like simmiliar to a scary movie film (horror with a little bit of comedy i think) i rember an exact scene where the murderer put a guy with a black leather jacket in an oven.",

        "content": "Hi it's my first post here,\n\nI have been recently running into this issue where I cannot set Netflix's Smart Downloading feature to use more than 9.5gb of storage and don't know why this is a case, I have tried this on both Android 10 and Android 15 thinking it might of been a container-based issue with the way Google have Implemented a feature that restricts what files apps have access to, I found this wasn't the case and I thought this might of just been a cap assigned by netflix probably because of licencing, I tried searching this up and I found that this cap seemed to be undocumented as of my current research and so I don't know if this is just a problem with me. I do have Netflix Premium so I don't know why this could be a problem since it's noted that premium has more features compared to the other plans and it just says I can download on up to 6 supported devices at a time but never specified how much I could download.\n\nI am a person that notices every aspect of quality change and like my downloaded content to be at least 1080p.\n\nSorry i had to use this account, I didn't have enough karma on my \"main\".",

It doesn\u2019t happen when playing on non fullscreen and also doesn\u2019t happen with other apps like YouTube. Anyone know how to fix this issue? It rlly bothers me cuz it takes out of the watching experience ",

        "content": "Just binged Sirens \u2013 loved it but confused about one thing (Simone)\n\nSo I just powered through Sirens in a day (don\u2019t judge me lol) and honestly, it was hilarious. Super fun watch. I thought the ending was perfect \u2014 Peter trading in his wife for a younger, better-looking one? Iconic. Good for him \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut one thing kinda confused me\u2026 why was the whole staff so happy and even playing music when Simone got fired? I mean yeah, she was a little intense and definitely had that boss energy, but I didn\u2019t really catch her being straight-up rude to everyone. Did I miss something? Or was it more subtle? Just felt like there was something I wasn\u2019t picking up on.\n\nAlso, Devon. Man. It felt like she was kinda in love with being miserable? Like her sister chose a life of comfort and happiness, and Devon just could not wrap her head around it. It\u2019s like she couldn\u2019t grasp that maybe not everyone wants to be in the struggle all the time lol.\n\nAnyway, would love to hear what y\u2019all thought. Did I just miss some major cues?",
