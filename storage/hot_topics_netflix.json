        "content": "(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nThe way American Primeval wrapped up was straight-up poetic. The Mormons taking over Utah showed just how ruthless power grabs were back then . Ironically the same kind of evil that was forced onto them when their religion first started. Jim Bridger giving up his fortress really drove home the idea that every man has a price. Sometimes even the strongest can be swayed. The Natives gave up their right to peace with the whites just to keep Abish safe, only for Jacob to be the one who killed her. That was brutal. And Isaac\u2019s last act, getting Devin and Sarah to safety was a heartbreaking parallel to what he couldn\u2019t do for his own wife and son. The worst part? That\u2019s exactly what got him killed. Every story came full circle in a way that felt raw, tragic, and strangely perfect. I give it a 9.6",

I would have loved more time with Mo\u2019s brother Sameer delving deeper into his autism diagnosis and I also would have loved more depth on Mo\u2019s sister and her relationship with her mother. The trip to Palestine episode was heartbreaking and I could have done a whole season there as well. I really just love this cast and love the writing. Does anyone know how viewership is faring? Does anyone think there\u2019s any chance the show could be extended for a third season? Curious as to what rationale went into renewing for a second and final season from Netflix (unless this decision came from Mo)! ",

Just to get her husband and daughter to be there when it happens? \n\nWhat is the billionaire aiming to achieve? Have it all for herself? Fine, disappear the 2 astronauts, but did she really have no other option that to kill 178 people?! Why have the husband and girl killed? Or, why not kill the assistant instead, that's one hell of a loose end. \n\nAnd also, you spent hundreds of millions for the mission but get your astronauts fly economy??!! No private jet?
