The mix of tech, paranoia, social commentary, and all the weird psychological stuff hits different compared to most series out right now.  \n  \nI checked Netflix but their recommendations felt kind of random and not really in the same vibe. Before I start scrolling for an hour, is there anything on Netflix with a similar feel? Something with hacking, underground groups, heavy atmosphere, or that same kind of tension where you never fully know who to trust.  \nI am not expecting a perfect match since Mr. Robot is pretty unique, but anything close in tone or theme would be solid. Would appreciate any suggestions from people who watch the same kind of shows.",

Of course there's the inevitable time-skip to compensate for the actors aging, but I don't really see it as that big of a deal. I was scared I wouldn't remember anything from the previous seasons considering how long it took, but I guess Stranger Things is just one of those shows where once you pick it back up, you suddenly remember everything. Again, I'm only two episodes in right now, but so far, I like it a lot. It could be that I've been starved of any Stranger Things content for a while now, but it's just nice to watch it again. In episode one I got so scared cause I thought they just killed off Dustin. They for real had me concerned. Besides that, I'm enjoying it. What do you think?",

        "title": "Missing: Dead or Alive S2 Analysis",
        "content": "Anyone else think that Eric Greene didn't do it and that Jersey and James Kelly framed him?\n\n1) When Jersey was at the police station he complained that they had been holding him there for \"4 hours.\" When he was being interviewed he said he went to some other house and waited for \"4 hours.\" Just seemed like an evasive type of phrase he uses. Like he wants the listener to focus on how long he was occupied with something rather than what he was really doing there.\n\n2) Detective Raine said that Jersey and James didn't know each other, she emphasized that their stories matched even though they didn't know each other twice...and yet Jersey was at James house often? They definitely all knew each other. Certainly enough to plot to frame someone within the group...especially the time that they first visited James and there was someone else in his house and they were pretty sure it was Jersey (who tipped them off to talk to James anyway? Wasn't it Eric?). I also didn't like that Detective Raine at first was like \"Jersey's name keeps coming up\" and then later switched that to \"Easy's name keeps coming up\" and yet that didn't seem true. Eric/Easy's name didn't come up hardly at all except by Jersey and James.\n\n3) Sunshine would probably have spoken if the police seemed like they were going to catch the correct people. When she said \"that's a sad story\" it was obvious she knew what happened but it seemed to me that the story was wrong and the tears were less likely about Morgan and more that she was still going to have to deal with the guys who actually did it.\n\n4) Jersey makes a point to claim that Eric was involved with the top drug dealers...and yet the other police department investigating the top drug dealers said that Jersey was involved and didn't mention Eric. Perhaps the cops are in on the framing of Eric for this reason because it is way too obvious that it was Jersey.\n\n5) Jersey showed with ease how Morgan was strangled. If it was not something he had done before he would have fumbled with his hands and wouldn't have done the extra squeeze. He claimed previously that he would shoot people just because he wanted to and they found a gun and there was no follow up on that either. When the guy who found the skull said it looked like cartel did it...why was that? Was there a bullet hole? Did they choke him out, move him, then shoot him so there wouldnt be mess in James house or the car?\n\n6) Eric's angry reaction to being framed seemed very genuine as did his last words in the court room. There was no pause. He probably caused Jersey and James problems and having him framed was a solution. And the other big drug investigation cops likely also saw framing Eric as an easy solution to protecting their investigation. I don't think Detective Raine was happy with likely being told to handle the case that way, especially on TV. She seemed quite tense and \"scripted\" as people have complained about. I don't think she (or the captain) wanted things to be handled that way. I wonder if that's why they are doing the show or if they had gone too far with it and had to wrap it up and add in a second story to distract. Bet they wanted people to focus on the trans aspect.\n\n7) If Jersey is dealing with a big drug ring he's not stupid. He probably was cutting James in on the money. James was very obviously not \"scared\" when he said he was scared. His original demeanor with the cops was what kind of guy he is because he was caught off guard and he was putting on a full act in the station. Saying he was nervous was not him opening up about his feelings, it was setting a narrative out there to cover up how his behavior being \"off\" might be from nerves rather than lying.\n\nThis guy Eric Greene got put away for 57 years. Looked like Jersey got put away for something as well, but if him and James are out, I bet they start the whole thing back up again. All the witnesses who had their homes \"invaded\" never mentioned Eric, they mentioned Jersey. Well technically they all mentioned 2 guys and technically the show didn't confirm that the other guy was Eric, maybe it was or maybe it was someone else important for the big drug investigation who's name couldn't even be aired in the show. I bet Eric was actually Morgan's friend based on the video of Morgan talking to \"Easy\" in the store. I bet part of Eric's anger is that he didn't have any evidence on Jersey or James to give the police, but there's no way that all he said in the interview was that he didn't do it. They didn't show what he would have claimed his alibi to be because anyone who says they didn't do it has to have some kind of alibi story even if its a weak one.\n\nI wonder if Eric is fighting to get out or not, if he even can and what kind of family he has or what his background is, the show really didn't seem to want to let us know too much about him.",

        "content": "So I got into this debate with my friend about which show actually stands on top, Stranger Things or Squid Game. And honestly, I\u2019m firmly on the Stranger Things side. For me, it\u2019s not just a show; it\u2019s a whole world you sink into. The mix of supernatural horror, 80s nostalgia, and those genuinely loveable characters makes it feel richer and more emotional. You grow up with the kids, you get invested in every friendship, every twist, every villain. Even the side stories feel meaningful. And the world-building? Massive. The Upside Down, Hawkins Lab, Vecna, it always feels like there\u2019s a deeper layer waiting to unfold.\n\nNow, Squid Game is definitely powerful in its own way. It\u2019s sharp, socially relevant, and brutally unpredictable. The tension is unreal and it keeps you hooked from the first episode. I get why people hype it.\n\nBut for me, Squid Game is more of a one-time adrenaline rush, whereas Stranger Things has long-term emotional weight. It\u2019s something you rewatch, quote, and connect with. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll always pick Stranger Things. It's  not just thrilling, it\u2019s iconic.\nYou can put your point if disagree. ",

None of whom live at my house or who I have on my Netflix account. It was so weird! Had to log out and log back in as me\u2026 it was like being at an Airbnb where somebody else had forgot to log out except this was at my own house. Anyone else have this happen ever?? ",
