I'd always have the 4k plan through some deal, I believe the last year I had it through a verizon deal of like $140 bucks for the year with amc+. And I'd get something similar all previous years for the past like 5 years. But there have been zero deals this go around, and I'm now at a point where I'll be cancelling a couple other streaming services that are lacking or cheaper trials ending (i.e. apple 3 month trial). \n\nAnyway, the 4k plan is now $25 which is pretty insane to me. I did get a quality tv and sound system back in 2020 and am used to 4k on every other service. So I'm deciding if I want to do $25 a few months a year, or do $8/mo continuously for 1080p. Since netflix releases all episodes at once, it doesn't really create the weekly discussions the way a show like severance, last of us, white lotus, etc do. So I'm heavily leaning towards just subscribing for a month at $25, immediately cancel it so it ends that month, and rejoin when theres at least a few more new shows/seasons that actually appeal to me. Wondering how many other people just subscribe occassionally throughout the year. ",

        "content": "I just jumped ship from iPhone 15 pro max to Samsung s25 ultra. Today I started watching 4k content from Netflix on the s25, and omg! It looks so good! I can't even tell there are pixels! It looks as good as 4k on a 4k monitor! Then I watched the same content on my iPhone, it looks like 720p! Not even 1080p..... But the content title says \"Dolby Vision\" on my iPhone, and \"HDR+\" on my samsung phone. \n\niPhone won't tell me what the max resolution it was playing, but it looks like 720p; samsung tells me it was playing in 1080p in HDR+. \n\nI am 100% sure both phones were on the same wifi, with media quality switched to \"High\".\n\nWhy is that? I even tried it on my iPad Air ( newest gen), still the same thing! Like where have I been all these years paying for the Premium plan for nothing.... (other than the times I watch it in Safari on macbook). ",
