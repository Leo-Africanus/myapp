        "content": "SAN ANTONIO - Two men have been arrested after a fight over a Netflix account ended with gunfire.\n\nBrian Travis Reynolds, 19, and Anthony Constante, 19, were taken into custody this week in connection with an incident outside a home on Calle Briseno, according to the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nInvestigators said the confrontation started on September 23, after Reynolds changed the name on 20-year-old Vincent Munoz\u2019s Netflix account to an insult. Munoz then agreed to fight Reynolds and Constante after feeling disrespected.\n\nWhen the pair showed up, they jumped a fence to get to Munoz. Reynolds had a handgun in his waistband, which he allegedly handed to Constante during the fight. At one point, Constante was seen on video striking Munoz repeatedly while holding the weapon, deputies said.\n\nThe fight continued after the gun was passed back to Reynolds. A shot was fired during the struggle, and Munoz was left bleeding from the head. It\u2019s still unclear if he was struck by a bullet or injured another way.\n\nDeputies also noted the gun had been modified with an illegal device known as a \u201cswitch,\u201d which turns it into a fully automatic weapon.\n\nReynolds and Constante were arrested.\n\n[Reynolds &amp; Constante: a cautionary tale in being careful re: sharing your Netflix password](https://preview.redd.it/ua398llofxrf1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e07955aabdf562b102294f9beeaff3b28df1ee)\n\n[news article link](https://foxsanantonio.com/newsletter-daily/two-men-arrested-after-fight-over-netflix-account-escalates-to-gunfire-gun-violence-switch-television)",

        "content": "I just finished Black Rabbit and honestly, I think it\u2019s one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen in a long while.\n\nExciting and unpredictable \u2013 Every episode had me hooked. There\u2019s this constant tension and unease that made me lean in, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\nEmotionally provoking \u2013 It\u2019s rare for a show to hit so many emotional notes; anger, sadness, empathy, anxiety and dread. All in the same arc. I found myself genuinely caring about what happened to the characters.\n\nCharacters you invest in \u2013 Even when they\u2019re flawed or making questionable choices, I couldn\u2019t help but root for them or at least understand them. That level of writing and acting is what kept me so engaged.\n\nActing \u2013 Top-tier. The performances felt layered, raw, and real, like you\u2019re watching people rather than actors.\n\nCinematography \u2013 The dark, grey tones of NYC were such a perfect backdrop. It wasn\u2019t just filmed in New York; the city itself felt like a character. That moody aesthetic pulled me in even deeper.\n\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand at all is why The Guardian gave it a negative review. Honestly, did we even watch the same show? For me, it delivered on every front; storytelling, visuals, acting, and atmosphere.\nEdited to add the music matched the dark and gritty theme so well also!\n\nOverall, Black Rabbit just worked. It\u2019s one of those rare shows that stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\n\nAnyone else feel the same way, or equally baffled by the negative takes?\n\n",

        "content": "Don\u2019t worry: no Season 2 spoilers here, just fan-made ideas and imagined Season 3 moments.\n\nPlease read all of my scenes, they aren\u2019t in any particular order and before you start, here are pictures from Season 1 &amp; 2 that we need to see from Wednesday again \ud83d\ude09\n\nScene 1: Jealousy SparksA heated moment where jealousy shows, either from Wednesday or Tyler (or both). That enemies-to-lovers energy adds fire to their journey and deepens the tension.\n\nScene 2: The Woods, North of the Canadian BorderEnid is missing in her wolf form, and Wednesday refuses to give up searching. Tyler insists on helping. As they move through the dark woods together, the danger pulls them closer.Tyler: \u201cShe used to tell me the woods would protect me. But now it feels like they\u2019ve turned against me.\u201dWednesday (coldly honest): \u201cThe woods don\u2019t betray. People do. The trees are indifferent, like me. But indifference can be a shield if you know how to use it.\u201dTyler (dark laugh): \u201cTrust you to make grief sound like survival training.\u201dWednesday (steps closer, voice low): \u201cIt is. And if you want to survive, stop seeing these woods as haunted\u2026 and start seeing them as ours.\u201d\n\nScene 3: The Angry Love ConfessionSomeone insults Wednesday. Tyler steps in, furious.Tyler: \u201cSay that again and I\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201dWednesday (eyes flash with fire): \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201dTyler: \u201cOf course I did. Because I love you, Wednesday. And whether you like it or not, you\u2019re mine\u2026 my Graveheart.\u201dWednesday (pauses, smirks): \u201cFinally. It took rage to drag it out of you. I\u2019m yours too\u2026. my Ruin. I love you.\u201dTyler: \u201cWe really are two black-hearted souls ready to pillage the world together.\u201d (smirks)Wednesday: allows the faintest ghost of a smile to slip through.Their first real kiss ignites.\n\nScene 4: Wednesday\u2019s NarrationWednesday (voiceover):\u201cI never believed in love, and I\u2019ve always hidden my emotions because they reveal a weakness others could use against me. But Tyler saw through it. He\u2019s seen the sides of me I promised I\u2019d never show. And despite everything he\u2019s done, I love him. I can\u2019t bring myself to get through any day without him.\u201d\n\nScene 5: Tyler\u2019s GriefWednesday helps Tyler face his mother\u2019s death, not with softness, but brutal honesty. She tells him grief never disappears, but it can sharpen you. For the first time, Tyler realizes she understands him better than anyone else.\nTyler (voice low, almost breaking): \u201cYou\u2019re the only one left for me. No one sees me the way you do. I only have you.\u201d\nScene 5.5: Tyler\u2019s Apology\nTyler: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I\u2019ve done. I know I don\u2019t deserve forgiveness, but I need to hear it from you eventually so I can live without hating myself.\u201d\nTyler\u2019s narration: \u201cI feel like such a hypocrite asking her for forgiveness, knowing I\u2019ve done nothing to earn it\u2026 yet. I never realized how special she was before, but now I do. Wednesday deserved better than me, way better than me.\u201d\n\nScene 6: Favourite TortureTyler: \u201cYou\u2019re my favourite type of torture.\u201dWednesday (smirks): \u201cThe kind you won\u2019t survive.\u201dTyler (leans closer, voice trembling, hands twitching as he resists touching her): \u201cThen I\u2019ll die happy.\u201d\n\nScene 7: Kidnapping/DangerIf Wednesday is captured:Tyler: \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll let her die, you\u2019re dead wrong.\u201dWednesday (with her signature smirk): \u201cWednesday Addams doesn\u2019t die, Tyler. You should know that by now.\u201d\nIf Tyler is trapped:Tyler: \u201cI thought you despised me. Turns out you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily, Wednesday Addams.\u201dWednesday (rare flicker of emotion): \u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nScene 8: Wednesday Takes Control (NEW SCENE)After being betrayed by Isadora or the Hyde pack, Tyler allows Wednesday to become his master, dark tension, power play, and Wyler chemistry at its peak.\n\nScene 9: Proving HimselfTyler earns Enid\u2019s forgiveness by showing up when it matters most. Later, he saves not only Wednesday but also someone from her family, Pugsley, Thing, or even Uncle Fester. The ultimate way of proving his loyalty and securing his place in her world.\n\nScene 10: Gothic Romance Moments\n* The fiery kiss scored with a song like \u201cWrong\u201d by Chris Grey (personal favourite, but many options).\n* A Phantom of the Opera inspired dance at Nevermore, gothic and hauntingly beautiful. Before they dance, Tyler greets her with a kiss to her hand.\n* Wednesday stumbles across a hidden drawing of herself in Tyler\u2019s sketchbook, proof that he\u2019s been haunted by her all along.\n\nScene 11: The Unspoken TruthTyler: \u201cTell me the real reason you missed.\u201dWednesday (eyes narrowing, voice low but teasing): \u201cI missed because even someone like me can care\u2026 for someone like you, even when I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nScene 12: Choosing Her Over the PackTyler stands between his Hyde pack and Wednesday, torn for a moment but then resolute.Hyde pack: \u201cJust leave her, Tyler. She\u2019s not worth it.\u201dTyler (eyes blazing, voice steady): \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s worth more than every ruby, every diamond, every secret you hide behind. I\u2019m choosing her. You were never even an option.\u201d\n\nBonus Scenes &amp; Fan FavesThese are just a bit more standout Wyler moments. There are extra jealous sparks, emotional confessions, and suspenseful moments that add even more depth to their story. Each scene builds on their dark, emotional journey and shows why Season 3 could be the most talked-about chapter yet.\n\nWrap-upScenes like these keep Wyler gothic and emotional at its finest. This is a full pitch of Wyler that could make Season 3 unforgettable and trending online. Scenes like these could boost Netflix\u2019s views, smash their own records, and satisfy Wyler fans everywhere.\nWyler isn\u2019t just romance, it\u2019s gothic history in the making.",

        "content": "\n\u200bI think Season 1 of Tires is simply an awesome watch from start to finish. The show is packed with light-hearted fun that makes it incredibly easy to binge. It has that great quality of being simple, pure entertainment without much heavy lifting. While the main story arc builds in a somewhat predictable way, the journey is still highly enjoyable. I was particularly impressed with the interpersonal conflict and sharp dialogue between the characters. The entire cast has been perfectly picked for their respective roles in the auto shop. Shane and Will are especially perfect, carrying the comedy with their brilliant chemistry. Their relationship is the heart of the show and provides most of the laughs. The comedic timing is insane to watch. I genuinely like the show's approach to covering various social subjects. It addresses them realistically and with a good sense of humor, which is refreshing. Crucially, it manages to bring a positive message to the world without ever feeling like a boring public service announcement. Overall, I really loved the first season of Tires and highly recommend it for a fun, quick watch.",

        "content": "Drawing Closer came out in 2024. It stars Ren Nagase, Natsuki Deguchi, and Mayu Yokota. I don't want to really spoil anything. When you pull it up on Netflix you'll get the jist anyway. I have watched this several times but recently I find myself in a similar situation:  metastasized colon cancer. Anyway, who cares about that. I was going through my watch later list cleaning things out because no one lives forever right? I came across this and watched it again but in a WHOLE different light. It is SO well acted. The feelings they showed were visceral.  The beginning, the middle, the end. All perfect. It has been a tear jerker everytime I watched it but now, the whole \"live for the moment\" storyline took on a whole different meaning. Anyway, this isn't meant to be a soapbox. I'd like you to watch it. Sure you need subtitles but believe me it in no way diminishes the feelings you'll have. It's not depressing either if that's what you think. It's sad, almost unbearably so. But it celebrates life in a way that makes it uplifting. Maybe it's my own situation making me write this review but it seems like the most original movie dealing with this subject matter that maybe I have ever seen.  So please check it out. Thanks for reading.  :)",

Definitely worth a watch, sci-fi action thriller with great characters, and a compelling story line.  I think they also have an animated series, which I have not seen yet, but definitely highly recommend the live action show!

        "content": "When watching netflix it will randomly freeze the frame and audio will continue for a second and then stop. When you leave fullscreen it will go back to normal, it happens randomly, not instantly when entering fullscreen and not when subtitles for example show up. It's not regular either, can be with 1 minute breaks or 20min breaks, we tried updating drivers because I've seen others mention that could be causing issues but it didn't help. We've also tried two different monitors, one which is 60hz and one which is 144hz, it makes no difference.   \nAnyone recognize this?",

Grizzled fella, solves cases by his own non-traditional methodologies, endearingly neglects his personal life, and the subjects of his cases represent little ecosystems in the human community. And British flavored!\n\nI somehow watched season 4, then 1-3 of The Sinner and the thing that irked me most about the show is that Ambrose is hardly impacted by the administrative expectations of his actual job. I mean, in season 2 he spent the whole time basically volunteering his services for another PD lol. Meanwhile, Detective Frost is more realistically part of a department and has an amusing relationship with a boss who actually makes professional demands of him. There\u2019s pretty good running jokes about the growing piles of unfinished paperwork associated with cases backing up. Lastly, he takes mentoring younger members of the department seriously and that\u2019s pretty sweet to see. \n\n",
