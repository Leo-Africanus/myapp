        "content": "A decade or more ago there were only a small number of platforms, e.g. netflix, Amazon. \nThen when Disney for example decided they wanted their own platform, along with a dozen other companies, it resulted in a hugely diluted market place where no one or two subscriptions can provide any meaningful breadth of content that existed back then. \nYet each of the subscription options offer about 10-20% of the content that Netflix and Amazon used to, but still think it's appropriate to charge \u00a310-15 a month.\n\nFor me, this did not result in any improvements as a consumer but represented potential increases from &lt;\u00a320 a month to &gt;\u00a350 a month, which I wasnt willing to spend on 5-6 subscriptions.\n\nI occasionally run an Amazon sub under student pricing and cancel it the second the content I wanted it watched. \n\nSomething else I found frustrating is having to scroll through pages of foreign content or even worse, foreign content that's not obviously foreign until you press play and see/hear the awful dubbing. \n\nI'm looking at you netflix, using foreign content to supplement your lack of new content over the past few years.\n\nI would suggest they have options to filter content in the same way you can by age rating or content type only selecting your preferred language it was filmed in, sifting out any content not in your preferred language or dubbed content if that's your preference. \n\nAt this stage, if that option ever appears I suspect it would be behind a pay wall.",

I\u2019ve got the Netflix Premium plan, and while I do get Ultra HD content, I can\u2019t seem to get Dolby Atmos only 5.1 audio shows up.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets weird: when I switch over to Netflix on my Windows laptop, the receiver actually does switch to Atmos (shows up right on the front panel), but the video quality is kinda trash because the app doesn\u2019t handle 4K well.\n\nI\u2019ve already made sure passthrough and eARC are enabled on the projector, so everything seems set up correctly on paper.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering is this a known issue with the Netflix app on Google TV, or could there be something off in my setup? And most importantly\u2026 is it even possible to get both 4K and Dolby Atmos on a projector setup like this without needing an external streaming device?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone\u2019s cracked the code on this.

I've also watched Knightfall.\nDo you have any recommendations for similar shows? It's important that they don't have any fantasy elements, like Game of Thrones or similar.\n\nP.S. I'm Italian, if that matters for availability of shows",
