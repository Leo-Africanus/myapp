The couples feel genuine, their issues relatable, and the focus isn\u2019t just on drama for the sake of it. Instead, the show dives into real conversations about love, trust, and growth (inasmuch as a \"reality tv show\" can be) vs for eg. the USA versions which feel like they emphasise pure chaos over emotional maturity and healing in any way.\n\nSide note though, I can't believe that Nancy stayed either Bohlale :( Damn",

        "content": "As mentioned in the title, I just finished watching it, and I\u2019d say it was worth the wait.kind of. If you haven\u2019t seen the series yet I suggest skipping this  to avoid spoilers\n\nThat said, I\u2019m a bit disappointed. This season focused heavily on homosexual relationships. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s bad, but most of us want to see the main character\u2019s love story, not a side character creating drama in everyone else\u2019s love lives. The story was supposed to center around Kitty discovering more about her mom, which was why she went to KISS in the first place\n\nOn top of that, making Kitty bisexual felt like a misstep. It shifted the focus away from the original premise, leading to unnecessary fights and breakups that dominated the screen time. If you\u2019ve seen the show, you\u2019ll notice that more than half of the relationships are homosexual. It felt like the series lost sight of Kitty\u2019s journey and the charm of the original story\n\nWhat I did enjoy, however, was Kitty finding new love. I genuinely thought she\u2019d end up with the same person(Dae) from season 1, so that twist was refreshing. And seeing Margot and Peter from To All the Boys was so relieving(?) honestly, that was the main reason I watched this season\n\nOverall, I feel like the story doesn\u2019t completely wrap up, leaving me hoping for another season to tie up loose ends\n\n",

The way he calls her Covey, the way he saved her from making a fool out of herself to help her with her grandma, their dance, the hot tub scene, and them breathing each others air lol. The way they looked at each other wowoowowowow!!! They really did listen to their audience after season 1 and said let's give them the slow burn. MinHo sees through Kitty and loves her for her, and Kitty loves MinHo for who he is as well. The beauty shines from within is so true in this love and friendship thing they have going. I love them together. Peter Kavinsky guest appearance was so cute and the grandma family story is so touching too. Not MinHO being jealous of Pete like he likes to call him lol!!!
