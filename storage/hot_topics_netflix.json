Its imppossible, My wife has watched me screaming at how stupid teh wrold has become becasue the days of pluggin in a red and white cable and being ab le to watch a movie, are gone. its a giant scam now. Forcing you to spend thousands to buy a dobly digital receiver with a center channel with special modes, jsut to watch the movie your paying for.  \nNow, im not a fool, i understand what im talking about. My TV only ahs optical output, ive tried a soundbar, hiopeless vocals, so i upgraded to all icould afford, a bookshelf monitor system., edifier r1280db. Im really angry becuase thay hasnt helped. It recieves PCM only, so i have the TV set to that, and even if i choose stereo in netflix, its unusable, at maximum volume, there is absolutely no way one could make out peopls voices, subtitles are required.   \nThis si so incredibly stupid for a time nearly 30 years after the year 2000. Humans are suypposed to get more inteligent, but this stupid nonsense, is destroying the entertainment industry. Yes, its THAT bad,. Ive searched the web, and found no asnwers, onyl countless individuals wiht teh same heartache.  \nSo here I am, telling netflix on a reddit cahnnel, they should remix the entirer catalogue and reupload it, remastered, wiht a vocal boost audio option.  \nI dont think anyone wiht enough brain capacity or intellect would read this though,. the onyl solution is if im somehow going to find myself working for Netflix and fix it myself.\n\nThis is nto a user or hardware issue. The moxies have been uploaded with 5.1 or stereo withi the vocals (center channel) too low. Simple as that.",

Specifically, I really dislike the way that movies start playing even when I'm just considering whether to watch the trailer or to see what cast members are acting in it.  I've come back from the kitchen with snacks to see that a movie I wanted to watch was already running for a few minutes.  It's mildly annoying to try to unsee something while rewinding to the beginning to restart.  I've tried to turn it off in my settings, but they only offer changes for previews or show episodes.  I think the worst part is that if I decided I don't want to watch something, it probably still affects what the algorithm offers in the future.  Why?  Just why?",

The couples feel genuine, their issues relatable, and the focus isn\u2019t just on drama for the sake of it. Instead, the show dives into real conversations about love, trust, and growth (inasmuch as a \"reality tv show\" can be) vs for eg. the USA versions which feel like they emphasise pure chaos over emotional maturity and healing in any way.\n\nSide note though, I can't believe that Nancy stayed either Bohlale :( Damn",
