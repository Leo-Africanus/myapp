        "content": "  Netflix\u2019s *Ripley* is a great thriller that leans hard into mood, restraint, and slow-burn suspense. The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

        "title": "Think Best Guess Live is rigged? You're Wrong.",
        "content": "Let's really put this into perspective since there are so many people online complaining that they think it's rigged.\n\nNetflix is projected to have brought in 45 BILLION dollars in 2025. That is earning a revenue of 123 million dollars day. \n\nBest Guess Live gives out $15,000 every weekday, so 260 days out of the year. That adds up to a little under 4 million dollars. With special giveaways let's just pretend it's actually 5 million dollars over the course of the year. Let's pretend it's 10 million even, that's 0.01% of their annual revenue. **It takes Netflix approximately about 2 hours to generate 10 million dollars.**\n\nWhy would a company that makes 123 million dollars a day risk their reputation to save 10 million dollars? It would be like you or me risking a felony charge to save a nickel we found on the sidewalk.\n\n**Netflix is a 500 billion dollar company, you think they're going to risk catching a federal charge over a $15,000 daily trivia game?????**\n\nThey're literally doing this for retention. If someone was going to cancel their account because they don't like the content being carried, maybe having this keeps them around because they have fun playing it.\n\n\"The clues are impossible!\" There's literally 80,000 people making random guesses. On a puzzle they are trying to make impossible on guess 1 and 2 specifically. They go through the answers after to ensure their thought process and why the clue is fair. Why would anyone be giving away money in a game where there are 5 guesses want to make it easy to be figured out on the 1st and 2nd guess? It makes no sense.\n\n**TL;DR:** Netflix makes the prize pool money in the time it takes you to watch one movie. They have zero incentive to rig it and every legal/financial incentive to keep it fair so you keep opening the app every night and don't cancel your membership if you don't like the tv/film options available.",

I was never a fan of Real Housewives or those types if reality shows, so cringe, but this one I actually enjoyed a bit. Maybe because I live in South FL and could relate to a lot of the scenery.\n\nWigs, tacky dresses, cellulite, fake boobs, saggy skin and bickering aside some of these characters were actually entertaining and funny. \n\nMaria , although annoyingly emotional narcissist, was hilarious. \n\nThe self proclaimed Grande Damme Gale was hilarious too, and I could see that she must\u2019ve been a very beautiful woman when she was young.\n\nRosalyn was also an interesting character, she must\u2019ve worked very hard to be the prim and proper soft spoken princess, but I can see from a mile away she just wanna party and dance on tables ",

Are the biggest factors things like new season releases, online hype, or how popular the show already is? Also, do older shows often return to the Top 10 when new seasons come out? Based on trends and current buzz, what do you think the top five Netflix shows this week are likely to be, and why do you think those particular titles are performing so well right now?",

I definitely think they should be held more accountable than they seem to be in the storyline but maybe 50%. I think there was a definite lack of seeing your son has some sort of problems that should\u2019ve been addressed properly years back. ",

        "content": "Some Stranger Things fans are not in their minds, like they really think that after this level of finale, netflix will call it a fake episode and they will come up with an ep 9. After building this grand hype for the final episode and playing it in theaters, they will call it a fake end. Are you kidding me? I also didn't like the final fight much, but after all the epilogue, do people really think that netflix will call it a fake end and release ep 9? Like, if they would not have shown the epilogue, then there would have been a chance of calling it a fake end, but the epilogue ended the series, and though it is not a perfect end and the final fight had many issues but like it or not, this is the end of Stranger Things.",

        "content": "I've been super bummed with the decisions Netflix has made in the last few years. The very few shows I've enjoyed were cancelled or had their entire tone shifted. Stranger Things started out dark, ominous, and serious. It ended lighthearted and felt like a Disney show.\n\nI'm not quite sure why I felt the need to share. Maybe it's because I'm cancelling something I've supported for over a decade. I believe we vote with our dollars. I just can't justify my dollars going towards creating the content Netflix is anymore.",
