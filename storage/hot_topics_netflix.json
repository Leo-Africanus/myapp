        "content": "Is it just me, or did Season 2 of Sandman feel a little rushed? I still enjoyed it overall and I\u2019m not saying it was bad (nein, not at all), but something about the pacing felt off compared to Season 1. In the first season, everything had time to breathe like characters, motivations, even silence mattered. Season 2 felt more like \u201cokay, next plot point, next scene\u201d without letting things fully settle.\n\nLucifer especially stood out to me. After how intense and meaningful the finale of Season 1 was, I expected that arc to have more weight or long-term impact. Instead, it felt kind of disconnected, like der buildup didn\u2019t fully pay off. Not bad, just\u2026 lighter than expected.\n\nI\u2019m not a hardcore Sandman fan or comic reader, so maybe that\u2019s part of it. Still, as a casual viewer, the shift was noticeable. The ideas were cool, the visuals were great, but the emotional glue wasn\u2019t always there. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it (ja, possible), but I\u2019m curious if others felt the same or if this is just how the story goes.",

Well then, how about my take on this show?\n\nOkay, so firstly I commend the effort to have a very quirky and different type of story telling. I am unfamiliar with this universe, so I had an open mind. Quickly I noticed that the acting, while over the top at times, was actually pretty good, but there are things in it that make me wonder about the writers.  \nSecondly but also possible spoiler if you read this first but holy carp a DINO EGG?! Come on. Not a fireball, not a rematerialization, no not at all instead a rather round huge egg way far off from where the group was...very interesting direction leaving it open to possibly another chapter however strange of a twist, which I am not gonna lie, I would watch it too.\n\nThis feels more like a anime with less over the top action than a real motion show...it is strange and satirical at times and I am not sure it was meant to be...\n\nI really love that farm hand in the one scene was Hammish from Viva La Dirt League over on youtube. Honestly some of the VLDL crew are wonderful actors and so fun.\n\nI guess if I was giving it a rating I would probably rate this as a solid 8 out of 10, but add a bonus point for the naivety of the entire thing. Normally something like this would not hit but somehow works with this series. SO deal with a 9 out of 10. If you want that last single digit point you are gonna have to make another season!\n\nSecond time posting this, hope it does not get auto removed this time.\n\nThanks.",

        "content": "I\u2019m still not over Netflix canceling Mindhunter. The atmosphere, the writing, the performances, everything felt so carefully crafted, and it seemed like the story was just getting started.\n\nIt had so much long-term potential, especially with the real-life cases they were building toward.\nAnyone else still disappointed about this one? What Netflix show do you think ended far too soon?",

        "content": "I\u2019m giving Dark another shot. I don\u2019t mind the subtitles at all, I love the Scandi murder mystery shows and the Korean romcom. I think it got too convoluted for me the first time around and I was having trouble keeping track of who\u2019s who, especially since there are so many teens and flashbacks. Someone had posted a companion website that mapped out all the different characters and family lines. Can\u2019t find it, can someone please repost? TIA ",
