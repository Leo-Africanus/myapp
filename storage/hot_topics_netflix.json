I would have loved more time with Mo\u2019s brother Sameer delving deeper into his autism diagnosis and I also would have loved more depth on Mo\u2019s sister and her relationship with her mother. The trip to Palestine episode was heartbreaking and I could have done a whole season there as well. I really just love this cast and love the writing. Does anyone know how viewership is faring? Does anyone think there\u2019s any chance the show could be extended for a third season? Curious as to what rationale went into renewing for a second and final season from Netflix (unless this decision came from Mo)! ",
