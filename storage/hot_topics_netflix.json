        "title": "Discussion Forum Over Volume One of Stranger Things Season Five (SPOILERS SORRY)",
        "content": "I just finished up the first volume of Stranger Things, and here are my thoughts:\n\n\n\n\u00a0One, Dustin. Dustin has been a fragile character that has already gone through a lot. Do not get me wrong, I understand that he would be grieving Eddie, but he wasn\u2019t even greiving him this hard in the last season. I know grief fluctuates, and people go about it in different ways, but there was no inkling of evidence in Season Four that Dustin would turn into this. We feel like a mix between the stoicism of John Bender from *The Breakfast Club* and the corniness of the George Michael-looking boy in the nintento Power Glove commercial. The bro-mantic storylines that we all adored between Dustin and Steve feel over, and I know for a fact things will be mended during the season, or likely have one of them dying in the other\u2019s arms, saying sorry. I would move on to my second point, but I feel I have the best way to put it now. Season One and Season Two of Stranger Things really prioritized characters and writing great characters and scenes rather than prioritizing plot. That I believe is what has become the shows biggest flaw. We all know Stranger things was set to be an anthology series, which inevitably ended up failing as viewers were not as interested in the character eights individual storyline. Of course, the audience were so invested in the original characters from the first season that it would be renewed, but as a serialized show now. I believe after Season Two, it became more about what is happening over the arc of the season than how do our characters interact and care for one another. Why does Hopper have a complete Character reset in season three? In fact, since season three, why has Hopper felt like a new character every season? Because it is not the same Hopper who has learned everything and endured everything he did in the first two seasons. Furthermore, I think even though I personally thought Vecna was cringe, I at least saw how having a humanoid villain was a successful way to continue the show, since it is hard to continue battling a non-verbal dark force the entire show. I kinda am giving up on this at this point, but I wanted to say something. I am enjoying this season are two things. I am enjoying that Will is finally standing up for himself, especially to his mom. (JOYCE BEING ANOTHER CHARACTER THAT HAS NO STAKES ANYMORE.) And I like that they have Robin and Will interacting, yet the scene writing is still terrible, but I believe this was a nice progression, especially since the two of them were not given much last season. With Robin getting a Character reset and Will yearning for the Mike Wheeler ding-a-ling. I believe this is the best thing they have done so far this season. Please let me know what you think, and please let\u2019s not talk about the Holly plot line or how Max even enters it. That is a whole other tangent.\u00a0\n\n\n\nP.S. I am a big fan of the show, and I am saddened by how the season is going so far. ",
