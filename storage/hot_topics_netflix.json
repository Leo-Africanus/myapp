        "title": "Netflix Has Gone Downhill",
        "content": "I\u2019m bracing for downvotes, but hear me out: Netflix has gone down. Not crash-and-burn down, but a steady slide from must-have to \u201cI\u2019ll resub when there\u2019s a buzzy release.\u201d I get that plenty of people still love it, but what used to feel like discovery now feels like searching, and that shift matters.\n\nThe biggest crack is trust. Too many promising shows get axed after a season or two, so viewers stop investing. It\u2019s hard to recommend something when you might be setting a friend up for a cliffhanger that never gets resolved. Netflix still lands hits, but fewer cut through the noise, and the middle tier\u2014the quirky, mid-budget series that built the brand\u2014has thinned out. What\u2019s left is an awkward mix of glossy tentpoles and disposable reality.\n\nPricing and policies haven\u2019t helped. Between tier reshuffles, an ad-supported option, and the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix asks for more while delivering less certainty. If I\u2019m paying premium, I want premium clarity: finished stories, a strong middle class of originals, and an interface that helps me find them. Instead, the algorithm cycles the same tiles, autoplay shouts at me, and the Top 10 often reads like a marketing strip rather than a reliable compass.\n\nThe binge model, once Netflix\u2019s superpower, is showing its limits. A full-season drop creates a weekend of hype and a Monday of amnesia. Competitors that pace releases weekly keep conversation alive longer, which builds community and anticipation. Netflix\u2019s experiments with split seasons feel more like damage control than a coherent strategy for keeping shows in the zeitgeist.\n\nI know the counterpoint: scale demands broad bets. Serving the whole world means optimizing for averages, and averages don\u2019t produce many cult classics. There are still gems\u2014especially international series\u2014but they\u2019re buried under repetition and generic thumbnails. Personalization should feel like a path that widens as you walk it, not a carousel that loops you back to the same five options.\n\nWhat would winning look like? Start with a renewed commitment to finishing stories\u2014greenlight responsibly and communicate clearly about endpoints. Reinvest in the mid-tier that keeps people engaged between megahits. Rethink curation beyond raw engagement: elevate human-programmed shelves, surface more staff picks, and rotate true discovery rows weekly. On product, make autoplay opt-in, expand \u201cbecause you watched\u201d with smarter, transparent explanations, and let users pin interests so the home screen adapts to them, not the other way around.\n\nAnd if you disagree, that\u2019s fine. I expect pushback, maybe even a pile-on. But the criticism comes from a place of former love. Netflix made streaming exciting because it felt bold and curious. Lately, it feels cautious and crowded. The audience is still here, willing to be surprised. The question is whether Netflix wants to be surprising again.\n\nIf you\u2019re still all-in on Netflix, tell me what I\u2019m missing and what\u2019s genuinely great right now. I\u2019d love to be convinced to stay subscribed year-round instead of hopping in and out for the next shiny release.\n\n",

He's too hot and can't do an american accent and accounting for the strangest voice choice of all time, it just comes off silly and \"simple jack-y\".\n\n  \nAnd the TONE??? The show so far plays less like an upclose look at a monster like dahmer and has been this hypersexual tease of teenage girls talking about bras, flashes of nazi BDSM imagery and concentration camps cut together in an exciting way. he gets the images from a girl who looks so sweet she's bound to be his first victim. \n\nGein is portrayed as a hot and muscular horny weirdo with a terrible voice, who fails to bring life to a character with the same kind of tv-watchability as Evan Peters's  cold, scary, planning, broken, psychopathic predator \n\nI'm writing this after watching the ridiculous scene at the Nazi BDSM party where Jewish prisoners are sexually humiliated against their will. And again- it's just the tone. It was off. And this show so fare seems kinda sexploitation-y and bad acting and bad casting and idk if i can keep going. \n\nThoughts?",

It\u2019s crazy that I\u2019m saying this about an NBC show, and I don\u2019t know if anyone will read this or care but I gotta get the words out. This show was beyond amazing. Say what you want about the filler, the repetitiveness, whatever. But Blindspot has arguably the most impressive full circle story, beginning to end, staying true to its core in ways that I feel like you don\u2019t see in a lot of shows anymore. I couldn\u2019t help but feel so deeply connected to the characters and their lives, and getting to see familiar faces through flashbacks/hallucinations was so comforting. Yes, the show is wildly farcical in literally every episode, but what\u2019s the difference between accepting the realities of a sci-fi show and embracing strange realities in a show that takes place in \u201creal life?\u201d This show was extremely clear from the first 5 minutes that nothing it presented was going to be normal, and by god it wasn\u2019t. But dammit I LOVE that about it. The creators and the cast cared so much about the depth of the plot and it really shows, and I am genuinely really sad that I have run out of episodes to watch and that the ending was so damn bittersweet. I really hope that any past or current watchers who saw it all the way through - because quitting at any point before the 100th episode is robbing yourself of the beautifully closed loop, complex and heartbreaking character arcs, and also knowing the truth that the story really does continue, but maybe not in the way you want - feel as touched as I do by the story, it\u2019s amazing characters, and what it all meant in the end. It\u2019s an isolated, hidden gem, that other amazing shows (like Lost - despite it\u2019s brilliance) just cannot replicate in the same way. Or if they have, I haven\u2019t seen them. \n\nThe craziest part of all this for me is that this show had been recommended to me by netflix for MONTHS, and I skipped over it because the poster looked too NBC and my assumptions got the better of me. What a fool I am. Never judge a show by it\u2019s poster, you may be missing out on a truly touching experience. ",

A good thriller should be atleast a little bit if sense when you run it back in your head but this did not. She also comes across to me as a selfish mother . Why bring a child if you can not live for them. Time in time again , I have realised that living for love is more heroic than dying for it and this show is the exact example why. Her sister would not have wanted her to die to show the world the truth. It was stupid. Also how come Joe turned out to be a psycopath . Like do people not know the person they marry. He did not just kill once or twice. He probably killed more than shown in the show. What a rubbish show. I hated it maybe because I knew going in I was going to waste my time and I did it anyways.

Beetlejuice went over pretty well too. Trying to find more in that \u201cfun spooky\u201d category, things with monsters, mystery, or Halloween vibes without being too gory or depressing. Most recently we liked Hubie Halloween and The Curse of Bridge Hollow. Any recommendations for that middle ground? Bonus points for movies with adventure or humor mixed in! ",

        "content": "I think Tom Hollander was absolutely abysmal as Alfred Hitchcock. The casting was just a complete misfire, not that the shows writing of Hitchcock was any better. Any time he\u2019s on screen I\u2019m genuinely tempted to just fast forward to the Gein parts, he\u2019s just painfully bad. Was pretty excited to watch this considering how good the Dahmer season was, but the flash forwards are just so disjointed and completely ruin any flow the show gets into. IMO they could have done it in a way that made the Psycho storyline work, like do it in the second half of the season, but the flash forwards to this, combined with the episodes of Buchenwald psychosis just make the show a complete mess.",

        "title": "You Season 5 and The Lost Bookshop by Evie Woods !Spoilers!",
        "content": "Yesterday I watched the last season of You. Part of the story was about Bront\u00eb, a randomly discovered employee of Joe\u2019s.\nIt\u2019s about a special bookstore that used to belong to his guardian (basically father) Mr. Mooney. Of course, the two of them fall in love, but it\u2019s forbidden because he\u2019s married and has a son.\n\nNow today I started reading the book, and I\u2019m at chapter 19. Here, the married bookstore owner, who also has a son, inherited his antiquarian bookshop with old books from his father. He hires a female employee who just showed up out of nowhere, and they seem to be falling in love. Of course, that\u2019s not really possible either. At the same time, the author Emily Bront\u00eb has already been mentioned several times.\n\nSo, for me it\u2019s quite a coincidence that I\u2019ve come across two such similar stories in a row. I know this isn\u2019t such an unusual scenario, but honestly, I didn\u2019t even know the name Bront\u00eb before, and I feel like the similarities are pretty striking, even though the rest of the story will probably play out differently.\n\nWhat do you think?",

And this is coming from someone who has seem some dark shit on the internet and watched Cannibal Holocaust. Do not watch this if your squeamish or easily disturbed by gore or watching a guy straight up have sex with corpses.",
