        "content": "This show is a must watch! Definitely screamed \u201cthe perfect couple\u201d vibes of a rich family on Netflix . Where are they from? Missed that. Anyway this show was hard to watch but also weirdly realistic in a very weird way. Like what in the world would so many of us do in this situation?? It\u2019s that insane. If we found out our nanny was dealing with our child in this fashion. I don\u2019t have words.\n\nIn addition there is so much going on. So many different dynamic characters and the scenery. Loved Cecille. You can tell she\u2019s independent of her husband (her office is literally on the water or wherever she works) and i just had the vibes of how he never talks back to her (I know men who think their better then their wives). Aka that beautiful house is 100% half hers and well earned. I\u2019m convinced she makes more than the lawyer husband. Again, she didn\u2019t say it outright but she mentioned the neighbor is his biggest client and looked completely un phased like the true queen she is. Every woman that makes their own money (usually more) knows this discussion well with their man. And it shows. \n\nHave yall watched this on Netflix? Thoughts?",

        "content": "!!!Spoilers for Sirens!!!\n\nOkay I just finished Sirens and I need to rant (I apologize this is long)\n\nI hate Devon. Like with a burning passion.\n\nShe called her sister a wh\\*re for sending fruit then sucks a guy off because she can't smoke??? And then licks the guy who drives her to a hotel???? Goes to a bar want just wanting to f\\*ck?? Then f\\*cks a gardner. And not to mention she's been sleeping with a married man. Pot is calling the kettle black here.\n\nShows up to her sister's work and threatens to basically cause trouble for her instead of just waiting later to talk like her sister asked.\n\nIs rude to her sister's boss before even really knowing her and then says that she should have been told her sister got a nose job as if Simone isn't an adult and can make her own choices.\n\nDemands her sister move back and help with their father. I get siblings should but she offered to help with money which would be good cause it sounds like he needs a home nurse or go to a place where they can take care of him full time or someone who can take care of him full time. Either sibling spending all their time taking care of a parent is not it. And let's not forget the dad neglected and abused Simone, so why would she want to help in the first place.\n\nSays personal stuff about their life to random people SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW!!!!\n\nGoes to the party after Simone told her to stay in the house until she was done with work and she shows up causing problems. No respect for Simone at all.\n\nThey give her money to take care of her dad because Simone doesn't want her there and demands her sister come home???? Like what. She clearly doesn't want to go. A sibling showing up to their siblings work and demanding their grown adult sibling to go home with them when it's clear the sibling doesn't want to is beyond wild.\n\nTalks about how her boss is controlling AS IF DEVON ISN'T. Girl is trying to force her sister home to take care of their dad because she doesn't want to do it alone and thinks Simone's owes her and wants her on meds. Says \"You're going to buffalo with me\" like huh?!?! How is that not controlling?\n\nBelieved strangers about gossip and ran with it. Gossip she heard in jail by a drunk lady who couldn't even remember Devon's name.\n\nSimone doesn't owe her anything. Simone was in an abusive environment before Devon come back and when her sister was somewhere else she shows up demanding she return home to help take care of their dad. And tries to guilt her into coming back when she refuses multiple times. What person wants to help someone who neglected and abused them and furthered their trauma?? And even says \"You don't feel any responsibility for him?\" um no. Since when are children supposed to be indebted to their abusers. And then she tries to tell her \"You sound like a b\\*tch off your meds\". You mean her anxiety meds? The ones her doctor told her she doesn't need to take because you can heal from it. Then says \"you are only alive because of me\", and that means she owes you? She then left her to be abused/neglected and are actively trying to manipulate her, she owes her nothing. And then storms away saying \"You don't need me anymore well good f\\*cken luck\" as if Simone hasn't been doing things on her own for 10 years!!!! Like dear lord.\n\nLater kinda blames her drinking and DUI on someone else as if they forced her to. Like you chose to drink he just drank with you. And got mad when he offered her a drink, which is what she normally does and she yells at him. He didn't even know she was sober when she yelled at him!! Like girl you are the problem.\n\nSimone isn't a saint at all but dear god why is Devon so insufferable. The ultimate victim mentality. I get she's mad and has trauma but dear lord above.\n\nAnd honestly I don't see how Peter is a monster either. The ending seems like Devon and Michaela are calling him one. But like what did he do that's monstrous? Sure he lied about going to see his son and grandchild, not exactly a terrible thing and completely understandable. Yes he kissed Simone and it wasn't right but neither pursued it after until Michaela fired her. And Michaela then fires her knowing what the job means to her and lies about it because she wants to get the upper hand on Peter or to keep her marriage that isn't exactly working anyway cause neither are very happy (wasn't very clear to me). Like no one in this situation is really a monster or all that terrible. Honestly the worst people to me are Devon and Ethan. Devon for all the reasons above and Ethan cause man over stepped his bounds  and didn't respect her privacy then acted like a man child and wouldn't take no for an answer at first then was being a jerk.\n\nEnd of rant.",

I've checked every device I use Netflix on and they're all set to audio English and subtitles off. \n\nCan't be the only one who has had this, how do I make it stop?\n\nEdit: so if someone speaks a foreign language on screen I get the same thing, the subtitles are in another language when they should be in English.

        "content": "I just saw my mother watching some foreign nonsense called The Sea Beyond earlier today. Not sure what it's all about, didn't really give a dang to find out. All I know about it was that it's another random foreign show Netflix has in its catalog, and it is one with horrid translation issues. And with this one, it's the worst I've ever seen with any of them as the subtitles were on as she watched it and literally NOTHING was matching what the actors, or rathe yet the DUBBED actors, were reciting or saying AT ALL!\n\nThat's been a major issue I've had with Neflix for years now when it comes to how they handle captions and subtitles for foreign shows and here, it's far more worse than any other one I've seen. I don't know why they never fixed that issue, but when it comes to the hard of hearing, it really does them a disservice more when they don't realize what they're reading doesn't match of to what they're watching.\n\nEspecially when they're charging nearly thirty bucks a month for the bloody thing. With all that they could've been able afford to improve their subtitle tech. Use AI on that for improved accuracies or something , if they want. ",

        "content": "Remembered about a few months ago I saw that total drama had all of the seasons available on Netflix, I recently checked and saw that it only has season 1. In short, how many seasons of total drama are available of Netflix for Canadian users, I\u2019ve seen people say Canada should have all of the seasons and perhaps there could be a glitch with mine.",

I'm a huge fan of the thriller and mystery genres \u2014 love anything that keeps me on the edge of my seat or has a solid \"whodunit\" vibe.\n\nWould really appreciate your recommendations!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone, for your recommendations. I'm watching, \"The Residence\" since most of you recommended it, and I'm loving it.\n\n",

I hope he gets rid of his beard in future films as well as he looks really young here and if he can continue to be this expressive then the films shall also start doing better. (Ofcourse with good scripts as well which I highly doubt shall happen).",
