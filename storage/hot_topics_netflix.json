Have been using the same account without issue for years. Each time i start netflix or my parents start netflix i need to verify the account. \n\nAnybody know what to do? As we are literally the same household. Same adress and everything and according to the law where i live, we literally live in the same household. I even have to use their bathroom as i am just living in the guesthouse in their garden which is just a room basically..... \n\nIts getting a tad annoying for both of us having to verify emails every time the other logs in.

Imagine Gi-hun discovering that the Front Man was the detective\u2019s brother\u2014and instead of immediately trying to blow up the system, he played along in the games to dig deeper.\n\nPicture Gi-hun maneuvering through the games with this knowledge, inching closer to exposing the truth. And then\u2014boom!\u2014a climactic face-off between Gi-hun and the Front Man in the end. The layers of drama, the personal stakes, the moral dilemmas\u2014it could\u2019ve been an incredible payoff for both characters\u2026. May be this is what we will get in season 3! ",
