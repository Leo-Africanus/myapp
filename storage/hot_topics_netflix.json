Big mistake, apparently, because after making that change one time, every single movie or show that I start has portuguese audio and subtitles, and I have to change it back to english. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe PS5 app doesn't have any \"default language\" settings that I can find, aside from one on the show page that seems to be specific to that show. Of course, changing this to english doesn't stick - every time I come back to a show it has been changed back to portuguese.\n\nMy phone app does have a \"Manage Profiles\" option which allows me to select a language. I changed this to english. In fact, I have changed it to english several times over the last few days, and it keeps changing itself back to portuguese.\n\nThe \"Manage Profiles\" option on the netflix website also has a language option, though this appears to impact the menus rather than the in-show audio. This has been english all along and has not changed.\n\nI have tried logging out and logging back in. I have deleted the app from my devices and redownloaded it. I have logged out of ALL devices and changed everything I could back to english. Nothing changes. On every device, everything always defaults back to portuguese. It's driving me insane.\n\nHas anyone else had a problem like this? Am I missing a hidden setting somewhere? Or do I just have to accept my fate and learn portuguese to continue using Netflix?\n\nEDIT: after some more experimentation I have managed to get to a place where movies play in english, but shows still play in portuguese. This makes even less sense to me, but I guess it's a slight improvement?",
