Now, it wasn\u2019t just the actual show that made it amazing, getting to watch it with my brothers and cousins, late night watches, and watch parties with some of my favorite people for S5 all contributed to making it my favorite show! Now I know I cannot replicate some of those factors, but an amazing, hooking, emotional show can help start the process of finding a show to cover up the sadness from ST being over. Please recommend a show you think I should watch that will start another stage of happiness and deep thoughts and conversations related to the show. Maybe a show that you just personally loved or even a show where you had a similar experience as I did! Anything, just please give recommendations for shows on Netflix that I will fall in love with.

Pero no cuadra ya que tienen el mismo ADN, as\u00ed que en alg\u00fan momento de otra L.T. (Linea temporal) antes de la muerte de la hija de Panida, se esfumo por las primeras rupturas temporales que experimento Panida, y la Varee de 2024 (En la L.T de la serie) la adopto, y en esa L.T. se quedo en b\u00facle a raz\u00f3n de las rupturas temporales.\n\nPor el momento esa me convence, de ser otra resulta en un final incestuoso que continua con la nieta, bisnieta, tataranieta, etc. De Panida.  \nAunque el padre no sea el coronel, ya que el mismo lo admite, la panza de Varee-Min sigue ah\u00ed por lo tanto el incesto sigue presente. Okey, ya me volv\u00ed a contradecir. Ya que Varee-Min tiene una panza de embarazada a menos que no sea, supongo que mi anterior teor\u00eda tiene sentido.\n\nEntonces.. que tal que haya tenido relaciones consigo misma con una Varee del 91 (pero hombre) que por las rupturas temporales (y lineales) vino a otra linea en el mismo tiempo y tuvo una hija con la Varee- Esto est\u00e1 muy revoltoso.
