        "content": "I was excited to watch EMILIA PEREZ tonight and resubbed to Netflix for the first time in a while. \n\nI only watch things on my PC Desktop (high-end machine, fiber connection). For years I was able to get a great bitrate (8+ Mbps) by using their Win 11 desktop app. I seemed to recall they'd lowered their computer-streaming bitrate recently so I chose to get the most expensive plan, thinking maybe if I opted for the 4k version it would give me a higher bitrate while streaming to PC. It did not. \n\nEMILIA PEREZ came through at 2.5Mbps. \n\n(insert grey death suffering meme guy). \n\nI gave it 25 mins of low-bitrate nonsense before I fired up \\[an alternate viewing option\\]. I'm writing this as I wait the 15 mins for it to download.\n\nI'm still happy to give Netflix my money for the month. I *want* to pay them for content that I want to watch. I want that content to get my views. But for some reason Netflix decided to *regress* in quality (I believe this bitrate downgrade came right around COVID, similar to Google removing the ability to play owned movies on YouTube.) At least we'll always have Apple - supporting 21:9 monitor-owners since 2010. \n\nI'm not going to ask: \"Why do they do this?\". I know. You know. It's because we don't matter, and they don't care. The amount of people who watch Netflix exclusively on PCs is probably 0.0001% of their user base and we're not worth catering to. That makes sense. I just wish they figured out some way for their service to be able to feed us a higher bitrate stream of their content. I get that people who own TVs probably don't notice or care about bitrate, but computer-streaming people would. ",

The longer this delay continues, the more I think that\u2019s bullshit. I dno what the real issue is, but if that\u2019s what happened, how come it didn\u2019t affect any other Netflix shows/movies? Everything else seems to be relatively on track. \n\nAlso, the last I heard was that the movie was possibly being moved to 2026 now! Im not sure how legit that is though. If it is, what is the issue? At this rate, I\u2019m betting they won\u2019t be making any more after this one finally releases. IF it releases. I\u2019m starting to doubt we will ever get it at this point.\n\nLastly, I was super surprised that the sub for this movie has less than 700 followers. I was going to post there, but that sub is not very active. \n\nSo my questions to all of you:\n\nDo you think the change in leadership was the actual issue? I know there were multiple issues, but, other than the strikes, this seems to be the one that they cite specifically as delaying them. \n\nDoes anybody have any concrete information on a possible release date?

        "content": "I have been using Sennheiser HD 4.50s with my Google Pixel 6 for the past 3 years with no audio issues on any app other than Netflix but as soon as I put on a show while using my headphones the problems begin. Audio delay on every single show, movie, or anything I watch on Netflix. Anyone have any suggestions? I have no audio issues with any other streaming services, or YouTube or with any downloaded files. Correction. I just confirmed I am having issues with audio delay on Disney plus as well but not with YouTube. ",
