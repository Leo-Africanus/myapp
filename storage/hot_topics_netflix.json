I\u2019m never gonna go to Netflix to watch a podcast. I\u2019d rather just not watch the podcast. The numbers will reflect the sentiment because I know I\u2019m not alone. ",

The series was episodical and it was just about the girl, nothing too fantastic. It was not anime, it was a 2d series and it was on netflix between 2012-2018 at least on Chile.\nI remember the ending being in portuguese, but I haven't find any series in portuguese that fit the series. Plz help, I want to be able to sleep, but I have to find this series.\n(No, is no Luna's world)\nThanks!",

Just really funny, great characters and consistent quality.\n\nWhat surprised me is how such a serious topic is handled in a comedy. Somehow they are able to address the topic of addiction and still be able to laugh.\n\nGreat show. ",
