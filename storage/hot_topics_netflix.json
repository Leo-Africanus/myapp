Linda Cardellini just seemed like she was still a part of Dead To Me. Lisa Kudrow on the other hand was fantastic. She did the part of a grieving mother so well. Ray Romano too was so good and Luke Wilson as well. It seemed like such a sweet and a good holiday binge kind of a show that isn't too heavy or hard on your brains and eyes. They should bring it back for another season with different characters and a story. Just shame how it wasn't promoted as well or we don't have many people talking about it. ",

        "content": "Here's where I currently stand on Netflix as a whole:  \n  \nAs an example: If Netflix produced Star Trek: The Next Generation, it would have been cancelled after the first season and it would never have become as huge as it is today.  \n  \nNetflix needs to take more responsibility to bring stories to fruition and conclusion. Stop producing so much absolute C, D and F grade productions.   \n  \nFocus up and work to improve the shows that have traction to be there. You cancel shows with viewers measured in millions and waste money producing umpteen 100's of things with viewership measured in thousands. \n\nPeople pay good money to spend their time getting involved in concepts, plots, character development, etc., only to have Netflix repeatedly and relentlessly pull the plug on them. \n\nAlso becomes difficult to find things worth watching because you have to browse forever through low grade productions on the platform. \n\nPersonally, I think they should stop wasting so much money, only to pull the plug on good productions because of.... money, and stick to their guns and see things through. \n\nThere's a mathematical reality to having, for example, 10,000 things to watch, spread over your subscribership, vs 5,000 higher quality things spread over your viewership. Viewership hours are finite. They put so much out there, they distract viewership from coagulating onto good productions that rely on viewership to continue production. It seems like they do not understand this basic concept. \n\nCurious to hear what you all think, please comment below :) ",
