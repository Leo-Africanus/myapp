        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m trying to track down a Japanese film I watched on Netflix around 2010-2011. I\u2019m sure it was a sex film. Not sexual scenes but scenes with full blast sex. The movie had explicit sex scenes, comedic elements, and was definitely in the adult or niche section of Netflix at the time.\n\nSome details I remember:\n\t\u2022\tThe film featured actual sex scenes (not just sexual content, but actual explicit scenes) of a young woman and an old man where he feels her up on and begins to try and have sex with her, he tries to penetrate her but she keeps blowing him until he finishes to prevent him from wanting to feel like finishing in her or whatever. \n\t\u2022\tIt had a comedic tone, not taking itself seriously.\n\t\u2022\tThere were scenes involving bugs being used in fights or some bizarre concept along those lines.\n\t\u2022\tAt one point, the suns face turned to the face of one Japanese dude in the film and started talking to him.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the word \u201csex\u201d was in the title, but it\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t recall the exact name. Has anyone seen a film with these themes from that era? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

All three components support HDCP 2.2.\n\nI was happily streaming in 1440p throughout the day when all of a sudden my stream was interrupted by an error message and after reloading the stream was stuck at 1080p again. I've tried clearing the cache for Microsoft Edge and restarting my computer to no avail. Graphics card driver and Windows update are both fully up to date. I pay for Netflix Premium. I also have the HEVC extension installed and I've tried resetting it. \n\nI reached out to Netflix support with the same details and the best advice I got was to try streaming through Safari. Needless to say, I'm hoping I get better advice here.",

I am very intrigued by it and the intersex dynamics between the contestants. \n\nThe men seem to lack [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!the aggression to claim their woman and I find it a bit comical but also frustrating at times. The guys lack confidence! They're overly cautious when they approach the women treating them like they're fragile. It's so gentlemanly to a fault. It's just not how things are supposed to be done. Their approach simply gives power to the women. It's so unusual for men to put their fate in the hands of a woman. It's so clumsy and awkward seeing men waiting with bated breath for a woman to pick them.!&lt;\n\nWhen the women experience rejection, it's just excruciating. It's painful to watch because they wear their emotions on their faces and that's just awful. [Single's Inferno Season 2]&gt;!One of the girls was so unfavoured by the men, she broke down in tears because she wasn't being picked. That was painful. I feel like the producers of the show had to step in to intervene as she eventually gets picked by a guy that's a twist entrant in the middle of the show. It's so against the grain of events it's clearly manufactured as the girl may have been contemplating leaving the show.!&lt;\n\nAnother problem that seems to be a societal norm is the [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!inability to move on. This criticism is levied against both men and women. When they are clearly not their targets favourite, they engage in this self destructive \"I refuse to move on\" thing that's so problematic. It's so twisted! That means that it's an obsession rather than a love interest. This is a critical flaw.!&lt;\n\nOverall the show is great. The women are beautiful and the men are good looking. It's nice seeing how things are done in a conservative society albeit frustrating at times. I do think that the episodes are too long and [Single's Inferno Season 1 &amp; 2]&gt;!I'm not a fan of the physical challenges that earn people first choice rights. I think they made a mistake here and should've gone with a random system instead.!&lt;",

No credits and still much part of the show. \n\nSuddenly a take over title card for prison break came up while still playing the audio and shortly after went to a trailer for it. And then the first episode of the show \n\nWtf? I excited and picked up where it left off and then it did play til the actual end. But why would they do this? Just so you\u2019re on Netflix more? Super annoying. ",
