        "content": "Netflix has seriously harmed it's reputation with how often it is now cancelling shows. What used to be seen as the go-to service for saving cancelled shows, has now become the very thing it swore to destroy {Hello There Obi-Wan Kenobi reference). Netflix likes to repeat it's standard line that they have never cancelled a successful show, but they conveniently never tell us how they measure success, because this doesn't ring true with their shows like Lockwood &amp; Co and Shadow &amp; Bone, that got to both Number 1 and Number 2 respectively in Netflix's own published streaming charts, and that still wasn't enough to save those shows from cancellation. Also Netflix clearly has favourites in terms of marketing, for example I enjoyed the show Everything Now, but you've probably never heard of it, and I searched Facebook - Netflix did one post about it when they dropped the trailer 3 weeks before it's worldwide release, and that was it; but other shows like Bridgerton, you can't fail to know it's there because they post daily about it on their socials for weeks up to and including release and for weeks after too. You even have actors in a new show saying they have to search their show to find it so they can watch and it's not even advertised on Netflix's own home screen, let alone anywhere else, so no wonder these shows get cancelled as they are never given a fair shot to succeed.\n\nIt seems unless you go viral or break Netflix's own streaming records, like Stranger Things or Wednesday, then even getting the number one or number two spot is not good enough to save a program from cancellation. Netflix needs to remember that not all releases are an overwhelming overnight success - even some of the best and most popular shows took a while to find their audience, like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The West Wing, The Sopranos, but then when they did find their audience they became what everyone was talking about, and people who had never seen the show, still knew about them from it's impact on the cultural audience. Somebody else said, and I truly believe it, that if Netflix had made Breaking Bad today, they would have cancelled it after two seasons, and then think what great storytelling we would have missed out on, all because the show wasn't a record hit in it's opening week.\n\nAnd now Netflix finds itself in a self-fullfilling loop where they have now trained their audience to not try new shows and get attached as they'll likely be cancelled. Think about it, how many new shows can you think of on Netflix that got renewed last year. It only seems to be people will tune in for shows like Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Outer Banks, as they have had time to grow with the characters, so now Netflix has got themselves in to a model where customers don't try a new show, like KAOS or Everything Now, and they'll wait and see if it's renewed, and when after only a month since it's release, it does indeed get cancelled, the consumer hasn't wasted time getting invested in a show &amp; characters that get cut short, especially nowadays when there is so much to watch across traditional TV and now streaming services too, that just because the audience doesn't come running to watch as soon as it drops, doesn't mean it's not there or interested.\n\n2025 see's the return of some of Netflix's biggest shows like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things, but 2 out of those 3 also end this year too and then what shows will be left that are associated with the Netflix brand - they had Stranger Things, House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black when Netflix first got going, it'll be hard to say by the end of this year what big shows Netflix will have left to draw customers in\n\nUnless Netflix, and the wider industry, change their perception to not only see massive, viral numbers as success and that shows with strong-moderate success are allowed to grow and widen their audience, then there will eventually reach a tipping point where they will cancel one show too many that either customers leave their service, or creatives will decide that Netflix isn't a good partner to work with where you put years of work in writing, filming, producing, editing a project just for it to be cancelled a month after it's release, so if you have a story that needs more than one film or a one and done series to tell it in, then Netflix probably isn't your best bet any longer.\n",

I\u2019ve watched a few of them because they had high ratings on popular platforms like IMDb, but honestly, they turned out to be pretty average.\n\nWhen I see an anime with ratings similar to my top-tier favorites (*Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Erased, Demon Slayer, Solo Leveling, Jujutsu Kaisen, The Promised Neverland*), I expect it to be on the same level. However, when I think about Netflix anime, the ones that come to mind are *DanDaDan* and *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, and in comparison, they feel mid at best.\n\nI have a theory that maybe these shows get such high ratings because a lot of people watching them haven\u2019t actually seen truly great anime (except for what's available on Netflix). What do you think?\n\n**P.S.** I intentionally didn\u2019t mention series like *Naruto, Bleach,* or *One Piece*.

The astronaut goes off to space and her ship is lost.  Her girlfriend was a space flight director.  They encountered an alien presence that was using her girlfriend's image to lure her in.  Does it sound familiar?  I know the song space oddity was used alot.",

        "title": "The ending of American Primeval did an amazing job. What do you think?",
        "content": "(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nThe way American Primeval wrapped up was straight-up poetic. The Mormons taking over Utah showed just how ruthless power grabs were back then . Ironically the same kind of evil that was forced onto them when their religion first started. Jim Bridger giving up his fortress really drove home the idea that every man has a price. Sometimes even the strongest can be swayed. The Natives gave up their right to peace with the whites just to keep Abish safe, only for Jacob to be the one who killed her. That was brutal. And Isaac\u2019s last act, getting Devin and Sarah to safety was a heartbreaking parallel to what he couldn\u2019t do for his own wife and son. The worst part? That\u2019s exactly what got him killed. Every story came full circle in a way that felt raw, tragic, and strangely perfect. I give it a 9.6",
