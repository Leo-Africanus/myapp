I\u2019m not good at understanding themes so forgive me if some of my questions are really stupid. \n\nTHEME QUESTIONS \n\n1. What does the child being sent up represent in both movies? I understand how the platform is supposed to represent capitalism and society but what does that he children being sent up supposed to represent? \n\n2. What does the children scene in platform 2 represent? The one with all the kids fighting for the top of the pyramid? Why does the winner of the game get sent to the bottom of the platform? What is that even supposed to mean. \n\n3. What was the animal cruelty supposed to represent? The cruelty of people? There\u2019s one scene where the platform goes all the way to the bottom and we hear animals clawing and growling. What does that mean?\n\n4. What was the point of the fat guy who liked pizza. What was his representation of the theme? \n\n5. There were several biblical references throughout, like mentoring the word savior multiple times, 666 people in the platform, and the christian black guy. What do those represent? \n\n6.  Does the law and the people trying to enforce the one meal a day in platform 2 supposed to represent communism? \n\n\n\nPLOT QUESTIONS \n\n1. Was the girl at the bottom real in platform 1? Was she the message? I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not because they show in the mid credits scene the chefs reacting to the panna cotta but not the kid.\n\n2. How does the main character girl of platform 2 survive at the very bottom of the pit all the way until she is reunited with her ex?\n\n3. What is the point of the platform? Is it like the cube where we\u2019ll never know its purpose? \n\n4. Why does miharu search for her kid after willingly let her kid play in the pyramid game? She knew that there was a chance of her kid getting chosen right?\n\n5. So sending a kid up wasn\u2019t the message right? Because the girl sent up the black kid and the platform kept on going. What\u2019s the point of the kids then. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot and some of them might be stupid questions but i\u2019m a stupid person so thanks if you can answer these ",

It was cool seeing more sides of the Squid Games other than the games themselves.\n\nLee Jung-jae does an incredible job in showing the development his character went through and how it has matured Gi-hun.\n\nNew additions like Thanos, Kim Jun Hee, Cho Hyun-ju and others were great additions to the show. \n\nAnd seeing the mastermind play the games, at one point, i thought he actually turned good. But later events proved otherwise\u2026\n\nI want to specifically point out that those last 2 episodes were also INSANE.\n\nMy only complaint is how the season ends, in my opinion it was a bad spot to end it. It kinda feels like were in the middle of an episode and BOOM, ending.\n\nI cant wait to see how season 3 picks up, especially after how it ended.\n\nAnd this last thing is kind of a tangent. I wonder if David Finchers American remake wont be a remake, but possibly a spin off, showing that the organization is global, and season 3 could possibly set that up.",

        "content": "Will Season 3 of SG have enough time to connect the dots?\n\nI\u2019ve sat with the shows second season for almost a week now, and have watched it multiple times. I enjoy most parts of the season, and am excited for the next, however, I\u2019m a bit confused as to where exactly it will go from here.\n\nObviously, S2 is only around half of the complete storyline Dong-hyuk wrote, with S3 being the other half, as well as the finale of the show. Gi-hun being captured\n\nS2 ends with Gi-hun and Jung-bae being captured, after In-ho, who is (unbeknownst to the other characters) the Frontman, switches back to his true identity whilst they think he is dead. Jung-bae is killed in front of Gi-hun, and the show ends there, with many things left up in the air.\n\nUnlike S1, there are other players aside from Gi-hun who are alive, since we hadn\u2019t even made it passed all the games. \n\nThere are many subplots within this season. \n\nThere are many side characters with their own developments.\n\nFor example, whilst the game is going on, we have Gi-gun and Jun-ho\u2019s crew going island to island looking for him. In the final episode, Captain Park is revealed to be traitor (once again, unbeknownst to the other characters). The next season not only has to address that, but also wrap up this subplot by them either finding the island, or someone finding them.\n\nAnother example, a woman (whose name I forget) is shown throughout the series from her perspective as a guard in the games. She was given a background earlier in the show, and has had decent amounts of screen time. The show clearly wants us to acknowledge her. However, not much really happens with her character. She recognizes a person in the game that she knew in real life, and she goes out of her way to disrupt the other guards organ-selling operation by making sure the players are all the way dead before buried, but other than that, her arc is left up in the air with no real sense of direction.\n\nOf course, they also have to address the main game itself. Do the games just, continue? It\u2019d feel weird if there wasn\u2019t some sort of shift between S2 and 3.\n\nI have much more on my mine but my yap session is about over. In all, I have high hopes for season 3 considering I like season 2, and they were both filmed at the same time, and I trust that Dong-hyuk has fully realized the story.\n\nI only hope that they are able to tie everything together without rushing past things they previously set up.",

        "content": "I am on the road for work regularly.  Will Netflix allow two people to use it if they have different locations or will i have to tell the household they are out of luck if I want to use the account while in a different time zone (since I assume this looks like account sharing to them).\n\nAlso how much time of commercials do you see if you sign-up for the cheaper option on a 90 minute movie?\n\nNever previously considered Netflix but one of the hotels I frequent has blocked devices from functioning on their TVs (so no more travelling with a firestick).",
