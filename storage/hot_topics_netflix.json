Is true that in many latino families parents are authoritarian and egocentric, to the point of being violent. Older generations used to tell stories about that time when the father sent the kid to the hospital or that other time when the mother public shamed the children, to teach them a lesson but that kind of behaviour is toxic, creates trauma and in recent years latino culture in a whole have been trying to eradicate this kind of toxicity.\n\nThis kind of humour is something you'd expect from a 90s comedian, not from a stand up comedian in 2025. Sorry but the second part of the show was not funny, it sounded like someone's coping mechanism with traumatic experiences, something very common in latino families.",

        "content": "I saw this come up again in a post, and there isn't a lot of good info out there on how to fix 4k streaming... so here's what worked for me.\n\nThe issue is that all streaming sites limit quality to prevent people from *'the unmentionable act of yo hoing and yarring with a parrot on your shoulder that gets your post auto moded'*. They do this through a few different types of DRM. Most notably AV1, HEVC, and Playready.\n\nCurrently the only browser capable of being DRM compliant is Microsoft Edge. To see if you are DRM complaint type \"Edge://gpu\" into your MS edge address bar and look for this section\n\n    Media Foundation Rendering Capabilities\n    =======================================\n    PlayReady Hardware DRM disabled: false\n    Direct Composition             : true\n    Dolby Atmos support            : false\n    AV1 installed                  : true\n    AV1 activable                  : true\n    AV1 version                    : AV1:2.0.6.0\n    HEVC installed                 : true\n    HEVC activable                 : true\n    HEVC version                   : HEVC:2.4.39.0\n    Display:                       : Scaled: [0,0 1920x1080] Scale: 2.00 Actual: [0,0 3840x2160]\n    GPU Index                      : GPU0\n    HEVC - Dolby Vision support    : false\n    HEVC - HDR10 support           : true\n    HDCP 2.2 support               : true\n    HEVC - 4K support              : true\n\nWhat you care about is Av1 being true, HEVC 4k being true, and Playready disabled being false (double negative, it means your hardware is not being disabled because it is playready compliant).\n\nYou can download the HEVC and AV1 codecs in the MS store if you need them. If your playread is set to true... well that's going to be a fun rabbit hole for you to go down to see if your Monitor, Cable, and GPU are PlayReady supported.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "content": "(Spoiler alert, this is for people who have watched it) To be completely honest, no Netflix show has ever actually made me want to sit and waste my time writing a Reddit post, but this one blew my mind. First of all, I love how EVERYTHING connects in the end, no loose plot holes, shout out to Harlan Coben for that. All of the missing and deceased being related and connected to some absolutely mind blowing cult is just, **WOW.** Most shows leave holes and cliffhangers, I don't know if you can count Ingrid being an ex member of the cult as a cliffhanger, I'm 50/50 on it. The ending was good but also it would of been more refreshing if it ended on a more happier note, instead of the close up frame of James Nesbitt's ghostly \"I know something\" face. Alfred Enoch was brilliant as a detective and I never expected him and his police partner Ruby (Amy Gledhill) to be dating. We were also shown Tracy-Ann Obeman whom I immediately recognized as Aunt Val from Friday Night Dinner. The only bits I were iffy on were the casting for the oldies. Lou was okay, Kevin's old neighbor not so much. Only because you could tell she was acting from a script. But otherwise the casting was 10/10. Story, also 10/10. I'd love to hear other thoughts on it. ",

        "content": "Can I just say that I love shows/movies where the familial relationships are the main focus of the story. Like forget ships, give me a set of siblings duking it out, dealing with dysfunctional parents, while trying to get through life\u2019s ups and downs any day of the week.\n\nI know this is on the unpopular side but I love that they introduced Kali as El\u2019s sister and that we found out more about her backstory, and for a period of time El wasn\u2019t always alone.\n\nWe know that El ends up losing her memory and struggles to piece together all of the crazy shit that has happened to her, so it really did feel like a missing piece to her puzzle was filled when she reunited with Kali.\n\nThey needed each other. Yes, we know El loves Mike, Hopper, along with having an understanding with Will in knowing what he has went through with Vecna and the rest of the party but having that sibling bond is something that you can\u2019t fake, force, or dismiss.\n\nWe know that Kali was in a different headspace in 1984 when the sisters first reunited, in comparison to how Kali is in 1987. Kali was clearly a broken bird when we met up with her again, and of course she would be, her friends get murdered in front of her, she gets beaten, her head gets shaved again, and then she becomes a human blood bag to an abusive, tyrannical military woman. Easy to see why she wasn\u2019t in the greatest had space even though they were down to the wire in preparing to fight Vecna.\n\nI mean look at their faces when the find each other in Season 5. El apologizing for leaving, and wishing that she had looked for her, and Kali not holding that against El is so sweet. So many fans believe that Kali was jealous of El, and even that Kali even blamed El for why she got caught, and it was not that at all.\n\nKali was in angry, pessimistic, and in despair, but she would never take it out on El.\n\nSeason 4 was so bad, hard, and devastating for El, could you imagine if Kali was there, no shit that bully Angela would have BEEN got her ass handed to her by Kali even before El put that skate to her face lol.\n\nI love that Kali always called El \"Jane\" as well. Kali is \"Little Big Sister\", and El is the \"Big Little Sister\" so cute.\n\nI know that this is a lot, and Kali has divided a lot of fans but I really wish we would have gotten more of Kali, El's sisterhood. They really fought hard to have normal lives, and to be something more than just than their numbers, and what the government wanted them to be.\n\nMy head canon is that both of them are chilling at the waterfalls, living it up, happy and at peace together.",

I\u2019m genuinely surprised more people aren't calling out how problematic this story is It\u2019s marketed as a dreamy romancebut if you look close up it\u2019s  nightmare of toxic dynamics Alex is WeakWilled Masochist man who spent years leading a double life He has a longterm girlfriend Sarah his high school sweetheart Yet every year he saves his most precious time and emotional energy for Bobby He also gave her greater hope in their relationship after proposing to her, following bobby onesided lover or what he thought attemp to kiss him only to change her mind seconds later telling him he was just a friend This isn't friendship this textbook Emotional Affair He lives a parallel life with Bobby  during these vacations It\u2019s pure masochism to spend days watching the woman you love in the arms of other men only to go back to your actual girlfriend and pretend everything is fine He essentially set Sarah aside keeping her as a placeholder until he could finally get his desired tormentor That makes him a total ass\ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\u060cIt is incredibly naive to bet your life on someone you only know through vacations and good times Real relationships aren\u2019t built on summer cocktails and 5-day trips they built on the mundane, ugly, daily grind Alex doesn't know the real Bobby he knows the \"vacation version\" of her Basing a future on that is just pure stupidity, Ohhh Bobby Bobby Bobby\u060c she literally has everything yet she constantly centers herself as the victim Her trauma? People called her names in high school Look bullying is horrible Oki,but hello? Welcome to the real world Thousands of people have faced bullying with a horror and brutality that words cannot describe and they didn't turn into selfcentered  people who disregard everyone else's feelings She uses her past as a shield to justify her need for attention the fact that She's a grown woman while also keep doing is  just weird, Let's not forget the attempt to kiss the person she calls her platonic friend only to tell him seconds later that he's just  friend and What disgusted me most was the treatment of Sarah Bobby  knew about Alex and Sarah\u2019s relationship and as a woman she should have had some empathy  but she just didn't care,And Sarah She is not entirely victim She stayed for years likely because being high school sweethearts and constantly getting back together gave her the false hope that Alex was committed to her but She should have given herself aslap and gotten out of this strange relationship to me The ultimate insult was that Bobby was invited to the brother's wedding but Sarah not \u060c she was the actual girlfriend of years ?  I have never seen a more blatant humiliation The little apology Poppy finally offered Sarah was joke After years of emotionally hijacking her boyfriend a \"sorry\" is just pure audacity It\u2019s not justice it\u2019s plain rudeness and entitlement This story doesn't celebrate love it celebrates two people who are too selfish to care about the collateral damage they leave behind However I'm grateful they ended up together each shoe only fits the one that matches it Oh man why are they making Wattpad teen stories into movies? Am I the only one who sees this? I mean few years ago I would love it I just i hate how growing up is sucks \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\n  \nedit: I also think Two heroes They are incompatible with each other there is no energy attraction or chemistry between them \n\n",

She even does exactly what was shown in the trailer, shooting at Eleven &amp; co.\n\nI know that being Sarah Connor in those 2 terminator movies is the only career highlight of her, but being in Stranger things doesn't change much either (for her &amp; the show)",

It just got me thinking that there\u2019s a lot more shows that ended poorly than end. Great.",

        "content": "It's not a review. It's a rant. Because I'm disappointed. \n\nI watched it mainly because it\u2019s a limited series and because Jon Bernthal is in it. Even then, it was hard to push myself to finish it in one go. The ending was painfully bad, and the writing felt lazy.\n\nIt feels like the creators tried too hard to misdirect the audience by scattering half baked subplots everywhere, without committing to any of them properly.\n\nJack Harper is an especially poorly written detective. He\u2019s introduced as a caring and sharp investigator, but from the very first crime scene he behaves like a clueless amateur. He\u2019s a detective, yet when he clearly senses he\u2019s in trouble, he doesn\u2019t act like one at all.\n\nThere were several clues, like the phone, that ultimately went nowhere except for a confrontation with Duffie, which itself was a mess. A detective says \u201cyou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d the suspect runs away, and he just stands there doing nothing. That was the moment I completely lost interest. (I don't want to even get into the swab thing and ring lost scene)\n\nFrom then on, nothing felt even remotely believable.\nZoe tries to warn Jack, and he doesn\u2019t even bother to consider what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s unbelievable that, after two people close to his sister died, he still fails to see a pattern or ask her for any unknown stories.\n\nAny normal person would have connected the dots and at least listened to her. The Catherine to Lexy transformation was a stretch, but that can be excused for the sake of the story.\n\nFrom what I understood, Anna went to the cemetery in the first scene, saw them having sex, went back to Atlanta, decided to start over, and when she couldn\u2019t get the job back, she used a hometown murder she saw on social media for field reporting so that she can go back to her town formally.\n\nEven then, the timeline makes no sense. Her disappearance was only for a year. What makes even less sense is why she married the brother of a former friend who watched and enjoyed while she was SA'd. She never tells him the truth and continues to live in the same town. None of this adds up.\n\nThe worst and most foolish twist was the mother\u2019s revenge plot. It might have worked if it had been slowly spread into the story. Instead, it\u2019s dumped on the audience in the final minutes through a letter voiceover, making it feel rushed and absurd.\n\nAnd Zoe\u2019s murder, the complete absence of her daughter\u2019s reaction or even her presence, and the fact that he does not bother to check on the daughter when he finds Zoe in the bathtub or even after the final headshot. and then in the final scene the daughter leaves flowers only for the infant. None of it makes any sense.\n\n",
