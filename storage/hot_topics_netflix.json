Half way through the show I thought this was sci-fi and then it got weirder and weirder. I skipped through most of the family scenes  to save some time and I was mostly curious where they're going with this. Then came people dying mysteriously, cartoon villians from the government performing medical experiments on people searching for \"the Holy Grail\", \"The Major\" who's way up the ranks to conduct large operations that even the NSA is not aware of. The scientist who's there to explain shit to people with psychic powers called \"the calling\".\n\nI got even more excited when I realized there's 4 seasons of this. I don't know how it was even possible to stretch this for that many seasons and this got my curiosity even more. Most of the time I'm just skipping through the episodes until I get to see Michaela's pretty face but everything's all connected. Wow.\n\nTwenty years from now, this is gonna be a cult classic. Calling it now.",

I want something worth spending time on, and well-made. \n\nHere are the shows that entertained me.\n\n1. Persian Lessons \n\n2. Midnight at the Pera Palace (Turkish)\n\n3.

I am using a wired connection through the same Wi-Fi box it wants me to sign into. I have a high-end PC and use Ethernet because it gives the best connection. I have Comcast for internet and cable. Netflix is part of my plan and I pay extra for an upgraded version through Comcast.\n\nThis only happens on my PC. It does not happen on the TV, Fire Stick, or Comcast box. My PC is in a different room and I like to play shows while I work.\n\nWhat made it more frustrating is that Netflix sends a code by email that expires in 15 minutes. Each time the email took around 20 minutes to arrive. After five failed tries it made me wait 24 hours before I could try again.\n\nI checked and the only devices connected are inside the house. Does anyone else have to deal with this nonsense.   ",

Not only that but my 2 siblings who are also out at university have to ask for a code, so my mom will just have to send a code out every 5 days, that's annoying... Anyone know where I can complain to Netflix? Because I couldn't find anything and have resulting in complaining to reddit. \n\nCome on Netflix... you can do better. ",
