I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Beck was so shitty towards him and the relationship she didn\u2019t really care. Marianne literally was a homewrecker. Love was crazy as hell I wish they would\u2019ve stayed together. Kate was a hypocrite, a complicit contrite hypocrite. Bront\u00eb was honestly just annoying as hell. Penn played the hell out of this role though.

I wanted to root for him\u2014but ultimately, he\u2019s a deeply flawed man who keeps making the same mistakes, over and over again, with no real desire or ability to grow. Every time he\u2019s close to change, he snaps back to his core self\u2014likely a result of the deep abandonment wound left by his mother. He\u2019s constantly trying to fill that gaping void, chasing broken love and clinging to fantasies of acceptance.\n\nHe\u2019s also a massive hypocrite\u2014one of the biggest. He says he wants love, claims he just wants someone to accept him for who he is. That\u2019s why he lashes out at Kate, accusing her of being evil when she struggles to accept the dark things he\u2019s done for her. In truth, Joe demands unconditional love without offering true honesty in return. All he wants is peace\u2014but he thinks peace comes from being understood, not from taking accountability.\n\nLooking back, Love Quinn was arguably his perfect match. She accepted all of him\u2014his obsessive love, his violent side, everything. She loved the monster and the man. But even then, he couldn\u2019t handle it. He saw her as the monster, projected his shame onto her, and pushed her away\u2014just as he\u2019s done with every woman who ever threatened to see him for what he really is.\n\nJoe is a brilliant character. But as a person, he\u2019s trapped inside a maze with no exit\u2014a cycle of self-delusion, obsession, and destruction. A loop of tragic self-reinvention where each version of himself is just a new disguise for the same broken soul.\n",
