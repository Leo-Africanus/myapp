Plus, it\u2019s a quick hour and a half movie which is a genre I feel is harder to find these days. Highly recommend as a comforting holiday watch!",

He was honest about how American culture is so twisted with money when it comes to their own parents and America.  He made so many important points that people in general should really reflect on.  I love this guy - reminds me so much of George Carlin.  I had no idea who he was but I tend to watch what\u2019s in the top 10 and this is.  Not as heart felt as Jamie Foxx\u2019s special but clearly a different story there.  Ronny paid tribute to his dad at the end and I had some tears but I hadn\u2019t laughed that hard in so long.  I hope he does more specials/ tours - before he decides to peace out. I\u2019d pay to see him to make me laugh.    I wanted to see who else watched and everyone\u2019s thoughts were.  Did you love it as much as me or were you insulted like some people are by comedians these days? ",
