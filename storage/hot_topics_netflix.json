Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

It's good, I could see lots of references and demonstration of our capitalist society. It is also fun and good to see people collaborating because it is what people would naturally do in that situation.\n\nEpisode 5. Also a commentary on the exploitative nature of the system. But the violence is over-the-top and isn't what normal people would ever do. The most anyone would do is to threaten them to earn more points. Everything else was highly unnecessary. And I also don't think it's possible to keep going when you are getting hit like that everyday. \n\nThere is literally no way anyone would ever do what 4, 6, and 8 did. It would work only if they were freaking psychopaths chosen deliberately. That's the only logical answer to their actions.\n\nEpisode 6-8. If you really wanna watch this drama, I recommend you to stop on episode 6. The lower class people revolt and they get their peaceful ending there. Anything past that was unnecessary and outright DUMB. Highlight the word DUMB.\n\nThe psychological torture scenes were unnecessary and over the top cruel, too disturbing even. \n\nAfter episode 6, I just skipped through most parts because it became unbearable for a few reasons.\n\n1. The characters become stupid. \n\nCouldn't they just keep buying stuff until the time is over? Even if 1st floor is against it, they were more than willing to cover his cost so I see no point in them continuing the BS. \nAlso the \"no-violence we-cant-harm-them\" thing was just??? Personally, I would've at least scarred 8's face or something.\n\n2. Their motivations for doing things don't make sense anymore.\n\nWhy did 5th floor just go along with 8? She had multiple chances to stop her but she simply didn't and until 4 convinced her, she wasn't even thinking about saving the others??? They went on and on about how much they suffered and how deep their bond is and then suddenly 5 was helping 8?\n\nAlso, the fact that 8 has gotten away with everything she did was... just ugh. I also don't understand how anyone of them didn't think of killing her. It was obvious what she would do after she gets out into the world with that much of a money. She would definitely do unspeakable things and any sane person would want to prevent that from happening if they were in that situation.\n\nTo me, it all went downhill after 4th episode. And the last two episodes hit such a rock bottom that I'd never ever ever seen on any show. I didn't even  know it was possible to get that bad. Just absurd honestly. ",

So, everything was going \u2018well\u2019 up until Yola visits Lupita in jail and gives her poisoned candy. Alright that, even though, in my opinion, that is also not as logical (even though I get the reference to Moncho\u2019s death and that it was supposed to be ironic) as Yola\u2019s, even if lied, words that she would much rather Lupita rot in prison for all those years. Wouldn\u2019t that give Yola more satisfaction rather than an easy way out for Lupita? It just genuinely didn\u2019t make sense to me, even though I get what the show was trying to do, again, with the irony of Lupita ending up the same way as her victim but at the hands of the victim\u2019s wife\u2019s hands, I get it. But at the same time I don\u2019t find it the logical outcome for the show. \n\nNext, and this is honestly my main point about this, why the hell would Lupita, who poisoned multiple people herself in such a way, eat this candy given to her by someone who has exceptional hatred against her no less? It leads me to believe that she knew the candy would be poisoned and just wanted to use it to commit suicide. I can not explain it in any other way. There is no way she ate that candy, really believing Yola\u2019s words that the candy isn\u2019t poisoned. If that IS what happened then that does not make any damn sense and is downright stupid. \n\nWhat did you guys think of this part? ",

I couldn't bring myself to watch it after the second episode. However, I had to endure the amount of cringe and revolting disgust I felt when watching the show just because I wanted to know who Stella Cho actually was. The whole season is just such a mess. The more I watched it, the more I hated Kitty. I feel like the writing and character development could have been done better. I feel like Kitty only reaches out to people whenever she faces a problem and, the fact she has FOUR people in love with her. Which is kind of insane, honestly. Honestly, out of all these characters, I only liked Stella but, they ruined her character at the end and what do you mean she forgave Min ho's dad after he just said, \"I am sorry for being cruel\", like, you just said a sentence, and she just accepted it!? When you consider Stella was bullied a lot online (She was a YOUNG KID back then. It must have hurt a lot), this kind of simple apology just wouldn't do...... I feel like Stella's goal was better than Kitty's at this point. They keep dragging out the \"I am searching for my mom and I am also gonna keep ending up at several love triangles or squares or even hexagons!\" plot too much. Min ho, Yuri, and maybe especially Kitty had really bad character development.... Why would Min ho even date a girl while he was still following around Kitty like a dog? Yuri is a cheater at this point. Cheating on her girlfriend with Kitty. I hope they make up for this mediocre writing at season 3.....",

        "content": "*Peaky Blinders* (2022) Season 6, supposedly final season. Film sequel, *The Immortal Man*,  coming in March 2026.\n\nGods, this is good - the fascist movement, Mosley, etc. in England, the connections with it, gangster and political in the US.\u00a0\n\nRe-watching for the first time since it came out, season 6 of *Peaky Blinders* (2022). I'm being deeply impressed with it, I think, more so, than first time around. In other words, this series is aging very well, becoming every more relevant to our own time than even when it released initially. Which is both good, for viewing, and bad, for we *living* in this time.\n\nDiana Mitford is a prominent character due to her intimate relationship with Mosley, the proud Brit fascist/racist would-be prime minister, and her fan girl relationship with Hitler. Watching this in the same year UKTV-Britbox put out another period drama series on the Mitford sisters (*Outrageous,* adapted from a book by Mary Lovell), is disturbing in exactly the way the history of that bundle of sisters always is. How could a family produce both a fascist racist like Diana and a progressive like Jessica?\n\nI am guessing many of those who found season 6 an inferior season, \"not like what it used to be\", is because the season dramatized so specifically how capitalism, class, crime and politics are history's quartet, connected in time's womb. Along with Mosley, a Boston Irish crime boss, Jack Nelson, is Tommy Shelby's antagonist. Nelson is another fascist opportunist-sympathizer, playing both sides against his middle, wired into D.C. political hierarchy at the highest levels, including having easy access to the POTUS. He's a fictional Joe Kennedy.\n\nWhat I like best about this period drama, and so far, particularly, this season, is the range of strong female characters -- and there are many! Again, it seems many viewers couldn't move on without Polly. They loved her strong character -- it had been there from the beginning. These newer women having so much influence on the Shelby family's growth moving into WWII era, seemed not to be to the liking of many viewers either.\n\nIt's so interesting too, seeing other characters hewing in their individual cases back to their cultural roots in many ways, as the world they'd been navigating successfully as crime bosses is changing again, and they look in their own ways to survival and success in their future, particularly Tommy with his Romany imagination, and Alfie Solomons. Sure and they'd be in alliance now and again, both always forever outsiders to Britain's ruling class, no matter how useful, how necessary, they are to it..",

        "content": "\n\u26a0\ufe0f I\u2019m no director, so I don\u2019t know exactly how these changes would affect the whole story. But these are fixes I think would work without messing up the big plot.\n\n\n1. Holly &amp; Max Plot  \n\nIssue: This plot wasn\u2019t super interesting. It took too much time that could have gone to the main group we\u2019ve followed for 7 years. It also pulled us away from other characters.  \n\nChanges: Skip Holly\u2019s full perspective and making her a main character. Instead, learn that Vecna takes 12 random kids through quick clips and stories that we see and that Max says to the group. Show short clips of all 12 kids, not a full Holly storyline.  \nFor Max: After she wakes from her coma (with a proper reunion), she tells it all. Use simple flashbacks: the portal to Hawkins opening, entering the cave, seeing the memory world for real.\n  \nWhy it works: Solves the boring Holly/Max story, gives main group more time for their plan (key in a finale), and we still get what\u2019s happening with the 12 kids.\n\n\n2. Lumax Hospital Scene  \n\nIssue: This scene felt poorly done with obvious plot armor. Lucas kicking a Demodog at full speed without getting bitten or falling? Too unreal. We also need a death in Vol 2.  \nChanges: \n\nInstead of Lucas kicking the demo, Vickie or a random makes a loud distracting noise either by accident or purpose. Demodogs turn, attack, and kill her right before the elevator doors close. Lucas sees it and screams \u201cNO!\u201d in horror. Then the scene continues like in the show.  \n(We know Demodogs chase loud noises, like when Mrs. Wheeler turned on the washing machine.)  \n\nWhy it works: More realistic, less plot armor with a tiny change. Vol 2 needed a death, and Vickie fits\u2014she\u2019s not a main character and adds nothing big later in the story. \n\n\n3. Upside Down\u2019s Look  \n\nIssue: Upside Down changed a lot from S4. It should feel scarier and more mysterious, like before. \nChanges: \n\nMore darkness, fog, and rotten vibes\u2014like real Upside Down from past seasons. More monsters is optional (there\u2019s an explanation why they\u2019re gone), but the look should match S1-4. Characters should show more fear going in.  \n\nWhy it works: A consistent, creepy Upside Down with darkness, fog, and rot feels right. It keeps the scary nostalgia and makes more fans (including me) happy.",
