I have thoughts of who it could have been instead or the kind of motive I'd have preferred, but I won't share that either.\n\nMy only criticism is that the episodes should have been shorter. There were scenes that were longwinded and convoluted due to the length. It could have been 10-12 quick episodes instead of 8 super long ones. A minor nitpick I had is that the piano music they played sometimes was too similar to Only Murders in the Building. The piano music made sense because the characters in OMITB lived in an apartment where they used the elevator. \n\nOn a positive note, I thought the performances were all phenomenal. I absolutely loved Cordelia Cupp as a detective. I do wish the show had been set up for future seasons. She was very compelling as a lead. \n\n**What other murder mystery shows/movies have you seen?** \n\n I've Watched:\n\n* Psych\n* Monk\n* CLUE\n* How To Get Away With Murder\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* Murder Mystery &amp; Murder Mystery 2\n* Knives Out\n* Murder on the Orient Express\n* Sherlock Holmes (the movies and the show) ",

        "content": "I\u2019m a father of almost 15 and 10-year-old boys living in the UK. I watched the show in one go yesterday and can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It\u2019s hard to describe this mix of moments from the show, memories from my childhood, memories of my kids, and the ambient worry I have in my head now. My wife doesn\u2019t watch intense shows, but I feel that we need to experience it together and speak about it. I was wondering if we could watch it with our older kid as well. I\u2019ve discussed the premise with him, and he seems interested (hard not to). \n\nI feel that watching/reading things together could be a great conversation starter for some topics. Kids and I still read books together before bed, and we had some great chats while reading \u2019The Body\u2019 and \u2018Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\u2019; and we\u2019re currently watching \u2018Atypical\u2019 together, which they really like and very keen to share their thoughts on.\n\nI\u2019m sure his perspective on Adolescence will be completely different from mine (as mine will be different from my wife\u2019s) and I\u2019m both interested and scared. The show doesn\u2019t give you any answers; it seems that everyone sees different things in it and relates to the characters in a different way. What will a teenage boy see in the story, what will their reaction be like, and what conclusions will he get to? How will he talk about it with his friends? Is it too intense?\n\nI know it very much depends on a kid and their sensitivity but what are your thoughts? Has anyone watched the show with their teenage kids?",

That\u2019s a whole other convo and one I\u2019ve had with a few people over the last few days but something that seems to have been overlooked a lot..\n\nIn the first episode when Jamie is being questioned by the cops, they show screenshots of the Instagram profile with the model and in the cop\u2019s own words, Jamie had left \u201caggressive\u201d comments on her photos. He\u2019d also reposted her photos on to his own insta account, meaning his classmates would\u2019ve seen it. \n\ntake away all the other factors (Katie having her n*des shared, Jamie\u2019s blatant terrible  attitudes towards women, him trying to \u2018get\u2019 Katie at her weakest) wouldn\u2019t just her seeing his aggressive comments be \u201cjustification\u201d enough for leaving the emojis on his photos? \n\nWould it be a mature way to handle the situation? No. But she\u2019s 13. And comments/ messaging on social media is their language. But I can\u2019t help but think if a kid had made openly racist or homophobic comments on someone\u2019s photos which was seen my a classmate, then said classmate posted some emojis reflecting this\u2026.

Not all of them satisfy my cravings for popcorn television.  \n\nBut 4 episodes into Until You Burn, I am sucked in.  \n\nThe story here is a typical brother is seeking to avenge the death of his brother. It looks like he was murdered by someone a wealthy family or connected to them.  \n\nA few things of note in this telenovela compared to others I have scanned or skipped:\n- class theme are pretty typical, but this one is also layering in race on top of the class\n- since there is a race theme here, there are visible Black people and even supporting characters that get screen time and dialogue \n- I don\u2019t speak Spanish so I am watching with English subtitles. I know some words here and there but so some translations look a little funny\n- this show is set in the beach, at sea - really pretty visuals \n- the sounds track is great and seems to be covering a good selection of Colombian music \n- this doesn\u2019t seem to have any cartel angles which is such a common stereotype of Colombian shows, this seems to be a more basic poor guy gets revenge on rich people story - not unlike the show Revenge which I also really enjoyed. \n\nIf you like revenge dramas where the character is playing the long game to infiltrate, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this one, based on the first few episodes. \n\nIt also seemed to be super popular in Colombia - getting like 35-40% prime time viewers so that bodes well for an engaging 60 episodes. And it just finished its run in February so it made it to Netflix quick. ",

        "content": "My jaw dropped with every Episode.\n\nI would have rather they did this in their native tongue instead of English. \n\nIndrani -the murderer, is literally the director of EPS 3 and 4 \n\nI just can't believe people like Indrani exist in RL. I knew things were fishy when the guy in white originally found the body, but the police never made an official report. Ganesh the guy who reported the body the first time\\] must have been so freaked out when the police came a second time. I think the old police chief Dattatraya and the following one, Rakesh were paid off by Peter. \n\nShe never loved Sheena. Or Mikhail. They were thorns in her side. In the 15 years that she abandoned them, she never sent any of them gifts of presents. NEVER sent them letters to show that she was thinking of them. And I guess when she was like 18 and away. I get that she was happy to be away from her abusive dad and just wanted to be a Teenager, I get that, \n\nShe is a victim. \n\nBut as she got older and met Sanjeev she completely completely abandoned both of those kids and forgot that they ever existed. Her parents were on the brink of poverty. And forced her to take responsibility. She must have been horrified when they took the plane over. \n\nI do notice that Indarani was completely happy to dump her first two  kids, but was adamant she was taking Vidhie. Because she was the only child that she actually loved. \n\nImagine, faking your own son's drug habit and putting him in a mental institution????????\n\nThey had so much dirt on her and Indarni knew that they would have a hold on her and her purse strings forever. I definately think that she killed Sheena. It's like she never wanted the older ones to exist, and I believe Mikhail when he accuses her of trying to kill him too. \n\nIndrani is a TERRIBLE liar. Clearly it's Peter's money that has kept her out of prison.\n\nPeter is also a piece of shit, Bc you are lying to your son on behalf of your wife, and covering up the murder of your son's fiance and lying to him on the phone? It's all sooooo sick!\n\nSo Rahul and Sheena were step-siblings by marriage?\n\nEven after she killed Sheena Indrani is still so angry at her. Taking over her emails and phone. Indrani as sheena sends a rude email to Vidhie, and ends it with Rahul. \n\nI wonder did Rahul and Peter refuse an interview, and what is their relationship like now? When Rahul and Sheena started dating, I think that was the beginning of the end for poor Sheena. \n\nHow can Vidhie say that she was never really part of Peter's family when Peter raised you as his own. Not to mention, you bad mouthed your mother to keep Peter's family cheques coming in. I just get user vibes from Vidhie and Indrani.\n\nIts just funny that as soon as Indrani got the bulk of Peters money in the divorce. Suddenly, Vidhie's a mommy girl now?\n\nIt's just very weird Sheena goes missing and Mikhail \\[her sibling\\] and Vidhie who treated Sheena like a sister didn't look for her? Why not? Vidhie makes them sound so close. Sheena goes missing and there are no questions?  \n\nReally?\n\nJust because Mikhail could be a \"bum\" or lazy. It still doesn't change the fact that you killed sheena, Indrani. Constantly trying to make your oldest children as villians is NEVER going to make you look good. \n\nThe show does a **terrible** job concerning the verdict, you're just kind of left hanging as to what the judge decided and if the bail was temporary or what?\n\nHow does her lawyer Rajeesh, sleep at night after her defended her in court. \n\nAs Indrani talks about Sheena she can't even force ONE tear or pretend to be upset. \n\nThis show just made Indrani looked psychopathic. \n\n  \nIt's a shame that no-one else wanted to come on, bc I really wanted to hear Peter Sanjeev and Rahul's side of the story. But I understand why. \n\n",

        "content": "From the desensitised nature of the children in the school only asking for videos of the murder to the cheering and filming in the school fight as well has his friend casually lending him a knife to \"scare\" Katie. The pupils not listening to teachers who are emotionally and physically absent towards all of the children plus the children's refusals to take part/ care about the lessons or authority at all. This is even shown after Jamies  dad confronts the teens who vandalised his car laughing at his genuine struggle and emotion. Jamies behaviour towards women such as the psychologist and his mum and his immediate switches in attitude towards any male figures. The obsessive lying such as about pickles, marshmallows and his small ways of putting the psychologist down like calling her old or being rude about her sandwich as well as his mum where he says shes good at nothing but cooking roast. the obsession with media shown through his isolation into his bedroom after receiving a gaming set up. its not explicitly said he was watch the red pill andrew tate type media however its inferred. the detective who cannot connect with his son in the slightest due to his isolation and even the detective (I believe) viewing him as less than (due to his former popularity and the son not being popular). the way real society has received this media as well many people denying Jamie did it after CCTV showed explicitly what happened or justifying it due to Katies \"bullying\" which was just calling Jamie out on his genuine misogynistic views towards katie and girls in general. Believing he's better than other men as he didn't SA katie even thought he \"had the chance\" and after his guilt was discovered he less regularly said \"i didn't do it\" but switches to \"i didn't do anything wrong\" showing his rationalisation of his actions due to his veiws on women. This show is amazing i've never seen anything so real and so accurate of our society ever. I could write an essay about this show and these are just SOME of the tiny details in the show that i missed at first but its crazly well written and has a scarily accurate depiction of the disheartening youth culture currently so well. \n",

        "content": "Hello all,\n\nMy wife and I are part of the Preview Club and have been for over a year. We were finally accepted to the focus group for a recent film. I was excited because I wanted to be part of focus groups for every film and show we\u2019ve watched. This is where I ran into problems.\n\nThe account is under my wife\u2019s name and email and when I joined the Zoom I was told I couldn\u2019t participate because I wasn\u2019t my wife. I\u2019ve since changed the email on the account to mine but I\u2019m unable to change the main user from her. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this and have any solutions? I\u2019m also curious whether I\u2019ve screwed myself out of the Preview club by changing my information.\n\nThanks for any response.",

Or, if I buy an extra member slot, will it let us use all three profiles?",
