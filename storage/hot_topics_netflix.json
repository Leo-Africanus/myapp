This is about Owen, Khloe, his mother, Kendra\u2019s husband and Lauryn. This should have been about the victims. They should have highlighted everything Kendra took from Shawn (Kendra\u2019s husband.) Kendra is literally a family annihilator without the redrum. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t Netflix put more emphasis on the sexual messages to minors??? Why did Netflix make a mockery of this situation??? Why didn\u2019t they center the other parents? Why platform a literal abuser??\n\n\nY\u2019all might drag me for this but I feel like Lauryn\u2019s reactions are odd. Like I didn\u2019t see any shock or surprise or even anger. I\u2019m extremely surprised that the fact that Lauryn stayed in constant contact with her mother. It almost seems\u2026 dismissive of the whole ordeal. \n\nShawn and Lauryn lost EVERYTHING and Kendra is making it seem cool. I\u2019m just appalled. ",

People try to logically rationalize their actions as if it makes them understandable. Girl, Hitler had his reasons too, and was very convincing in his rationale, he still was a monster. That woman gives me chills. I have strong reasons to believe her daughter will cut her off way later in life, when she is going to become more aware. At the moment, she\u2019s too young to fully process it and have perspective. She\u2019s in a bubble. She clearly doesnt seem to fully understand.",

        "content": "I was really enjoying the movie and the comedy until the end. It was so bad, I kept expecting a last minute reveal but there was none. So this whole time you have Elizabeth, this former MI6 agent investigating four murders, and then she finally cracks them, and despite their morally ambiguous nature she takes them to the police anyway. Like Penny killed a man for a woman who would never get justice in the courts. Totally valid in my opinion! There was no justice for women in that day. And then you have Penny\u2019s husband killing a piece of trash businessman to protect his wife. Again, I personally wouldn\u2019t complain. But instead of understanding and saying \u201chm maybe we should not pursue this mystery\u201d she confronts the husband which leads him to killing himself and his wife. And of course this is expected, because jail at that age?? Meanwhile, she lets a crime boss who cut off people\u2019s fingers, steals people\u2019s passports, and is essentially facilitating modern slavery live his life as a floralist because she wants the retirement home to stay open. Talk about double standards?! She has a moral superiority complex for sure. And the Polish guy, Bogdan, was literally just trying to escape what was essentially slavery to see his dying mother, and yet his story is ended when he\u2019s arrested as well. It left such a sour taste in my mouth. These people, who had good reasons to do what they did, got arrested and a crime lord didn\u2019t? And that\u2019s just the end of the movie and Elizabeth gets to dance and pretend like she didn\u2019t ruin three peoples lives? Like WTF??\n\nAlso what is it with everyone confessing to their crimes?? There was no evidence to prove Penny and her husband did anything, but he just admits to it with the slightest pressure. He would\u2019ve been fine otherwise. And Bogdan telling Elizabeth\u2019s husband even though he also had no evidence? Come on, lazy way to conclude the story.\n\nAnyway, TLDR it had so much potential but the ending ruined it",

        "content": "Reading the comments here, most people agree Kendra is a psychopath and pedophile, which: yes absolutely. And I agree she needs to be locked away for a much longer time (and studied).  But there are some other takes I had that I don\u2019t see reflected. What do you think, and what unpopular opinions do you have? Please share:\n\n1. Yes, obviously Kendra was fixated on Owen, even when he was still a little prepubescent boy (sick). And she was jealous of Lauryn for being with him. That\u2019s all the comments I\u2019ve read. But I believe it went much deeper than that. She was also deeply jealous that her daughter was growing into a pretty teenager who had her whole life ahead of her and hadn\u2019t fucked up her marriage, finances and life like Kendra had. Owen was the target of her fixation but It wasn\u2019t only about Owen. There\u2019s a lot more going on. \n\n2. I\u2019m sorry but Owen\u2019s parents/mother are not the heroes people are making them out to be. Why in the free world would they not take the kid\u2019s phone away? He was being harassed into a place of suicidal ideation. They are terrible parents for letting him just deal with it while the mom pranced around pretending she was a star on Law &amp;\nOrder \n\n3. Lauryn\u2019s dad was an incompetent father. I believe Kendra is a master manipulator but what the hell must he have been doing to not see signs that something was terribly wrong? I think he was having affairs/a double life or at the very least was willfully burying his head in the sand. What do you mean you trusted your wife to handle your daughter\u2019s severe sexual harassment and abuse? You didn\u2019t think you should help? You didn\u2019t think the situation warranted all hands on deck? Where the hell were you the whole time? And all he could say about Lauryn now is that she\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d and will be a \u201cbeautiful woman.\u201d  Something is also off with him. \n\n4. Regarding Lauryn's non-emotional reaction to what her mom did to her: Lauryn never had close friends and was always quiet and withdrawn, per all her peers. Owen said she was trying to isolate him from his friends so it was just \u201cthe two of us\u201d. As far as we saw, Kendra was her primary parent, with barely any paternal involvement. Kendra\u2019s sociopathic ways are normal to Lauryn because it\u2019s all she knows. (I hope she gets a lifetime of therapy.) During the confession conversation, either she was in shock and, as any\n15 year old child would be, confused and unable to process the emotions on the spot (and also focused on following an authority figure\u2019s directions to call her dad) \u2026or she knew or suspected her mom was behind this.",

The mother obviously got caught - hence why the daughter is so forgiving and willing to reconcile. This also explains her lack of reaction when the police tell her this information. The mother was less concerned about her daughter finding out in that moment then the others at the school\u2026\n\nIf this was directed a bit better and answered the important questions - and also maybe emphasized that this woman, if she did act alone - correctly portrayed that she was a predator, obsessed with her daughters boyfriend and jealous of her own daughter\u2026 then I think this whole documentary would have made more sense.\n\nThis leaves a lot more questions than answers, and unfortunately, might leave some (like me) with the potentially wrong impression that the daughter and mother were both in on this.

Boy were we wrong!  Maggie Kang might be Canadian but she has definitely held on to her Korean heritage when writing this. \n\nThis is about a K-drama as it gets.  The story is right.  The locations really match the types of locations you see in a K-drama.  The music, of course, is what you\u2019d expect of K-pop.  The cast was excellent and I *did* recognize many popular K-drama stars in the credits. \n\nThe got the K-drama tropes down perfectly.  Walking past.  Foodies.  Wrist grabs.  It was all there except of the White Truck of Doom. (IYKYK)  \n\nI have seen some complaints about the ending but I\u2019ve got to tell you, it was about a Korean as it gets.  In these supernatural stories where the being falls in love with a mortal, &gt;!that being *always* ends up sacrificing itself for their One True Love.  Time passes, and then there is a happy reunion. !&lt;  Well, usually.  If there is a second movie, this is what I would expect to happen.  However, I would only expect it to be &gt;!Ji-Un, not the rest of the band.!&lt;  \n\nThe biggest problem I\u2019ve had with the movie is when people ask for recommendations on live action K-dramas.  My first thoughts would be something like *My Demon* or *Vincenzo*.  The problem is those aren\u2019t shows you\u2019d recommend to someone you don\u2019t know and may be a 13 year old girl.  \n\nAny thoughts from other K-drama fans?",

        "content": "**Why did Kendra go after Owen's** ***new*** **girlfriend, a full year after he and Lauryn broke up?**\n\nThat isolated single detail proves this had absolutely nothing to do with protecting her daughter and everything to do with her own predatory obsession with Owen. Owen's mom tried to point it out, but they barely gave her a voice.\n\nIt feels like the real story was \"Predatory Mom Coach\" but decided \"Highschool Catfish Story\" was way more marketable. It's like they are deliberately downplaying the darkest part of this story and perpetuating Kendra's misdirection/manipulation.",

I don\u2019t know how much Michigan pays, as a tech worker in Zone B, I know Zone D is significantly less, however it\u2019s not $10k a year. We\u2019re talking 6 figures for tech professionals. And she was doing two jobs? Her husband did not notice this woman was not contributing ANY money? And he looked blue collar. Their last house looked like a trailer home. How do you not know your wife doesn\u2019t have one job, much less 2? Who was filling out these rental applications?\n\nThis whole story was weird. But that one part I major side eyed because it made no sense. You can\u2019t really hide whole ass salaries like that. ",

Rant incoming\u2026\n\n\nIt really bothers me that her daughter Lauryn still had a relationship with her &amp; even a close one. \n\nShe didn\u2019t just cyber bully her, she said disgusting things. She literally told her to OFF HERSELF. She broke up her daughter\u2019s first relationship, she listened to her daughter cry, beg for it to stop, &amp; still did it. That\u2019s sick, that\u2019s not \u201cthat wasn\u2019t me\u201d \u201ci dont know what i was doing\u201d. She harassed her for almost TWO YEARS. You being assaulted does not excuse you to harass your daughter, it doesn\u2019t even correlate. &amp; then to do it for almost 2 years. \n\nNot to mention her obsession with Owen, that\u2019s disgusting &amp; predatory. She could have just called her daughter ugly, annoying blah blah but she said vulgar things about him. THATS WEIRD. I know this whole thing is weird but it\u2019s even weirder that she was obsessed with him. \n\nI personally would never talk to my mother again. &amp; my mom is by best friend. You told me to off myself everyday multiple times a day. Then said \u201cwell I knew she wouldn\u2019t do it\u201d, I could never trust her again. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

Oh well. \n\nWhile I was too young to remember a lot of the back story, I never saw Jerry as corrupting society. And screw Oprah. I can\u2019t stand Oprah. Couldn\u2019t even as a child. And especially now with her blinds. Jerry himself seemed like a good guy (Oprah never did to me. Always got sinister vibes). The guests really were the weirdos. Who goes on tv and shows this stuff off? So it\u2019s kind of sad to see so many people s\u2014t all over it now. I don\u2019t think Jerry is the reason that guy killed his wife. I think it\u2019s wrong to try to paint that on them. \n\nBut the horse guy? And the dad sleeping with his hooker daughter? I hope the cops took care of them. If anything it sounds like Jerry helped some of these scum get caught. Does anyone know if law enforcement ever did anything? ",
