The animation is top-tier, the writing respects the original lore, and the pacing actually works. Even Arcane (though not technically a Netflix production) followed a similar winning formula.\n\nWhat do you think is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d? Is it the teams they hire? The animation style? The freedom they give the writers?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve watched Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, Tomb Raider, or Captain Laserhawk too. Are we witnessing a new golden age of game adaptations?",

        "content": "This is literally the best exmaple I\u2019ve seen so far of a show that should\u2019ve have been so much longer yet was obviously done in a way to make it short and full of action within just 8 episodes. This show should\u2019ve been 20 episodes. Instead the creators decided to do what Netflix has now done multiple times and condense it into one of those shows where it\u2019s just nonstop action and plot twist and turn with conflict and resolution happening way to fast. It\u2019s a great show, but way too fast passed. Which is what ruins it. The characters don\u2019t have enough time to develop and that makes the show feel shallow and not as intense or meaningful because u lack connection with the charictors. An example of this is how quickly cane\u2019s character is brought in and how quickly it goes south with him, it\u2019s supposed to be a sort of plot twist, but it doesn\u2019t even feel like one becuase there\u2019s not enough time to even developed a proper plot. Another exmaple is how quickly the early plot twist with sherif is done and how quickly the sherif goes from partner to being killed. It\u2019s just all far too rushed and should\u2019ve been carried out through multiple episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this exact issue of rushed shows so much recently on Netflix, they had great potential but just were executed in this poor fashion which ruins the whole thing.

Was taken directly from the Roku home page to an ad and then the show started playing.\n  \nIt was very confusing at first, but its not uncommon for animes to start in weird spots with a lot going on to drag you in and catch you up.\n  \nAbout 12 minutes in, it dawned on us. We were watching the last episode. Everything about the episode culminated in \"this is the closing of a story\".\n  \nI backed out to see that it had taken us DIRECTLY to the last episode and auto-played it. None of the previous episodes have any play time on them.\n  \nThe show was instantly spoiled for us.\n  \nThis $500 TV is less than 6 months old. The bug is reproducible and there are many forum posts on Netflix and Roku community forums from the last 2-3 weeks complaining about this. Where both Netflix and Roku are passing the blame to each other.\n  \nIt's our fault honestly for trusting technology to do something correctly, with how bloated and garbage smart TVs, streaming services, and technology in general, are these days.\n  \n**TL;DR:** Be aware that there is a reproducible bug when selecting a search result in Roku that is on Netflix where it will automatically play the LAST episode of a TV series. Whether this is a Roku bug or Netflix app on Roku bug is unclear, as they keep passing the blame.",

It\u2019s not clear to me how to best manage Netflix access during this time. \n\nI just got an alert on my iPad that my device isn\u2019t part of the Netflix account for my household, with the option to get a two-week travel/temporary code.  What other options do I have to access Netflix while traveling? Should I create a whole new account and cancel the existing one to initiate a new household? I also have a laptop that I\u2019ll sometimes access Netflix from. I am also moving locations every 2-6 weeks. Does each new location require establishing a new Netflix account?\n\nFor context, I am the account holder. I have tenants at my home with access to my Netflix account, but if I have to boot them out that\u2019s fine.",
