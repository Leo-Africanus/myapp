        "title": "Catch Me If You Can, would a Frank Abagnale style con work today or would tech stop it?",
        "content": "Just finished rewatching Catch Me If You Can and I keep getting stuck on how much of Abagnale\u2019s success relied on people trusting a confident story and paper records. He forges checks, pretends to be pilots and doctors, and basically wins on smooth talk, timing, and exploiting gaps in how institutions verified things back then. Looking at 2025, there are two clear directions. Modern banks, airlines, and employers have more automation, KYC checks, instant database lookups, and cross-referenced ID services that can flag fakes in seconds. A fake resume or a paper letter seems much harder to use to fool those systems. Digital trails and audit logs make it easier to trace and stop suspicious activity.  \n  \nBut there\u2019s also a huge amount of real personal data out there from breaches and data brokers, and that can be stitched together to build very believable identities. Deepfakes and AI can clone voices or make convincing video snippets. Human trust is still a major vulnerability: social engineering works because people rush, want to help, or assume an authority figure is legitimate. A modern operator could combine old-school charm with new tech  build an online persona first, then use carefully timed phone or in-person moves to close the deal. Some targets would be harder today and others are still shockingly soft. Big finance, enterprise HR, and major airlines are much tighter. Small hospitals, local businesses, and customer-support teams at smaller services often rely on phone calls and quick checks, which feels like low-hanging fruit. Logistics and delivery systems can also be manipulated if you know the right touchpoints.  \n  \nMy mental image of a 2025 Abagnale is someone who layers things: scraped data to bootstrap a backstory, polished social media and LinkedIn history, AI-generated voice clips for cold calls, and then a confident in-person moment where people fill in the blanks. Or it could be less theatrical and more distributed: exploit gaps in onboarding flows, trick CS systems, and collect many small wins across dozens of targets instead of one big caper.  \nWould a charismatic impersonator still pull it off today, or has tech made that kind of con obsolete? If someone tried something like this now, where would you expect them to succeed first and where would modern verification stop them quickly? Any examples of modern scams that felt like a Catch Me If You Can remake but for the internet age?",

        "content": "When Dahmer first came out I remember thinking wow this is probably one of the best limited series I\u2019ve watched (coming from someone who never knew who he was) and was not shocked when it won so many awards. Then by the end of the series with them teasing John Wayne gacy I was thrilled to see that this trilogy wasn\u2019t over and that another serial killer who this time I knew would be the next story they focus on. When the news was confirmed that the next season would be about the Menendez brothers who this time I knew a lot about I was kind of disappointed not because of them personally but because I think the Segway from Dahmer to JWG especially since they were active during the same time would have made an awesome season 2.  Why didn\u2019t Netflix decide to go ahead with JWG is beyond me. Now with season 3 being Ed gein, who mind you barely has any video or audio recording to base the series off with most of it being inaccurate and dramatised, has Netflix missed the potential to make a record breaking trilogy series beyond Dahmer? Especially considering already the ratings for Ed gein aren\u2019t merely as high as the Menendez brothers yet alone Dahmer. \n\nNow again, with the teasers for season 4 being Lizzie Borden? I mean seriously, Ed Geins evidence to base season 3 off was dry to nothing and now they want to focus on someone way before Ed geins time? I don\u2019t think the ratings will be going up anytime soon if they don\u2019t plan to start focusing on newer stories with some evidential backup. \n\n(Also when I say seasons I knew they\u2019re separate shows it\u2019s just to help the timeline ) \n",

But during this break, something just hit me and has left me confused: \n\nWith the Dahmer series, it explored his childhood a bit, and tried to atleast give some form of explanation, rightly or wrongly, as to how it started with him\u2026 the road kill with his Dad, leading up to exploring in the army etc. With the Ed Gein story there is non of that, so im left thinking how does he go from being slightly awkward and a unusual guy, to wearing head masks out of someones real flesh, making things out of their skin\u2026 you know? What was the trigger? How did it start? Was it just that German magazine he was shown? It doesnt feel like enough, was there something in his childhood and growing up? \n\nOf course i dont think the story was designed to tackle this issue in the way its been produced, but i wish they had\u2026 knowing \u201cwhy\u201d is a big part of it\u2026 but i dont know, what does everyone else think?

Maybe flashbacks from her childhood or even simply more insight on her mental disorders not just \u201cthe doctors having a look\u201d *never speaks about it again*\n\nAnd Samuel could have easily been turned into an anti-hero or even one of the main antagonists because he was left on the side to deal with his debt and drinking issues with zero of his families fortune. \n\nPS: *These are all the negatives I really did enjoy the show but the take away is sometimes less is more and more is less. This is the issue with 8 episode seasons.*",

        "content": "idk man. everyone online seems to be hating this movie but i actually think it\u2019s both really good and really bad at the same time. like, i get why people are grossed out or mad about it - i was literally gagging at parts, it\u2019s one of the most disgusting movies i\u2019ve ever sat through - but i also think that\u2019s kind of the point.\n\nit\u2019s weirdly nuanced in the way it shows how media shapes us. like the comics and nazi photos sending him over the edge, adeline\u2019s obsession with horror photography, the way psycho literally captivated the masses and started a whole new wave of fascination. it\u2019s showing how we\u2019ve always wanted more. more horror, more depravity, more blood, more \u201crealism.\u201d and we got exactly what we asked for.\n\nand yeah i could barely stomach it. i\u2019m literally struggling to eat after watching it because it\u2019s so repulsive. but it\u2019s also kind of brilliant in how it shows where all this came from. like, after ww2, we saw the actual horror humans are capable of - concentration camp photos, mass graves, the stuff that made us realize hell isn\u2019t some mythical place, it\u2019s what people can do. and instead of turning away, we became fascinated. and as humans do,,,, we fetished it   that\u2019s where horror really started to mutate. from psycho to texas chainsaw massacre to scream, horror slowly turned into soft porn with a knife. and now ed gein being portrayed as next captain america with his six pack and buff arms\u2026.. fucking a corpse\u2026. \n\nand the thing is, horror has always mirrored culture. vietnam war, sexual liberation, the rise of porn \u2014- all of that bled into and made the \u201csex horror\u201d genre. and this movie captures that. but what bugs me is that it doesn\u2019t seem to realise it\u2019s also part of that same cycle. that ed gein saw this horrors in the media - and copied it. it\u2019s talking about how media inspires horror, but it\u2019s also gonna inspire some creepy fuck to copy it. like this narrative that is portrayed as \u201cthe truth\u201d will inevitably inspire minimum one person to make a nipple chair. the same way school shooters copy each other. that\u2019s just reality.\n\nso yeah, i think the movie gets it but also doesn\u2019t. it\u2019s an amazing critique of how media feeds on violence and trauma, and how violence feeds on the media in one big bisous cycle of sick fucks. but it\u2019s also feeding the same beast. \n\nthe brutality and gruesomeness is definitely reflection of where we are now - gaza, ukraine, congo etc.  horror is everywhere. right at our fingertips tips. every day i see another hospital getting bombed in a gaza on my literal tik tok fyp and i just go about my day. it\u2019s everywhere. and we are so desensitised. and because of that, there\u2019ll always be another movie, another killer, another atrocity.\n\nit\u2019s messed up. i hated watching it. but i also think it says something really real about us.",

        "content": "At first I thought it was going to be good. Especially the first 2 chapters, I liked them a lot, but throughout the series my desire to watch it disappears. It all consists of telling stories about psychosis actors, the Texas massacre, film producers who were inspired by him, and above all, romances they have had and experiences that are not real or are still theories.\nI thought I was going to see how Ed Gein acted, the things he did, what he did with corpses, everything. But instead I find that shit. \nI had a lot of hype for this season, I thought it would be good and above all that it would be the creepiest of all. But it feels pretty bad. It's morbid of me to want to see more of what the crimes were like and how he really acted, but damn, that's better than wanting to see stories that never happened about his life.",
