I don\u2019t like the way the whole narco culture is romanticized, which is why I don\u2019t watch any narco shows but the way the ozarks was produced was so good and so engaging. It really kept you on the edge of your seat with so many elements from the chosen colors to the dialogue. The AO was engaging to me because you had to really pay attention to the story line to understand what was happening and how everyone was connected. Same with Dark. \n\nI wish they\u2019d come out with a show that had complex interconnected characters, a plot that was ever-evolving but with a clear end goal/ resolution for the characters to achieve and a big conflict to overcome. \n\n",

        "title": "Bullet Train Explosion",
        "content": "Bullet Train Explosion is both a modern remake and a follow-up to the 1975 Japanese film The Bullet Train, which also inspired the Hollywood thriller Speed. The story brings back the high-stakes idea of a vehicle that can\u2019t slow down without risking an explosion. This time, it\u2019s the Hayabusa 60 Shinkansen\u2014a sleek, high-speed train racing toward Tokyo. A ransom must be paid before the train reaches its destination, or the result won\u2019t just be the death of those onboard\u2014it could mean disaster for millions in the city.\n\nWe meet the characters, understand the stakes, and in many ways follow the now-established beats\u2014like the government refusing to negotiate with terrorists and efforts to discreetly evacuate passengers. Much of the first half plays out confidently and effectively. The bullet train setting is a treat on its own (as someone who recently traveled to Japan, seeing those stations in the film gave me mild PTSD). But what sets this version apart is that the bomber reveal happens midway through the film\u2014and they\u2019re onboard. From that point on, the focus shifts to the dynamics inside the train, and that\u2019s where the movie starts to lose steam.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/18/bullet-train-explosion/",

The dad had passed away and was haunting his son and wife but only the son could see him. One scene in particular is the dad ghost crawling up the stairs with the creepiest smile imaginable and the little boy running under his bed where the dad then slithers in and finds him. There was also something with the mom wearing a locket with his picture in it?\n\nI know this is not a lot to go off of but that episode has stayed with me this whole time and literally sent shivers up my spine.

        "title": "Adolescence: sympathy for the predator, silence for the victim",
        "content": "I watched Adolescence yesterday, and honestly, I left feeling frustrated. The narrative was so **one-sided**,it focused entirely on how Jamie and his parents were affected, while completely ignoring the girl\u2019s perspective. I found myself sympathising with Jamie, not because he deserved it, but because the **show gave us nothing else to work with**. We never saw her side of the story. There wasn\u2019t even a single scene\u2014or even a conversation\u2014about how she might have felt when her private photos were leaked. No insight into her trauma. No glimpse into her devastated family. **Just the convenient label of \u201cbully\u201d slapped onto her character**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the problem lies. A lot of people are now **defending Jamie, saying he was justified because she \u201cbullied\u201d him first**. But let\u2019s be real,**she didn\u2019t explicitly bully** him. Jamie was exhibiting clear **predatory behaviour**. He asked her out when he knew she was emotionally vulnerable, trying to take advantage of that moment of weakness. It wasn\u2019t about affection,it was entitlement. He believed she owed him something. That mindset alone is alarming. And when she rejected him, he spiraled. To incite a symbolic pushback against the misogynistic space he was aligning himself with, her only response was a red pill emoji. That was it. And honestly, it was fitting:because Jamie wasn\u2019t just acting like an incel, he admitted to believing in some of the theories spread by incel communities. So no, her response wasn\u2019t bullying:**it was resistance**.\n\nBy that same twisted logic, since Jamie and Katie were the same age, are we supposed to say **Katie should have killed the boy who leaked her pictures?** She didn\u2019t. Despite the emotional hell she went through, she had better emotional control than Jamie. And that\u2019s really the core message this show addressed\u2014how so many young men today lack healthy coping mechanisms. Instead, they turn to toxic online spaces and influencers who feed them **the idea that they\u2019re worthless unless they conform to hyper-masculine, misogynistic standards**.\n\n**Jamie\u2019s misogyny wasn\u2019t something Katie caused**. It was already there, deeply rooted. What struck me the most was how emotionally detached he was from the women in his own life. He barely acknowledged his mother or sister. He only ever spoke about his father, and when he found out his mom and sister were in the car, he acted like they didn\u2019t even deserve to speak to him. In the end, he apologised to his dad,but **never once considered the pain he caused his mom or sister*\".\n\nAnd when the psychiatrist asked if his father had any platonic female friends, Jamie reacted like the concept itself was **ridiculous**. To him, women existed either as trophies or for sex;never as equals or companions. That speaks volumes.\n\nYes, the show tries to challenge the narrative around toxic masculinity and failed coping mechanisms in young men. But it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It had the opportunity to challenge that narrative more deeply -by showing how such behaviour causes trauma not just to the perpetrator and his family, but also to the victim and her family. **The consequences weren\u2019t just limited to Jamie\u2019s household**. A complete story would have acknowledged that the pain spreads far beyond him.",
