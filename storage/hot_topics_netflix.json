I get that from an entertainment standpoint they did this to increase the shock factor when it\u2019s revealed that she was the catfish but I don\u2019t think they did enough to explain other people\u2019s perspectives of her behavior.\n\nOwen says that he felt she gave him extra attention in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. And the examples he gives probably would have been hard for other adults to pick up on as they would likely just seem like Kendra being somewhat maternal towards him.\n\nBut then Khloe\u2019s dad said that he thought early on that it was Kendra and even mentioned it to the sheriff. But then Netflix completely failed to dive into the reasons WHY he would think that. This makes me think that she was probably doing other strange things if other adults suspected her, whether it\u2019s a history of manic behaviors or inappropriate behavior towards minors it would have made sense to touch on that more rather than trying to stick to this story that she was some completely normal mom who just happened to wake up one day and start tormenting and sexually harassing teenagers out of the blue ",

LADY, no one else has stalked minors and adults with sexual content texts for 22 months as an OOPSIE. Did this make anyone else want to scream at the TV!?\n\n\\-She lies that she started doing this to find out who sent the original texts. She started off aggressive with those texts out of the gate and they escalated. Did anyone else believe her?\n\n\\-She was absolutely obsessed with Owen, and I believe she was hoping to push her daughter, Owen, Khloe or someone to snap and do something.\n\n\\-I think she got off way too easy in this documentary. I am sure they had to make some agreement with her so she'd appear, but man I wish they would've pushed back.\n\n\\-Can anyone answer why she didn't get charged with anything as far as the sexual content to minors went? I mean her texts to Owen and Lauryn were beyond disgusting for 14 year olds. Why was it only stalking and nothing in the substance of the texts? Genuinely asking anyone who knows the law why this would be the case.\n\n\\-I can't imagine all these people living in the small town together after this all went down. I genuinely feel awful for this poor girl Lauryn. You can tell the difference in her after she had gotten some space from her mother's grip and had time to process. Those interviews she was different. She also says \"I hope that my mom gets the help she needs so it doesn't go back to the way it was before.\" I don't think she's just referring to the texts. She's probably been awful on other things.  \n  \nThose are my thoughts / questions. No one I know has watched it yet and dying to hear people's thoughts!!\n\n",

        "content": "I was really enjoying the movie and the comedy until the end. It was so bad, I kept expecting a last minute reveal but there was none. So this whole time you have Elizabeth, this former MI6 agent investigating four murders, and then she finally cracks them, and despite their morally ambiguous nature she takes them to the police anyway. Like Penny killed a man for a woman who would never get justice in the courts. Totally valid in my opinion! There was no justice for women in that day. And then you have Penny\u2019s husband killing a piece of trash businessman to protect his wife. Again, I personally wouldn\u2019t complain. But instead of understanding and saying \u201chm maybe we should not pursue this mystery\u201d she confronts the husband which leads him to killing himself and his wife. And of course this is expected, because jail at that age?? Meanwhile, she lets a crime boss who cut off people\u2019s fingers, steals people\u2019s passports, and is essentially facilitating modern slavery live his life as a floralist because she wants the retirement home to stay open. Talk about double standards?! She has a moral superiority complex for sure. And the Polish guy, Bogdan, was literally just trying to escape what was essentially slavery to see his dying mother, and yet his story is ended when he\u2019s arrested as well. It left such a sour taste in my mouth. These people, who had good reasons to do what they did, got arrested and a crime lord didn\u2019t? And that\u2019s just the end of the movie and Elizabeth gets to dance and pretend like she didn\u2019t ruin three peoples lives? Like WTF??\n\nAlso what is it with everyone confessing to their crimes?? There was no evidence to prove Penny and her husband did anything, but he just admits to it with the slightest pressure. He would\u2019ve been fine otherwise. And Bogdan telling Elizabeth\u2019s husband even though he also had no evidence? Come on, lazy way to conclude the story.\n\nAnyway, TLDR it had so much potential but the ending ruined it",

This wasnt a OOPSIE moment. And no Kendra, we have not all broke the law but got away with it, and certainly not to this level. Please, the rationalization of it all. People try to logically rationalize their actions as if it makes them understandable. Girl, Hitler had his reasons too, and was very convincing in his rationale, he still was a monster. That woman gives me chills. I have strong reasons to believe her daughter will cut her off way later in life, when she is going to become more aware. At the moment, she\u2019s too young to fully process it and have perspective. She\u2019s in a bubble. She clearly doesnt seem to fully understand.",

I can\u2019t even believe a mother would do something this drastic to their own child I mean being a teen is already so much &amp; to think that you would do something so drastic . Telling her to off herself like that is crazy &amp; her playing the hero is what she was doing that is a real mental issue. Also this woman is a predator I mean all the messages of her talking about creaming &amp; sexual acts is just disgusting . I believe she was getting off on those messages which is more crazy because at that time that boy was sooo young. I knew from the beginning something was off about her she just looked off. But I was not thinking to this extent. I couldn\u2019t imagine putting my son through something like that. It can really mess with someone\u2019s mental health. What a disgusting human in my opinion she should have been registered as a sx offender I just can\u2019t get past the fact that she said all of those things to her daughters boyfriend \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e",

Nothing special, it's just a 1985 vintage camera. But, this same model was used by Lydia Deetz in Beetlejuice. Fun fact: Lydia's model was named N2000 - under this name this camera was realised in North America. F-301 was sold in Europe. But, in fact, it's this same model.\n\nPhotographer from Wednesday S2 with his Nikon F-301:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h31ve55bkemf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1984ee18d875f8836de241b01d7b48df67f7b32\n\nLydia with her Nikon N2000 in Beetlejuice:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecglq54mjemf1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c5e53ae32d1d705fddc7d37d7ea85f01ca8bf1e\n\n",

        "content": "Reading the comments here, most people agree Kendra is a psychopath and pedophile, which: yes absolutely. And I agree she needs to be locked away for a much longer time (and studied).  But there are some other takes I had that I don\u2019t see reflected. What do you think, and what unpopular opinions do you have? Please share:\n\n1. Yes, obviously Kendra was fixated on Owen, even when he was still a little prepubescent boy (sick). And she was jealous of Lauryn for being with him. That\u2019s all the comments I\u2019ve read. But I believe it went much deeper than that. She was also deeply jealous that her daughter was growing into a pretty teenager who had her whole life ahead of her and hadn\u2019t fucked up her marriage, finances and life like Kendra had. Owen was the target of her fixation but It wasn\u2019t only about Owen. There\u2019s a lot more going on. \n\n2. I\u2019m sorry but Owen\u2019s parents/mother are not the heroes people are making them out to be. Why in the free world would they not take the kid\u2019s phone away? He was being harassed into a place of suicidal ideation. They are terrible parents for letting him just deal with it while the mom pranced around pretending she was a star on Law &amp;\nOrder \n\n3. Lauryn\u2019s dad was an incompetent father. I believe Kendra is a master manipulator but what the hell must he have been doing to not see signs that something was terribly wrong? I think he was having affairs/a double life or at the very least was willfully burying his head in the sand. What do you mean you trusted your wife to handle your daughter\u2019s severe sexual harassment and abuse? You didn\u2019t think you should help? You didn\u2019t think the situation warranted all hands on deck? Where the hell were you the whole time? And all he could say about Lauryn now is that she\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d and will be a \u201cbeautiful woman.\u201d  Something is also off with him. \n\n4. Regarding Lauryn's non-emotional reaction to what her mom did to her: Lauryn never had close friends and was always quiet and withdrawn, per all her peers. Owen said she was trying to isolate him from his friends so it was just \u201cthe two of us\u201d. As far as we saw, Kendra was her primary parent, with barely any paternal involvement. Kendra\u2019s sociopathic ways are normal to Lauryn because it\u2019s all she knows. (I hope she gets a lifetime of therapy.) During the confession conversation, either she was in shock and, as any\n15 year old child would be, confused and unable to process the emotions on the spot (and also focused on following an authority figure\u2019s directions to call her dad) \u2026or she knew or suspected her mom was behind this.",
