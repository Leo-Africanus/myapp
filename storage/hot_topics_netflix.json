I really like shows where teen characters have strong bonds, especially brother\u2013sister dynamics or a sweet, realistic teen love story that develops over time instead of feeling forced or overdramatic.\n\nSchool or family settings are a big plus. I want awkward phases, misunderstandings, growing pains, and those quiet scenes where characters actually talk about what they\u2019re going through. Basically, comedy with a heart \u2014 where you laugh one minute and get emotionally attacked the next.It should be live action not animation.",

Truthfully, if they'd tried to do a modern adaptation of it then ending up with freddie should've felt right\n\nQuite frankly, they should've switched brayden and freddie, give brayden (as freddie's role) more screen time so it adds up to the persuasion plot. If they wanted this show to be a second chances trope it clearly backfired super hard  \nMoreover, i'm pretty sure by the public outrage s2 endgame is most likely going to be braydriana. Riley and Brayden will not work out and neither will freddie and adriana. I hope Adriana and Freddie get the closure they deserve tho\n\nI'm a huge fan of this whole figure skating romance trope. I really liked spinning out and i was super bummed when it was discontinued, i was hoping for this to be bettter\n\nPS- is there anyone who's a fan of adriana and freddie ??? bc as soon as i finished the show and opened insta- all i could see was just insane braydriana love, like yeah their chemistry was off the charts but i couldn't help but feel for the whole freddie and adriana trope too. The moments they had were more emotional and intimate otherwise. ",
