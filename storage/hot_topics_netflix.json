        "content": "The tiger and the magpie were easily my favourite characters in the movie, and if you\u2019re also into art and mythology like I am, here\u2019s a little background on their historical references.\n\nIn traditional Korean art, the white tiger and magpie often appear together in a style called [Jakhodo](https://exhibitions.asianart.org/exhibitions/jakhodo-today/#:~:text=The%20tiger%20and%20magpie%20pairing%20appears%20so%20frequently%20in%20Korean%20art%20that%20it%20comprises%20its%20own%20genre%3A%20jakhodo%2C%20paintings%20depicting%20tigers%20and%20magpies) (*jak* = magpie, *ho* = tiger, *do* = painting). These images were used as talismans to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe tiger was intentionally given those ridiculous, bulging yellow eyes to make it look dumb. That\u2019s why it\u2019s traditionally nicknamed \u201cidiot tiger\u201d (\ubc14\ubcf4\ud638\ub791\uc774), and the paintings are often called *\u201cIdiot Tiger and Scolding Magpie.\u201d* So, in its introduction scene when the magpie looked annoyed and judgmental that was on purpose.\n\nThis art style is part of a genre called [Kkachi Horangi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhwa#:~:text=Kkachi%20horangi%20(%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4)%20is,structure%20of%20Joseon%27s%20feudal%20society), and it\u2019s basically satire. The goofy-looking tiger represents authority (intentionally depicted as silly and clumsy like corrupt officials or clueless aristocrats), and the magpie is the voice of the common people, calling them out.\n\nWhen Jinu mentioned he made the hat for the tiger but the bird kept stealing it, that was a reference to a real J[oseon-era Minhwa painting that shows a tiger smoking a pipe and wearing a top hat](https://korelimited.com/blogs/korelimited/the-korean-tiger-a-hallmark-of-korean-identity#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking%20features%20of%20art%20portraying%20the%20Korean%20tiger%20is%20the%20eyes%3B%20they%20are%20often%20bulging%20and%20painted%20a%20bright%20yellow.%20This%20is%20a%20recurring%20aspect%20of%20most%2C%20if%20not%20all%20art%20with%20the%20tiger%20as%20its%20subject), while a magpie stands nearby.\n\nThe White Tiger (Baekho in Korean) is also one of the Four Holy Beasts in Sino-Korean mythology, symbolising the West and the element of metal. It\u2019s a powerful, protective figure with deep cultural significance.\n\nI actually did a breakdown of the movie and shared some theories about the tiger in a separate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lmhs7a/kpop_demon_hunters_movie_analysis_theories/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) if anyone\u2019s interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8slwt5zaz2af1.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813ed2ffe493193302e9f83b02839916a0229094",

Now I am hoping there will come a season 2. Any news regarding this? It should be a no-brainer, you can literally go into so many directions with a figure like Freud. Or Nietzsche. Or Carl Jung.

He's been able to pivot to \"Jokes for Max\" in a really heartwarming way. \n\nBut there are two points I want to emphasize:\n\n1). How in recent seasons when he is traveling he is very conscious to discuss the societal issues and humanitarian efforts going on in all of these countries/cities. It might feel heavy handed at times, but it is the minimum he can do to raise awareness for good causes.\n\n2). How he treats the people he works with and the people he cares about. Almost always in each episode he has a scene where he's having the camera crew getting in on trying the food, too. He will typically treat the local fixers to meals which reinforces this as well. But most of all what I thought was touching this season were his personal stories with his dad's Filipino nurse and his Guatemalan nanny - how he went out of his way to honor them during these journeys. \n\nCombined to me shows someone who cares for his staff no matter how long you worked for him. Feeling like the Everybody Loves Raymond royalties are doing a bit of good in their afterlife. \n\nPhil if you see this, I love ya. \n\n",

        "content": "I'll talk about s2-s3 in one post because it is 1 story. This contains spoilers from S1, S2 and S3. You're warned.\n\n1. Delete a bunch of voting scenes.\n\n I get it's to show how these players form groups and how interesting it is that so many want to stay except... I don't care. It's boring. The main reason I didn't mind the voting scene in S1 was because it subverted expectations. Most people didn't think they'd get to leave the games. This season does the opposite. And then probably 10 times.  \n\n\n\n2. Let the police officer retreat ANYTHING from his old phone. \n\nLet's say he retreated the picture of past winners, than he could've maybe tracked them down and extended the world building a bit. It might not be \"realistic\", but if we care about realism he shouldn't even had survived that fall... I just think if everything he did last season wasn't for nothing, maybe he would be a bit more useful this season. Did anyone enjoy watching him search for an island for 15 hours? Another route they could've gone was just to... let him find the island? \n\n\n\n3. Make No-eul a secondary main character\n\nThis might be more of a hot take, but I'd leave police officer's arc in S1 and make Noeul a replacement. It could be interesting to follow more of the behind the scenes from a soldiers perspective, especially one of higher rank. I wish it would take more time to explore how someone could choose to work in the games. Outside of Noeul, every soldier seems to be just the most straightforwardly evil person you'd ever meet, but I think how you end up as a guard is still a bit of an plot-hole. Also, leave the organ-selling plotline to S1. With Noeul as a main character I think it would be a lot more interesting to see how the soldiers deal with the players rebelling, and maybe have some of the higher-ups putting preshure on them. (I'm not only talking about the main coup here, so indirectly have players (Gihun ig) rebel more)\n\n  \n4. Delete the shaman lady.\n\n\n\n5. Delete non-important players and develop the ones you choose to highlight\n\nThere's too many characters. Many are interesting on paper, but because of how many they have to focus on at the same time a lot of them never become more than a shell of their character. I think there would be 2 options to archieve this. One would be to intertwine more backstory into the first episodes. Maybe have some characters living their life in the halloween party or have a larger segment following the pregnant couple. The other way would be to incoorporate some flashbacks. \n\n\n\n6. Isn't the new players lowkey the same from s1, just watered down in a different font?\n\nMight be another hot take but the trans woman \n\n\n\n7. Have players interact with one another\n\nAnother problem with the amount of players is that so many of them don't have any significance on the greater plot or each other. None of the characters impact Gihun's chance of survival. They don't have an impact on his goal of taking down the games either really. Why not have him plot against the system before a game, and one of the players working against that to win the game? \n\n  \nI won't talk about the S3 ending because I couldn't finish the season, but feel free to discuss it. I'm also not claiming these changes would be perfect either. They'd probably run into other plot-holes nonetheless. Anyways, what changes would you guys make? What did you think worked or didn't work in this season?",

It will play a preview or a series recap but when it gets into the meat of starting any episode or movie, every second of the whole video is a black screen with only the audio working.  It's not that it's always a black screen with audio only (that is a well documented tech issue) and I've tried all of those tips, from restarting to reinstalling the netflix app, to clearing cache and data, to logging off and on again, to switching profiles and none of this fixes the problem.  I have watched netflix before on my Android (Galaxy A50) with zero problems, so this is a new issue with me.  What on earth is going on?",
