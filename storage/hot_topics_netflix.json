I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! \n\n\\- What do you think of English dubbing in general? (e.g., films, TV shows, anime, etc.)\n\n\\- Are there any specific examples (good or bad) that stand out to you?\n\n\\- Have you watched \"Dark\" or \" Money Heist \" in English? Did you like it?\n\n\\- Do you think it is useful to watch English dubbed movies to learn English (if you are not a native English speaker)?\n\nPlease also let me know, if possible, where you're from (or, at least, if you are a native English speaker or not). Your input would be invaluable to my research, and I\u2019m truly grateful for any insights you can share. Feel free to be as detailed or brief as you\u2019d like!\n\nThank you so much for helping out, and I\u2019m looking forward to reading\u00a0your\u00a0opinions.",

The all time big question - will it be possible to have 2 devices on one wifi at my house and 2 devices on my sister's wifi in her house.
