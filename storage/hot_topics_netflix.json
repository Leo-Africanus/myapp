She gave the network sky high ratings while being horrible to people and the network and every person involved in the edits that made it on-air enabled Tyra to continuously strive to be even more deranged than before. She made bank off controversy then and she\u2019s making bank off controversy now. I believe her takeaway from ANTM is that controversy sells. I don\u2019t believe she went into this documentary to reclaim her narrative. She went into it knowing she would create controversy and that the world would continue to buzz over her beloved show and that she would make a shit ton of money because of it. She does not care emotionally for anyone involved. I genuinely think she is proud, she feels smart, and she feels in full control. Tyra rage-baited us and is thriving off our continued buzz about her, her show, and this doc about her and her show. I would so badly love to read her deal memo.",

Bringing in wannabe models, coach them, learn about them, share their stories of how they got here, be their big sister, erase the \"vapid stereotype\", get them good contracts. Save them. \n\nIt could've even been like Shark Tank where some judges are still hardasses. \n\nInstead, she continued the trauma cycle. It's unbelievable. \n\nAnd she's unapologetic. Honestly, I feel like everyone just blamed it on the times and moved forward. So I know everyone is saying that the J's and Nigel were apologetic but I technically don't see that. Where's the direct \"I'm sorry for literally creating a hostile environment in multiple ways\" from any of them? \n\nLook, don't get me wrong, I like the J's and Nigel more than Tyra and I think that they did a little better than her in this doc, but they are not blameless either. \n\nAnd that dude? Ken? Equivalent to Tyra. Despicable!!!!!!!! ",

It's set in Hialeah which it isn't a backwoods town, it's a dense urban/suburban major city in South Florida with over 220,000 residents. I'll cite one example of what I am referring to. How many rounds were shot into the house and outside yet not one call was ever made from any resident. Yeah, they said the homes in the short cul de sac were all stash houses or cartel owned but that kind of machine gun fire and # of rounds would be heard for blocks. Affleck &amp; Damon are the draw for sure but this was a B-movie compared to Affleck's \"The Town\", which was good but not great",

Maybe someone here has read the book which may have more details, or just has a plausible theory on these questions.\n\n1.\t\u2060Rachel and Helen were attempting to blackmail Lexi/Catherine, but for what? They couldn\u2019t have known about L\u2019s sister. What then?\n\n2.\t\u2060When Richard took Anna to the lake house to clear the air / bury the hatchet with Lexy, what was their true intention? Did Richard confess to Lexy that he banged Anna? When Jack beat him up at the bar and Anna told him she\u2019d tell Lexy they slept together if he pressed charges, he seemed to genuinely not want Lexy to know and agreed not to press charges if Anna kept quiet. Were they planning on murdering Anna? Was that why the bleach and other stuff was on the pool table? He had purchased that stuff days before so there must have been some kind of plan to harm her, but if so what was their motive?\n\n3. Here\u2019s the biggest hole for me. How did the mother know that cancelling their hotel reservation would make both Anna and Richard go to the lake house and how did she know lexi would be there? How did she know it would lead to an altercation in which the cops would come, search the house and find the planted evidence? That seems like a big reach. Seems like a lot of ifs, conditions and leaps of faith to make that all happen the way it did. Seems like anna would have been more likely to go to Jack or her mom\u2019s house, after all her and Jack had just recently somewhat reconciled (aka banged in his truck). Maybe if that didn\u2019t work out, if Anna didn\u2019t go to the lake house, she would have tried again another day another way?\n\nTLDR\n\n1. What did Rachel and Helen have on Lexi?\n\n2. Was Lexi and Richard planning to harm Anna and why?\n\n3. How did the mother know the stars would align and the cops would find the planted evidence?\n\nThanks for reading this far and thanks for any insight offered.",

        "content": "I had my CC cloned so got a new one and Netflix asked me to update my details - entirely reasonable.\n\nNo matter what I do on the update page, using text code security check or using the App to validate the transaction, the card is declined. the card is entirely valid and has no issues on it. HSBC say theres no attempted/failed transactions from Netflix so its unclear why Nertlfix wont accept a valid card.\n\nThe previous cards used on the account are all of the same type, exact same bank and theres never been an issue so its not 'My Account' thats the issue.\n\nNetflix chat help is stumped as they say theres no issues they can see but I still get the same messages up.\n\nAnyone got any ideas ?
