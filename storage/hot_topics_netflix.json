Dr Patrick Steptoe (played by\u00a0Bill Nighy) and scientist Robert \u2018Bob\u2019 Edwards.\u00a0\n\nBut Google's results leave a gaping hole in the history of the creation of IVF \u2013 the vital contributions of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie) who was only commemorated by the Royal Society of Biology in 2015.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, it was Jean who provided not only the \u2018last piece of the puzzle that made IVF possible\u2019 but also the voice desperately needed to bring this \u2018incredible\u2019 part of British history to the big screen.\n\n\u2018If this film is a reminder of the sacrifices that have been made by women, some good men, but mostly women, and how therefore we should protect that progress at every cost, then fantastic,' said Norton.\n\nYou can [**read the full article here**](https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/19/james-norton-i-took-ivf-granted-learned-shocking-truth-21940171/)",

These people lived in different areas of the US. It seems it was very widespread but Netflix is completely ignoring it and gaslighting us with how successful it was to not upset investors.  I guess they are not wanting to engage and hope it fizzles out while they correct internal issues before next stream, essentially making us beta testers.  \n\nI had friends over and spent an hour fucking with my home network thinking it was on my end until I saw others reporting issues.  It was beyond frustrating... then when it did work it looked like dog shit... I pay for 4k/HDR.  This is 2024, the scaling technology is there, yet they cut corners somewhere at the expense of its customers.  Oh well... cancelled just on principle. Ive been with them since early DVD delivery era.  Sorry, just ranting... tired of greedy corporations bending us over.  \n\nEDIT:  I should have included that they 'sort of' acknowledged it per the CTO to their EMPLOYEES... nothing publicly, at least not that I know of yet. \nhttps://x.com/markgurman/status/1857903507694915931",

        "content": "I was on Poshmark (it\u2019s like eBay to sell used clothes mostly at discounted prices), and was in a live auction/bidding where the host brought up their excitement to see the show. So I tuned in and watched it. FYI I didn\u2019t know about either of these people before the show, although I had heard of them. \n\nIt was several hours with a bunch of other fights leading up to the \u201cmain event\u201d where Mike Tyson fights Jake Paul. I watched the majority of the show, but once it get to their fight, I don\u2019t think I could take more than a couple minutes because it was disturbing to me and wrong. From my perspective, it was just wrong and made me angry. The way Jake Paul was talking shit about Mike Tyson was disgusting to me. I think for 58 years old, Mike Tyson was incredibly athletic, and I liked that they talked about his impressive history in the sport. I was not surprised he could not win a fight against a professional 27 YO fighter, but that does not mean he\u2019s incredibly strong compared to most others his age im sure. Also it\u2019s very frustrating that if Mike Tyson wanted to continue fighting at his age, there weren\u2019t people out there to offer opportunities to him to do so that weren\u2019t mistreating him, which is what I think was happening. We need more opportunities for old people IMO for physical activity, socialization, work opportunities (if they want), etc. It\u2019s so wrong to make him fight that young man, it honestly shook me a lot which is why I\u2019m posting. I think it\u2019s really messed up. I don\u2019t care who you are, that is never okay in my book. Shame on everyone involved in encouraging that fight and encouraging Mike Tyson to participate. Listening to Jake Paul smack talk him in advance was also f**ked up, he\u2019s not a winner to me. Dour generation needs to do freakin better treating older people. I think they need more opportunities. Us young people need to step up more, if anyone has any insight on that. I\u2019m honestly so upset about this ",

At its heart is Don Fabrizio Corbera, the Prince of Salina, who leads a life surrounded by beauty and privilege. But as Italy moves towards unification and the old aristocratic order is threatened, he realizes that his family\u2019s future is in jeopardy. New allegiances must be made, each one a threat to his principles. Eventually Don Fabrizio is faced with an impossible choice. He has the power to engineer a marriage, between the rich and beautiful Angelica and his nephew Tancredi, that could secure his family\u2019s legacy but, doing so would break his favorite daughter, Concetta\u2019s heart. The series will be a modern exploration of timeless themes \u2014 power, love, and the cost of progress.\n\nDIRECTOR: Tom Shankland, Giuseppe Capotondi, Laura Luchetti  \nWRITER: Richard Warlow, Benji Walters  \nBASED ON THE BOOK: The Leopard (Original Title: Il Gattopardo) by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\nKEY CAST: Kim Rossi Stuart, Benedetta Porcaroli, Deva Cassel, Saul Nanni\n\nTEASER: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk)",

But in my account, under my profile, it says \"TV animation effects\" and under \"Reduce motion transitions\"  At the right side there is no box for a check mark, but a toggle, that is either gray with a minus \"-\" sign or if clicked again, it turns blue with a check mark sign.   Does the check mark still means that transitions are reduced, or since is blue with the checkmark that transitions are actually enabled and can be seen?",

        "title": "Looking for a show to watch? List of 5 of the best shows I have seen",
        "content": "People around me tell me that I give the best recommendations for shows and movies. You can basically be sure that whatever I recommend to you will not be in vain, and you'll likely share similar feelings to mine. I take a lot of pride in the fact that people respect the recommendations I give, along with the thoughts I share about a show or film. So, I refuse to do anything that might jeopardize that. Below is a list of shows (in no particular order) that I hold in the same regard as *Breaking Bad* (not all of the recommendations I give right now will have similar plots to *Breaking Bad*, such as drug dealing or gangs, but some will). Also, I am FAR FROM a good writer. So my writing may be a bit sloppy, or bland... but just trust me that these are some of the best shows you can watch. Each of them had a similar factor. I got extremely in to them to the point I would stand up, cry, or talk to the TV; and I basically watched most of them in a few sittings if not one alone. You will won't be bored for a while if you go through this list and watch each one. Here we go though!\n\n1. **Snowfall** 8/10 A solid show. It starts off feeling a bit cheesy with the acting and something about Franklin felt goofy to me at the start. However, the character development is outstanding, and the actors seem to find their footing as the show progresses. Take my criticism with a grain of salt because the show is definitely not a slow burn. It starts strong and captivating, only continuing to get better (until season 4).\n2. **3%** 9.5/10 A phenomenal show, truly a hidden gem, and in my opinion, the king of hidden gems. If a show truly deserves a 10/10 rating, this is one of the few that comes close. Some of the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen, with exceptional character development. I became so attached to some characters and truly despised others. What makes the show unique is that there isn\u2019t a clear \"good guy/bad guy\" dynamic. While the show guides you toward who you\u2019re supposed to root for, you can still choose your own \"home team\" without having your experience ruined. The show excels in its realism\u2014real in the way people react to events and situations. It provides a genuine depiction of what the world could be like, even in its dystopian setting. There isn't much \"evil\"; instead, you see people doing what they think is right, even if others view their actions as evil. I watched it in its original Portuguese because the dubbed English version didn\u2019t do justice to the actors' performances\u2014and frankly, it was poorly done, as most English dubs are. The show is filled with twists and turns, and it's almost never predictable. An incredible mind-bender of a show.\n3. **Ozark** 8/10 Another strong show. For some reason, I tried starting it about four times before I finally got into it\u2014I can't remember why. This show excels in almost all aspects: plot, acting, character development, and twists that are far from predictable. The pacing is smooth, and the plot is captivating. There are moments where you notice something but don\u2019t think much of it, only to realize how pivotal it was 30 episodes later. I love shows with well-written foreshadowing, and *Ozark* is one of them.\n4. **Attack on Titan** 9.5/10 I understand not everyone is into anime, but I truly believe anyone can watch *Attack on Titan* and love it. In my opinion, it\u2019s one of (if not *the*) greatest stories ever told. It doesn\u2019t rely on typical anime clich\u00e9s like over-the-top humor or fan service. The acting is great (both the sub and dub, although the sub is infinitely better), and it feels like regular TV\u2014despite being animated. The first episode grabs your attention in a huge way. While the show might seem a bit slow after that, be patient\u2014the first season is just laying the foundation. I wouldn\u2019t call it a slow burn, but the first season is one of the less captivating ones. Once you reach the middle of the third season, nearly every episode has you on the edge of your seat. Not many shows can make me stand up or talk to the TV, but *Attack on Titan* did it repeatedly. It\u2019s one of the most well-written shows of all time, with incredible foreshadowing, mind-blowing twists, and unforgettable characters. It explores the gray areas of good and evil in a way few shows do. The second half of the series is almost a new show, yet it still feels like the same one. It's hard to explain, but you\u2019ll understand if you watch it. This show has everything to be peak fiction\u2014nothing is missing. The ending was set from the very beginning, which is rare in storytelling. Every storyline and loose end is tied up in a way that\u2019s incredibly satisfying. I cried multiple times and had my mind blown on more than one occasion. SO many twists. A perfect show.\n5. **White Lotus** 8.5/10 Another hit. I don\u2019t typically enjoy comedies or shows that try too hard to be funny (not that I\u2019d call *White Lotus* a comedy), because more often than not, I find them forced and unfunny. But this show had me laughing on several occasions. It doesn't let the humorous moments overshadow the overall tone of the show, nor does it detract from its urgency or seriousness. The show portrays society and the human psyche in a way that feels incredibly real. Throughout, you feel as though you\u2019re watching a story that could happen in real life, even though the events are outrageous. The characters' reactions to events make sense, and I found myself comparing them to people I know. The acting is excellent, and each character feels authentic. At times, I was amazed at how much they resembled real people\u2014not in appearance, but in their actions. It\u2019s over the top at times, but never to the point where it feels unreal. A remarkable show.",
