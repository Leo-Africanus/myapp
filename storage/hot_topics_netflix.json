And it seems to have gotten worse since the UI was updated. Or is there really nothing to watch on netflix?\n\nAnd its now always pushing for me to rewatch everything I've already watched, like just minutes after I've finished something it's the big main full screen suggestion. What's that about? Where's all the good stuff? Is there a way to game the algorithm so I can see the stuff it's not showing me? Or is Netflix really just Korean melodramas and 20 year old terrestrial TV dross.\n\nI'm using netflix so much less since the ui was updated that I'm starting to wonder if the algorithm is designed to find the sweet spot between keeping me paying but watching nothing. :(",

I understand this has been discussed before, and that the darker image is often a creative choice by the filmmakers rather than a technical limitation\u2014especially with Dolby Vision, which isn\u2019t always used to its full dynamic range. Even in daytime scenes, the average brightness tends to be much lower than standard SDR content.\n\nWhat puzzles me, though, is the contrast between the playback and the scene thumbnails. When scrubbing through scenes, the thumbnails appear much brighter and more vivid\u2014more in line with what I\u2019d expect from HDR content.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is this behaviour down to Netflix, or something to do with how LG handles Dolby Vision?\n\nThank you!",

        "content": "I have NF Standard and I'm in Germany. I don't understand what am I paying for. The bitrate is bad, sometimes too bad (depending on the show). It looks worse than a BDrip from 2006.\nI want a clear, crisp image, I don't need more. But they don't give it to me.  I have a 1080p 55\"TV from 2013.\n\nEverything seems to be degrading instead of developing. We are moving backward. In 2010 blu ray quality was standard. 15 years later we have a WORSE quality. And shows like Squid game isn't even available on Bluray anymore. \n\nDid we stop to value quality? What happened? \n\nI'm using the ps5 app\n\nAnd is 1080p on Premium better than on Standard? \n\nThx",
