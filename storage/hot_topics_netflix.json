He was never charged for the murders, but did serve time for sending a ransom letter. He had refused every major interview, but he agreed to do this one. They gave him the space to talk about his side of the story.\n\nIt is sooo strange how no one thought about approaching him like this before. And if they did, why didn't he talk? It's so bizzare. ",
