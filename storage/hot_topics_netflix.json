And then they were \u201cshocked\u201d when they learned someone died there from a doctor that worked there even though it is brought up in multiple reviews that someone died at the clinic??",

        "content": "I have the standard with ads account in the UK and wondering why the ads are so terrible. Like there seems to be only 3 ads in total of all betting sites. So at every ad break I get the same 3 ads of betting companies. Is this the case for everyone?\n\nBear in mind never have I ever had the slightest interest around betting or sports. Surely this is just bad advertising and targeting lol. How is it so hard to at least show me something I might be slightly interested in",
