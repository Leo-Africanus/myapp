She married him, she has 4 beautiful children and she maintained her silhouette (I know her eating problems, but she's lucky to have a good health and not being affected by a hormonal problem, as many women are going through). She has the life and the opportunities that 99% of the planet couldn't even dream of. She is still very rich and she can pursue her passion, the fashion-she is very talented in this to be fair.\n\nI watched the documentary. It looks like she is not aware of none of these things. ",

Charlie Hunnam and Laurie Metcalf's performances were great but what really grinds my gears are the portrayals of the actual known murder victims. I get writers take artistic liberties for entertainment but what they came up with was just so perverse. Mary Hogan was a former madam in Chicago? Bernice was a desperate old kinky cougar looking for a sugar baby? Was this to make us feel less sorry for them? Like maybe they deserved it bc they weren't \"virtuous\"? There's very little background online about either of the victims, at least nothing I could find, so I cant understand why they made these choices for these women? The only thing I could come up with was Ryan Murphy really doesn't like women.",

There are better ways to make an impact without having to watch 10 scenes of a dead bodies getting f***** and 600 people getting grotesquely murdered with every brutalized second on display.\n\nEdit: I have no problem with violence or gore in film, TV, video games etc. However, if im gonna have to watch some guy fuck a dead body for the love of the game every 10 seconds, the plot better be good and add something interesting to the conversation. If not, im not interested in some murder porn fantasy that isnt made in good faith to the people who actually suffered that freak.

        "title": "A Rollercoaster of Emotions with Monster: Ed Gein (I actually liked it \u2014 and here\u2019s why)",
        "content": "After the second episode, I started to doubt how accurate the show would really be (I hadn\u2019t read any spoilers, but I knew a lot about the real case). At first, I was honestly annoyed by the whole Adelaine storyline \u2014his supposed girlfriend and accomplice\u2014 and the murders of victims that were never actually proven to be his. Even the depiction of the *real* victims wasn\u2019t that precise (Bernice\u2019s death scene was\u2026 embarrassing, omg).\n\nBut around episode six or seven, I started to *get it*. It finally clicked that everything we\u2019d seen before was meant to show what it\u2019s like to be **inside Ed Gein\u2019s head**: confusing, hyper-sexualized, disturbing, and suffocating. What\u2019s real? What\u2019s a lie?\n\nThe scenes that directly referenced horror films \u2014like the chainsaw one and the babysitter Evelyn (clearly nodding to *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*)\u2014 added a clever extra layer. They reminded us that we\u2019re not only trapped in Ed\u2019s confusion, but also in **Hollywood\u2019s own distortion** of reality through the \u201ccreativity\u201d of its horror movies inspired by killers like him.\n\nFor me, the turning point \u2014and the reason I ended up really appreciating the show\u2014 was the final stretch. It hits you with a cold dose of reality, showing the heartbreaking truth about mental illness and how it gets minimized and worsened in a violent, repressive family or social environment.\n\nPsychiatric disorders are not only hard for others to understand \u2014they\u2019re also hard for the person living with them. And the way the show portrayed his schizophrenia diagnosis (wow) felt incredibly authentic. The imaginary communication with Ilse and Christine Jorgensen \u2014with them saying things that were actually coming from his doctor and his own mind\u2014 was such a genuine representation of a brain desperately looking for answers but simply not working right. It truly felt like a drowning man reaching for anything to hold on to.\n\nMaybe we all expected it to follow the same style as *Dahmer*, but the fact that this one actually makes you **think** (and even research what was real and what wasn\u2019t, instead of just buying whatever a show tells you) really impressed me. I\u2019d even say it\u2019s more suited for *true crime* and horror fans \u2014the kind of viewers who can catch those deeper layers more easily.",

I can never seem to find anything I want to watch or am interested in. Idk when it started but there was a time when basically every Netflix original I don\u2019t dare to watch because I already know it\u2019s going to let me down (except the Monster series like it ok.)\n\nI got a pretzel in my head due to simultaneously knowing that i should cancel and that i do have an attachment to the brand. Getting all the newest movies in the mail for me and the gang to watch was epic and being able to stream on my Xbox was epic in its own right. Does anybody feel similar?\n\nEdit: there has been some straight fire that I loved like All Quiet on the Western Front, Stranger Things, Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor and others. It\u2019s not all bad and i\u2019m for sure not shitting on netflix",

We have consistently lived together (I\u2019m 21), but in the last 2 years we have sort of split out. I\u2019ll explain. We live in a very cramped house and my dad started renting an apartment across the road, and all three of us spent time over there. Sometimes just my parents, sometimes just me, sometimes one of them, sometimes all three of us. It was like an extension to our house and literally 50 metres away or so. This was before the Household Restrictions really came about so we never had issues. \n\nPost Netflix introducing the Household Restrictions, my mother and I bought an apartment about 50 metres from my family home in the other direction. Like the last place, all three of us come and go from this apartment. All three of us use the TV interchangeably. But the Household Restrictions are really screwing it now. It will disable at either our house or at the apartment semi constantly. Every single time we try and use it, no matter which house we\u2019re using it from, we have trouble getting into it. My dad is the only one with access to the email and if either my mother or i want to use the account, and hes busy, at work, or asleep, we simply can\u2019t access Netflix at all. \n\nIs there any way to get around this? Is it worth emailing Netflix customer service and explaining this? Can they do anything? ",

If she cared for anyone else portions would\u2019ve gone to the actual victims of her father. The truth of the matter is her dad was actually a pretty good dad to her to the point nobody believed he was a killer.  He was a horrible person, I\u2019m not downplaying that it had to be traumatic in some way. But the entitlement and woe is me is just so irritating every single scene was all herself.

Can be binged in one evening. The plot just gets more wild and sad and baffling. \n\n2) The Keepers - just incredibly good - the women in the show who never gave up were inspiring and the editing etc is sooo good. I\u2019ve re-watched easily around 4 times. Absolutely love it. \n\n3) Tell me who I am - a haunting and chilling documentary about twin brothers and their vastly different recollections of what it was like growing up in an upper class family in England within an abusive family unit. The one brother had an accident and had complete memory loss, the other was burdened with a complete memory of their childhood \n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished watching Boots on Netflix and wanted to share some thoughts.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how the show treats LGBT characters in a natural, realistic way. Unlike series like Heartstopper, it\u2019s not overly sweet or romanticized  it has humor and light moments, but it doesn\u2019t sugarcoat everything. The LGBT aspect feels like one part of the characters\u2019 lives rather than the sole focus, and, at least from my perspective, it avoids stereotypes.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think about this approach. Did you notice how the show handles LGBT representation without making it the only focus? Did this affect how you connected to the characters and the story? Personally, I found this more realistic style refreshing compared to more \u201cfeel-good\u201d shows, and I\u2019d love to know if others felt the same. Were there particular moments that felt especially natural or well-balanced to you?\n\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts and hearing how others experienced the series!\n",

        "content": "!!!Spoilers for both book and movie!!!\n\nI'm a huge fan of the book. If was one of the first that got me into the mystery/thriller genre.\n\nOverall, the movie was pretty good. I think that I would've enjoyed it way more if I hadn't read the book beforehand. The changes to the plot really bugged me\ud83d\ude05\n\n1. Lo's arc is completely different but I find her more likeable in the movie.\n2. I think the movie should've included the home invasion and Lo's inability to cope with it. In the book, Lo gets drunk the evening before witnessing the body being thrown overboard, which is a major reason why people don't believe her. She's implied to be in a mostly sober state in the movie, which makes the gaslighting from Bullmer and the crew much more obvious.\n3. The movie completely changes Carrie's character. The movie makes her very innocent and fragile. In the book, she's a very morally grey character - she's much more in on Bullmer's plan and is harsher with Lo. I liked her character way more in the book and felt like her personality was much more interesting.\n4. However, something that the movie did perfectly was capturing the unsettling, too-flawless, cold vibes of the boat. The scenery was gorgeous. They did a great job with the aesthetics.\n5. Didn't love the ending change. I would've kept the original ending of the book but didn't leave it as open ended.\n6. The evil doctor felt like an unnecessary character.\n7. I did love how the movie really humanized Anne.\n\nAnyways, that's my review :)\n",

        "content": "Disclaimer: To the people complaining about all the posts about this show. Just keep scrolling if you don't like it and have some respect for the people who take the time and effort to put their thoughts out there for meaningful discussion. I'm seeing a lot of downvotes on anything to do with this show and that says to me people are just downvoting in bad faith. The fact of the matter is, this is a netflix subreddit and this is the appropriate place for these posts.\n\nNow onto the post:\n\nI'm about halfway through the series and I'm having some mixed feelings on this season. The biggest problem with the Ed Gein story isn't the casting, or the accent, it's the fact that most of it is completely made up.\n\nFor example:\n\nHe never kept a body in his mother's room. He actually boarded off her room and kept it untouched like a shrine. His mother's grave was encased in cement so instead, he dug up other women. He was obsessed with his mother and the reason he crossdressed was in some way to embody or become her. She became a voice in his head due to his undiagnosed schizophrenia and all the things he did were likely due to his mental illness.\n\nIn addition, there's no evidence he ever killed the babysitter, or did that \"magic show\" for the kids he baby sat for. In fact, the babysitter lived 2 hours away. There's no evidence he ever killed his brother, who instead died of asphyxiation from trying to stop a brushfire on their property. There's no evidence he ever had a romantic relationship in his life. In fact, it seems more probable he was so brainwashed by his mother that he could never be intimate with a woman. It's possible she knew he was mentally ill and tried to protect other people by keeping him away. Also, since he was strange and quiet, it seems like women friendzoned him and used him for favors instead of dating him based on quotes from women who knew him. And lastly, the part about him murdering 2 hunters who discovered the body never happened and isn't based on any real case of hunters found murdered in the area. Pure fiction\n\nIn reality, Ed Gein murdered 2 people and dug up 9 women. The rest of the stuff about his life is largely anecdotal or unknown. He wasn't someone like Jeffrey Dahmer or BTK who talked at length about their crimes and gave us a peek under the hood of how their minds worked. Part of me feels like there's not enough source material to make a true to life character study on him like they did with Dahmer but at the same time I do think there's enough to at least make a good approximation of who he was. The Menendez brothers' story is steeped in speculation as well but they at least kept it honest.\n\nI think in general the Monster series should focus on understanding the minds of these people and why they commit these acts and to do that they need to focus on the truth. That's part of why people are fascinated by serial killers. It's not so much the violence, it's the question of why they committed the violence and the curiosity of who they were as people and how they got that way. That said, this season fails at that and instead is filled with a bunch of hot air.\n\nIn the end, I think they could have stuck with the facts and given us a dark and gritty look into Ed Gein's lonely life by using an inner monologue of his and focused on his psychology. I'd rather have that than the made up stories. I'm fine with including the scenes about the impact and influence he's had on our culture but only if they're honest about who he was in the first place.",

Sure enough I looked it up and that whole bit was just cut from the Netflix version. It\u2019s weird considering the vulgarity of the whole movie, which also has a line that includes the R slur, that they cut the line about queefs?  It\u2019s weird and a little alarming that they\u2019re just cutting movies up. What else are they removing? ",

        "title": "What Monster:  Ed Gein taught me",
        "content": "TL;DR:  This is typical Netflix propaganda based more on fiction than fact.\n\n1)  When in doubt, blame the Nazis.  While it's true Ed Gein had some fascination with concentration camps, he was also fascinated with many other things such as cannibalism.  The frequent hallucinations of hanging around Nazi leadership, including Ilse Koch, made the series almost unwatchable.  How Ilse Koch eventually hanging herself had anything whatsoever to do with Gein is beyond me.  But dead Nazis sell, of course.\n\n2)  Or blame the Republicans (you know, the new Nazis).  If only not for Nixon and Ford, Gein would have truly been rehabilitated.  Those evil Republicans wanted the worst of the worst to be punished rather than rehabilitated.  How dare they!\n\n3)  When there isn't enough material for facts, just make them up.  Why not give him an imaginary girlfriend who knew of all his exploits and was equally as sick in the head?\n\n4)  When there isn't enough material for facts, just produce random sex scenes with corpses and between prisoners.  \n\n5)  Video games and TV clearly have nothing to do with the desensitization of the West.  I mean, showing sex with corpses rather than implying it was absolutely necessary and definitely doesn't desensitize the borderline crazy.  \n\n6)  To increase the drama, just besmirch the character of a long dead middle-aged woman by putting her in a consensual sexual relationship with a serial killer.  \n\n7)  Netflix, or at least the creators of \"Monster,\" are the leftiest of the left.  No one else would try to generate sympathy for someone like Ed Gein.  Seriously, was it necessary to try and show a fake attempt at him doing good by helping catch Ted Bundy?\n\n8)  If anyone says they are trans, you never question them.  Unless they are a violent killer.  Then they definitely are not trans, because trans are usually only victims and almost never violent.\n\n9)  Charlie Hunnam will never be viewed the same again.  Granted, I knew him from Green Street Hooligans and not his other... umm..  exploits.\n\n10)  Aunt Jackie always was and always will be an evil woman.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  This could have been a great three-part series if they had stuck with the facts and left out the hallucinations and the side stories (Hitchcock, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc).  Instead, it turned into an overly long, eight-part fictitious world, loosely based on a real serial killer, while pushing left wing propaganda.  This is on par for Netflix and reminds me why the only good things coming out of Netflix these days are from Europe and sometimes Canada.  ",
