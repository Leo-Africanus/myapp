For whatever reason every other streaming service only seems to have results pop up if the movie is available there, but Netflix will get your hopes up and generate a search which makes you think it's available for streaming but it's happened like a dozen times now that the title isn't available and to \"remind\" me later when it's available. It feels like just a way to drive traffic to Netflix with hopes that they will just look for something else to watch via Netflix rather than scouring the internet looking the thing they were originally trying to watch.

She gave the network sky high ratings while being horrible to people and the network and every person involved in the edits that made it on-air enabled Tyra to continuously strive to be even more deranged than before. She made bank off controversy then and she\u2019s making bank off controversy now. I believe her takeaway from ANTM is that controversy sells. I don\u2019t believe she went into this documentary to reclaim her narrative. She went into it knowing she would create controversy and that the world would continue to buzz over her beloved show and that she would make a shit ton of money because of it. She does not care emotionally for anyone involved. I genuinely think she is proud, she feels smart, and she feels in full control. Tyra rage-baited us and is thriving off our continued buzz about her, her show, and this doc about her and her show. I would so badly love to read her deal memo.",

Could be someone sent back in time, to another universe, into a book, whatever (not into the future tho, I prefer fantasy over scifi). Magic or realism is fine, I'd prefer romance B plot but it's not mandatory/could be the A plot. \n\nWhile I do have Netflix and it's easiest, if you have recs that aren't on there or aren't on there anymore I'm definitely desperate enough to go on a lil hunt!",

Honestly, I feel like everyone just blamed it on the times and moved forward. So I know everyone is saying that the J's and Nigel were apologetic but I technically don't see that. Where's the direct \"I'm sorry for literally creating a hostile environment in multiple ways\" from any of them? \n\nLook, don't get me wrong, I like the J's and Nigel more than Tyra and I think that they did a little better than her in this doc, but they are not blameless either. \n\nAnd that dude?

How many rounds were shot into the house and outside yet not one call was ever made from any resident. Yeah, they said the homes in the short cul de sac were all stash houses or cartel owned but that kind of machine gun fire and # of rounds would be heard for blocks. Affleck &amp; Damon are the draw for sure but this was a B-movie compared to Affleck's \"The Town\", which was good but not great",

When I click on the site it shows as normal and there is a play button but when I click it, the ui3012 error shows up. When I tried to look it up on netflix another day to see if it will still show the error, I can't look the show up on netflix site or the app, but it's on google. I talked with a friend about it and she can look up and play the show as normal so what is happening and how can I fix it?\"}]}]}",

        "content": "Before starting to watch Run Away I had recently watched Tim Robinson\u2019s The Chair Company. I appreciate in retrospect how The Chair Company nails the trope of vigilante conspiracy mystery genre so well, while in absurdity, that it makes poorly executed earnest attempts at the same feel more than silly.\n\nI got through half the episodes when I thought, maybe the ridiculous &amp; unsatisfying ending of TCC is a sign that Run Away will end similarly, because how couldn\u2019t it.  Reading some spoilers I feel like not seeing it through was the right move.",
