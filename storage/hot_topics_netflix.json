She proceeds to cry and beg him to tell her why sir, why'd you kill my daddy??, which unsurprisingly doesn't work. Then the nurse drugs him, tells her she only has a few minutes to get the truth out of him.  He reveals he was paid to take the fall for the murder, and she decides to argue with him. But you confessed! They found the weapon on you! I am guessing a DI doesn't know what paid to take the fall means?  Only after a few minutes does she finally ask \"who paid you?\" Of course too late, he has passed out. Then she crys more.  Christ on a cracker, are the books this stupid too? How does this guy have a career.  ",

Believable characters, great actors! \n\nFrom Netflix:\n\nBased on a true story, the crime drama series The Breakthrough follows the second-largest criminal investigation in Swedish history. In the early 2000s, the small city of Link\u00f6ping was rocked by a double homicide in broad daylight. Two people \u2014 a child and a woman in her late 50s \u2014 were stabbed to death. But with no motive or suspect, the case eventually grew cold. Nearly two decades later, the police made headway after a genealogist entered the fray.  Starring Peter Eggers and Mattias Nordkvist, the series was directed by Lisa Siwe (The Bridge) and written by Oskar S\u00f6derlund (Snabba Cash). \u201cThough this is a fictional drama series about a crime, it is, above all, a depiction of a human tragedy \u2014 where we place our focus on the victims and the investigation rather than the perpetrator,\u201d Siwe told Netflix. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about the compassion and care for one another that is needed to move on when terrible things happen.\u201d",

En plus de perdre une heure de mon temps pr\u00e9cieux, j\u2019ai eu droit \u00e0 une arrogance et un m\u00e9pris qui en disent long sur la consid\u00e9ration que Netflix accorde \u00e0 ses abonn\u00e9s fid\u00e8les.\n\nLors de cet appel, le premier interlocuteur, par son attitude condescendante et arrogante, s\u2019est distingu\u00e9 par une totale absence de professionnalisme. Par contraste, une deuxi\u00e8me personne a tent\u00e9, avec beaucoup de douceur et d\u2019attention, de trouver une solution. Malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, le probl\u00e8me n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre r\u00e9solu et une solution alternative, certes bien intentionn\u00e9e, mais loin d\u2019\u00eatre optimale, m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e.\n\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019intervient Esther, une responsable suppos\u00e9e \"sup\u00e9rieure\", dont l\u2019arrogance et l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence ont surpass\u00e9 toutes mes attentes (n\u00e9gatives). Lorsque j\u2019ai abord\u00e9 la question d\u2019une reconnaissance pour mes plus de 5 ans de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 ininterrompue, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse glaciale et m\u00e9prisante : \"Chez Netflix, vous n\u2019\u00eates pas r\u00e9compens\u00e9e pour vos ann\u00e9es de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9.\"\n\nPire encore, \u00e0 peine avais-je formul\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9silier mon abonnement qu\u2019elle m\u2019interrompait pour m\u2019annoncer que l\u2019annulation \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 confirm\u00e9e et que j\u2019avais re\u00e7u un e-mail. Est-ce cela, le respect que vous r\u00e9servez \u00e0 vos clients de longue date ?\n\nSoyons clairs : ce genre de m\u00e9pris est inacceptable. Vous traitez vos abonn\u00e9s comme des vaches \u00e0 lait, en vous souciant uniquement de leur argent, mais certainement pas de leur satisfaction ou de leur fid\u00e9lit\u00e9. Je ne suis pas seulement d\u00e9\u00e7ue, je suis outr\u00e9e par le manque total de consid\u00e9ration dont vous faites preuve.\n\nNetflix Suisse, vous devriez avoir honte. Votre arrogance et votre m\u00e9pris montrent que vous n\u2019\u00eates int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ni par vos clients, ni par leur fid\u00e9lit\u00e9. Vous \u00eates devenus un g\u00e9ant d\u00e9connect\u00e9, uniquement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par vos profits, et cela finira par vous co\u00fbter cher.\n\nCe message est adress\u00e9 aux responsables de Netflix Suisse : continuez ainsi, et votre arrogance entra\u00eenera votre chute. Vous prenez vos abonn\u00e9s pour des imb\u00e9ciles, mais sachez que nous ne sommes pas aussi dociles que vous semblez le penser.",

Such a predatory business. Why can't I just get the 4k deal for 1 device at a time?\n\nWhy do they have to lock resolution behind the absurdly expensive tier just because they want to milk as much money out of people as possible?",
