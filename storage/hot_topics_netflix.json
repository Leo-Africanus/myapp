        "content": "I watched the documentary in full and there\u2019s so much to say, but I\u2019ve honestly found other posts on it as well. \n\nOne thing I can\u2019t seem to find is about their \u201cfriend\u201d with the black hair.\n\nSomething about her feels off to me? I understand maybe nerves, and obviously she had known them prior to this happening.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know, the energy she gives me is that she actually had feelings for Brian but was embarrassed about it, so she pushed it away, and wasn\u2019t actually friends with Gabby, or was jealous of her. There\u2019s times where she seems normal talking about them, like the engagement, but then other times not so much.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me that she\u2019s in this documentary about him killing Gabby, and she\u2019s yapping about Brian saying the friend thing or being the love of his life, and the bluebird text. She smiles a lot when talking about him, and then when she talks about him playing guitar for Gabby and \u201chow could I be so blind?\u201d Gives me the feeling he didn\u2019t tell her about Gabby until they found out and she thought he was her lover boy-regardless if they were dating or not.\n\nShe isn\u2019t actually crying at the end.\n\nIdk. I always think I\u2019m reading too much into something and then something comes out and I\u2019m like \u201cI KNEW IT\u201d, lol.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure what this means, I guess I wonder if she knows more than she\u2019s letting on? Gabby had reached out to her ex, and if I know anything about abusive bf\u2019s, they\u2019ll come back around to old \u201cloves\u201d to get an ego boost. Makes me wonder if he ever reached out to her when he and Gabby were fighting, or after Gabby\u2019s death. She seems like she had that relationship with him. \n\nDid anyone else get this vibe from her or am I nuts?",

Especially the mother. Blaming Shannan for everything. With Gabby, Brian\u2019s mom is also narcissistic. In the same aspect as Brian. Both sons were narcissistic same as their mothers. \n\nThe body cams/story. In both body cams both Brian and Chris have that same smiley expression. They also both blamed the other party on wrong doing. Brian convinced the cops that Gabby was also being the aggressor. With Chris during the start he blamed Shannan stating they were fighting and she could of left with the kids. Also made the story convincing by her \"leaving the ring behind.\" During the interrogation Chris also claimed Shannan was choking one of the daughters and that's what \"made him\" kill Shannan.\n\nI just wanted to state this information because I started noticing the similarities when I saw the Brian body cam happened on August 12 2021. Chris murdered his family August 13 2018. \n\nIf there is anything else that is worth sharing please comment below! I'm sure there is a lot more similarities than my findings! ",

        "content": "I just have to get this off my chest, even at the risk of getting massively downvoted, this character is so poorly written. She changes her mind ten times in a single episode and is excessively annoying. The story itself is dull and weak overall with no character developments, but I could live with that if it weren\u2019t for ***this*** one character being forcefully inserted into every situation. It made sense in Season 1 since the story revolved around her, but in Season 2? Even FBI agents are unaware of Night Action, yet somehow, this civilian is deeply involved in everything??seriously? If the writers were so intent on keeping her relevant, why not just hire her as a tech? Instead, they throw a civilian into the field like it\u2019s nothing. To top it all off, the actor really cannot act. It was really difficult to finish season 2. I am not even getting to the other issues like poor writting, countlessly irritating character arcs.. S1 was not the greatest but it felt like this had some promise going forward and boy, oh boy, was I wrong.",
