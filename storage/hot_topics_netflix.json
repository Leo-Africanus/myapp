She knows he\u2019s still using the Netflix she pays for because after he moved our profiles showed up on her Netflix when that hadn\u2019t been there before. She has no idea what the password is. Is there some solution to this?  This POS doesn\u2019t deserve his free Netflix.

        "content": "After a long wait, [the first official teaser for Season 3 of Alice in Borderland](https://youtu.be/CaWRDITtT1U) is here. It is shockingly the first Japanese video this year to make it to the main Netflix YouTube channel, rather than merely the regional channels.\n\nThe trailer of Asura, the remake of the 1970s family drama, did not make it. Neither did that of Bullet Train Explosion, a modern reimagining of the action-thriller movie from that same decade that is said to have inspired Keanu Reeves' breakout hit Speed. More recently, the musical drama Glass Heart failed to get its trailer onto the main channel as well.\n\nThat is a major decline from last year, which saw FOUR Japanese originals get even just their official trailers onto the main channel: House of Ninjas, City Hunter, The Boyfriend, and The Queen of Villains. And judging by the attention (or lack thereof) given to 10Dance and Last Samurai Standing, I will be pleasantly surprised if either makes it as well.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea has had healthy representation (barring the numerous works that remain stuck on that country's channel). Obviously there is the final season of Squid Game, but other originals have also had their official trailers hit the main channel. There is Mercy for None, aka the Korean John WIck. There is Weak Hero Class 2. There is even When Life Gives You Tangerines, arguably the first K-Drama to make it. Even Revelations, whose teaser and first trailer were not uploaded to the main channel, got its final trailer in.\n\nThat leaves only five other Japanese (true) originals (not counting Giri/Haji, which first aired on BBC2) whose official trailers have made it to the main channel (at least in my memory):\n\n* Followers (this one actually came before Alice in Borderland)\n* First Love\n* The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House\n* Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead\n* Yu Yu Hakusho\n\nThe last three of them came out in 2023. That means in the span of two years, seven Japanese official trailers made it to the main channel - a major leap in marketing. But now, a downturn.\n\nIt even extends to the ancillary videos on the Still Watching Netflix channel. Squid Game, just to name a Korean example, has had many of them there. Alice in Borderland? Two, one for each season. The rest have had none - not even YuYu Hakusho and City Hunter, which were adapted from famous manga.\n\nHeck, they even streamed the Squid Game Season 3 launch party! Alice in Borderland might not get the same privilege for its own third season.\n\nSo what gives? Why has Netflix stopped significantly promoting its Japanese originals this year after a somewhat strong streak? Let me know in the comments!",

        "title": "Netflix's Abrupt / Intrusive Ads (That Start Without a Break/Cut to Black)",
        "content": "I recently noticed that Netflix's ads have felt weirdly more intrusive than other streaming services, and I think I figured out why: they don't cut to black before they jump into a commercial!\n\nHere's an example from \"The Queen's Gambit\": [https://youtu.be/JPpU6UuJKvM](https://youtu.be/JPpU6UuJKvM)\n\nOther streaming services (e.g., Max and Disney+) have at least a few black frames to demarcate their ads, but Netflix doesn't -- one frame is the show, and bam! the immediate next frame is the ad. I'm guessing this was deliberate -- a sneaky/subtle way to trick your brain for a split second to think the ad is part of the show and retain your attention.\n\n(\\*I'm not 100% sure, but it also looks like the frames might even be blended to make it even more \"seamless,\" but that could be a separate frame rate issue with my camera. Here's one example: https://imgur.com/a/a1DPC6l)\n\nI googled this left and right, but couldn't find any discussions about this. Has anyone else noticed this/posted about this? I don't know if this is a new thing, but there's definitely been a recent spike in the number of times I'm watching something on Netflix and I'm momentarily confused about why the Squid Game man is suddenly looking at a Chipotle burrito.",
