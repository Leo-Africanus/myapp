Not to mention people in other countries don't get those ads which makes it feel even worse. I don't know if this will be as big a money grab as they think it will or it'll just be a massive deterrent. If this is how it'll always be for lives I don't plan on watching another. ",

If anything I wish there was more resolution to the shootas on the boat (knew it was the Captain immediately lol). But I am looking forward to seeing the third season! I like that it leaves you feeling a bit neurotic about what comes next. And I think it will age incredibly well. What an incredible job that this crew did! Also, visually very fun / horrifying to watch unfold. \nThe games appear extra cold, sterile and sinister. \n\nI really haven\u2019t seen editing this sharp since S6 of Sopranos. It\u2019s like a character in its own right. \n\nI am sure this season will hit a lot harder upon rewatches! I implore those of you somewhat dissatisfied to give it another try before this summer.",
