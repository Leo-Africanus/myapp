They could\u2019ve actually had some dramatic tension of folks figuring it out, trying to escape, an actual uprising. Folks on the outside could\u2019ve figured it all out and it turns into a hostage negotiation without the billionaires knowing they were hostages. Instead other than them actually getting them in to the bunker, I\u2019m in episode 8 and there\u2019s been more action in an hour of my abuela\u2019s daily telenovela. Not to mention dead lesbian syndrome within an hour of her appearing, and some casual antisemitism (come on, the wealthiest most evil billionaire just happens to be Jewish and he\u2019s the only one whose religion or ethnicity is mentioned? \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).

What an amazing and intense show.\n\nSomething that doesn\u2019t make sense to me though is the ending. **Spoilers ahead \u2014 stop reading if you haven\u2019t finished.**\n\nAt the end, Junior forces Vince to rob the Black Rabbit with him. Since Vince was masked, no one knew who the second gunman was. Later, Vince kills Junior to save his brother Jake, which obviously puts him on a collision course with Junior\u2019s father.\n\nHere\u2019s my confusion: why on earth does Vince go to the *same fence* that Junior was planning to use? By doing that, he exposes his identity. Junior\u2019s father learns exactly who he is, and it puts everyone in danger.\n\nIf Vince had just stayed away, no one would have ever been able to confirm for sure that he was the other shooter. Going to the fence with the jewels was basically like announcing, \u201cYes, I was the second robber.\u201d\n\nAm I missing something here? Was there a reason he *had* to go to that fence, or is this just a plot hole?",

What really struck me was how the show captured the pettiness and cruelty of human nature how people would rather cling to the throne and their power than save actual lives. That layer made the story so much more haunting than just the undead.\n\nAnd the acting? Absolutely top notch. Every performance carried so much weight that I found myself invested in every character\u2019s fate, even the ones I hated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been putting this one off like I did, don\u2019t.

        "content": "(SUBTLE SPOILERS AHEAD) \n\nThe writers, actors, show runners, animators, and everyone who\u2019s worked on this show should be SO PROUD! \n\nI love animation and for a long time now nothing new has felt like it \u201chit the mark\u201d and this show just nailed it. \n\nThe pacing is fantastic, the humor is quirky and unique, the characters have strong individual identities and relationships, the world building is GREAT with so much potential to explore, and the animation is really crisp while still providing lots of fun details in the hotel. \n\nBut I think the thing that I truly appreciate is the balance of light humor with serious topics. They deftly explore the difficult emotions these characters feel with both humor and genuine honesty. From things like self acceptance (Ben) and fear of dating again (Catherine) to the much more serious undertones of missing a parental figure and wanting to have friends (Ester), and family trauma/relationship dynamics (Nathan and Catherine). The characters feel very truthful, their flaws explored with their good intentions and love for each-other ultimately coming through. \n\nThey touch on these topics while still providing room to develop them, leaving the audience not only excited for more world development but also excited to explore these characters on a deeper level. You can feel the passion from the creators in each episode. \n\nI\u2019m so impressed and excited for this show and really hope Netflix invests in it properly. If they do it could absolutely be a classic! I certainly already have it on my rewatch roster and this season alone is one I know will be watched over and over again :) \n\nThank you to everyone who created and worked on this show for giving us such a gem!

I can\u2019t help but make direct connections from the events in that show to what\u2019s happening in the US right now. \n\nNo this isn\u2019t some psycho post nor do i think everything is directly related\u2026 but there are similarities in the unfolding of events that you can\u2019t help but to think about.
