        "title": "Does anyone else think that the new kid influencing docuseries is disgusting dramatic irony?",
        "content": "Netflix has released a new docuseries, \"Bad Influence\", about a kid who was exploited as a child influencer. Her mom posted her all over the internet as a kid with little / no regard for her safety, and made tons of money off of her.\n\nSo, Netflix are now using this kid's story to - you guessed it - make money off the documentary.\n\nHer full name is in it, her face is in it. I've watched the intro in which someone states \"predators were watching these videos\" AND IT SHOWS, with no censoring, the type of videos that predators would seek out - eg, of her dancing as a minor dressed in not a lot.\n\nThe real kicker is that this kid is STILL A KID. She's still 17. And even if she wasn't, I still feel this is exploitative. This is NOT the way to raise awareness of the dangers of child influencing.\n\nAlso - she's very active on social media and hasn't posted about the documentary, which makes me question whether this was even done with her consent. Imagine the mental toll this kind of thing would take on her. It seems to be an awful privacy violation for a child whose whole life has been a series of awful privacy violations. I hope she gets the help she needs and then sues the shit out of them.\n\nIt feels so disgustingly ironic to me. Gross on Netflix's part.\n\n(EDIT: I did watch an episode to make sure I was along the right lines after I posted this. just want to say I 100% agree with anyone saying that the other kids deserve to tell their stories, especially now they're adults. What an awful, disgusting situation all around. My heart breaks for all these kids. We must have better laws to protect our children from the internet. However, I do believe the publishing of the doc could make things worse for the \"main\" child in question, and I don't believe it was published with her best interests at heart. I'm also uncomfortable with Netflix monetising the situation. Thanks to everyone who's discussed this in the comments.)",

Also per usual, different viewers and critics have very different opinions about which ones soar and which don't.  \n  \nSo I may be an outlier in my particular affection for the first episode, \"Common People.\" I like how its plot takes simultaneous swipes at the gig economy, the insidious omnipresence of advertising and \u2014 a particular fascination of mine \u2014 the relentless micro-tiering of every service in our lives.",

I have to admit that season 1 amazed me and especially the two boys (Spyros and Antonis). I felt so sad about what they want through it felt as if I was experiencing these events. Well.. there's an explanation to that because I'm gay myself and to an extent I have experienced similar situations.\n\nOverall, I liked season 1. Season 2 not so much but it deepened the characters which was necessary but unfortunately it felt like the plot had kinda frozen.\n\nAnd then season 3.. well I didn't enjoy it. It focused too much on Klelia and Orestis but I really don't know why this relationship mattered that much. it felt as if the writer who is also playing Orestis just wanted more screen time for himself. A murder had happened and they didn't seem to care. \n\nAnd most importantly I didn't understand why the two boys went to the police department. I mean what for? It's as if they cancelled all the efforts of seasons 2 and 3. It also never made sense to me why Maria (Spyros' mother) did not give him some good money so he could study along with Antonis but they returned to their broke state. ",

But nothing made sense in the Cassandra Series. \n\nWhy was the house empty for 50 years. \nWhy was Cassandra evil from the beginning. \nIf the switch was fake, then Fynn didn\u2019t turn her on but she was on the whole time. \nWhy does no one tackle her, how are they afraid of a robot on wheels that can not climb stairs, just get on the stairs, she needs an elevator to follow you. \nWhy is everyone sooooo dumb. Believe your wife for once when she says something is up with the robo chique. A child listening to a robot to take a weapon and not telling their parents anything about it because a robot said so? \nThe whole story line with maggy also didn\u2019t make sense, she could have provided for her or she could have left on her own. Why did she had to die there? \nThe husband trying to kill his wife in the end, without any hesitation? Eventhough she said that she will not harm the kids? And his best soulution in an hour free walking was to get a tree and scream at a women? No stop at the hardware store or anything? Finding the powerline to the house and disabling it? \n\nI liked the style, the basic idea and the story telling. But even if the logic does not have to be perfect, it should at least make sense in its own context. But what the heck was this, and how disappointing was the end??\n\nThey could have saved the whole series by changing one little thing: When Sam was in the clinic and hallucinating her sister, they should have focused more on this talk. And after it, plottwist: it was really her fault all the time. The robot was just a robot, everything was fine, but due to the loss of her sister she turned crazy and hallucinated all of this robot stuff. Her family was really on vacation over Christmas to enjoy some peace. And she realized it in the clinic. They would have avoided all the plotholes and made it a psycho drama showing how vulnerable we are in time of crisis. Brilliant! But this? Meh ",

        "content": "In Episode 1 of Project UFO, at about the 39 minute mark, he has a bunch of poppy straw hanging on the wall.  As far as I know, this is only used for extracting opiates such as morphine.  Is anyone aware of another explanation for its use, perhaps specific to Poland?",

        "content": "Censoring passion of the christ?\n\nThere any reason why Netflix censored passion of the christ? They basically eliminated the beginning where it shows the prophecy from Isiah and since it's the same movie i don't get why they'd take the Bible verse out. It'd be like editing it for violence when it's Netflix. I'm just padding this now so it hits the required word count",
