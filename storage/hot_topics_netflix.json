        "title": "Could Guillermo Del Toro's new Frankenstein movie be a Santa Clause origin story?",
        "content": "Obviously there are spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie then stop reading.\n\nI just finished watching the 2025 Frankenstein, and the first thing that occurs to me is that it sets the Creature up perfectly to be the origin story for Santa Claus. Here are some of the reasons:\n\n* The movie ends with the Creature walking towards the north pole, which is always thought of as the remote home of Santa Claus.the Creature\n* The Creature has a good heart and just wants to help people (he cares for the family, helps the old man, and frees the ship from the ice at the end)\n* The Creature is immortal, just like Santa.\n* Furthermore, his immortality implies some sort of magic being involved (surviving an exploding stick of dynamite goes beyond scientific explanation), which could explain some of the magical aspects of Santa.\n* The Creature begins to look like Santa at the end of the movie (with a long heavy coat like Santa's). Since he doesn't want to scare people, a big hat and beard would also make sense.\n* One of the first scenes after he escapes the lab is him befriending reindeer, foreshadowing his future as Santa.\n* After that, the Creature hid during the day and only came out at night, where he would leave seemingly magical gifts for people (much like Santa leaves gifts while everyone is sleeping). The family would also leave food or other things for him (like leaving cookies for Santa).\n* Elizabeth, who shares a mutual love with the Creature, looks shockingly similar to Jessica from the 1970 movie Santa Clause is Coming to Town (both are pale with long red hair parted in the middle). This movie is a Santa Claus origin story, so it would be a clear Mrs. Claus Easter Egg if Guillermo Del Toro intentionally styled Elizabeth like Jessica.\n* Furthermore, all the Creature ever wants is someone like him to live with. Assuming he is able to eventually create such a person (maybe using the notes he found outside the lab), then this person would also be immortal and would fit perfectly as Mrs. Claus (it would also make sense that he might make this person look like his love Elizabeth).\n* Perhaps the elves are also immortal, good creatures created by the Creature (but since he always says he wants just one other person like him, maybe he made them better suited to creating toys as craftsmen).\n* The movie takes place in 1857, which is still before Santa Claus becomes a mainstream part of Christmas.\n\nEdit: changed Frankenstein to the Creature, and changed Santa Clause to Santa Claus",

        "content": "This movie is super creepy. It made me think about how women in the early 1900s used to be treated. It made me think that this is probably  how the first women who started to see through their social conditioning felt. Or any women that went agaisnt  their husbands.   It was common for women to be labeled mentally unwell, and recieve lobotomies if they did things like show anger, go agaisnt  their husbands  wishes, or step out of line with the social norms. Much like in this movie.  In the movie when the women step out of line they are labeled mentally ill, and then their brains are \"restarted\".  Women were expected to be exactly as the women in this movie are. \n\nImagine the first women in the 1940s that started to question  \"why are we house wives, why do we all dress the same, why are we servants to men, why cant we have jobs, why cant we drive , why cant we vote what is going on,  why are we given lobotomies if we show emotion or disobey our husbands\"? And then she slowly started to realize women were  being brainwashed and that women are fully capable of doing things outside of their house duties. I imagine it was much like this movie, like seeing through the simulation like social conditioning, and then being condemned by society for speaking out, and sometimes being forced to have lobotomies to make women  fall back in line with the social norms.

        "content": "I wasn\u2019t expecting much from Kevin Hart\u2019s Acting My Age. You all know the rich person comedian effect, I thought he might have had a little too much time on the golden throne to make me laugh.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect just how artfully he would illustrate how our current adult generations (and all previous generations in recent history) struggle with movement. Our current fitness education is failing our adult generations.\n\nThis critique of fitness begins in the context of a road race. Specificially, Kevin describes his challenge to and eventual 40-yard-dash against friend Stevan Ridley (former NFL player).\n\nDuring this race, Kevin tears both adductors in one leg, leaving him wheelchair bound.\n\nWhile it sounds like a silly situation typical of an eccentric character, it points to a larger issue: we want to be able to move as we get into adulthood. Humans are meant to move.\n\nHowever, we tend to disregard movement, thinking we can pick up from where we left as a child, until, of course, we try moving and injure ourselves.\n\nKevin goes on to describe the delicate nature of the human form. He talks about his sensitivity to injuring himself during basketball, and humorously identifies the sense of fear and common injury from missing a few steps and slamming your heel down the stairs.\n\nThis type of identification, characterization, and normalization of our weak adult forms highlights just how little we do to develop fitness knowledge that\u2019s accessible for our adults. Most adults stop moving around, leaving them susceptible to injury.\n\nIf we do not improve how we teach fitness to adults, our adults will continue to be fragile bodies waiting to land improperly.\n\nThanks Kevin, you hit a great point.",

        "title": "AIO for wanting to move out over a Netflix account?",
        "content": "I (17pnts) live with my stepfather (37m) and my biological mom(36) for almost 3 years now. \n\nNow for some context my biological parents are divorced and the custody battle was messy and I lived in a bad environment when I lived with my mom before. (I moved with my dad when I was around 11). I had to move out of my dad\u2019s house because he\u2019s an alcoholic and didn\u2019t treat us right, he would yell and call us names for dumb stuff. And to also note (this will become relevant) I lived with my dad with two of my other siblings, my sister \u201cKatie\u201d (currently 11) and my brother (currently 16)\n\nSo I have my own Netflix account that I pay for that only I use. My family all uses the same Netflix that my family pays for. The reason o have my own is because the one they use isn\u2019t always paid on time. And there are a lot of people in my family so I would often get kicked off of it cause there were too many people. I\u2019m not gonna ask him to pay it so I just got my own. So the other night (it was a Saturday) my stepdad called me into his room and asked if he could use my Netflix account. I said no, I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t believe I was rude or anything. He didn\u2019t say anything so I just walked away and continued what I was doing. He calls me back again and is immediately super mad. He raises his voice (not yelling but still) and calls me selfish and says I\u2019m turning into a selfish person. I start laughing (I do this when I\u2019m uncomfortable). I genuinely didn\u2019t understand what he was so mad about. He asked a question and I answered it? He was comparing me to my cousin (I don\u2019t want to speak ill of her but I\u2019m nothing like her). Then he started talking about how he feeds me and shelters me and stuff like that. Note in this argument I was upset and I did raise my voice. He just really upset me because he was yelling just like my dad, and saying I\u2019m this just like my dad. I then said that\u2019s literally your job. To feed and clothe me. You chose to be a parent. Then he actually screamed this part. That when we go to the store he doesn\u2019t have to buy me anything. I reply with: yea and that YOUR choice. I\u2019m choosing not to share this with you I\u2019m allowed to have something\u2019s to myself. At this point I\u2019m sobbing (and I haven\u2019t cried in front of any of my family sing I was like 10). He immediately backtracks seeing my and says he\u2019s sorry and that he didn\u2019t mean to upset me or lose his temper. He then comes towards me with his arms out. I say no and run into the bathroom. The only reason I didn\u2019t run to my bedroom is because the bathroom door has a lock. I then proceed to have a panic attack in the bathroom and wait 30 minutes for me to calm down and stop crying. I walk out and head straight to my room. My family has this thing where if something happens it is probably never gonna be talked about again. Like something bad or not necessarily bad, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. When I\u2019m in my room I text my friend about it and she offers for me to spend the night at her place. she knew I was having a rough time (with something u related to this) because I was crying at school on Friday. I text my step dad and ask to stay the night at her place and he says yeah. He then asks if we\u2019re good and apologizes like three times. \n\nI stay the night at my friend and get home around 6pm on Sunday. As soon as I walk in the door he tells me to sit down on the couch and that he needs to talk. So I sit down with the rest of my siblings and he starts saying that I opened his eyes yesterday. And I was right, stuff like that. He then says that he chooses to give us our technology and he is now choosing to take them away. He then (specifically to me and my siblings that lived with my dad) talks about how we make him feel like he isn\u2019t loved, because he isn\u2019t our \u201creal dad\u201d. And to be fair my sister Katie has told him he isn\u2019t her dad. But me and my brother haven\u2019t. He basically goes on for about 45 minutes and my mother pitches in too. She is clearly very upset about and is saying over and over how ungrateful we are. I tell them that I am and have been grateful ever since I moved in with them. That I chose to be there I could have stayed with my dad but I chose to move there. (Btw they used my dad as a talking point to prove they cared more basically cause they were here and he wasn\u2019t). I then said I don\u2019t understand. And another thing is that I have a \u201cchore\u201d kind of to do the dishes. When I say kind of I mean my mom mostly does them but they said I should just know when to do them. I don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s supposed to mean. Like every time the dishes are in the sink? If so I\u2019d be doing them every time I enter the kitchen. Or something else? I don\u2019t do them for these reasons. First off idk why but doing things without being told makes me over think like crazy, like idk it just makes me anxious, it\u2019s super weird. Second if I were to do them I already know somebody would have something to say about it \u201coh you\u2019re cleaning\u201d. Or something dumb like that. And my parents would say stuff like that too, not just my siblings. I know I shouldn\u2019t care but I would be thinking about that the whole time. 3rd I actually hate doing the dishes so much, I would much rather scrub the toilet than do them. Something about touching wet food and where other peoples mouths have been really like freaks me out. 4th (this is the last one I swear) I\u2019m just a kid and I\u2019m  exaughsted  after being at school and basketball after, the lady thing I want to do when I get home is dishes. Ok so when I said I don\u2019t understand he said: you don\u2019t know when to put the dishes away. I didn\u2019t say anything because he was right and because I didn\u2019t know how to explain why I was actually confused because I was so upset. He takes away just me and my younger sisters and brothers stuff not the other 4 kids who were sitting on the couch as well. I went to my room and just cried myself to sleep. \n\nSo am I overreacting? \nWhat should I do? I\u2019m just confused because if I was in trouble for the Netflix thing why were my other two siblings punished as well? And if it was about chores why didn\u2019t he punish all my siblings? (All my siblings don\u2019t do their chores not just me). ",

Setting language and subtitle to english...as a matter of fact, my profile setting has always been English- i had to change subtitles back from Chinese to english.\n\n2. Reload or refresh or quit netflix after setting english...still the same.\n\n3. My netflix app does the same thing.\n\n4. It naturally defaults to english subtitles when there isn't a Chinese subtitle option... \n\n  \nI dont know what else to do ... any suggestions?",

        "content": "While viewing Netflix on my phone today I noticed that the FX show Archer was in my list which I thought was weird because I know Archer was removed from Netflix earlier this month on the 12th. When I got home I went to turn it on my home tv but was confused to see it did not show up anywhere and when I searched it, the show was not there. My partner checked his phone and even more confusingly, it was not available for viewing on his phone despite all of our devices being on the same account. After checking all of our other tvs we were able to determine that it was only the Netflix on my phone that was showing this show as available despite them all being the same Netflix account. I also notice that several other shows that I do not think are currently available on Netflix are showing up, only on my phone, such as weeds, the office and superstore. All of them work and include all of the released seasons of these shows. Can anyone explain this to me? How am I seeing shows that are not available on Netflix through Netflix??",

That was just Netlix but there are countless more examples on HBO and Prime\n\nI tried p!rate sites but I can't watch a movie with corn poppping up every 5 minutes mid screen. So can anybody tell me why this is? Why can't Netflix/HBO/Prime Video just give us the full shows? \nPlease be understanding, I don't have much knowledge about this",
