It's a good length too - long enough to tell a story spanning some years, but not so long you don't ever want to see another race.",

        "content": "I went into Netflix\u2019s new dating show excited because of the premise, but also because I\u2019d been following Logan for a while on social media. She seemed like an accomplished researcher, author and advisor to companies like Hinge which is so cool. I\u2019ve also heard some of her original sound bites on dating that seemed mostly decent. \n\nHowever I was a bit let down by her appearance on the show. First of all, I felt she had very little personality. She came off as quite meek, and bland, and if anything, the participants facilitated the scenes and kept things energized. \n\nI also felt like her coaching moments were a mixed watch - some were insightful and effective, but others were lacking, and others came off as even a bit abrasive. \nFor example, there were many dates that went relatively well and had good potential, but the participant wrote it off quickly. This isn\u2019t uncommon in modern dating. But as a coach, Logan just agreed with the dater, rather than maybe challenging them to try one more - and I think this caused some people to lose out on connections that could have developed a bit more time. \nOr another example - she tore into the lady with the big glasses - attacking her glasses choice and also telling her that her personality is too big. IMO Logan, as a coach, could have more gently engaged with the lady, rather than potentially making her self-conscious and feel put-down. It also just seemed odd to me to target her fashion choice, when the woman clearly puts in soooo much effort and presents herself thoughtfully. It\u2019s not like on Queer Eye when a makeover is part of the deal.\n\nI think Logan is a smart lady! But I think she might be better suited for research\u2026or for consulting on a show like this - with someone more charismatic in the spotlight (this is national tv after all).\n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts?\n",

Him then being taken to a hotel as if that woman wasn\u2019t also part of it (so obvious). The ending felt rushed. Like the whole thing just got-bizarro. I did however feel like it was creepy because of the fact that AI can morph into this all knowing/controlling thing which I think is very real and we are clearly heading in that direction, if not there already. The beginning with the little girl listening to the show instructing her to go outside, we have that now with these crazy ass YouTube shows \u201cfor kids\u201d.

It's says the new device is a mobile browser and I get the email within seconds of going to app on phone. I'm not worried that someone got my password or I'm being hacked. Just wondering if this is happening to anyone else.",
