        "content": "So I have two tv's, a PS5, and my phone with netflix. All on the same network. The tv's are on wifi and the PS5 is on ethernet. We normally have one or two going at the same time. I have three profiles but all on one account. Our problem is that occasionally one device will say it isn't a part of my household and then I'd be prompted to update my household list (again). So.. I'll check the network, still connected to the one and only router in the house, and do the update anyway. Then, a few days later, another device (on the household list) will pop the same issue. This has been going on for a while and I've been constantly having to update the list on each device when it happens. I'd really appreciate some help with this as it's getting to be such a hassle. Maybe I'm missing something about screens on netflix or something? I have no idea. But if anyone knows about or has gone through similar, any info on this would be awesome. Thanks!",

        "content": "I might or might not be the only person who had the Guten Morgen, Sonnenschein song by Nana Mouskouri\u00a0stuck for days in my head. I surely went over to Youtube to play it over and over again until I learnt the lyrics. But then I noticed something intriguing. The song Cassandra used to sing every morning to wake up the Prill family was released in 1977, and Cassandra allegedly was disconnected by a power overrose the day she saw her family die in 1972. Not sure if it was a mistake from the crew or was intentionally chosen...which makes the whole plot a bit more dark to me, thinking about what happened during those years from which she could have learned the song.\n\nI mean if we think about the fact that she was able to turn on and off by herself, I assume Flynn moving the switch on episode 1 had little to no influence in her awakening, also I'm still skeptic about his mechanical abilities fixing the humanoid robot, he was a remarkable student but his hobbies were more artistic. Also we know so little about Margarethe and her time in \"captivity\", and we know nothing about what happened with Birgit and the baby. On top the way Cassandra immediately assumed the personality of an \"AI\" smart house when she was awaken rather than explaining her situation, and her immediate transformation into the antagonist that wanted to get rid of Samira to take over her family was to me always lacking a little bit on the character developing area.\n\nThe impact of betrayal, loss, and trauma can be profound and may lead to extreme emotions and behaviors. However, the transformation into someone with a desire to harm others usually involves a more extended period of psychological change. The transformation from experiencing trauma to becoming a villain is a complex process and rarely happens overnight, so that was the only part that didn't quite fit to me in Cassandra's redemption arch of the series. But if this is a hint of some background story happening in between the 1972 and the present days, this could eventually provide an explanation to this and all plot holes and doubts we were left with. What do you think? Is this just a mistake or a hint to a season 2?\n\nTL,DR: The good morning song Cassandra sings was released in 1977 and she disconnected in 1972. Is this a hint to a possible season 2 that fills up plot holes or just a mistake from the crew?",

        "content": "Belle Gibson\u2019s actions\u2014falsely claiming to have cured her cancer through natural remedies and profiting from those lies\u2014were certainly unethical and deceptive. However, she was never criminally charged in Australia. Instead, she faced civil penalties under consumer law. \n\nAnd why didn't Apple and Penguin sue her? \n\nHere\u2019s why criminal charges were not pursued in Australia:\n\n1. Civil vs. Criminal Law \u2013 Gibson\u2019s conduct was primarily treated as a violation of consumer law rather than criminal fraud. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) pursued her under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) for misleading and deceptive conduct.\n2. Burden of Proof in Criminal Cases \u2013 For criminal fraud charges, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she knowingly and intentionally deceived people for financial gain. While morally clear, legally, this can be more complex.\n3. Consumer Law Penalties \u2013 In 2017, the Federal Court found Gibson guilty of misleading consumers and fined her $410,000 for false health claims and failing to donate promised proceeds to charity. This was seen as a sufficient legal response.\n4. No Individual Criminal Complaints \u2013 Fraud charges often require direct victims to make formal complaints. While many people felt deceived, there wasn\u2019t a widespread push for criminal prosecution.\n5. Lack of Specific Criminal Charges \u2013 Australian law does have fraud provisions, but proving criminal intent and harm at a level warranting prosecution may have been difficult.\n\nSo while her actions seemed fraudulent in a moral sense, legally, authorities chose a civil route rather than criminal charges. \n\nWould you have preferred a criminal case? \n\nI would !

        "content": "I just realized that I can't access Netflix while traveling as I get the error \"your account can't be used in this location\". On reaching out to customer support, I was told that I need to restart the account such that the subscription will be based on the country I am in. However, once I do that, my account won't be accessible in my home country where I originally created the account. My account is a shared account and this is a weird policy. What is the point of having a shared account with multiple screens and all if Netflix enforces such policies. ",
