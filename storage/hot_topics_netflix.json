This show takes the deadpan to a whole new level - everybody gives absolute knock-out performances, and the seriousness with which they deliver some of the best one-liners in Netflix history is just so fun to watch. I'm on episode 6 and I just got to Randall Park saying \"His name is Fgwlpskr Pif\" and I'm just losing it. I'm glad this isn't a background show for me because I know I'd be missing the point of it all ... a lot of the humor is nonverbal and in the pauses and cuts so it's been way better to watch it straight up. \n\nConsider giving this show a watch - it's been a real banger. Heck of a cast and they all seem to play well off of one another. ",

And then he had the nerve to go into debt, dragging his wife's finances down with him, just so his mother could continue living this lavish lifestyle (which, let\u2019s be honest, he enjoyed too). I could understand if she was struggling and he was helping with healthcare or basic needs, but no\u2014this was pure greed, and his wife was left alone in a foreign country, raising a newborn with no support.\n\nI get that being abandoned as a kid messed him up, and getting his mum back was a big deal for him. But let\u2019s not pretend her\u00a0*money*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a huge factor in his decisions. And then at the end of the documentary, he had the nerve to say,\u00a0*\u201cMy real family are my mates who stuck by me through my worst times.\u201d*\u00a0(that felt like a direct dig at his wife) Like\u2026 excuse me?

        "content": "Firstly I don't understand why some people are so fixated on the bullying storyline, when it's a story of all the different forces that create violence in teens. Stephen Graham's explanation that he thought about the phrase \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and therefore we've all failed (in the face of rising teen knife crime in the UK) is so clear.\n\nBut did others think it was clear that Jamie made worse comments to Katie than what we learn?\n\nWhat we know is that Jamie received nude photos of Katie, asked her out, she said \"I'm not that desperate\" (this part rang true and I think was meant to feel that way) and then she left comments on his IG implying he's an incel.\n\nTo me, it felt obvious that when Jamie was talking to the psychologist, he left out part of the conversation. He praises himself for being nice to Katie but admits he thought she was at a weak and vulnerable moment. My interpretation was that when she turned him down, he most likely said something about how no-one else would want her now her nudes had been shared. Especially since we know about his anger outbursts. It was these comments that made her post the emojis on his Insta. I thought it was important that her comments aren't about him being ugly or unpopular - which he sees as his biggest issue - but they specifically call out his attitude to women. And DI Bascombe misses the point a second time when his conclusion is \"So Katie was bullying Jamie?\"\n\nAs a fairly online woman, that was where my mind instantly went. It's such a common pattern: misogynist shows woman positive attention, woman turns him down (politely, kindly or not), misogynist shows his true colours. \n\n",

One time was fine, I just logged myself back in, but now when I do *any* action (and I mean any: typing in the search bar, trying to watch a show, changing profiles, etc.), I get immediately logged out.\n\nI tried one solution that I read where you cleared your cookies (sometimes there's a weird caching issue that Netflix doesn't like, I'm not sure exactly, I don't work in web development), but that didn't fix it. Just in case there was a \"too many logged-in devices\" issue or something, I got rid of all the ones I haven't touched in at least 2 or more weeks as well.\n\nFor some reference, I'm using the Librewolf browser on a Windows 11 system. (Librewolf is just Firefox, if you don't want to look it up.)\n\nAny help with this would be appreciated, if you can! I'm patient. And if you need any more information, I'll answer accordingly :)",

        "title": "Squid Game Season 3 Might Be About the Danger of Black-and-White Thinking \u2014 And We\u2019re Already Falling Into It",
        "content": "**TL;DR:**\nSquid Game is not a good vs evil story. It\u2019s about people losing their way in a dehumanizing system. The real danger isn\u2019t choosing the wrong side \u2014 it\u2019s thinking there are only two sides to begin with.\n\u2014\u2014\n\n**I think one of the big themes in Season 3 will be the dangers of black-and-white thinking \u2014 and how dehumanising people, even \u201cvillains,\u201d leads to destruction.**\n\nIn a recent post, I talked about how fans often miss the point of Squid Game by trying to label characters as either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d \u2014 Gi-hun as the hero, In-ho as the villain. But the show seems to be building toward a much deeper critique: the real danger is in *thinking that way at all.*\n\n\u2e3b\n\n**1. The Problem with the \u201cHero\u201d Box \u2013 Gi-hun**\n\nGi-hun is flawed from the start \u2014 an addict, a liar, a bad father. Yet we excuse his actions because we *want* him to be good. We see him as the \u201chero,\u201d so we overlook how:\n\t\u2022\tHe started dehumanising others (like hoping for more O deaths in S2).\n\t\u2022\tHe sacrifices innocent people without their knowledge or consent.\n\t\u2022\tHe begins to resemble the VIPs \u2014 gambling with human lives, just with different intentions.\n\nJust like with &gt;!Daenerys in Game of Thrones!&lt;, people don\u2019t notice when \u201cheroes\u201d start crossing moral lines \u2014 because our boundaries shift along with them. That\u2019s dangerous. When we idolize someone, we stop holding them accountable \u2014 and sometimes follow them too far down a dark path.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n**2. The Danger of the \u201cVillain\u201d Box \u2013 In-ho and Beyond**\n\nOn the flip side, calling someone a villain or a monster (like In-ho) erases their humanity. And that has real-world consequences:\n\t\u2022\tWe stop trying to understand *why* they became who they are \u2014 missing opportunities to prevent others from following the same path.\n\t\u2022\tWe start justifying harm or cruelty toward them, feeling morally superior the entire time.\n\nDehumanizing someone can start with wishing something minor (\u201cI hope they stub their toe\u201d) \u2014 but it escalates. If your moral compass shifts enough, you might find yourself condoning violence, even death. That\u2019s how hate radicalizes. And ironically, that\u2019s exactly what In-ho does to the players.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Season 3 Might Be Warning Us About Both Extremes\n\nI don\u2019t think Season 3 will tell us whose worldview is *right* \u2014 Gi-hun or In-ho. Instead, I think it\u2019s showing us how **both extremes can lead to darkness**:\n\t\u2022\tSeeing yourself as the hero = You stop questioning your own actions.\n\t\u2022\tSeeing others as villains = You become the thing you claim to hate.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to pick a side. It\u2019s to **stay human** in a system designed to strip that away.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhat do you think? Are we already watching Gi-hun slide down the path he\u2019s fighting against?\n",

        "content": "I recently noticed over the last few months that whenever I open my home page on Netflix there is a huge mobile ad. Am i wrong to get very mad at this fact? I pay a lot of money for the most expensive plan that specifically lists \"Watch advert-free\".\n\nIn general I'm totally cool with ads if a service is free, but as a regular paying client, a term that's supposed to be very valuable to companies this feels like a major slap in the face, and if this does not change within a month I will cancel my membership within a month.\n\nFIX THIS NOW NETFLIX!",

        "title": "the show adolescence isn't saying men=bad",
        "content": "I've seen a lot of men on different subs arguing about how the new show Adolescence with Owen Cooper is anti-male. However, I think this is very false. \n\nJamie (played by Owen Cooper) does not become evil overnight; he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online communities. There are many times in the show where I sympathized with Jamie, given that he is just a 13-year-old boy. I think that societal expectations regarding men showing their emotions led Jamie to struggle with emotional repression, which caused him to lash out when he was rejected. And before you say \"he was bullied\", I don't think he was. Jamie asked Katie out when he knew she would be vulnerable, and then she just called him out on it. As someone who was bullied as a kid, bullying is more repetitive. from the show, It just seemed like she had \"bullied\" him this one time. The show more urges people to create better support systems for young men so they learn how to manage their emotions rather than just saying men are bad. \n\nBasically, the moral of the story is to make sure that you are teaching your boys how to show their emotions in a healthy way, ask for help, and learn how to handle rejection. I think this show did an excellent job examining how online spaces can radicalize young boys and how its important to understand the challenges they face like internalizing emotions.",
