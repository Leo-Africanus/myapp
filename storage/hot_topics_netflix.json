        "content": "Back when I first saw Enemy of the State , it felt like over-the-top Hollywood paranoia, all satellites following you in real time, phone taps in seconds, every move tracked which is very typical of the entertainment industry. Watching it again last night it feels way less like science fiction and way more like a Tuesday.  \n  \nThe wild part is we don\u2019t even need spy satellites anymore. We hand over our locations to apps 24/7, leave microphones in our homes, and carry around devices that log everywhere we\u2019ve been. Add in data brokers, security cameras on every corner, and facial recognition in half the apps we use, and you\u2019ve basically got the same surveillance net the movie warned about. Made me super anxious last night about my own data, I don't get spam calls much but I get lots of promotional offers in my mail from places I haven't even heard of. Data gets sold online all the time and it's probably in the subscription agreement if anyone ever read it but is there a way to take these off for sure? It's the internet and nothing truly gets deleted but at least make it less visible. Would appreciate anyone knowing more than I do to tell me how I could try and track and maybe delete my data online.",

There are numerous silly subplots that go literally nowhere.\n\nI fell like I'm watching random scenes from kids movies about summer camp and school, except the dialogue was better in the shows that focused on 7-year olds.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible, it's convoluted and everyone talks like a try-hard emo.\n\nNot to mention the constant exposition, is the target audience persons suffering from loss of short-term memory?\n\nIt is atrocious, I want to like it but it is a burning file of poo.",

But we're both from Toronto and thought it was cool the director was from there. I myself like art as well.\n\nAfter watching film, it was easy to follow, fun movie. Not heavy on plotline but animations, colours, music was pretty awesome.\n\nLooking into the history and BTS of the film was what really caught me (hence sharing article). So much respect for the teamwork, thought and intention.\n\nFelt like it's a milestone for many of us who didn't make it in something but the alternative path brought us towards something we'd never imagined. Overcoming our battles and demons and bringing in a new version of ourselves.\n\nSo glad for this film's success and everyone involved \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nP.s. yes you should watch this masterpiece \ud83d\udc4c",

        "content": "I found Four Seasons entertaining and liked all of the characters but it left me very depressed on how older women were portrayed. Is this how life after fifty goes? \nFirst,  we have Nick leave his very sweet, pretty wife so he can relive his youth. I wasn\u2019t  hoping for a Betty Broderick type reaction from Ann but the whole situation seemed very unrealistic. That divorce would drag on and on and she wouldn\u2019t have carte blanch to his credit cards. So Nick, who doesn\u2019t seem that rich, attracts the young girl and what does he do? He gets her pregnant. Is midnight feedings more fun than Ann\u2019s midnight video games?\nMaybe I just liked Ann too much because here is Nick with this attractive young blond and who does Ann attract? Not the hot surf instructor but instead a bald, wrinkled up weirdo. This is when I said you know I don\u2019t think I really like where this show is headed. \nNow Nick dies, the show is finally picking up in the karma department and surprise, surprise, poor Ann is saddled with planning his funeral. Why doesn\u2019t his adult daughter, who is falling all over new girl friend within six hours of knowing her, plan the funeral. \nEvery time young girlfriend Ginny fiddled with her necklace I was furious. It\u2019s not like it was an engagement ring. I really disliked how easy breezy these May December romances can be. \nI guess Liz Lemon\u2019s character was the most realistic but the frumpy bathing suit was annoying. Come on Liz, we know there\u2019s a great body under there and you don\u2019t need to wear long sleeve suits. Fine you don\u2019t want sun burn but juxtaposed next to Ginny\u2019s matching bikini, the message seemed to be, over fifty women need to cover up their bodies. More evidence of this was poor Ann\u2019s beach outfit choices and she looked pretty hot in that wedding dress so what gives with the caftan? \nSo I don\u2019t think I will be watching season two, especially if it includes poor Ann babysitting Nicks love child. \ud83e\udd2e\n",

I know this is a horrible example picture but its the best I could capture compared her to usual (lovely) face. Has anyone else noticed this?",

No spoilers but half into the 2nd episode I\u2019m bored. \n\nHouse MD on the other hand - some interesting characters introduced every episode and houses resident doctors make up for the show. Not sure why Netflix is unable to make the good content again. ",

        "content": "I know the movie is set decades ago but watching someone pull off that level of identity theft with nothing but charm and some paperwork is wild. It made me wonder how much easier it would be today with everything being online.\n\nBack then you had to forge documents and physically be somewhere to make the scam work. Now with social media, data leaks and people oversharing, you could probably impersonate someone you have never met just by piecing together public information. Name, address, phone number, old photos, even their signature if they have posted it somewhere (I myself have never changed my phone number or email, I imagine I'm in every database online). The scary part is how official everything can look. A scammer could set up fake accounts, fake email domains, fake phone numbers, and most people would not even think twice if the message looked professional. If someone had enough of your personal data they could probably pass as you with your bank, insurance, or even your employer. That's why I'm using Cloaked just to stay safe because I'm spiraling into all of this modern day privacy stuff and it's scaryyy. \n\nI know there is places you can buy data but is there any software or method to help with this stuff? I'd like to know your opinions or advice.",
