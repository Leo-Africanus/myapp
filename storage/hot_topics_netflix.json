Or did Netflix just scroll through creators on insta and say, \u201cYou look okay, congrats, you\u2019re now an actor\u201d? The acting felt like a bunch of people who\u2019d never been in front of a camera before\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the dialogue. It\u2019s like the script was written in TikTok comment sections. Nobody actually talks like that in real life  Hearing those lines come out of their mouths was physically painful, like they were trying to make TikTok slang happen, but no just stop this aint it.\n\njust cast actual actors next time. And get a script that sounds like it was written by humans and not an algorithm trying to go viral. And everyone is suddenly gay and bisexual on a korean school? How unrealistic\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 is netflix just trying to check the lgbt boxes or something???",

        "content": "I have two 4K TV's (LG &amp; Samsung) and Netflix's Premium plan (4K). Both are connected to the Internet by Wi-fi (I do not have the possibility to connect via cable).\n\nThe issue - both TV's are constantly stuck on 1080p quality. I do not think Internet connection is an issue - I have a very fast fiber-optic internet. I ran a speedtest and it shows 413mb/s download / 103mb/s upload. I ran a test of the internet stability directly on the Netflix app and it shows 44mb/s and 139mb/s on each TV. As I understand Netflix help-guidelines, they require a minimum of 15mb/s to run 4K media.\n\nDuring playing the TV displays the Internet speed at 0,95mb/s or 1,95mb/s depending on the TV, which is drastically low and in no way in line with my actual internet speed. I have changed the quality from automatic to highest in Netflix account settings, but no change. Both TV's have no issue playing 4K media on YouTube, I did not check other platforms yet.\n\nWhat's most interesting is that I had no problem obtaining 4K quality on Netflix on a much slower fixed wireless internet that I had previously (actual download speed was around 1mb/s, I do not remember the upload speed there).\n\nCould you please advise what could be the issue?

I also, do not want any scary images popping up and scaring our 2 year old. Any tips for Disney plus, prime video, Netflix and Gem. \n\nThank you in advanced.
