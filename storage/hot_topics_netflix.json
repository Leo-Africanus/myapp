        "title": "Is cinema dying?",
        "content": "I think yes, cinema is dying because people don't like to go there anymore, it doesn't resonate enough compared to the past. There are plenty of reasons, such as rising prices of tickets, streaming services, and more. But we still need to go to the theater for its collective experiences. The shared laugh and shocking factors motivate us to attend movie theaters despite their high ticket prices or simply to keep up the trend. According to history, cinema has provided a major dominance for media experiences; a big screen was an innovative thing for people to view. However, this doesn't resonate with our current status anymore. Everything is provided on screens with endless content, reinforcing the reason not to attend the cinema anymore. Streaming services provide comfort and even cheaper price than the cinema but endless comfort. From the perspective of Cinema, they are trying their best to operate the cinema to compete with streaming services such as ODEON, providing a monthly subscription with endless movies. Well, this strategy doesn\u2019t seem as efficient as it thinks; people are still not attending movies as much as the cinema companies intended. Moreover, movies are not as entertaining as before because the film industries are making sequels to prequels to gain a safety net of profit in box office revenue. Hollywood is literally operated in risk reduction nowadays, to avoid risk as much as possible. This behavior creates a lack of original content that people are demanding. However, maybe we are seeing the fade of cinema as nostalgic sadness because it is full of memories. But why do we still need cinema? People still demand cinema, because of its collective experiences, just like people go to a restaurant.\n\nFor cinema to thrive again, it should reconsider its historical pattern of how cinema counterattacked and learn from its threats. First of all, the appearance of television in the 1940s was a major threat to the film industry, and cinema counter-responded with bigger screens and a spectacle experience, where it created IMAX and Dolby Atmos. For the home video era, the response was blockbusters to overcome the quality of home experiences and increase the need for cinema attendance. For the streaming age, the threat is major due to the unlimited content provided with matchable quality. The convenience and binge culture are major standouts for streaming to dominate the media culture. But how are cinema responding? They are trying to enhance and promote the theatrical experience as much as possible, but it is not as much. I believe there should be technological breakdowns, such as Virtual reality, Artificial Intelligence, and sensory technologies, equipped in theatrical experiences. Unless Cinema stands as a major cultural and technological dominance in the ever-growing competitive environment.\n\n",

        "title": "Rewatching Stranger Things Season 4 made me realize that we lost the battle to win the war.",
        "content": "Most of us view the Season 4 finale as a tragedy. Max died (technically), the gates opened and Hawkins fell. It seemed like the heroes were finally outmatched. However, rewatching\u00a0*The Piggyback*\u00a0and\u00a0*Papa*\u00a0suggests that failure was actually a necessary setup. Season 4 served as a schematic of Vecna\u2019s battery rather than just a horror story.\n\nThe most significant line in Season 4 came from Dr Brenner. When explaining Henry\u2019s powers, he stated that Henry consumes his victims. They are not simply gone. They remain part of him.\n\nWe treated this as a throwaway horror line, but it is the key mechanic of the entire series. Vecna is absorbing consciousness to build a hive mind of souls. This means his greatest strength is also his fatal flaw. He has thousands of people trapped inside his head.\n\nIn the Season 4 finale, Eleven tried to save Max by piggybacking into her mind. She fought Vecna on his turf and fought defensively. She tried to be a shield. That failed because you cannot out-power Henry in his own domain.\n\nHowever, the loss established a crucial rule. Eleven can enter the mind of someone Vecna has consumed.\n\nThis brings us to Volume 2 and the confirmed episode title\u00a0*Escape from Camazotz*.\n\nWe know from Volume 1 that Max and Holly are trapped in that mind-layer. Everyone worries about Eleven fighting her way in to get them. We might be looking at this backward. The Season 4 defeat placed a virus directly inside Vecna\u2019s operating system.\n\nMax is not just a victim waiting to be saved. She is a bomb waiting to go off.\n\n*Running Up That Hill*\u00a0became the anthem of the season for a specific reason. The lyrics speak about making a deal with God to swap places. This foreshadows the strategy for the finale.\n\nEleven and Max might need to switch roles. In the past, El protected Max physically. Now, Max is the one positioned to strike from the inside while El holds the line on the outside. The song told us the plan all along.\n\nThis leads to the letters. Max wrote letters to everyone, including Steve, Dustin and her mom, just in case. She never read them. Those letters are a weapon that has not been fired yet.\n\nIn Volume 2, those letters will likely serve as the totem that wakes Max up inside Vecna\u2019s mind. Unlike Billy, who needed El to remind him of who he was, Max has her own anchor ready.\n\nSeason 4 had to end in defeat so that Max could be consumed. It was the only way to get an agent behind enemy lines. In the finale, El will likely not defeat Vecna with telekinesis alone. She will trigger the souls inside him to revolt. The piggyback was the rehearsal. The real plan is a mutiny from the inside out.",

There were moments where the dynamic came off as childish yet oddly overbearing, like a push-and-pull that never quite lands as playful or loving. Instead of feeling warm or endearing, it often felt tense and unsettling.\n\nWhat made it more jarring was the contrast, this is someone known for control, precision, and authority, yet the relationship on screen felt emotionally clumsy and strangely unbalanced. It didn\u2019t read as healthy banter or confident love, but more like two people stuck in a loop of immaturity masked as affection.\n\nOf course, editing plays a role, and we never see the full picture. But what was shown felt surprisingly raw in a way that raised eyebrows, not because it was honest, but because it seemed normalized despite how uncomfortable it came across.\n\nCurious if anyone else felt the same watching it.",
