By doing that jaime doesn\u2019t know how to regulate his feelings so he holds it in and lashes out when the pressure becomes too much.

        "content": "# FIRST, It Wasn't That Bad\n\nWe have to give credit where it's due for developing an original franchise with a mostly unique story. We don't get a ton of film sequels from Netflix, so I'm glad thidls looks like it's shaping up to be a trilogy. \n\nThat said, I think they could've done better on a few points. I think they overplayed the healing ability. I think dumping us straight into action was different and brave, but the time skip to a fully formed team was a little jarring, and I think they missed out on what makes \"immortal\" films interesting--but more on that later. \n\nMost of the action was good, let's be honest here. Solid sequences, great cast, and I can't say any single performance was *bad,* per se. After all, the actors can only work with that they were given. \n\nThe story fell a little short because what makes immortal films interesting is the back story. So we get Discord dropped into the mix with zero backstory. We get Tuah dropped in. Tuah's decision to never tell Andy about Discord isn't entirely clear. Why wouldn't Discord have reached out after Tuah saved Andy? Why is Nile \"the last immortal?\" Is their power genetic (as the first film suggested) or magic (a blade strike from *The Destroyer* says \"eff those genetics\"). \n\nI feel like they chased an idea before fully fleshing it out, and now we're kinda stuck on this path. \n\nMonday morning quarterbacking is always easy. But what ia a shitty Internet review without one? \n\nI think within the immortal genre \"going back\" is very common... Think, Highlander.\n\nPerhaps an interesting place to take the story might be the future. What if, perhaps in a spin-off show, Nile really is the last. She lives quietly, alone, for thousands of years believing she is the last until a \"new generation\" of immortals emerge. We learn about her history (still our future) through her recounting to her protege, her path through time. Ultimately giving said protege the lesson of the dangers of \"corrupt\" immortals, setting him/her on a journey through space and time to defend the galaxy against the threat. \n\n",

        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nWhen I first watched the show, upon episode 6, when Carl and Akram go into questioning Fergus about the investigation, he was beaten by some guy.\n\nWhen Carl returns to the precinct, he pulls over and the camera then stays for a full frame on this dark red Mercedes slowing down and then stopping after his Ford.\nFor me this was not some useless detail because it seemed the camera followed this car on purpose, also it caught my eye because it was the same color as Carl's car. \n\nI found it quite bizarre and decided to remember this bit if it comes back later.\nFor me, this car seemed to have followed Carl. Especially after Fergus told them that he was beaten by someone who they suspect is hurting him for cooperating with the investigation.\nThis seemed very odd.\n\nThen episode 9, revelation : we see Ailsa, Lyle's mother, trying to run away on the ferry with the same burgundy red Mercedes. The license plate matches the one following Carl in ep 6. So it was the same Mercedes who stopped behind Carl. It's not possible to see exactly who the driver is... \n\nSo I'm just wondering :\n* Do you think Lyle and his mother were following Carl and Akram during their investigation?\n* Were they the one hurting Fergus to silence him?\n* What this not extremely stupid since \"Sam\" was supposed to be dead? Being caught still alive is risky? \n\nMy take is that it must have been Lyle following Carl but it throws everything upside down knowing that Lyle was following the investigation... \nLyle has the capabilities to spy and stalk since he did that to Merritt. (like the scene where he is behind the window watching from outside before William, Merritt's brother sees him and  screams, to later recognize him on the boat).\nHe was also not always guarding Merritt and not always on the island, her mother did most of the job of keeping her enclosed.\nSo maybe, he was spending his time following Carl?\nBut for what? Taking this chance of being discovered is for me really risky, what is the point? \nAlso, if you're a cop, normally you can spot someone tailing you. \n\nDid you also catch this detail or is this new to you ?\n\nLet me know, I'd love to hear your theories! :) ",

Many of you probably like it or have adjusted to it, as Netflix\u2019s own research would suggest, but I could not. I tried, I really tried. \n\nA discussion on the drawbacks of the interface has been exhausted so I will not get into it. What I would add is that I noticed that I have been recently spending more time on Apple TV and HuLu. Not out of stubbornness or revenge, but it came organically. The interface of all three platforms is now very similar with the Netflix one being mid pack. I can no longer tell the difference so I would watch whatever is good. I think the new Netflix interface is an opportunity for other streaming platforms to catch up with Netflix and get new subscribers. It might also be the beginning of Netflix\u2019s decline or at best plateau.",

        "content": "\n\nRecommendation for a TV show where a person imagines a relationship with someone. As if they are in a serious relationship, but they are not. But not Baby Reindeer, that's what I watched, and I would like something darker and more twisted. It doesn't even have to be a relationship, but a series where a person has his OWN REALITY that has nothing to do with real life.\n\n\n\nSPOILERS!!! \n\nLike Emma Beesly in Clicbait",
