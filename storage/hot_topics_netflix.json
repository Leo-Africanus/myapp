        "content": "I just binge watched Tell Me Lies seasons 1 and 2 over the last two days, and I honestly don\u2019t know how to process what I\u2019m feeling right now.\nBy the end of season 2, I felt physically sick. Like genuinely nauseous, sweating, head pounding, stomach turning. I\u2019ve never had a show affect me like this before. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cwow that was intense\u201d, it felt disgusting, suffocating, and overwhelming in a way I can\u2019t even properly describe.\nI hate Stephen. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever hated a fictional character this much. He\u2019s manipulative, toxic, emotionally abusive, and watching him operate felt draining and disturbing. But what hurts even more is Lucy. Watching her repeatedly abandon her self respect, excuse his behavior, and spiral deeper just made me angry and sad at the same time. It\u2019s frustrating in a way that feels personal.\nHonestly, I can\u2019t even name many \u201cgood\u201d characters in this show. The only one who felt remotely decent to me was Wrigley. He\u2019s messed up too, sure, but compared to everyone else, he didn\u2019t actively destroy people the way the others did.\nThe worst part is the show is captivating. The writing, the tension, the way it pulls you in\u2026 it works. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard. I went in planning to watch all three seasons eventually, but after finishing season 2, I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t continue. I don\u2019t care how good the plot is.\nMy mental health feels wrecked right now. I\u2019ve got a headache, my chest feels tight, I can\u2019t breathe properly, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to eat for at least a day. I know it\u2019s \u201cjust a show,\u201d but the emotional weight of it hit way harder than I expected.\nI just needed to get this out somewhere because this reaction scared me.\nHas anyone else felt this messed up after watching it? Or am I alone in this?",

There\u2019s so much potential and depth in them (ex. Glitch, Dead to me, The end of the fucking world, playing Gracie darling, ratched, you get the point) that would put them as high as like vampire diaries and supernatural. Netflix doesn\u2019t really have a Long series, like AMC and Hulu. Unless they mark Stranger things as one if it continues that long. It\u2019s just so sad, these writers have potential and deserve their whole story to produced. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why Netflix is taking such AMAZING ideas and just cutting it short. Multiple short stories doesn\u2019t equal out to the long insanely amazing shows, and if it\u2019s for money? That would be stupid right? Cos they would make so much more money, continuing these fascinating series. \n\nI feel Netflix has gone down hill after Stranger things, and 13 reasons why, those were their star shows. I would include Arcane, but that has just recently become a thing. They could have so many good long ass shows. But they just don\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t make sense to as why :(",

        "content": "First off I just want to say these people are insane as fuck but what really made me want to come type on here was the last 2 episodes where they spoke on fucking Jamison Bachman, a serial squatter, he would find roommates to live with (eventually created a fake name Jed) and after a while stop helping with the rent. He was also very educated when it came to law stuff, so every time they wanted to have a protection order against him and things like that, he ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS found a way to flip it on them, to the point where a couple of them would lose their own apartment to him!! Eventually he met his match and a girl had him sent to jail a couple times, his fucking brother bailed him out each time and I never knew why! Next thing you know, he kills his brother !! I think he had some sort of grudge or anger towards his brother, I\u2019m not sure what it is I just know that his older brother became more successful then him. But he gets locked up for his murder, then fucking kills hangs him self before he really even got sentenced in 2017. He put these people through wayyyy too much to to sit there and cop out on life, he was evil as fuck . I usually don\u2019t care too much when people kill themselves while waiting for their sentencing the way he did, but he was the lastttttt person to sit and have the opportunity to cop out on life the way he did. He was a smart psycho",
