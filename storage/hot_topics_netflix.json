It's the sort of thing someone with schizophrenia might say.\n\nAnyway I was just surprised not to see a single mini article mention it, or to see anyone mention it in the breakdown threads after her win.

        "content": "I came in all ready to hate Bryan but I\u2019m just not seeing it. I finished episode 1 and so far he\u2019s been chill. She\u2019s rolling her eyes, she\u2019s snipping at him, and she won\u2019t get off her damn phone. \n\nI know she was killed and he\u2019s supposed to be a monster but I haven\u2019t seen him do anything even remotely out of line in these videos. If he was ever frustrated I could understand, she never puts down her camera, it\u2019s all film, film, film. That would annoy the hell out of me, but we never see him raise his voice, make faces at her, or appear angry. It\u2019s all her. \n\nI\u2019m just surprised by how he\u2019s been painted and what I\u2019m seeing. I believe all women, I always give women the benefit of the doubt, I can toe the line of feminist misandry. But I\u2019m just not seeing it in this doc. Is this a pro Bryan piece? Or is Netflix setting it up to show a complete 180 in the later episodes?",
