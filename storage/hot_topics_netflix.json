Okay, so what happened to the female cop\u2019s husband/child\u2019s father? There was some strange back story where he needed her to lie for him, he was stalking her. I felt like there was this big build up that ultimately just was him going to jail with no resolution really. Also, in the beginning when the woman falls off the cliff, the police were back and forth about if she was already dead before she fell or not but we could clearly see she was dead. She also had some animal tear up her knee after she had been shot. When they finally showed the chain of events, it showed her getting shot, but no animals attacking her. It only showed her \u201cjump\u201d off the cliff. So, she wasn\u2019t dead? She committed suicide? Another thing, they made it seem like the man that was showing up to see the girl was this creepy ominous guy who she trusted. The way they showed him opening her bedroom window made it seem like he was going to hurt her. Idk, this show felt like the audience was being lead in different directions with no real \u201cah ha moment\u201d or pay off. oh and, the whole drug ring side plot was incredibly unnecessary in my opinion too.

        "content": "YouTube has been around for over 20 years now. In my opinion it is the standard for video player quality and usability. Since as long as I can remember, you've been able to select whichever resolution you want for whatever video you're watching.\n\nI am so sick and tired of the fact that you cannot just select the resolution of the video you want on Netflix. The only options I can find on video quality are universal for your entire profile and include \"Low, Medium, High\" which is completely ambiguous and meaningless to any user with half their brain.\n\nWhy can't I just select the resolution that I want? If it's laggy or my hardware can't handle a specific resolution, then I can turn it down to something else. This is absolutely basic functionality that should exist for such a large company and it's obviously done intentionally. I also can't believe that more people don't complain about this. This should be changed. Why aren't a larger number of Netflix users complaining about this?",

Is it based on performance that you get paid? I presume marketing or finding unsolved cases or issues must be tough\u2026\n\nWhat do you think happened to Amy Bradley?",
