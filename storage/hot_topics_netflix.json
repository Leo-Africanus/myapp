I searched for \u201ccrime story with a detective trying to solve it which is also dark and mysterious\u201d. It gave me results of shows including shows I\u2019ve already watched and when I typed \u201cshow me only series that I haven\u2019t watched yet\u201d it replied \u201csorry, I cannot do that at the moment\u201d. \n\nI also searched for House of Guinness and it gave me results similar to it (which of course the first result was the show itself), but when I replied with \u201cWhy Peaky Blinders isn\u2019t listed? It\u2019s from the same creator and is quite similar\u201d, it just replied with similar shows other than Peaky Blinders, ignoring my question. So, I think it\u2019s not as conversational as other AI assistants (Copilot, Gemini, etc), but it\u2019s in beta so maybe that\u2019s why? We\u2019ll see.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
