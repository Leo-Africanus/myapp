I have some issues with some of the animation and the plot has a few inconsistencies, but one thing [I have no problems with is the music itself.](https://www.thepopverse.com/movies-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-perfect-k-pop-introduction-huntrix-bts-twice/) Every song is solid and represents a trope or genre within KPop. The first song feels like it could be on a Blackpink record. The Saja Boys song was inspired by BTS. The big confrontational song is sung by members of Twice during the credits. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that KPop Demon Hunters is very good and has a great soundtrack. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting a gateway drug to KPop.",

        "content": "This is somewhat tricky because the algorithm of Netflix suggesting new titles to you is a black box. But should you, for best results, rate based on the quality (meaning objective rating - acting, camera work, writing, cinematography etc.) or on the content (the genre, topic, setting, story etc.)?\n\nFor example if you had two movies  \nA) A sci-fi action comedy movie that has amazing camera work, acting and writing.   \nB) A medieval murder mystery thriller that has miscast actors, useless subplots stapled on with horrible acting and amateur cinematography.\n\nNow if you really really like a medieval setting, thrillers and especially murder mysteries are 100% you jam and you really don't care for action, sci-fi or comedy, how should you rate the movies? \n\n* If you go for the objective rating of A+ B- will you now see more sci-fi action stuff that you don't really care for? Or will you be treated to highly rated cinematic masterpieces of every kind? \n* On the other hand if you try and curate your stuff and go for the subjective rating of A- B+, will you get more of the themes you are looking for or will you be flooded with borderline unwatchable straight to DVD crap?\n\nThe \"I love this\" option made it a bit easier so if it's something that is both objectively and subjectively great for you, you know how to vote, but if I don't like something for the quality but not the setting or other way around, I often don't dare \"dislike\" it, because of how it might misunderstand *what* I disliked.",

        "content": "My review........it was....OK.  Julianne Moore was great...as expected.  I feel like she's super hot these days....very deserved!.  Milly Alcock...also great! Both held their part of the bargain...great actresses!   The storyline was ...meh if I'm gonna be honest.   The success of this series was really based on the cast...not the story line.  I felt that the real interest was in Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis' characters. Their chemistry was amazing and I wanted to see more! Her and his backstory, ,  how this cult started, who was the first wife, \"hey hey\"? Josh Segarra's character? Like wtf is that about? There is soooo much more to unpack here that is bigger than this storyline! PLEASE MAKE A PREQUEL  or a spinoff with Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis!.  So many questions unanswered!",
