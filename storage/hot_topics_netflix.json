        "title": "The Residence: the blink and the note SOLVED",
        "content": "MAJOR SPOILERS for the end of The Residence!\n\nI think I figured out the issue with Lilly's blink and the note! I looked a bit to see if anyone else has already explained this but didn't see anyone so if I'm just super unobservant I apologize.\n\nThe problem we all have is that Cupp claimed that knowing about the note in the jacket pocket identified the killer, because only the killer could have known it was there prior to the discovery/investigation. Lilly claimed to have seen Bruce put the note in Wynter's jacket, which Cupp would find later.\n\nThe problem is that anyone could have told her the note was found in his jacket, and in her version of events she \"knew\" it was there because she \"saw\" Bruce put it there. Lilly could absolutely know the location of the note in her version of events, making the fact that she had the location of it not a gotcha at all.\n\nSo what was Cupp getting at when she said that detail identified her as the killer?\n\nIn order to understand this, we have to do what Cupp taught us to do earlier in the season - establish context.\n\nThe Lilly reveal and the investigative hearing are intercut with one another. What is happening in the hearing is giving us context for Cupp's frame of mind during the reveal.\n\nThe biggest thing she emphasized to the committee was all about context and possibility. She had to entertain the idea that Elsyie and Bruce and Doumbe were ALL innocent. That there was a fourth person.  She needed to consider this option, and she did.\n\nBefore Lilly's \"blink\" Cupp jumped up on the table and announced that the existence of the door meant that anyone in the room could have done the crime. THIS was her flashing her wings.\n\nShe then made a point of saying \"If I'm wrong (about none of the most likely guilty three being involved), one [points to Bruce] of [points to Elsyie] you [points to Doumbe] definitely did it.\" This is her establishing that she was operating under the assumption that the three of them were NOT involved. She was entertaining the possibility that the three were already ruled out.\n\nIf she was wrong about ruling them out and flashing her wings and no one blinked, it was safe to put the three back in the running as the killer. But if she was right and the flash revealed someone else...\n\nSo if Bruce, Elsyie, and Doumbe were not involved at all, HOW did the note get in the jacket?\n\nLilly admitted to being in possession of the note right up to Wynter's death. The note needed to go from her possession into Wynter's jacket. Either Wynter put it there himself or the murderer put it there, but no other person was in possession of the note between Lilly tearing it out and it being placed in Wynter's jacket.\n\nKnowing, not WHERE the note was, but the sheer fact that the note DID return to Wynter, was what gave her away, because only the killer could have known (not WHERE it was, but) HOW he got the note back after Lilly tore it out.\n\nIn Lilly's story, the note goes from her to Wynter via Bruce, making Bruce the last known possessor of the note. Without Bruce - and again, this was the CONTEXT Cupp was operating under at the time - there is no one in possession of the note between Lilly tearing it out when he was alive, and it being discovered in his jacket when he was dead. Lilly's own admissions give us no reason to believe otherwise.\n\nSo if the three - and Bruce in particular - weren't there for the murder, the only way the note gets from Lilly to Wynter is if she gave it to him at the time of the crime. If she had given him the note earlier and not been connected to that period of time, she would have had no reason whatsoever not to share that fact, as it distanced her from the crime. But she herself admits having it up until his death. This is how, if Bruce, Elsyie and Doumbe were not there, Lilly's the only possible suspect.\n\nAnd here's a huge piece of the puzzle: WHY did Lilly tear a page out of Wynter's journal? What possible scenario could allow this detail to happen? Why would Wynter's journal be in her presence, much less the target of her anger?\n\nI think it's because of Wynter's records. I believe that Wynter showed her the journal when he threatened to expose her, and Lilly, realizing that the journal was his record of her crimes, tried to take it from him, but he wrestled it away from her and she only tore out a scrap.\n\nIf Lilly had just said nothing about the note, she could have gotten away with it. If she'd not given such a specific detail, she could claim that, for example, she left it at his desk, or lost it, or even not tell anyone she tore it out in the first place.\n\nTelling Cupp she had the note up until his death was one detail too many, and in the CONTEXT of the other three NOT being in the room, identified her as the only possible killer.\n\nSo when Lilly was the only one to \"blink\" at the flash of Cupp's wings, in conjunction with the fact that she alone had the note she herself tore out of Wynter's journal, along with her overwhelming motive, she made any other culprit impossible.",

        "title": "Blindspot Binge, 3rd rewatch, answer to the finale",
        "content": "Sorry for this in depth response, but as you can see I was a fan of this show and I\u2019ve been coming on here lately because it came back to the forefront. I have always thought that Jane lived in the end and always believed the ultimate clue was in her final words, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d The reason I\u2019m posting this after 5 years is because when it was on TV and I watched the finale, there wasn\u2019t much buzz around it because of COVID and everything going on in the country during that summer, which obviously, and rightly, had people\u2019s attention and focus. \n\nThen it came back to the forefront through Netflix about a month ago and all I\u2019m seeing is how she definitely died, which was not the case. This is for a number of reasons. My first point is that basically it would mean the whole central theme of the show and character arc of Jane, Roman\u2019s sacrifice and ultimate realization that Weller was the key to Jane\u2019s living on due to his ability to ground and surround her with happiness and positive meaning, which he (as her brother) never could, was all for not. To dive a little deeper, the point of Jane\u2019s character is redemption and proving good can be found in evil and eventually turn complete evil into complete goodness. With that being the central theme, you don\u2019t have redemption if you ultimately fail at your mission and die. I get some will argue self sacrifice as the ultimate show of love and care for others, but that\u2019s not what Jane was, she was a survivor and a fighter. Her ultimately dying would be the antithesis of her characters whole persona. \n\nMoving on to my next point, a secondary theme that comes up in one of the tattoo cases is Remi and Roman are an ode to Remus and Romulus, the ill fated siblings, one who died and one who went on to found one of the greatest empires to exist on this planet. In this case the roles were reversed obviously, Remi was the Romulus, the survivor who achieved what both sought too, but only one could. In her case it was a life of \u201cboredom\u201d, but happiness with Weller, hence the finale\u2019s title \u201cIunne Ennui\u201d, which is the word ennui backwards and forwards, and is an ode to Remi and Roman (Remus and Romulus) switching fates.\n\nThis title also alludes to Jane\u2019s character, again in that it is the word written backwards first and then correctly second. It suggests she entered (first appearance) Time Square with her character\u2019s morale compass being completely non-existent, but a life full of excitement and left it (finale) with her morale compass being overly high, with a life of boredom in front of her. This is demonstrated and emphasized by Time Square being empty during the cut away scene with just the body bag in the middle. This is done to illustrate the emptiness is gone and happiness and belonging is what she is a part of, which is what the dinner scene is all about. \n\nYou also must consider that EVERYONE of those characters at the table is alive, not died like with the hallucinations and they have even grown since the events in Time Square and found some semblance of happiness in there own (now boring) lives. Everyone says it is too perfect of an ending when in actuality it is just life, think of drifting apart from friends and then coming together one time a year or every couple years. Do you commiserate over how your life isn\u2019t what you wanted it to be or do you remember the good times you had and how you grew and had awesome experiences together? (If the answer is you commiserate over depressing stuff then you\u2019re definitely doing it wrong). \n\nLastly and most importantly are her final words. The \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d response is to Roman\u2019s overall questions of, \u201cCan we be good, can we be forgiving and forgive ourselves for our past sins and can we find happiness (or a happy ending)\u201d? This is explicated expressed in the final episode of season three as he lay dying under the tree (episode 3.22), he asks her this directly. It\u2019s truly a very good bit of TV and highlights the central theme and plot of the entire, can evil become good and does a redeemed evil thing deserve happiness in the end? This question ultimately isn\u2019t answered for 2 seasons, and I know the show got outrageous in terms of storyline, but how much of that was a hallucination also? Honestly, I\u2019ve always wondered that and still do after my third rewatch. \n\nAnyways, overall, I know some think it\u2019s \u201copen to interpretation\u201d, but people never mention that in the same interview where Gero himself said this, he follows that up with, if one analyzes the \u201cauthorial intent\u201d of the show in totality and the finale at a macro level, there is a correct answer. To me, if you\u2019re writing a story, this would be the authorial intent of any good author to bring the ultimate closure to plot and central theme. Jane saying \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d literally means she changed from evil to good, was finally able to let go of her past evils and realized that even if your evil, sometimes you do deserve that second chance and happy ending, which Jane did deserve.

No hospital or workplace in their right mind would do that. It\u2019s a welcome mat to people thinking she just got the job because of her compliant (which sounds like it cause Dr. Cruz says she\u2019s trying to handle a PR nightmare)\n\nSide note, not only would they not make her chief, wouldnt she be under mandatory therapy or leave as well after something traumatic? Seems like she\u2019s back on the floor the day after filing a huge traumatic complaint. I feel like anyone in a profession like that would have to be psychologically cleared. We already see her having flashbacks of him when she\u2019s trying to treat patients..\n\nAs if that\u2019s not bad enough, the same doctor now admits to permanently putting her sister in a wheelchair from pushing her down the steps. Just seems weird af she continued a normal life after something so major? \n\nHorrible character writing and super unoriginal plot. \n\n",

        "content": "Just came across Love Life, which was released in 2020 and had two seasons. I\u2019ve binge watched both of them and I thought they were both really great. Very realistic in terms of talking about dating lives and emotions and difficulties that arise. I also love that it was shot in NYC where I live. I have never heard of this show before and I\u2019m a pretty picky person, but I thought it was fantastic with the exception of a few unrealistic scenes/occurrences in the series. It also had some really great people in it, namely Anna Kendrick, Jessica Williams, and Ego Nwodim. What are you guys think?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nFor ages now I've been frustrated by not being able to use picture-in-picture mode for Netflix on my phone. It works for all other apps (YouTube etc).\n\nI know that PiP isn't available for ad supported plans. I'm not on one of those, but I do get it as an \"additional household\" of a family member paying the additional fee on the top tier. Does anyone know if this comes with any restrictions on PiP?\n\nIf not, would love any suggestions for troubleshooting! I'm running Netflix on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G, on HyperOS 2.0.5.0. Picture-in-picture mode is set to on for Netflix and all other relevant settings seem fine.\n\nThank you very much.",

        "title": "I finished watching the season 4 of 'Stranger Things' and here are my observations",
        "content": "I just finished the 4th season of 'Stranger Things' and I observed:\n\n\n1. The demogorgon in the Russian prison when released on the captives, is so much extremely fast and powerful, kills most of the men in blink of an eye, but for some reason it goes slowly and easy on Hopper and Enzo, waits for Hopper to lit a fire and then doesn't even go away from fire, just gets very slow. It is shown to easily break the prison walls and structures and create havoc, but was for some reason waiting until now.\n\n\n2. The plan to defeat Vecna didn't seem like a plan. They all knew how fatal is upside down, but they went there casually with a few normal guns and no special weapon, while completely ignoring many scenarios which could happen. They didn't even have a proper serious discussion about the plan and any what-ifs. \n\n\n3. Everywhere these guys went they kept talking loudly and kept arguing, instead of keeping a watch and being careful, looking for any clues. They never cared if something undesired hears them or attacks them. \n\n\n4. Lucas and Max didn't even lock the house from inside or had any plan on what will they do if someone disturbs them when Max goes in trance (they were aware that Jason was on lookout for them all). This situation was not something they could compromise with. (Even though I hate Jason for being there at wrong time)\n\n\n5. It was brutal to watch Max finally getting folded by Vecna.\n\n\n6. I am tired of stupidity from characters like Eddie who had no business jumping back into upside down, when it wasn't even helping anyone. He and Dustin had already distracted the bats for a good amount of time, and just needed to take care of themselves. It was an unnecessary and meaningless loss.\n\n\n7. Found Joyce to be very irritating at certain moments. \n\n\n8. Joyce and Murray casually deciding to attack the pilot Yuri in sky without really caring about how will they survive, and then comfortably getting out of the crash with minor scratches. \n\n\n9. Seeing Hopper alive was such a normal moment for everyone like he just returned from a long vacation. \n\n\n10. After Max final gets unconscious, the gate to upside down gets cracked open throughout the city (atleast) which should completely change everything immediately. But 2 days later we see the headline on TV calling it an earthquake? Everyone in Hawkins including the police ignored the miles long (atleast) giant orange crack which is a portal to another world going through the city for 2 days? Why and how they completely ignored that? Even the kids didn't talk about it. (During the very last of the episode when the snow like particles started raining, we could see some orange gates or cracks spread throughout an area) \n\n",

But the Netflix account has been taken! They changed the password of course and email but here is the creepy thing. My mums email have our surname in it and the new email on the Netflix account has our last name in it and we tried to recover the account through mums credit card and apparently her credit card isnt on the account either. \n\nIt also has a @renew.club at the end and I've never ever seen that before. So right now I can't recover the account whatsoever as we are gonna have to call up sky and probably Netflix but Its just all werid and creepy. Like why take the Netflix account and take off the credit card? Why use apart of the original account holders email in the new email? And why not fully hack the original email to gain access to more data?",
