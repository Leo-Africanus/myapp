The acting felt like a bunch of people who\u2019d never been in front of a camera before\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the dialogue. It\u2019s like the script was written in TikTok comment sections. Nobody actually talks like that in real life  Hearing those lines come out of their mouths was physically painful, like they were trying to make TikTok slang happen, but no just stop this aint it.\n\njust cast actual actors next time. And get a script that sounds like it was written by humans and not an algorithm trying to go viral. And everyone is suddenly gay and bisexual on a korean school?

        "title": "Alice in Borderland Dealers Momoka and Aasahi",
        "content": "  \nNow that season 3 has been allegedy announced to be released as of late, I wanted to talk about some elements of the series - starting with the concept of dealers\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyjwe0qptfee1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ec6710eb858dad9e92cc49ca56e45a1e1219578\n\nMomoka and Asahi, pivotal characters in\u00a0*Alice in Borderland*, are revealed to be \"dealers,\" individuals coerced pehraps into orchestrating and supervising games in the Borderlands where their survival seems to depend on their compliance. However, this role turns them into indirect agents of death, complicit in the system that preys on other players. Their roles add a layer of complexity to the narrative, raising questions about free will, morality, and the cyclical nature of life and death as well as how one becomes a dealer and what final result this means when linked back to the real world. So here are some of my questions as someone who hasn't finished reading the manga and is open to spoilers by any means if anyone has any answers!\n\n**1. What Motivates the System to Create Dealers?**\n\nWhy does the Borderland system require participants to act as dealers? Is it a mechanism to ensure complicity and spread guilt, or is it a test of moral resilience\n\n**3. Why do dealers have to try and 'kill' people?**\n\nIn the video recording, Momoka says 'a lot of people have died because of us', not only do they go to supervise but they mention 'we made sure many players died' in order to manipulate the games but why? What's the point of this as a lot of games seem to be based of merit or just pure luck - so why would the system want dealers to come in and purposefully sabotage the outcome?\n\n**2. Does the role of dealers tie closely to the randomness of the meteor strike in the real world?**\n\nJust as the meteor arbitrarily determined who lived and died, does the system of the Borderland places individuals into roles that often leave them with no choice such as dealers? or are these roles perhaps something individual players choose for themselves at some point similar to choosing 'citzenship at the boarderlands' like in the end scene? If not, what happens to dealers once the game has been completed? do they also get to choose to go back?\n\nI have a lot more questions but these are just a few about the dealers specfically. The scene where they're in that room full of a bunch of screens really altered my perspective of the show as you can expect and I still have difficulties connecting everything in a way where it makes somewhat sense.",

        "content": "So I just finished re-watching La Palma for the sixth time and I hopped on reddit to see what people were saying about my new favorite cinematic masterpiece, and I'm absolutely amazed at how wrong everyone seems to be about Erik's \"death\".  Just thought I'd clear up any confusion on the matter.\n\nErik never died.  In the final scene Erik was revealed to actually have been a sea turtle the entire time, who ended up surviving the gunshot due to his hard shell blocking the bullet.  In the last scene of the final episode it literally shows him reuniting with his sea turtle family and slowly fading away as he swam off into the distance \ud83d\ude44\n\nThere were actually several signs throughout the show to hint at this being the case:\n\n* Erik's obsession with sea turtles and the many boat trips he took to visit them.  \nHe even divulges that he was in debt to the boat guy because of this.\n\n* Erik's need for his sister to take care of him.  \nTowards the beginning of the story he asks his sister for $100 to buy vegetables (sea turtle diet)\n\n* Halfway through the series the police start to arrest Erik but eventually realize he is a sea turtle (you can't arrest sea turtles) and then switch to arresting Marie when she gets involved, which gave away that she was his owner and therefore responsible for him.  \n\n* In the jail when he finally gets ahold of the keys, he struggles to unlock Marie's cell due to his  lack of opposable thumbs.  She even has to steady his flippers to help him out.\n(I honestly debated whether or not to even include this one it was so obvious, I seriously hope no one missed this)\n\nI could go on but I really feel like those are the main points and if you still can't see it then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nAll in all I really loved this series and thought it had a really heartwarming ending and message about how Sara should've died when the tsunami absolutely turbo-fucked the shit out of the airplane like seriously what the fuck was that",

        "content": "I\u2019ve seen a few posts bashing the show but I\u2019ve honestly been loving it! Here\u2019s 5 things I like about it:\n\n1) Pacing. With each episode being only 30 minutes long, the show wastes little to no time in each episode. This is in stark contrast to some romcoms which can have pacing problems, with filler suddenly grinding the show to a halt. The show is constantly throwing twists and turns, and just when you think you know what\u2019ll happen next it surprises you, without being overly subversive just for the sake of it. I never really felt bored watching this show.\n\n2) Characters. Every speaking character feels like they have a place in the web of relationships that unfolds, as well as having their own motivations. There\u2019s no love interests that exist just to be love interests, each character clearly has their own backstory and personality. I\u2019m glad the show doesn\u2019t waste precious screen time with inconsequential characters, and it felt like as soon as character became irrelevant to the plot, they were able to gracefully fade to the background.\n\n3) Relationships. Some people were bashing on the queer aspects of the show (without considering that that\u2019s the reason some people are watching the show in the first place). I get that it can seem like queer people are overrepresented in this show, but don\u2019t forget that in real life lgbt people tend to stick together, so it\u2019s realistic that a single friend group would have a disproportionate amount of queer people compared to the general population. As for if it\u2019s realistic to be openly queer in South Korea, my interpretation is that it\u2019s a wealthy international school with more liberal values. In terms of how quickly romantic feelings can shift in the show, I think it can be easy to forget that these characters are supposed to be in high school, which is a time of discovery and new experiences for many. It\u2019s common for relationships as a teenager to be somewhat short lived and spontaneous. I think the way the relationships play out is realistic for high school, and it\u2019s also compelling as a coming of age story for Kitty.\n\n4) Dialogue. I know that some will have gripes over the use of \u201ctiktok slang,\u201d but I think it\u2019s faithful to how teenagers talk. While I will admit there are times the acting feels a bit unconvincing/disney-esque, I also found myself laughing out loud at just how natural some of the characters\u2019 reactions to situations were. \n\n5) Setting/Theme. One of my favorite parts of the show is how it basically feels like a marriage of those old CW shows like Gossip Girl and 90210 with modern K drama elements. As someone who went on foreign exchange in Asia, I think the setting of an international school in Seoul is believable and works well to complement the tone and the fact that this is essentially an American show inspired by Korean culture. It also complements the original \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d adaptation well.\n\nSo yeah just wanted to post this to counteract some of the negativity around this show in the sub. I think season 2 was phenomenal and I really hope it gets renewed for a third!",

It\u2019ll play an episode, play the next, and then autoplay stops and gives me the screen options like it\u2019s the last episode of a series (instead of **moments/speed/episodes/audio and subtitles/next ep/full screen** it\u2019s just **moments/speed/audio and subtitles**) I\u2019ve tried deleting my profile and making a new one, shutting down my iPad, deleting and redownloading the app, and nothing is working.

I just want to know if it happened to you guys. My guess is hackers or those sell netflix accounts. \n\nAlso 3 months ago, someone's device was added on my account. I really think I was compromised",
