The kind that aren\u2019t just sad but actually make you sit in silence for a while after an episode ends, just processing everything.\n\nI\u2019m talking about shows that cover real-world tragedies, injustices, or historical events in a way that really sticks with you. Stories that aren\u2019t just entertainment but actually make you think about how messed up the world can be. I know *Dopesick* and *Apple Cider Vinegar* fall into this category, but I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others out there.\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d like something available on Netflix, but if there\u2019s something really good on another platform, I\u2019d still be interested in hearing about it. I just want something that\u2019s powerful, disturbing, and leaves an impact.\n\nAny recommendations? Would love to hear what shows have left you completely drained after watching.",
