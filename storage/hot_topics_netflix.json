The first one was slow to get through, granted, but by the end it was easily one of my favorite horror/suspense shows. CANCELLED. And it\u2019s certainly not the production costs since very little special effects were used. \n\nThere were more shows that got canceled, obviously, but these were the three that really got to me.
