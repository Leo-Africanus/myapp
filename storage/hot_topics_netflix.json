To me, they are very unnecessary and very confusing. It ruins the show. One minute he\u2019s paranoid about getting caught hacking and the next he\u2019s hearing voices that aren\u2019t there? Like why? The last straw was the opening of Episode 6. He (i guess) imagined being in a sitcom. Why couldn\u2019t they continue with the hacking greedy corporations storyline without the dad being an imaginative character in Elliot\u2019s head? Like i said, i enjoyed the original concept and am thinking about finishing it but idk? Have any of you finished it? Is it worth it? It just annoys me when writers try so hard to be clever and eccentric with these shows ultimately losing the plot &amp; ruining a good show. ",

He checks the perimeter and leaves his partner to look at the man\u2019s ankle monitor. The man then tries to kill the partner, but the MC stops him just in time. And guess what happens next? The MC slams him to the ground, then he and his partner just walk away\u2014leaving a man who just attempted sexual assault and murder completely free.\n\nAnother example is in Alice in Borderland. There\u2019s a recurring character who repeatedly tries to rape people, and the group has multiple chances to get rid of him. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but one scene had the main character strangling this guy after he tried to assault what seemed to be his love interest. Yet, instead of finishing it, he just lets him live\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get what kind of message the writers are trying to send here, but it feels like it completely falls flat. Why are they portraying rape like it\u2019s something that can just go unpunished?\n",

The resulting artefacts make it pretty much unwatchable. Some shows seem to be better than others, but I can't seem to figure out how to actually get them to stream in good quality consistently across all shows. I have tried adjusting the playback setting to maximum instead of auto, but it makes no difference since my internet is not the bottleneck and is capable of streaming 4k 60 fps on YouTube. I have not been able to find any solutions that I have not tried already (Windows app and quality settings).",

        "content": "On half it's my fault as well because I promised myself a long time ago that I wouldn\u2019t start a new series without making sure it\u2019s well-finished and not ending on a cliff-hanger.\n\nBUT...\n\n  \nI sometimes feel like I'm being punished because all the series I've watched so far became my favourites, I could relate them, all them have a unique, strong story that kept me glued to the screen from the beginning, but then its too late when I realise I won't see the end of this story, only can feel a gap inside me caused by the lack of sequel.\n\nBy Netflix: Travelers, Archive 81, The OA, The society\n\nBy Fox: Wayward Pines (yes its in Disney's hand now and they could had finished it if they'd had cared at all but no)\n\n  \nI know the sad reality that in this greedy capitalist world is all about the money how much they can take, but in the end of the day always the fans get the short end of the stick. When we read the news about the series being cancelled, what the first line tells about most of the time? The viewership has drastically decreased. I'm asking you that whose fault is that? \n\nIt's on me or on you who actually enjoyed the series and wanted more, or it's on the directors, creators, producers, executive producers, the very people whose job it is to specialize in this industry and create works that can stand the test of time in front of a wide audience without having to abandon them at the first bump in the road? In a normal parallel universe, they wouldn\u2019t just give up but would find a solution to the problem.\n\nI understand it\u2019s not easy to satisfy millions of people unilaterally according to your own vision, especially when it comes to film/TV production, but I don\u2019t think the solution is to throw all that work in the trash and never look back. That\u2019s not how you grow or learn. Instead, if everyone sat down and carefully discussed what could be done differently, how to carry the storyline forward in a way that brings viewers back, or even gains new ones, it would elevate them to a higher pedestal for being able to rise above and set aside their grievances. \n\nIn the long run, this would pay off, not only financially (for their own pockets), but professionally as well.  \nYes, I know there are numerous other factors why a show could be dropped. *The Society* and a few others were left hanging due to COVID-19. But that was years ago, then why haven\u2019t they picked it back up since then? Is it because these shows are too unique, and they prefer mass-producing cookie-cutter content that doesn\u2019t require much thought or effort? That\u2019s part of it.\n\nIf they stopped the mass production machine and quit churning out the same series every year with a different coat of paint, new actors, and new locations, and instead went back to the roots to fix their mistakes, they could actually finish the abandoned shows. And there are plenty of them.\n\nI'm asking you reader if you've watched these series I mentioned above, how did you like it? How'd you feel when you found out there won't be a sequel?",

Another example, during Your Idol (my favorite song), there were often times where the background chants were louder than anything else in the song. I was pretty disappointed by the experience, as the immersive and loud audio was the biggest thing I was looking forward to. I saw that other people were complaining before the sing along, so maybe I just couldn't tell on my TV speakers the first times. Or maybe I have a bad theater. Anyone else feel this way? ",

Here\u2019s what I know and what want to understand shortly follows:\n-Lyle seemed to always have a weird affinity for Merritt since they were teens. \n-When William Lingard hits Harry from behind, both teens realized the mistake. Then Lyle comes in and beats William, saying \u201cif I hadn\u2019t followed you, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d \n-Fast forward to when he was at Godhaven and he\u2019s giving a video interview, he kept on about Sam Haig being his brother bc if he didn\u2019t follow him, he\u2019d be dead. \n-Add in him being thrown in the hyperbaric chamber with Harry AFTER his death, but denies Harry being dead in his video interview.\n-There are moments of clarity for Lyle, returning Merritt\u2019s necklace, saying how he loved her, then showing extreme displays of hatred, blaming her for his brother\u2019s death.\n\n1. Does Lyle have a split personality disorder? I personally thought he did. Why else show compassion for the tooth infection and how apologetic he was when returning the necklace? (giving a needle nose pliers seemed to be the dumbest move but yet he was able to concoct a whole new life as Sam Haig just to infiltrate Merritt\u2019s life?)\n2. Did Lyle love Merritt? Or jealous that his brother wanted to leave to be with Merritt?\n3. Does Lyle accept that his brother actually died? In his teens he denied it.\n4. Why would Lyle assume William would continue to hurt Harry? I thought the teens knew each other unless Lyle was just looking for a reason to hurt someone?\nBONUS question \ud83d\ude02:\nDid the Mh\u00f2r sheriff know Lyle was the one who actually attacked William? I think this is the case, but at what point did he realize this and why not confess it? I can\u2019t accept the \u201cit\u2019s his ego to not admit he was wrong.\u201d\n\n",

Gotta love how it teaches you about so many different unique Japanese desserts and treats/ junk foods.\n\nOverall, very enjoyable silly fun stuff! Another reason why I love Japan lol.",

        "content": "I just learned today that Netflix prompts you every time you open your account after putting in a cancelation request to continue the subscription. Thats mad predatory and if you have a kid like I do that doesnt exactly read the prompt and just races past it, its nearly impossible to get the cancellation to stick. I cancelled my Netflix at 630am, by 930 I somehow had upgraded. The funny thing is the cancelation was put in during the weekday when everyone was at either school or work. Netflix of course had no answer for me other than I made the mistake. I suggest anyone trying to cancel, call the customer service number and have them delete your payment method. ",

        "content": "I've been with Netflix since 2012 and as far as I can tell, I've always had a premium account with 4 screens.  I guess at some point it got changed by them to a standard plan with 2 screens.  But now that doesn't matter since my son moved out and my brother could no longer access the account because, well....Netflix.....\n\nBut, I did recently added my brother as an extra member - not realizing that I did so with ads.  It is ridiculous that if I have an account without ads, they would default to the extra member option WITH ads.  The issue is that he casts to watch Netflix - and the ads membership does not let you cast.  I cannot believe how insanely hard it is to get them to charge me more money....\n\nI have done 2 chats and 1 call and I was literally ready to throw the phone.  I got as far as canceling the extra member, but if I try to add it back, and select the tiny print option that says without ads, I get to the next screen and there's no info - no monthly amount, etc.  Even if I still go ahead and click \"add member\", it goes back to my account page and nothing happens.\n\nI'm wondering if this is because technically the extra member account is probably still active until my next billing cycle?  Has anyone successfully changed an extra member from ads to no ads?\n\nThanks :)\n\n",
