The makeup is bad, the effects are few and far between and the script feels very \u201cwritten by GPT\u201d. \n\nThe move to Hemsworth (one of the other ones, not THE Hemsworth) didn\u2019t fit either.

He doesn\u2019t fight his way out of trouble, he just outsmarts everyone. One second he\u2019s a janitor, the next he\u2019s walking out like a millionaire, and nobody even realizes what happened.  \nWhat I love most is how he uses information. It\u2019s not about hacking or gadgets, it\u2019s about reading people, noticing the small things, knowing how systems work. He uses the kind of details most of us give away every day without thinking twice. That\u2019s what makes it feel so real.\n\nIt kind of made me think about how hard it is to stay invisible in real life now. Cameras everywhere, online tracking, data leaks all the time. He\u2019s changing disguises and I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to stop apps from following me around. Privacy feels like the real superpower now.  \nAnyway, I loved this season and I\u2019m curious if others did too. Did you like how they wrapped things up? Or did it feel a little too over the top?",

        "content": "Netflix delivered a one-two punch of market-moving news on October 30, 2025, igniting investor enthusiasm with a 10-for-1 stock split and reports it is actively exploring a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD). The dual headlines sent Netflix shares sharply higher in after-hours trading, adding momentum to a broader post-earnings tech rally driven by Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe company said the split aims to make its now four-figure share price more accessible to retail investors and improve liquidity. Hours later, Reuters and Bloomberg confirmed that Netflix had retained investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. to evaluate a potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\u2019 studio and streaming units, with the streaming giant already granted access to financial data rooms. Analysts described the potential move as a bold bid to consolidate the streaming market, expand original-content control, and diversify revenue amid intensifying global competition from Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+.\n\nIf completed, the deal would mark Netflix\u2019s largest-ever acquisition and signal a new phase of vertical integration.\n\n**Timeline of Today\u2019s Events**\n\n* 16:53 Marketbeat Notes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) trading 1 % lower pre-announcement following a minor analyst downgrade.\n* 16:54\u201316:57 Yahoo Finance / Yahoo Finance Canada Netflix unveils a 10-for-1 stock split, citing affordability and inclusion goals; shares initially trade above $1,000 before the news.\n* 17:19\u201317:20 Benzinga / Investingcom Headlines: \u201cNetflix Announces 10-For-1 Stock Split, Shares Rise.\u201d After-hours interest builds as retail demand spikes.\n* 17:44 CNBC Mentions Netflix among top after-hours movers alongside Apple, Amazon, and Coinbase.\n* 17:53 Investingcom Reports official confirmation of the split filing; some analysts debate timing amid rising competition.\n* 17:59 Bloomberg Bundles the split with broader tech coverage: \u201cApple/Amazon Earnings, Netflix Stock Split, More.\u201d\n* 18:50\u201318:56 Alpha Market News / Reuters Breaking: Netflix hires Moelis &amp; Co. as financial advisor, gains access to Warner Bros.
