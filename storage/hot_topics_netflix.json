Hwang is producing the series, which has been described as a 'high-stakes casino crime drama,' but there is at least one element in the description that sets this new series apart from Hwang\u2019s most well-known work.\n\nIn The Dealer, Geonhwa is a casino dealer who has to return to the shadowy world of illegal gambling after she falls victim to a scam and has to put her wedding plans on hold. However, to give her an edge at the tables, she 'is compelled to tap long-suppressed supernatural abilities,' which sounds like such a fun spin on the Squid Game formula of high-stakes tension and uneasy alliances with huge sums of money on the line.\" -full article [here](https://www.thepopverse.com/tv-squid-game-netflix-creator-next-project-the-dealer-supernatural-twist)",

I get their concern with sharing, but there are better ways to verify identity, maybe using facial recognition or something similar.
