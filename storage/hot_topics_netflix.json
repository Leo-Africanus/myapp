There\u2019s no point in making it less likely I\u2019d open my Netflix app. The only reason I renewed my subscription because I was told they finally integrated into Apple TV. Like I don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m basically paying for cable again with all the subscriptions I have. But taking away the convenience of the modern day tech is stupid. I like that Apple tells me about shows that are coming out from all my apps and and I just click continue watching. I don\u2019t want to load up an app and scroll through all the ways companies organize their apps to show me what they want, not what I want. Ugh honestly I\u2019m sure they have their financially sound reasons and I\u2019m just venting. Either way, all these battles companies are having is preventing us from having an enjoyable experience and I guess im about to cancel Netflix again. I watch everything from Apple TV. I always end up forgetting about Netflix then I\u2019m paying for an app I haven\u2019t used in a year. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

        "title": "\u201cDark\u201d and the excess of mystery storytelling",
        "content": "Did you enjoy watching Dark, or did your brain? \n\nUpon finishing Netflix\u2019s German-language sci fi, following four families in the fictional town of Winden, whose lives all get upended when a child goes missing, then another child, then a man in a preacher\u2019s outfit appears, then the weird cave all the locals theorise about winds up being a portal that can catapult you 33 years forwards or backwards, or sometimes it doubles up and you go 66 years back, or your future selves show up to intervene in current events and\u2014oh my god this show is exhausting. Good, and unquestionably clever, boasting a script brainy and twisted enough to make M. Night Shyamalan wide-eyed, but incredibly fucking exhausting. The first word a charade says in the show is an exasperated \u201cfuck\u201d which signals what watching the show is actually like. Especially when you binge it, Dark is not so much enjoyable as it is engaging. You\u2019re always thinking, but never really being entertained. \n\nWhen asked on how they came up with Dark, an inevitable question given how absurdly planned-ahead the show is for its three season run, showrunners Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese said they read up on science and philosophy, and a lot of it. Piles of books as research for your sci fi show that tries to be the popular spin on Primer is almost a necessity, and the effort was well worth it given the final product, but you can definitely feel the work that went into this script as you\u2019re watching it play out. After reaching a certain point of familiarity with Dark\u2019s groove, the twists are less surprising because you\u2019re imminently expecting them episode after episode, and at a certain point the story leaves centre stage as you subconsciously applaud bo Odar and Friese for even thinking of that. Dark is thoughtful, but there\u2019s little humanity left to breathe within all that clever narrative swerving. \n\nAs Winden is a pretty small town, the cast of characters is pretty thin. Even with the added junction of seeing them across various time periods and even parallel worlds, you\u2019d think by Season 3 that an average viewer would have a good grasp on who these people are. But alas you really don\u2019t, and this lack of true empathy or even relatability to any of them is mainly the show\u2019s blame, as it so often likes to remind us how every character is a pawn in a much bigger game. Watching one person be manipulated on their entire journey can make for engaging TV, but when the puppet strings are hanging over everyone, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to see them as people. By the time Adam compares them to chess pieces for the fiftieth time while he stares at that gawdy ainting, you start seeing them that way as well. \n\nThe main character gets the worst of this coldness. Jonas Kahnwald is the show's protagonist in tradition only; rarely have I have encountered a main character so scant of agency and actual vavavoom to their decisions. It becomes something of a running joke how much he gets hoodwinked by his peers. As he\u2019s the figurehead of a thinking-man\u2019s mystery story, nearly every thread ties back to Jonas, narratively and genetically. The whole town is essentially a slinky dog of DNA mixing, but any moral engagement over this incest hotbed about this is unfortunately airbrushed. The longer Dark goes the less time it gives its character to feel like people at all, because it has to keep that plot moving. Season 3 stands out as pretty bad for this, feeling somehow rushed and plodding at points due to how much is happening with so little deliberation over it, but even by Season 2 the wheels fall off a bit. It becomes far less dramatic and emotionally resonant past the first season form 2017, and morphs sharply into genre fare. I don\u2019t want to sound hyperbolic here - Dark genuinely gives no time to its characters over these life changing revelations. Most people would choose to die than suffer fates that various characters here endure. Who wants to be Ulrich or Helge? No thanks. \n\nOne can learn that their husband\u2019s secret love affair mistress also slept with her son in the 80\u2019s, and we don\u2019t see much difference between scenes of them discovering that baffling fact and processing it. One can discover that their daughter is actually their mother and have to time travel to an apocalyptic future to ensure their daughter freaks out over losing their daughter who\u2019s actually their mother\u2014do you see the point being made here? I wouldn\u2019t expect the writers to offer a plausible response to a scenario so convoluted and existential that it would make your brain implode, but Dark makes stunningly little effort to show any sort of mental strain this twisted web of a storyline weighs on anyone. I\u2019m sorry but music montages don\u2019t cut it. Each episode is bookended by an atmospheric track playing over characters looking glum. Assuming this is the stand-in for their contemplation for anything that the plot throws on their plate, I\u2019m still not convinced it\u2019s anywhere close to enough. Docking points off Dark for poor realism would be silly, but I think you can definitely notch it down a peg or two from that Masterpiece podium for how little it cares for its characters.\n\nAgain, maybe the point I harp against here isn\u2019t exclusive to Dark and is moreso a broad symptom in mystery-led storytelling. The characters become chess pieces. The same effect can naturally spring up in any media that dabbles with time travel. Combine these two together and you get Dark, a show that\u2019s indefinitely interesting but could\u2019ve been so much than just interesting. Maybe if there was a fourth season, or just a little dash of filler so we might see these people smile or laugh or something, you\u2019d have something deeply intellectual AND emotional. \n\nThat\u2019s my biggest bugbear with the show is the missed potential, especially when it seems like an easy amendment with all the hard work done. We could get a searing character drama with these four families, but Dark has no interest in doing that, therefore I doubt we\u2019ll really see how this core idea works at its empathetic best, because Dark already did half of these aspects the best it\u2019s ever been done. \n",

        "content": "What if Netflix introduced a feature that unlocks only during your second watch? Similar to Amazon\u2019s X-Ray, but instead of showing cast details, it provides backstory snippets or explanations for cryptic or subtle scenes.\n\nFor example, during a rewatch of shows like Dark, The OA, or Black Mirror, key moments could trigger contextual insights\u2014like the backstory of a mysterious item, the significance of a subtle gesture, or how a scene foreshadows later events. These would only appear on a second watch, so the first viewing experience remains unspoiled.\n\nThis would make rewatching feel fresh and rewarding, offering fans new layers of depth while encouraging even more buzz around Netflix originals.\n\nWould this feature enhance your rewatch experience?",
