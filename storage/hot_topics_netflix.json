        "content": "Been wanting to fix my shows from being blurry so I recently turned on HDR video streaming on my laptop to see if it fixes and it turned out to much better quality. But I realized my screen started to unusually flicker.\n\nI turned off graphics acceleration on edge and the flickering stopped on both but went back to it being blurry...\n\nIs there a way to keep the video quality high quality without any problems?  \n  \n**Note:** I'm using an Dell Inspiron 15 3520 laptop and have everything updated.",
