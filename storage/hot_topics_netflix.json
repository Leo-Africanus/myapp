Windows, I have tried all the browsers and also the windows store app and still get 29.970.  Any other app or video streaming site lets you pick but Netflix doesnt allow you to choose and it makes no sense.  Does anyone understand why or how to make it work?

I have thoughts of who it could have been instead or the kind of motive I'd have preferred, but I won't share that either.\n\nMy only criticism is that the episodes should have been shorter. There were scenes that were longwinded and convoluted due to the length. It could have been 10-12 quick episodes instead of 8 super long ones. A minor nitpick I had is that the piano music they played sometimes was too similar to Only Murders in the Building. The piano music made sense because the characters in OMITB lived in an apartment where they used the elevator. \n\nOn a positive note, I thought the performances were all phenomenal. I absolutely loved Cordelia Cupp as a detective. I do wish the show had been set up for future seasons. She was very compelling as a lead. \n\n**What other murder mystery shows/movies have you seen?** \n\n I've Watched:\n\n* Psych\n* Monk\n* CLUE\n* How To Get Away With Murder\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* Murder Mystery &amp; Murder Mystery 2\n* Knives Out\n* Murder on the Orient Express\n* Sherlock Holmes (the movies and the show) ",

Anybody else getting this bs?\n\nFor full context netflix is seldom used and honestly if it wasn't for this I would likely continue to be subscribed to a service which is quite frankly not worth the cost. \n\nThe next time this happens I will be immediately cancelling the subscription but I was wondering if anybody else was suffering at the hands of this incompetence (uk based)",

        "content": "Once before Netflix worked with DTSx Headphones and Atmos for headphones, for a long time it doesn't. when DTSx is enabled it shows 2.0 on ALT + SHIFT + D and says Spatial Sound logo.\n\nWhen using Atmos it shows 5.1 Atmos sound decoder and Dolby Atmos logo.\n\nWhy is that? shouldn't DTSx and Dolby be the same? am I missing something in windows 11 to play both of them or netflix changed something a long time ago?",
