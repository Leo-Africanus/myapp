Quickly became one of the most irritating streaming services to deal with, and customer support hasn't been of any help. I have the option to \"watch temporarily\" but then I need to deal with sending a confirmation email to the account owner, which I am not. Like I said, I'm still a part of the household and watching netflix physically in the same household, using the same wifi that the account owner is using. Is this happening to anyone else?",

But nothing made sense in the Cassandra Series. \n\nWhy was the house empty for 50 years. \nWhy was Cassandra evil from the beginning. \nIf the switch was fake, then Fynn didn\u2019t turn her on but she was on the whole time. \nWhy does no one tackle her, how are they afraid of a robot on wheels that can not climb stairs, just get on the stairs, she needs an elevator to follow you. \nWhy is everyone sooooo dumb. Believe your wife for once when she says something is up with the robo chique. A child listening to a robot to take a weapon and not telling their parents anything about it because a robot said so? \nThe whole story line with maggy also didn\u2019t make sense, she could have provided for her or she could have left on her own. Why did she had to die there? \nThe husband trying to kill his wife in the end, without any hesitation? Eventhough she said that she will not harm the kids? And his best soulution in an hour free walking was to get a tree and scream at a women? No stop at the hardware store or anything? Finding the powerline to the house and disabling it? \n\nI liked the style, the basic idea and the story telling. But even if the logic does not have to be perfect, it should at least make sense in its own context. But what the heck was this, and how disappointing was the end??\n\nThey could have saved the whole series by changing one little thing: When Sam was in the clinic and hallucinating her sister, they should have focused more on this talk. And after it, plottwist: it was really her fault all the time. The robot was just a robot, everything was fine, but due to the loss of her sister she turned crazy and hallucinated all of this robot stuff. Her family was really on vacation over Christmas to enjoy some peace. And she realized it in the clinic. They would have avoided all the plotholes and made it a psycho drama showing how vulnerable we are in time of crisis. Brilliant! But this? Meh ",
