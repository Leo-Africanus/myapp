Just wanted to share [this Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/watchflix-a-netflix-watch/ndembgeojaahiiibpjhocamieepbbabe) I built in under 4 days \u2014 it lets you **mark Netflix shows as watched** so you don\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve seen.\n\nOnce marked, it puts a little overlay on them (you can even customize how it looks). You can also choose to **hide** watched stuff (though fair warning: hiding is kinda glitchy right now lol) You can click the extension icon to open a full list of what you\u2019ve marked, jump straight to those shows, or remove stuff from the list. It\u2019s been super helpful for me since Netflix doesn\u2019t have anything like this. Its completely open source and safe.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to improve the extension just send me a dm or comment here, I will try to improve it by your feedback.

Speaking of, they just glossed over the fact that Sean Sanderson killed Caleb. Why exactly? Why did Maguire fire at Kyle in the first place? How did he know what Kyle was up to? After all of this, the whole angle with the older cop shooting his daughter knees out because he just wanted to get her to stop and talk? And then she goes off and commits suicide, almost taking out two other people while doing so? !&lt;\n\nSuper disappointed. A show hasnt gone off the rails this quickly for me since a while.

        "content": "I recently treated myself to a gorgeous **2K monitor**, excited to finally watch movies and shows in crisp detail. But when I fired up **Netflix on Safari**, the picture looked... well, **awful**. Blurry, pixelated \u2014 nothing close to the HD experience I expected. \ud83d\ude29\n\nI double-checked my internet (blazing fast), display settings (perfect), and even tried different shows. Same fuzzy quality.\n\nThat led me down a **deep rabbit hole** of research, developer tools, hidden settings, and overrides. After hours of experimenting and tweaking, I finally found a **clean, repeatable way** to unlock Netflix\u2019s **high bitrate playback** in Safari.\n\nIf you're also stuck with pixelated Netflix on your Mac and 2K display, here's the solution that worked wonders for me \ud83d\udc47\n\n# \u2705 Step 1: Enable Developer Features in Safari\n\n1. Open Safari and go to **Settings &gt; Advanced**.\n2. At the bottom, check \u2705 **\u201cShow features for web developers.\u201d**\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 1\\]*\n\n[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/h6qhgbuckfef1.png?width=1896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3232cdb46955a14e5a13688e5f0a746f05ff28d9)\n\n# \ud83d\udd13 Step 2: Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions\n\n1. From the top menu bar, click **Develop &gt; Developer Settings**.\n2. Under \u201cSecurity,\u201d check \u2705 **Disable cross-origin restrictions**.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 2\\]*\n\n[Image 2](https://preview.redd.it/6zxqz5bgkfef1.png?width=1896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b982357b15b42ef078eb83cb2208bbff8dd9312)\n\n# \ud83d\udce5 Step 3: Download the Player Script Override\n\nDownload this custom script that overrides Netflix\u2019s default playback behavior:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [**cadmium-playercore-shim.js (GitHub)**](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/Turbo-Recadmiumator/blob/master/src/cadmium-playercore-shim.js)\n\nThis lets you **manually select the highest available bitrate** for each video.\n\n# \u25b6\ufe0f Step 4\u20139: Override Netflix\u2019s Video Script\n\n1. **Play** any Netflix video.\n2. Go to **Develop &gt; Show Page Source**.\n3. In the **Sources** tab, look for the file named like `cadmium-playercore-*.js`. \ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 3\\]*\n\n[Image 3](https://preview.redd.it/amwu29elkfef1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c1e03f0048074721b4d4a11f2590347bc7c92e1)\n\n**4. Right-click** the file and choose **\u201cCreate Response Local Override.\u201d**\n\n5. Then click **\u201cMap to File\u201d** and choose the downloaded script.\n\n**6. Refresh** the Netflix tab.\n\n7. A new bitrate selector UI will appear. \ud83d\udcf8 *\\[Image 4\\]*\n\n[Image 4](https://preview.redd.it/8iw7fx3skfef1.png?width=4832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc7a3603036450de6708a1f4c63cc2aadd8a4641)\n\n8. Hit **\u201cOverride\u201d** and enjoy **buttery-smooth, sharp video**.\n\n# \ud83d\udd01 Step 10: Repeat on Every Safari Restart\n\nSafari clears overrides after closing. So you'll need to repeat steps 4\u20139 each time you reopen Safari. It takes \\~30 seconds once you're used to it.",

        "content": "When Netflix used to mail discs, specifically from 2015-2023, were the discs just of the show/movie or were they like actual discs with bonus features and everything?\n\nThis is a weirder question and if no one knows, that's perfectly okay. How specifically did you order these discs? Was it a separate site? Were there any hoops you had to jump through?\n\nDid any one of you rent The Adventures of Puss in Boots (2015)? If so, did it have the bonus features in the image? If any of you still have the discs (DVD or blu ray), would you be willing to sell them to me?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7mqedqy4cef1.jpg?width=6141&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3202c55dd884d5d3bb8ff2adbc2791de9129aa3d\n\n",
