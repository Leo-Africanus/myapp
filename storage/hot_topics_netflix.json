On the day it premiered, it suddenly had around 2,000 six-star reviews on IMDb, and almost none of them included any kind of in-depth written review.\n\nAt the same time, the show sits at 100% and 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIMDb is owned by Amazon, which is a direct competitor to Netflix through Prime Video. I can\u2019t help but wonder whether Amazon benefits when new Netflix titles are flooded with early low ratings, especially since user scores are one of the first things people check before deciding what to watch. What are your thoughts about this?",

        "title": "Frog - some questions",
        "content": "I just watched the show Frog, it's pretty good with a great vibe and an interesting story, it's just that character behaviors are absurd. Can someone explain the following:\n\n1. Why can't the protagonist report her to the cops over what she is doing to him (ignoring the kid)? \nI genuinely don't understand why the fact that he cleaned up after her makes him her hostage. She doesn't want the cops to know that she killed the kid, ok. But what does she actually have on him at all, there is no clear proof that he knew she did it when he cleaned up, and nothing stopping him from just reporting her now for harassment and trespassing - what will she do, say \"btw I also killed a kid last year and he might have realized it but didn't report me?\" There's really nothing keeping him from reporting her over what she is doing then. \n\n2. Why does he act like he can't report her for killing the kid due to lack of evidence? If he was going to report her for killing the kid, he wouldn't even need all that, since presumably the child and her personal life can be investigated and people would have noticed her child missing in real life. I do understand why he doesn't want to report it at first, I just think that acting like later he can't do it because she stole a recorded confession and a video of her leaving alone doesn't really make much difference if he wanted to talk about it\n\n\n3. Why does everyone in the show act like its impossible to arrest a person for anything unless I guess you catch them in the act? On one hand this guy thinks he will get in trouble for simply not reporting a murder no one can even prove he really knew of, and yet this woman literally slams into his car in front of the police station, walks around like a maniac , ultimately assaults (to the point where its an attempted murder) that guy and the protagonist's daughter, and yet she walks because the case isn't solid enough? I mean what more do you need aside from the two victims saying she did it to them. It's just ridiculous that on one hand you can stab and attack people but the cops can't do anything , but a guy will live like a hostage over fear of what an allegation (from the murderer) about him covering up a crime would do to him?\n\n4. Why wouldn't the father of the child report his son missing? Again, if he was in her custody and disappeared, you don't exactly need to have a footage of her killing the kid to build a case.\n\n5. Why doesn't the protagonist consult anyone, ever? Even if he was so scared of the cops, it makes no sense not to warn his daughter about the psycho who is harassing him and threatening her life. He has friends, connections, but just stays silent as if her throwing an allegation on him for supposed cover up (which can only harm her) is a figurative gun pointed at his head. Why would most people who know him even care or believe her? \n\n6. Why does the protagonist at no point change the locks?\n\nI almost burst out laughing when the genius cop (who literally did nothing to solve the case and seems to share the view raised in my point 3.) told him that he acted like any person would in his situation.\n\nFinally, this is just something I noticed in several Korean crime shows I recently watched (I still really like them), there seems to be a trend of functioning adults being ridiculously gullible and just taking everyone for their word even when it's totally absurd. Like if you just make a convoluted and dumb threat or if a totally untrustworthy person makes a promise, characters treat it like the most solid logic they can't possibly argue against.\n\n\nOverall the concept was good and I love this type of a thriller, I just think more solid rationale should have been given behind some actions. \n\nFinal comment - the psycho woman was so convincingly grating, I rarely genuinely detested a character so much, even though the protagonist himself was frustrating in his choices. I'm not even talking about the fact that she is clearly a maniac, but even her gestures, laughter, mannerisms, all made me feel this unusual aggression. I wanted to see her get punched, and it seems the show was very self aware that she'd evoke this reaction because she does get punched a lot and it's always really satisfying.",

That time has been replaced as of recent by some pretty big misses.\n\nEven the shows I can think of from this year like Untamed, Wayward, Waterfront, Hunting Wives, Black Rabbit etc are all lacking a lot. It feels like the only shows Netflix sometimes hit on are British dramas. \n\nSo if you are reluctant to check it out, don\u2019t be. (In my opinion of course) ",

It's absolutely fascinating and amazing, and there were some that were truly mind-blowing to see the intensity and also some of the games where these underdogs beat these obvious leaders or at least who look like obvious leaders. \n\n  \nAnyway, I'm personally enjoying it. I encourage you to also check it out. Definitely, I think episodes 2 and 3 onwards it becomes very intense, so if things feel a little slow in the first episode, don't give up. I highly recommend it. \n\n",
