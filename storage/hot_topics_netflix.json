Someone would have seen something. \n\nAnother thing YELLOW tells his daughter he saw her last at 1am. But the disco closed at 3 and women saw them together way after 1 oclock. Say what you want about all the evidence but the photos sold it. Even the forensics thought it was her in the photos. I\u2019ve looked at them and nearly all the prominent features are exact. I\u2019m not talking similar eyes. I\u2019m talking about eyes. Nose. Ears. Chin. Lips. Everything.\n\nThat is no coincidence it all adds up. Now I\u2019m not saying she was kidnapped for sex trafficking but what I am saying is that lady is for sure alive and did not fall off that boat. ",

Both the main characters were unappealing to me and I feel like their relationship wasn\u2019t explored enough, we were never shown actually WHY they liked each other so much. \n\nFelix was okay but I couldn\u2019t care for him. The ep about his family and SA was touching and really sad, but he had nothing else going on for him. He wasn\u2019t particularly affectionate to Jessica, wasn\u2019t shown to like her as a person rather then just being with her because she liked him, his relapse because of her was never even addressed, him still being friends and inappropriate with his exes was never resolved (I think there should\u2019ve been at least one scene where Jessica confronts him and he genuinely reassures her, since she clearly had insecurities and an \u201cother woman\u201d issue from her past relationship). He even cheats on her, NEVER apologises, and expects Jessica to give HIM a break after HER dog died a day later\u2026? UH??? A good looking bum overall. \n\nI was always on the brink of liking Jessica until she did anything. First of all I don\u2019t think the actress was a good choice, her way of acting is whiny in a really annoying way and when she was crying it felt like there was something I was supposed to find funny, but there wasn\u2019t? Her character was supposed to be weird and whimsy in an appealing and alluring way but she came off as just weird for no reason. Again I don\u2019t understand why she liked Felix first of all, I really thought he would be her \u201cI just moved to London and need a British guy to get over my evil ex\u201d who she\u2019d get over with after a bit, since she clearly didn\u2019t love him? Like, being on your phone while watching Paddington with him, saying I love you after like two days of dating,  being clearly upset at how he still interacts with so many of his exes, leaving him alone at her boss\u2019s house party, almost cheating on him on a work trip and never telling him, not wanting him to move in, accusing him of having no ambition? How were we supposed to be glad they get married in the end, they objectively aren\u2019t a good couple?\nEdit: I did love her family dynamic. It was very realistic and heartwarming coming from a family like hers.\n\nDid I get the show all wrong? Why does everyone else seem to love it?",

        "content": "I just finished watching the Amy Bradley docu. Prior to watching it, I wholly believed that she fell overboard and the family were in denial. But after watching the docu (and seeing how uncanny the similarities were in that adult escort site photo), I now think she could possibly also have been trafficked (though drowning overboard is still a possibility).\n\nHear me out - Amy was lesbian. This fact was never highlighted when I previously read about Amy prior to the docu. She was very masculine presenting and what one might term a \u2018butch\u2019. She wore masculine presenting clothes in her pictures with her friends. Her friend explained how scared she was to come out to her parents, and the disappointment the parents felt when she had told them (and how her dad wrote a 3 page letter to her then girlfriend smdh).  Her parents were obviously against her lifestyle despite saying that they \u2018loved her unconditionally\u2019. And she dealt with that unhappiness with alcohol.\n\nDespite her preference to wear masculine presenting outfits, she was literally in a DRESS with jewelry and stuff on the cruise. My conjecture is that she had tried to fit into what her parents wanted her to be (i.e. hetero) whilst she was with them on the cruise trip. And when she was approached by Yellow, she might\u2019ve probably thought well let\u2019s just try and see where this goes since my parents want me to be hetero. And hence it is possible that she had fed into her parents\u2019 dream of her being hetero when she was hanging out with Yellow, and unfortunately, eventually trafficked.\n\nHer parents are still in denial about her sexuality and you can tell from the way they speak about it that they are homophobic tbh.\n\nHappy to hear thoughts on this!",

        "content": "hey hey, just wanted to drop some opinions because i'm bursting to talk about this show and barely anyone i know has seen it yet\n\n1. omggg, from the time we got to hear the first round of singers, i was rooting for aaliyah, denzel, cameron, and katie to join together because their voices are all so rich and evocative. so when they eventually teamed up, i was SCREAMING !!\n\n2. the work ethic and unity of all the groups has been a major influence in how i view them. szn4 are my faves just because of how much time and effort they've put in, not just as a band, but as a group. i really wanted to love m2m because they're the most alternative of the bunch, but right off the bat they were all flakey \u2013 the other three just seem a lot more hard-working because conor is there to juxtapose was **bad** workmanship is. this is also the reason i'm obsessed with soulidified and why siren society are my current underdogs. both of these bands just feel like long-time friends starting a project together for the sheer enjoyment.\n\n3. the group names are KILLING me. the only one i sort of like is midnight 'til morning, but even that is lacklustre. 3quency, siren society, and soulidified are taking me out tho haha.\n\n4. not gonna get into it because the discourse around these two is already super negative. but obviously conor and alison have soured the show for me. i get showbiz and drama but the show works perfectly for all the other bands without them needing constant negativity surrounding them.\n\n5. conor's \"punk\" look had me rooting for him in the beginning, but now it kinda feels forced and performative. the \"punk\" aesthetic has no politics or morals behind it, it feels fake in a lil huddy, mgk, landon barker kinda way. and alison is really giving tess tyler from camp rock. i love a mean girl archetype but it just feels cruel, especially the digs at haley during practices, and the confrontation with erica in the booth.\n\n6. while i really felt horrible during the alison-erica confrontation, the editors really did not paint erica in a great light. the amount of scenes of this girl crying is over the top, which sucks because she has so many strong, leadership moments that get overshadowed by this framing.\n\n7. i absolutely fell in love with soulidifed. they feel so light and airy and fun. you can tell there is not toxic masculinity that side and it's so refreshing. they FEEL like how a boyband should feel, just in a modernised fashion. i'm so hopeful to see what happens with them once the show has aired and they come out with what they're doing with the band.\n\n8. what is up with the judge's commentary? for the most part, i agreed. but the criticism for siren society way outweight the compliments (def feel like that's foreshadowing their demise on the show), when i felt like their performance was the ideal girlgroup. i know nicole was probably harsher because it was her song, and i did see ehat she was saying about the sexiness feeling outdated, but what they did felt authentic and real to what i envision as a girlgroup. i've been using katseye as a litmus test during the performance episodes, and i genuinely see siren society as being the most alike to what the world wants to see.\n\n9. i can't with 3quency. i tried to like them, especially since they each had such strong solos in the booth scenes. but nori really sticks out since her voice is very youthful and unique. nori definitely has the least amount of skill and it shows. brianna sings beautifully, but the rich soulful tone feels like it would be better fitted in szn4 honestly. omg but wennely? she is just amazing. her voice blends well for a group, i just wish she was in a group that didn't feel so fragmented.\n\n10. why was the show so religious in the booth episodes lol? i feel like every second word in the booth chats was about growing up in the church, learning to sing in church choirs, pre-performance prayers, etc. it just felt so out of place for a singing reality tv show. \n\n11. the band forming mechanics were sloppy. by having the bands be allowed to be formed before all the contestants had the opportunity to perform didn't sit right. and having only 6 bands be the outcome made it feel like a race to who can slap together a band the fasted, which kinda took away from the organic ethos (which was super evident in the forming of band 6). i'm hoping it was just an editing thing, but if it wasn't, it's definitely an aspect that needs to be worked on.\n\n12. idk if there was a cap on how many members a band could have, but i don't get why alison couldn't have formed a group with elise, haley, cece, and mandy? that's 5 members which we've seen in so many bands. ig it may have been the same reasoning as 3quency where they wanted bigger roles/parts in the songs and felt their voices were strong enough to carry and full out a song? still sucks that the show seemed to put drama ahead of talent and skill.\n\n13. i love how the editors made sure to constantly remind us of people's names and what songs were being sung. if not, i would have totally forgot/glossed over major players in the show.\n\n14. not everyone who has watched this has seen popstar/dream academy. but my queen karlee was an absolutely legend in that show/project. she was in this show super briefly, and i'm so mad i didn't get to see anything of her, not a performance and no booth chats. it was nice seeing the little clips of her. anyway, she makes solo music now which is amazing (go stream), but it would've loved to see what she looked like in this setting, and hearing her compare it to dream academy.\n\nall-in-all, this show has a lot of kinks to work out. but i am rooting for this to take off because, with a little work, this show could easily be a great contender for modern day reality tv. the experiment played out exactly as it was intended, unlike other netflix reality shows, so i was super happy about that. the idea of a group of unlikely candidates coming together to make magic was brilliant, and is working well for me. what are your thoughts about the show thus far?",
