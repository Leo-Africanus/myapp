One is LG (the one with worse quality), while the other one is Samsung. Even though they're not the same size - LG - which is smaller, has a full HD panel and the picture seems to be of lower resolution. \n\nI was watching Total Drama in my sister's bedroom on her Samsung, and I noticed quite a difference in quality. Everything was much sharper and the colours stood out.\n\nWhat am I to do? It's not that Netflix on LG is unwatchable, but I would prefer it being better.\n\nP.S. Both televisions are connected to the same WIFI network.",

        "content": "Dear Netflix,\n\nI pay for the full UHD 4K plan because when I do watch something, I want the best quality available. Honestly, I don\u2019t watch Netflix that often, and I\u2019ve debated whether it\u2019s worth keeping given the price. But when a show I\u2019m excited about drops, I expect it to be available in top quality, that\u2019s what I\u2019m paying for.\n\nSo when Drive to Survive came out, I was really looking forward to downloading it and watching on my iPad Pro while on vacation. But the quality has been massively disappointing. I\u2019ve double-checked my settings, my Wi-Fi, and even looked up discussions here and elsewhere to troubleshoot. I see that there might be some factors outside of Netflix\u2019s control, but the bottom line is that other streaming platforms (Apple, for example) don\u2019t seem to have this issue.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a Netflix-side problem or something with the service provider, it\u2019s frustrating. At this price point, I expect reliability. If I can\u2019t count on getting the high-quality experience I\u2019m paying for when I actually want to use it, it\u2019s hard to justify keeping my subscription.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing the same issue?",
