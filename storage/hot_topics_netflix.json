        "title": "Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated on Netflix is NOT a prequel to Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!",
        "content": "I keep seeing on this sub that Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated (SDMI) is a prequel to Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! (SDWAY), but I struggle to see how that could be the case. While the ending does reset Crystal Cove to a timeline where there was no influence from the Evil Entity\u2014complete with the gang driving off into the sunset with a 1960s Hanna-Barbera-style laugh track\u2014several inconsistencies prevent this from leading directly into the events of SDWAY.  \n\nFirst off, canonically, Coolsville has always been the gang\u2019s origin. This has been consistent in nearly every Scooby-Doo movie and series until SDMI. Secondly, SDMI features a museum displaying the costumes of unmasked villains from SDWAY, suggesting that SDWAY already exists within the SDMI universe. Additionally, Fred and Daphne appear visibly shaken when they see a synthetic replica of Scrappy-Doo in the same museum, a direct reference to Scooby-Doo (2002).  \n\nFor SDMI to lead into SDWAY, the gang would have had to lose their memories\u2014just like the other residents of Crystal Cove\u2014which clearly does not happen. When they leave town for college, they still remember all their past cases, despite those events technically never having taken place in the new timeline. This means that the individuals who would have become villains in SDWAY lived different lives and never donned their infamous disguises.  \n\nIf anything, the ending of SDMI erases the events of SDWAY rather than setting them up. This would suggest that SDWAY is actually a prequel to SDMI, with the most likely sequel being What\u2019s New, Scooby-Doo? (WNSD). However, due to the timeline alterations in SDMI, I\u2019d rather view it as a standalone, non-canon series\u2014or possibly part of a Scooby-Doo multiverse. Since Scooby-Doo is technically part of the DC Universe, the latter isn't entirely out of the question.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts? ",

And movies like Trainwreck, while not great, still have had some merit. But my GOD -- Kinda Pregnant, which debuted today on Netflix, is fully unwatchable -- it's like a Z-grade Adam Sandler movie (and funnily enough, Adam Sandler's nephew, Tyler Spindel, directs this atrocity!), with a \"wild and wacky\" plot that is completely over the top and characters who are not in any way recognizably human. And Schumer actually co-wrote the script, so she can't blame this on bad writing. It is ATROCIOUS. Watched about 30 minutes and flipped it off, both literally and figuratively. Schumer really seems to be in a very bad place if this garbage is any indication.",
