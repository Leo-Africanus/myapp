        "content": "In general, I like Gordon and have eaten at two of his restaurants in London. The food was very good. He can cook, he is a competent chef no doubt.\n\nHe is also a brand rather than a chef these days, and he works with media very well.\n\nThis whole documentary could have been half its length very easily. A lot of it felt very repetitive.\n\nYes, there are always some growing pains when opening a new restaurant. Yes, the food looks fabulous and influencers are gonna love it. Is it sustainable? Is it nutritious?! What about the overall environmental impact of serving this kind of food during the winter in London. Nobody asks these questions that matter more and more.\n\nWhat honestly bothered me was his empty-eyed wife having so much space where she didn\u2019t really say anything too interesting. If you cut her bits out nothing of substance would be missing.\n\nHe brings up the wedding of his daughter so many times yet it is not a part of this documentary so we don\u2019t even get to see the dress, flowers or food. Just an engagement party that feels a bit forced as the cameras are there.\n\nIt is an ad for his new restaurant in London, and the bits about him being a family man felt incredibly disingenuous and staged. He does a lot of cuddling with the kids but very little parenting. He doesn\u2019t even cook for them in the show.\n\nHe says he loves his kids so much yet is gone easily six weeks at a time. His whole arrival in a helicopter to their country house in Cornwall was just silly and wasteful. He honestly comes across an absent father no matter the editing.\n\nHim talking about fitness? Bro I was a volunteer at London Marathon in 2009 and you didn\u2019t even make it past 10 km. I was waiting to snap your photo yet you never made it to my mark (mile 15). Like give me a break. You travel, take photos with fans, shake hands, make TV shows, you have zero time for fitness or your kids so you\u2019re in no position to lecture anyone about buying iPads for their kids.\n\nOverall, there was very little food shown, too much disingenuous family moments that weren\u2019t even interesting, too much talking by his wife saying absotely nothing, and all those emotional reveals were spoken about many times before.\n\nA total meh for me",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to understand how Netflix classifies Windows devices and chooses codecs, and I\u2019m hoping someone here might have deeper insight into what\u2019s happening.\n\nSystem:\n\nASUS VivoBook X515EA\n\ni3-1115G4 (Intel UHD / Xe-LP, Gen 12)\n\n8GB RAM\n\nWindows 11\n\nInternal 1920\u00d71080 panel (~200 nits)\n\n200 Mbps internet\n\nMicrosoft Edge (latest stable)\n\n\n\n---\n\nBackground (briefly)\n\nInitially I experimented quite a bit trying to get Netflix to stream 4K to my 1080p panel for the higher bitrate and let it downscale. I now understand that without a certified 4K HDCP 2.2 display attached, Netflix won\u2019t send the UHD ladder. I\u2019ve accepted that and moved on.\n\nDuring that process I also tried various \u201cNetflix 4K\u201d / codec-related browser extensions and other tweaks. None of them changed the actual codec ladder being served.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m not chasing 4K anymore.\n\n\n---\n\nCurrent goal: HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to achieve now is much simpler:\n\nI just want Netflix to use HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR instead of AVC (H.264).\n\nHere\u2019s the consistent behavior:\n\nHDR OFF \u2192 always avc1 (H.264), ~3 Mbps at 1920\u00d71080\n\nHDR ON \u2192 switches to HEVC (Main10 HDR ladder works correctly)\n\n\nSo clearly:\n\nHEVC decoding works on this system\n\nAV1 decoding is supported (confirmed in edge://gpu)\n\nHardware video decode is active\n\nPlayback is smooth, no dropped frames\n\n\nHowever, in SDR mode Netflix never selects HEVC or AV1. It always falls back to AVC.\n\n\n---\n\nDRM detail (important part)\n\nFrom the Netflix debug overlay:\n\nIn SDR mode \u2192 KeySystem: com.widevine.alpha.SW_SECURE_DECODE\n\nPlayReady Hardware DRM is not disabled, but SDR sessions appear to use Widevine software secure decode.\n\n\nThis makes me wonder whether the codec ladder selection is tied to DRM path classification.\n\nWhen HDR is enabled, the ladder changes and HEVC is used.\nWhen HDR is disabled, it falls back to Widevine SW secure decode + AVC.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019ve verified\n\nHardware acceleration enabled in Edge\n\nHEVC and AV1 decode supported by GPU\n\nVideo decode shows as hardware accelerated\n\nPlayReady not disabled\n\nOnly internal display active\n\nVirtual display drivers removed (used earlier while experimenting with 4K)\n\nClean system state\n\nTested multiple recent Netflix originals\n\n\nStill locked to AVC for 1080p SDR.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to understand\n\nIs Netflix assigning certain Windows laptop device classes to an \u201cHD SDR AVC\u201d tier regardless of decode capability?\n\nEven if the GPU supports HEVC and AV1, does server-side device classification override that and force AVC for SDR under Widevine SW secure decode?\n\nHas anyone with a similar Intel Gen 11 UHD system managed to get HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR on Windows?\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine whether this is:\n\nA configurable limitation\n\nA DRM / pipeline limitation\n\nOr purely server-side policy\n\n\nAny technical insight would be appreciated.\n\nAnd yes, I did use AI to get this post written since I\u2019ve been troubleshooting this for a while and wanted to present the details clearly. At this point I\u2019m just hoping someone here might have insight I\u2019ve missed.",

        "content": "Just started watching Stranger Things on Netflix and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I love anything set in the nineteen eighties because that was when I just came into my teenage years so the music, the fashions, even the rotary phone on the wall brings back some wonderful memories of a bygone time. The kids are really likeable and goofy much like the kids I grew up with. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn\u2019t already stumbled upon it ",

        "content": "It appears my Netflix account got hacked about 4 days ago at 2am. No one else has access to my account. \n\nGot an email from Netflix confirming my email address change &amp; that I would receive no more emails at that address. Called Netflix, they confirmed someone changed both the email AND credit card billing\u2014to what end? Why would they not just use the credit card that I had stored?\n\nAlso odd (and frustrating), tech support asked to confirm the payment method I\u2019ve been using for that account in order to verify my identity since name &amp; everything else was changed, and they can\u2019t find any record of billing with that credit card. I\u2019m sitting here staring at my credit card statement with 5+ years of Netflix payments on it.\n\n \n\nThey weren\u2019t able to give me my account back since I \u201ccouldn\u2019t confirm\u201d my payment method, so now they\u2019ve just cancelled the account &amp; I have to make a new one. Went ahead &amp; changed my password on that email &amp; ordered a new credit card number.\n\nAnything else I need to do? What was the point of hacking my account just to enter their own payment info? ",

        "content": "It\u2019s 2026, is there FINALLY options for the screensaver?? It drives me absolutely nuts that it turns on after just five minutes, and then quickly flashes through promos for other shows the whole time. Plus it being three buttons to get back to playing my show once I\u2019m ready. As someone that hates flashing images (especially in the background) and pauses frequently, it gets very annoying so I thought I\u2019d finally ask. I tried to look for settings within the Netflix app on my tv, but there\u2019s nothing there. Perhaps I need to gain access to a desktop computer if there\u2019s a setting to change it there? ",

        "content": "The first episode were these 2 high school boys who investigated their school mascot (which kinda looked like big bird, just big and yellow but I don\u2019t remember if it was actually a bird). Turns out it was a living thing. At one point they ended up trapped in the basement, almost gassed, and they escaped to the gymnasium. Somehow they looked into the mascots mouth and it ate them, and the episode ended with them trapped in its stomach. Sounds like a fever dream now that I think about it.",
