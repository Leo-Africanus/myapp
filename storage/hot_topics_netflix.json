The film\u2019s strength lies in its authenticity; every laugh, heartbreak, and quiet moment feels genuine, drawing you into their world. It serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting and impactful those youthful adventures can be.\n\nI really miss road movies like this, where a group of friends embarks on a journey to discover something meaningful.\n\nWhat did you think about this movie? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and feelings after watching it!\n\nAlso, if you have any recommendations for similar movies, please share them below!",

The whole thing about millions of fake accounts being created under people\u2019s names without their knowledge was wild enough, but what got me was how little control regular people had over their own personal information once it was in the system. It makes me think about it, are our systems really that vulnerable nowadays that something like this can just happen to anyone? We spend so much time being told to make stronger passwords and enable 2FA, but if a bank or data broker already has your personal info in their system, what stops it from being misused?",

The demons didn't have anything relating to demons, besides ugly ahh costumes and marks \ud83d\ude2d\n\nKny &gt; when I watched kpop I wanted to see the strength and abilities the demons in kny have, like if you asked me. Even the weakest demons in kny would kill the kpop demons ... Like I wanna see battle when it comes to fighting demons. wdym \"sing a song defeat demons\" ? That's a whole lot of LAME\n\nYeah kpdh is a show for kids so not lots of battles with bl00d fighting ect, but I mean nothing stopped 10yr me from watching kny. So it's just my opinion that the show felt boring, I don't care if your a kpdh fan tryna defend the show. We all know which is better dealt with demons, again it's a kid show so nothing crazy. Still felt like they could have least added more details and such. \n\n(Ik the creators wanted the show to be like 3 smth hours but but down to 1? Idk, I don't watch YouTube shorts enough to know much about the show)\n\nBut that's my opinion, it's just a show but I wanted to share what I think \u2764 it's not that deep rlly it isn't.

So instead of paying the $17.99/month plan, I see there is one for $10 cheaper that has ads. \nDoes anyone have that plan, and how long are the ads? Are they show specific, or am I going to get ads for fucking prescriptions and credit cards on here now too? ",
