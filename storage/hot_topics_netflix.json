        "content": "So I had this idea come out as a solution to when people have lots of shows backlogged on Netflix (any other streaming app tbh) and shows they\u2019ve been planning to watch becomes too overwhelming for the person. \n\nSo the solution is that Netflix would have like a broadcast schedule of all the shows they have on their catalog and treat it as a normal cable broadcast schedule, so if you feeling bored one day, or don\u2019t know what you want to watch, then you put on the channel and a random episode of a random show in their catalog would be playing and it\u2019d have a list of the other shows it plans to play next, if you find that episode really good, you\u2019d either leave the channel and go binge the show or you watch it to the end and when the next show comes on,you watch smth new and refreshing. \n\nIt\u2019ll basically take out the decision making process of what shows to watch but also makes it easy to find new shows to watch. It could also help you finish backlogged shows, as it would have a regular time slot on the schedule, so you don\u2019t have to find time to watch a show yk. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the bait for Netflix, they can promote shows they wanna promote and also show love to the shows they\u2019ve tried to murder (indirectly), but still have a dedicated fanbase, easily without putting too much effort, so it\u2019s a win-win for all parties. And the the best time for them is that they have more Ad slots to sell, for more money, I\u2019m not a fan of that, but the worlds based on Give and Take (and money) unfortunately.\n\nThe ideas not fully fleshed out but I\u2019d like to hear what people think about this and the pros, cons, the changes needed to make it feasible. Honestly, your thoughts on general, would be greatly appreciated.",
