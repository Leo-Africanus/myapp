        "content": "Disclaimer - I don't expect 100% realism in fiction. That's what documentaries are supposed to be for. I'm also a big sci-fi fan, so I can enjoy watching fantastical and implausible scenarios.\n\nBut I just don't see the point of setting a TV show in a real-world setting if you are going to completely distort that setting. That just makes it annoying, not fun.\n\nThis brings me to Hostage, the new political thriller about a British Prime Minister's husband being kidnapped, starring Suranne Jones and Julie Delpy. The sheer number of inaccuracies in the show are too numerous to point out (Oldham FC, anyone?). Mostly, they are the result of sloppy shortcuts in the writing.\n\nSo I'll just focus on the big one. The premise itself is simply not viable. There's absolutely no point in a kidnapper demanding that a British PM resign, because they can resign and then be reinstated almost immediately after the victim is released. Even if the kidnapper insisted on them resigning as a Member of Parliament, this presents only a minor technical hurdle to them being re-appointed.\n\nI can forgive shows taking liberties with reality if they're getting to the heart of an emotional issue. But this show doesn't do that because the whole family vs country dilemma doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Yet again I despair at the TV industry spending millions of pounds bringing together a huge agglomeration for talent for something that doesn't make the slightest sense.",

Top Notch production and very great casting. Great pacing. A little drawn out during certain moments, however the writing was phenomenal. Maybe I haven't watched a very very good murder mystery, but this was really good. I dont know what the general consensus is, It was a netflix show I took a shot on and it was a good shot. ",

I told her to set it up and I'd work on the ads thing. Called today and they said, NOT ONLY do I have to wait for the next billing cycle (3 weeks) to upgrade it, but they have to completely delete her account and terminate all the data to then add her back without ads...\n\nFirst, I've never heard of a company making it impossible to upgrade a service mid-billing cycle. Seems to just be bad business. But also that we have to delete her data? They already deleted all my add'l a year ago, which happened to millions, and then blamed it on me. I'm so fed up with these people but I cant cancel because my family pays for every other streaming service and they say theyll kick me off those if i cancel this one. *end rant* ",

        "content": "Currently watching bloodline on episode 22 and it\u2019s been an interesting watch so far. I must say Danny has been a menace ever since the show started to introduce what his real motive for coming back was. \n\nDid anyone watch this show and begin to think of their own family to some degree? I understand that no family is perfect and we all have our issues but wow Danny was like a bad omen to the Rayburns lol",

        "content": "Netflix's recommendation system is meant to be top tier and they spend millions of dollars in R&amp;D making it incredibly good. But in terms of user experience, all I'm seeing is an endless feed of content that *might* be something that I would like but I would have no way of knowing until I consume enough of the content to have a good opinion on. The endless scroll recommendation system works great for something like TikTok because the content is literally a minute long but I'm not gonna spend twenty or thirty minutes on the off chance that I might like some show in my recommended feed.\n\nNetflix needs to add in a chatbot that not only recommends movies/shows based on what you have seen before, but also explains why you would like it and basically sells you on why it would be good.",
