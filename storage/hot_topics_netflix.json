The production cooked; shooting and editing were elite. One reason that I found it so entertaining was that the first two episodes set up such a satisfying twist in the last episode.\n\nKC and Everett are hysterical foils of each other, not to mention they're both absolutely fucked as individuals. Everyone interviewed are such good storytellers, having a certain southern style humor/charm that doesn't get old quickly. The ending is so good too; there's a feeling of a hero's redemption with KC which ties the story very nicely. All in all, super impressed and grateful to see Netflix invest in this show.
