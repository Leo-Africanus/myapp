I\u2019d rather see romance handled with more maturity and subtlety.\n\nActing quality is really important to me. I\u2019ve tried some Netflix shows where the performances felt too forced or awkward, and it completely pulled me out of the story. If the acting isn\u2019t excellent, at least I\u2019d prefer it to be decent and natural.\n\nI\u2019ve already watched *The Witcher* and *Wednesday*. I was planning to watch *Sabrina*, but I\u2019ve heard she has too many love interests, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d enjoy that. The acting seems decent, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it.\n\nFantasy is my first choice, but if there\u2019s nothing that fits these preferences, I\u2019m also open to non-fantasy shows.",
