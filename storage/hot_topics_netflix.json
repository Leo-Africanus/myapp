There is some good acting and actors that carry the story, as well as some not very good acting and actors that actually (whether intentionally or not) keep it light and silly, but I didn\u2019t actually see that as a turnoff.\n\nIf I expected Black Sails I\u2019d probably hate it, but my wife and I found ourselves bingeing it and laughing with it (and sometimes at it which was just as enjoyable). The story wasn\u2019t deep but kept us watching all the same, would definitely watch a second season.\n\nDid anyone else get into it?",

        "content": "I'm watching \"The Closer\" and finding that the English subtitles are riddled with errors, way worse than any other show I've seen. It's mainly typos, where it looks like a bad copy-paste from the previous screen, with extra characters attached to the end of words, though occasionally they get words wrong.\n\nI started to hit the flag button to report errors every time I found one, but I found that I'm submitting multiple reports per episode.\n\nDoes anybody here know if someone at Netflix actually reads these reports and makes corrections to subtitles? If so, it's worth my time to keep doing it. But if they're just being ignored or going into the void and won't result in a better viewing experience for others, I'll just ignore all the errors and not bother reporting them.",

        "content": "One could say \"it's easy to make a show with a 'sketch' animation approach\". Another could say \"It's been done\". Perhaps both views can be correct, but it is safe to say the medium has found its intended audience in 'Samuel', a light hearted, and uniquely rich journey through the eyes of a young boy who uses sketch animation to bring life to the various stories which compromise his diary. \n\nSamuel demonstrates a micro series type of storytelling, making short entries in a diary each a distinct episode, while tying them together through the common themes of growing up, falling in love, and socializing as a preteen. \n\nThe messages of each story are often as relatable as they are personal, rich with flaws of life as a child growing up at the turn of the century. The additional wrinkle of 'Samuel' taking place in the early 00's makes it as much a fresh experience for younger audiences, as it is a look back for older ones. \n\n'Samuel' may perform well as its own one season micro series, or it may continue to grow as the titular character does. In either case, such a vibrant, heartfelt experience told in such a succinct way is a welcome addition to the world of 'coming of age' media. It is a beautiful story that will leave one not only looking back, but looking forward.",

        "content": "Can anyone tell me why the show Vikings is missing huge chunks of the show out of the episodes on Netflix? It will jump from one scene to the next without any context making it look like it was not only poorly written but poorly filmed. I watched this show from start to finish when it was made and decided to go back and re-watch it, but it's all effed up. Huge pieces are missing. Going from one episode to the next. It makes no sense and is a travesty considering the importance of this show. What the hell are they doing? ",
