It was cool seeing how their reunion tour revitalised their careers again. I wasn't aware the band has been active for the past 10 years.\n\nDidn't Robbie Williams have a biopic movie last year?

        "content": "Wow, so many rules.  \nI can't even mention certain terms without them being removed by a bot.  Well then, how about my take on this show?\n\nOkay, so firstly I commend the effort to have a very quirky and different type of story telling. I am unfamiliar with this universe, so I had an open mind. Quickly I noticed that the acting, while over the top at times, was actually pretty good, but there are things in it that make me wonder about the writers.  \nSecondly but also possible spoiler if you read this first but holy carp a DINO EGG?! Come on. Not a fireball, not a rematerialization, no not at all instead a rather round huge egg way far off from where the group was...very interesting direction leaving it open to possibly another chapter however strange of a twist, which I am not gonna lie, I would watch it too.\n\nThis feels more like a anime with less over the top action than a real motion show...it is strange and satirical at times and I am not sure it was meant to be...\n\nI really love that farm hand in the one scene was Hammish from Viva La Dirt League over on youtube. Honestly some of the VLDL crew are wonderful actors and so fun.\n\nI guess if I was giving it a rating I would probably rate this as a solid 8 out of 10, but add a bonus point for the naivety of the entire thing. Normally something like this would not hit but somehow works with this series. SO deal with a 9 out of 10. If you want that last single digit point you are gonna have to make another season!\n\nSecond time posting this, hope it does not get auto removed this time.\n\nThanks.",
