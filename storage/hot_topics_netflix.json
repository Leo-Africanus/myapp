There\u2019s no point in making it less likely I\u2019d open my Netflix app. The only reason I renewed my subscription because I was told they finally integrated into Apple TV. Like I don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m basically paying for cable again with all the subscriptions I have. But taking away the convenience of the modern day tech is stupid. I like that Apple tells me about shows that are coming out from all my apps and and I just click continue watching. I don\u2019t want to load up an app and scroll through all the ways companies organize their apps to show me what they want, not what I want. Ugh honestly I\u2019m sure they have their financially sound reasons and I\u2019m just venting. Either way, all these battles companies are having is preventing us from having an enjoyable experience and I guess im about to cancel Netflix again. I watch everything from Apple TV. I always end up forgetting about Netflix then I\u2019m paying for an app I haven\u2019t used in a year. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
