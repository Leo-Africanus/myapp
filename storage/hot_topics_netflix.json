        "content": "I assume everybody here is aware of the release of the new season of \"Stranger Things\", so I'm no different and decided to watch it as soon as someone told me about it.\n\nI'm not a big a fan of watching any kind of TV shows \u2014 at most I would watch a movie once a month and that's pretty much it. And the thing that got me really confused about this new season of Stranger Things is that it's not even the plot, or atmosphere that makes you binge watch it as soon as you finish 1st episode \u2014 it's the effects, cuts, timing and how it's put together that makes you want to watch it.\n\nLet me cllarify it for you: when you watch movies (or some TV shows too, like Better Call Saul) from 10-20 years ago like Matrix, Inception, Shutter island you just want to keep watching it because of how amazed you are by the plot and the twists are so unpredictable that you have these \"a-ha\" moments where you picture the whole image in your head with the wow effect.\n\nIn case with this new season though, the plot itself seemed okay to me, but while watching it I had a feeling that I'm watching tiktok lol. Just how fast-paced it seemed to me and the constant change of the enviroment, going back and forth between characters. As soon as you supposed to get bored and chill, produecer hits you with another dopamine hit to keep you engaged. So after watching first episode I turned it off as I knew where it was leading \u2014 watching it until 4 am.\n\nIf that't the case, it's not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 they are just evolving to attention span of its users and that's it.\n\n**Is it just my observation or there's somebody else who also felt that way? How do they make them so addictive to keep watching and what are the tricks that are using?**",

But I'm wondering about true Netflix movies and series that are distributed by Netflix themselves. Shows like Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, The Crown, Stranger Things, etc. Or, more recent films like Jay Kelly, Train Dreams etc. Then there are also a lot of shows that are aired on other streaming platforms or networks but are labelled as \"Netflix Originals\" in other countries (like Riverdale etc). \n\nI just like to watch more Netflix originals (movies + shows) that are really by them. There are a lot of movies released on Netflix almost weekly and I'd just want to make it easier to search. Thank you!",

Another episode was there was this well in this kids back yard that did something I can't remember what I'm pretty sure it was time traveling forward.

No one else on the show has such strange contacts in\u2026 \n\nIt honestly looks like she is wearing gag gift/Halloween costume contact lenses sometimes! Has anyone else noticed this? I am only on season one, so do they get better over time? Or is this something I should just do better ignoring?

        "content": "Not sure if I'm phrasing it correctly but for 1 certain show it won't remove the overlay.\nIf I go back to the menu it forgets my progress in the show. \n\nI've tried other shows and they don't have this issue. \n\nI can't press pause, only button that works is the back button or home button. \nIt seems like it is not registering that I'm watching something as it constantly jumps to the \"sleep menu that you usually get from being idle in netflix main menu\"\n\n\nAnyone know how to fix this?\nI tried reopening netflix but it didn't help",
