        "title": "I'm obsessed with the tiger and magpie in Kpop Demon Hunters",
        "content": "The tiger and the magpie were easily my favourite characters in the movie, and if you\u2019re also into art and mythology like I am, here\u2019s a little background on their historical references.\n\nIn traditional Korean art, the white tiger and magpie often appear together in a style called [Jakhodo](https://exhibitions.asianart.org/exhibitions/jakhodo-today/#:~:text=The%20tiger%20and%20magpie%20pairing%20appears%20so%20frequently%20in%20Korean%20art%20that%20it%20comprises%20its%20own%20genre%3A%20jakhodo%2C%20paintings%20depicting%20tigers%20and%20magpies) (*jak* = magpie, *ho* = tiger, *do* = painting). These images were used as talismans to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe tiger was intentionally given those ridiculous, bulging yellow eyes to make it look dumb. That\u2019s why it\u2019s traditionally nicknamed \u201cidiot tiger\u201d (\ubc14\ubcf4\ud638\ub791\uc774), and the paintings are often called *\u201cIdiot Tiger and Scolding Magpie.\u201d* So, in its introduction scene when the magpie looked annoyed and judgmental that was on purpose.\n\nThis art style is part of a genre called [Kkachi Horangi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhwa#:~:text=Kkachi%20horangi%20(%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4)%20is,structure%20of%20Joseon%27s%20feudal%20society), and it\u2019s basically satire. The goofy-looking tiger represents authority (intentionally depicted as silly and clumsy like corrupt officials or clueless aristocrats), and the magpie is the voice of the common people, calling them out.\n\nWhen Jinu mentioned he made the hat for the tiger but the bird kept stealing it, that was a reference to a real J[oseon-era Minhwa painting that shows a tiger smoking a pipe and wearing a top hat](https://korelimited.com/blogs/korelimited/the-korean-tiger-a-hallmark-of-korean-identity#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking%20features%20of%20art%20portraying%20the%20Korean%20tiger%20is%20the%20eyes%3B%20they%20are%20often%20bulging%20and%20painted%20a%20bright%20yellow.%20This%20is%20a%20recurring%20aspect%20of%20most%2C%20if%20not%20all%20art%20with%20the%20tiger%20as%20its%20subject), while a magpie stands nearby.\n\nThe White Tiger (Baekho in Korean) is also one of the Four Holy Beasts in Sino-Korean mythology, symbolising the West and the element of metal. It\u2019s a powerful, protective figure with deep cultural significance.\n\nI actually did a breakdown of the movie and shared some theories about the tiger in a separate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lmhs7a/kpop_demon_hunters_movie_analysis_theories/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) if anyone\u2019s interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8slwt5zaz2af1.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813ed2ffe493193302e9f83b02839916a0229094",

        "content": "This new season made me compelled to write this : I do hope he is a good person IRL, but wow, watching this show makes me feel really touched by the small gestures he does throughout the trips to these different countries. \n\nYes, the family connection is there with his wife, his kids, his brother, and previously his parents (RIP). He's been able to pivot to \"Jokes for Max\" in a really heartwarming way. \n\nBut there are two points I want to emphasize:\n\n1). How in recent seasons when he is traveling he is very conscious to discuss the societal issues and humanitarian efforts going on in all of these countries/cities. It might feel heavy handed at times, but it is the minimum he can do to raise awareness for good causes.\n\n2). How he treats the people he works with and the people he cares about. Almost always in each episode he has a scene where he's having the camera crew getting in on trying the food, too. He will typically treat the local fixers to meals which reinforces this as well. But most of all what I thought was touching this season were his personal stories with his dad's Filipino nurse and his Guatemalan nanny - how he went out of his way to honor them during these journeys. \n\nCombined to me shows someone who cares for his staff no matter how long you worked for him. Feeling like the Everybody Loves Raymond royalties are doing a bit of good in their afterlife. \n\nPhil if you see this, I love ya. \n\n",

        "content": "From start to finish, it was visually stunning, a true cinematic masterpiece. But what really stood out to me was the dialogue and the storytelling. The writing was incredible. Everything was so intentional and meaningful\u2014it all felt purposeful and symbolic.\n\nTake player 149, for example. She killed her own son (007) to save player 222 and her newborn. That parallel\u2014of a mother sacrificing her own child so another mother and baby could live\u2014was so powerful. It captured the essence of what it means to be a mother, and it really emphasized the value of life. It wasn\u2019t just tragic and it made sense, emotionally and narratively.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s In-ho. I genuinely think he wanted Gi-hun to win. When he offered Gi-hun the knife, it felt like he was testing him\u2014to see if he would break character, to see if Gi-hun would abandon his morals. When In-ho asked, \u201cDo you still have faith in people?\u201d\u2014that line hit hard. And the answer came, not in words, but in action. By choosing not to sacrifice the baby, Gi-hun showed that he still had faith in humanity.\n\nGi-hun\u2019s final words before his death\u2014\u201cWe are not horses. We are humans. Humans are\u2026\u201d that monologue was insane. So layered. It brought everything full circle: from him gambling on horses in the beginning to the VIPs betting on players in the game. That line wasn\u2019t just for the VIPs\u2014it was for us, the audience. A reminder that greed and selfishness can lead to disunity and inhumanity in our society. \n\nI could talk about this season forever. If you\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts too :) ",

        "content": "Why does Netflix not get that no one wants to play video games from Netflix? Why does it keep pushing this? I see GTA San Andreas every day on my homepage as if I did not play that game 15 years ago. People who play video games certainly would never use Netflix to do it. PlayStation and Xbox, etc, are the preferred options for that. Netflix should stay with movies and shows.",

But I\u2019m very happy to see they have Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s movies. I would love to see more Asian horror movies like my favs a tale of two sisters, juon series, and ringu. I don\u2019t know if those were ever on Netflix but I hope to see it there one day!",

        "content": "Hi I pay for Netflix Premium and according to the Account &gt; Membership tab in my account, I should be getting 2 extra members 'for an additional $8.99/mo' which I am currently paying.\n\nThe problem is it's only allowing me 1 member. There's another slot that says '1 slot available' however there's no button or option to add a person, the only clickable button is 'Buy another slot' which is charging me ANOTHER $8.99 for that second member. \n\nIs anyone else running into this issue? It seemed to have just started today or recently. Up until now I've had 2 members without a problem, but now it's only showing one and the second one costs extra, although it's stating i get 2 extra members with my current tier. HELP!",

        "content": "I think it\u2019s my favorite game scene in the show, down to the way it\u2019s filmed and the design of the game itself. The frantic, quick music represents the atmosphere and the blinking lights add to the atmosphere of panic. With an extremely time limit, hoards of people and a need for face paced decision making, the game really brings out the worst and shows what people will do when placed under high stress situations. I know that\u2019s what most of the games are supposed to do, but this one just makes it better because when placed in a situation like this where everyone is yelling, people make decisions that might not be what they would usually do, but what they need to survive. I don\u2019t know if this makes any sense, I just needed to rant.",
