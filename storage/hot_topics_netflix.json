        "content": "There\u2019s a part of the fandom that\u2019s using the argument that Stranger Things is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi, with fun cast and emotions, but this does not sit right with me at all. \n\nThe show not only has taken so long to finish, but has also been (I think?) Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

I should also mention that I\u2019m currently using ChatGPT to translate, as I\u2019m French.\n\nMy problem can be summed up very simply: I no longer have Netflix in 4K.\n\nI\u2019ll immediately answer the various questions you might want to ask to help solve my issue:\n\n* Yes, I do have the 4K Premium subscription;\n* Yes, I have purchased and downloaded the HEVC Codec from the Windows Store;\n* Yes, I am using Edge (more specifically, the Netflix app, which is basically Edge);\n* Yes, I have tested with Edge directly and without the app;\n* Yes, I have turned off my second monitor;\n* Yes, I have disabled NVIDIA Instant Replay.\n\nI\u2019ve been watching my 4K-available series and movies on Netflix since 2022, and I\u2019ve never had any issues until now. I\u2019ve always managed to find the solution on my own whenever 4K stopped working (disabling NVIDIA Replay, turning off my second monitor, etc.). But this time, honestly, I\u2019m stuck. I don\u2019t understand why, all of a sudden, I no longer see 4K displayed when I press CTRL + ALT + Shift + D. It shows 1080p instead, even though I haven\u2019t changed anything and this happened overnight.\n\nI should still point out one thing: I\u2019m used to what 4K looks like and what 1080p looks like, and honestly\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m watching my movies and series in 1080p, despite what CTRL + ALT + Shift + D indicates. Maybe it says 1080p but it\u2019s an error. Just in case, you\u2019ll find the bitrate shown in the screenshot below.\n\n[https://prnt.sc/9f1A7PSXMvMD](https://prnt.sc/9f1A7PSXMvMD)\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

        "content": "I finished the second season of \u201cThe Accident\u201d just now and there is one thing I felt to not really be logical. So, everything was going \u2018well\u2019 up until Yola visits Lupita in jail and gives her poisoned candy. Alright that, even though, in my opinion, that is also not as logical (even though I get the reference to Moncho\u2019s death and that it was supposed to be ironic) as Yola\u2019s, even if lied, words that she would much rather Lupita rot in prison for all those years. Wouldn\u2019t that give Yola more satisfaction rather than an easy way out for Lupita? It just genuinely didn\u2019t make sense to me, even though I get what the show was trying to do, again, with the irony of Lupita ending up the same way as her victim but at the hands of the victim\u2019s wife\u2019s hands, I get it. But at the same time I don\u2019t find it the logical outcome for the show. \n\nNext, and this is honestly my main point about this, why the hell would Lupita, who poisoned multiple people herself in such a way, eat this candy given to her by someone who has exceptional hatred against her no less? It leads me to believe that she knew the candy would be poisoned and just wanted to use it to commit suicide. I can not explain it in any other way. There is no way she ate that candy, really believing Yola\u2019s words that the candy isn\u2019t poisoned. If that IS what happened then that does not make any damn sense and is downright stupid. \n\nWhat did you guys think of this part? ",
