They should come with a warning at the beginning letting viewers know it's a 1 season show so you can decide if yiu even want to bother or not. \nIf Netflix wasn't free with my T-Mobile service I would have canceled it. I'm getting pretty tired of Prime doing the same, or maybe worse, taking years to come out with new seasons. And even then they only have 6, or if you're lucky, 8 episodes. I really miss when shows had a new season every year, right around then same time as the last, and where 12 to 20 episodes depending on whether it was cable or network tv. ",

        "content": "Ive had a continuous Netflix subscription since probably 2009 or 2010, pretty close to whenever they started doing streaming. Ive found the selection to be decreasing over the years, but i get that as new services started, networks wanted to get their hit shows back, and server space costs money. Even when I struggled to find anything worth watching, there was usually at least a couple things I wanted to watch. \n\nOther services I was more willing to cancel and restart as throughout the years, but Netflix just felt like a staple.\n\nOnce they eliminated the standard plan, and moved me to the ad supported, I really started to get annoyed. All of the sudden, a decent chunk of content was unavailable without upgrading to the $18/mo plan. Ads start sometimes mid-sentence, even in TV shows that were originally aired with commercials and sketch comedy shows, which have perfect, logical places to insert commercials. And the price just keeps rising while the amount and quality(imo) of the content declines. Personally, I don't play the games on Netflix, and I don't need to see another Tyson/Paul ballet. Maybe some people find value in that, but not me.\n\nThen, this weekend, I saw that The new Venom movie and Kraven had just been added... two movies that were pretty universally panned, but as a former comic book kid, I always watch even the bad superhero movies when they hit streaming. But of course, both of these are locked for the ad supported plans. So I canceled. It was the last straw. \n\nTo me, Hulu with Disney+ has become the go-to, keep all the time even if I'm barely using it. They've managed to keep subscription prices at a point where it just seems more convenient to keep it going than to stop/start it.\n\nNetflix will now be the service I subscribe to only for singular months when they have enough exclusives for me to waste a week catching up. \n\nRant over.",
