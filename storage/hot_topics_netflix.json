This was a convoluted mess of overly complicated ideas and plot lines, with random characters that are just an inch deep on development. I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

Not average because I could watch other stuff if it\u2019s just a regular show. With all the hype is it some of the best when it comes to Netflix shows? The name always threw me off.",

        "content": "Spoiler alert!\n\nThe first half:  vibes of thrill and a beautiful family working together to survive. \n\nThen it all turns for the worse.  The mom delves into the water to save her drowning kid.  And from this point onwards, little to nothing made sense.  Suddenly Jana(?) turned out not to be in the water.  Then the mom drowned?  Although it was never clear, because they dragged her into the cabin(?).  \n\nYep \u2014 dead I guess?  She never appeared again, so.  But the brother (Adam) tells Jana nothing.  The dad asks for a cup of coffee.  Then a bit later he crawls out to the shore and appears to have some sort of strange seizure.  The son (Adam) puts on his headphones.  Is the dad dead now too?\n\n\"We'll see mom and dad soon,\" the son tells his sister.  Ehm . . . okay, is that a look back to when they were alone in the boat, before it capsized (mentioned in the beginning)?  Nope, they seem to be on the island still, so it's the present.  \n\nAnd then too much psychological randomness to handle.  Pictures flashing by, views into different places without context.  All kids in a school being bombed (seemingly on the island too?).  And Yara, which I thought was Jana's late sister, wearing that shoe.  \n\nSuddenly the island is covered with water, rising and rising, and from the lighthouse a blow-up boat suddenly unfolds \u2014 which had previously been underneath the sand on the shore. \n\nThat's right after they managed to communicate their location on the radio and saw help pass by, upon which Adam thought he could swin out to the boat with a short rope for safety. \n\nWhat am I missing?  \nWhy was it so incomprehensible to me?",
