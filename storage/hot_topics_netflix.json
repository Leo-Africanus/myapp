As part of an investigation launched by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office on charges of \"hate and discrimination\" and \"inciting the public to hatred and hostility,\" 11 suspects, including actor Cem Yi\u011fit \u00dcz\u00fcmo\u011flu, have been detained. The police are still searching for five other individuals. (The boycott was launched in response to the lack of impartial media coverage during the process that began with Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu's detention and continued with his arrest, as well as the arrest of hundreds of young people.\nOn 2 April, the boycott turned into a general one-day action to demonstrate the power of the public through consumption and to send a message to the entire market. Alongside millions of citizens, numerous public figures also supported the boycott calls.)\n\nSource: HalkTv, BirG\u00fcn Daily",

Those men were pathetic- all it took was a pretty girl with a nice body to show them a little attention and they turned to jelly....(Good for her though.) I wasn't sure if she and Phil had a thing or her and Chris did. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed these three episodes more than the first three. But I liked them all. I'd love to see more seasons of the show. There's still some tweaking for them to do. \n\n***Edited to add-\nThis is by far my favorite podcast I've listened to that talks about this show.  \n\nSo far there are 2 episodes, one of them talks about 1-3 and the next one talks about 4-6.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7eUJyjTkELE2KfbxGHbqkF?si=N_LIduBhTuaX7OB6ws5hjw\n",

Netflix customer service says they can't verify I'm the actual account holder since I don't have the old debit card number anymore. I have years of bank transactions, dates of plan changes, IP address, etc.. Not good enough for them, it's got to be the number of the stolen debit card that I shredded at the bank (who doesn't keep records of debit card numbers once they are cancelled apparently).\n\nHas anyone every successfully recovered a stolen account or is it just SOL to my algorithm and move on?",
