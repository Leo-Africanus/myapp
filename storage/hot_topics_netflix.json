No explanation on what's going on. Uma's acting was bad.\n\n2 out of 10. Don't watch it.\n\n",

She knows he\u2019s still using the Netflix she pays for because after he moved our profiles showed up on her Netflix when that hadn\u2019t been there before. She has no idea what the password is. Is there some solution to this?  This POS doesn\u2019t deserve his free Netflix. I\u2019d love to hear how angry the phone call is when he sits down to watch it and realizes he\u2019s been kicked out of the account he created but doesn\u2019t pay for. \n\nTL;DR: would like to know how to get someone off of a Netflix account when you don\u2019t know the password.

        "content": "I recently noticed that Netflix's ads have felt weirdly more intrusive than other streaming services, and I think I figured out why: they don't cut to black before they jump into a commercial!\n\nHere's an example from \"The Queen's Gambit\": [https://youtu.be/JPpU6UuJKvM](https://youtu.be/JPpU6UuJKvM)\n\nOther streaming services (e.g., Max and Disney+) have at least a few black frames to demarcate their ads, but Netflix doesn't -- one frame is the show, and bam! the immediate next frame is the ad. I'm guessing this was deliberate -- a sneaky/subtle way to trick your brain for a split second to think the ad is part of the show and retain your attention.\n\n(\\*I'm not 100% sure, but it also looks like the frames might even be blended to make it even more \"seamless,\" but that could be a separate frame rate issue with my camera. Here's one example: https://imgur.com/a/a1DPC6l)\n\nI googled this left and right, but couldn't find any discussions about this. Has anyone else noticed this/posted about this? I don't know if this is a new thing, but there's definitely been a recent spike in the number of times I'm watching something on Netflix and I'm momentarily confused about why the Squid Game man is suddenly looking at a Chipotle burrito.",

        "title": "What has been preventing Japanese originals from getting their videos (teasers, trailers, and the like) uploaded to the main Netflix YouTube channel lately?",
        "content": "After a long wait, [the first official teaser for Season 3 of Alice in Borderland](https://youtu.be/CaWRDITtT1U) is here. It is shockingly the first Japanese video this year to make it to the main Netflix YouTube channel, rather than merely the regional channels.\n\nThe trailer of Asura, the remake of the 1970s family drama, did not make it. Neither did that of Bullet Train Explosion, a modern reimagining of the action-thriller movie from that same decade that is said to have inspired Keanu Reeves' breakout hit Speed. More recently, the musical drama Glass Heart failed to get its trailer onto the main channel as well.\n\nThat is a major decline from last year, which saw FOUR Japanese originals get even just their official trailers onto the main channel: House of Ninjas, City Hunter, The Boyfriend, and The Queen of Villains. And judging by the attention (or lack thereof) given to 10Dance and Last Samurai Standing, I will be pleasantly surprised if either makes it as well.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea has had healthy representation (barring the numerous works that remain stuck on that country's channel). Obviously there is the final season of Squid Game, but other originals have also had their official trailers hit the main channel. There is Mercy for None, aka the Korean John WIck. There is Weak Hero Class 2. There is even When Life Gives You Tangerines, arguably the first K-Drama to make it. Even Revelations, whose teaser and first trailer were not uploaded to the main channel, got its final trailer in.\n\nThat leaves only five other Japanese (true) originals (not counting Giri/Haji, which first aired on BBC2) whose official trailers have made it to the main channel (at least in my memory):\n\n* Followers (this one actually came before Alice in Borderland)\n* First Love\n* The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House\n* Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead\n* Yu Yu Hakusho\n\nThe last three of them came out in 2023. That means in the span of two years, seven Japanese official trailers made it to the main channel - a major leap in marketing. But now, a downturn.\n\nIt even extends to the ancillary videos on the Still Watching Netflix channel. Squid Game, just to name a Korean example, has had many of them there. Alice in Borderland? Two, one for each season. The rest have had none - not even YuYu Hakusho and City Hunter, which were adapted from famous manga.\n\nHeck, they even streamed the Squid Game Season 3 launch party! Alice in Borderland might not get the same privilege for its own third season.\n\nSo what gives? Why has Netflix stopped significantly promoting its Japanese originals this year after a somewhat strong streak? Let me know in the comments!",

        "content": "TW: spoilers\n\nI found this show couple days ago and watched almost all of it in one sitting, just finished the second half of the last episode rn and need to pour out my thoughts somewhere. The 70s arc of the main character was the best to watch, even though it was the most emotionally charging part, ngl at some point i was watching it only for her human scenes, because of the vibe (and because i could rest from the uncanny valley).\nThe only part i don't like in it is her son shooting his bullies and never getting caught, it's naive for me.\n\nStill, I'm pissed about the plotholes, like why the house stayed empty for such a long time with a robot inside and the decomposed body in one room, why their rentor haven't checked it first? Where are the squatters? Like an ABANDONED INTELLIGENT HOUSE FROM THE 70s WITH A TRAGEDY ATTACHED TO IT, it sounds like an urbexers wet dream, so again, you want me to believe, that in 50 years nobody got inside? \nAnd better, that nobody found the deceased child in the room OR the robot herself and if someone found them, they didn't go to police with it?\n\nAlso Samira's husband is written so insufferably, he gets more clueless and abusive with every episode, from consequently gaslighting her wife, through sending her to psych ward, cause she's scared of the old, uncanny valley robot, that tried to harm her 3 times previosly, to trying to kill her, because Cassandra said so\ud83e\udd23. I don't think he was meant to be so stupid as a character, he just turned out like that. Juno is weirdly infantilized, like she was playing kindergarten games with Emily, aren't they 9 years old? WHY she didn't drop out of school?? And WHY IN THE LAST EPISODE BOTH OF THE PARENTS WERE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT AND DIDN'T INFORM THE POLICE? LIKE AAAHAGAHSHXHHSKAUSH\n\nBut while watching all of it and being absolutely enchanted with her 70s plotline i started to think, that Cassandra's story would work better as an analog horror series, than as a netflix show.\nGood analog horrors are a rarity rn, i think that after Gemini Home Entertainment and The Walten Files everyone keeps copying. It saddens me, that the idea for her story was already used by netflix, cause it has so much potential for this different form.",

        "content": "I LOVE Tell Me Lies on Hulu! After the second season of it I was trying to search and find another show/movie that resembled Tell Me Lies, whenever I would search for that, this \u201cAfter\u201d series would always get recommended. I see that it\u2019s like 5 movies. I also see that it\u2019s about a relationship, love and college which relates to Tell Me Lies BUT is it as dark, passionate and crazy as Tell Me Lies? Does it keep as glued to the screen and always guessing what\u2019s gonna happen?Is it just another dumb love story? Or is it actually good and worth the watch? Just curious about everyone\u2019s opinion on this series. Thanks in advance for everyone advice!",

I do not remember S1 and I have had enough rewatching old seasons. \n\nAnd Netflix cannot blame the pandemic, they have been releasing content throughout the past 3 years. \n\nI have made a vow never to watch a new season if it is too far out that I cannot recall the previous season. \n\nNetflix needs to reconsider how they prioritize their content investments. \n\nDo you feel the same?",
