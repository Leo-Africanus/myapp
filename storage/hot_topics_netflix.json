        "content": "Ugh. After quite a while going without, I got Netflix again for a month just to finish Sandman, now that the second and final season is out this month. \n\nI knew it would feel different this time, after the appalling allegations that have come out about its author. But there's no escaping that the comics meant a lot to me at one time, and I enjoyed a lot of Season 1, despite its flaws. So I wanted to see it through. \n\nI'm only on episode 1, but so far it's really not working for me. Chiefly, I think, it's the script. It feels even more \"pseudo olden times speech\" than usual, if that makes sense - like, almost what a middle school kid thinks Shakespeare or medieval fantasy talk should sound like. As if all they did was  write a modern after school drama script, and then find and replace phrases like \"Don't you?\" with \"Do you not?\", and then called it a day. The actors do their best (I mean, I've seen Tom Sturridge do actual Shakespeare, and he is absolutely world class.) But it's hard to convey substance with such empty lines. \n\nIt also feels like the writers are going for some weird comic punchlines - as seen in the moments during the family reunion scene, where several times the dramatic music suddenly cuts out just in time for someone to make an irreverent quip. To me it just feels like a lack of trust in the material to be played sincerely, so they feel the need to add a bit of ironic \"haha we don't take ourselves to seriously\" snark into it just in case. \n\nAnd lastly, the whole Nada thing. It's been 10,000 years (as they tell us many times), and yet all it takes is one chat with his sister to suddenly make him obsessed with \"righting a wrong\"? What changed in that 5 minute conversation? Are you telling me he just never considered it that way before? With how much this guy broods over abso-fucking-lutely everything, he just never happened upon the possibility that this incredibly un-nuanced moral un-dilemma might have been problematic on his part? Baffling take.\n\nAnyway. Yeah. Let me know your experiences with this if you want.",

        "content": "Okay so let me get the positives out of the way first. The animation is great. The music, while not my style, I can appreciate as well crafted bops. Love how unhinged the girls can be.Overall it\u2019s a fun movie.\n\nBut then I started to that thing where I think about the themes of a kids movie like a dumb nerd and I found that it doesn\u2019t really hold up that well. \n\nSo one of the main conflicts in the movie is Rumi wanting to hide the fact that she is half demon. She sees herself as a mistake for most of the movie which makes for great irony considering the lyrics of golden. So far so good. She starts talking to Jinu which shows her that there is humanity in the demons. Okay great. \n\nSo for me this is all pointing the narrative to one obvious conclusion. There is nothing wrong with the demons, it\u2019s just the bad guy Gwi-Ma that\u2019s the problem. Get rid of him and there would be no need for the Honmoon, humans and demons can live together in peace and Rumi can be proud as a mixed race person of both Korean and demon decent, thus finally accepting herself.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what happened. The demons, with the exception of Jinu are all evil and so they have the big showdown and beat the demons and restore the Honmoon. Uuum\u2026 ok.\n\nSo what does this mean for Rumi? Can she truly accepted herself as a half demon while still sealing them off from the human world? Like was Celine right for rejecting Rumi\u2019s demon heritage if they are basically all evil except for the one love interest? Is Rumi fine with being half demon so long as she\u2019s \u2019one of the good ones.\u2019 I\u2019ll admit that what I proposed was cliche, but at least it\u2019s still a positive message. There are real mixed race people who do have an extreme dislike for half of their heritage and the answer that K-pop demon hunters has is that you can accept yourself, but so long as you close off that part of your heritage and try to forget that it\u2019s a part of you. Idk that\u2019s really sad to me. \n\nAnywho, y\u2019all let me know if I missed something that can makes the ending by make sense. ",

I am baffled by some of the subtitles. it's not just bad, they straight up make up entire sentences that were not said. like someone will say \"hmm\" and the subtitle will say something like \"oh that's terrible\" I understand not translating puns or expressions or culturally specific things. but sometimes they add unnecessary fillers that change the context. sometimes it feels like someone who barely understands Korean is using google translated english and making up fillers here and there.\n\nhow are the English subs are for other languages?

The things that made House perfect was:\n\n- Serious overall show with some comedy/wittiness. (No Sitcoms or pure comedies or whatnot. I like a good plot).\n\n- Each hour episode has its own story. The season has an overall storyline, but each episode itself has its own story that is concluded by the end of the episode. (So, no Audiobooks or Podcasts)\n\n- The mystery element, where the protagonists are spending the episode trying to figure something out, and the something is satisfyingly figured out by the end of the episode.\n\n- Most importantly: The protagonists describe what's going on. In House, the characters would describe down to the detail each symptom they were seeing, the ways the diseases affected the patient, etc. \n\n- Also, I know there's one or two that are basically \"House, but it's about Psychiatry\". None of that. I am in the field of Psychology, I would be too offput by the inaccuracies.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI might try out one of those lawyer detective ones, like Law and Order or whatnot, but I don't know which ones of those would be a good fit. But open to other suggestions as well.\n\nThank you!",

I wonder what happened?",

        "content": "Spoiler alert! So many things to say here. \n\nFirst of all are these grown as* men so proud of themselves so many years later. Also this POOR girl whose birthday has now been forever connected with the death of two innocent women. \n\nWhen she said the line at some point my dad was called and told two girls died and hee facial expressions from knowing shes filmed to wanting to break down to trying to numb herself man I felt this in my core. \n\nMy cousin died on my birthday 10 years ago - she was sick her entire life and I still have nightmares about it. \n\nBut one thing that impressed me is how the Dutch no thanks to the useless major and cops cleaned up their own town the day after. This is something I see in Netherlands/ Sweden that I really feel we can learn from. \n\nResponsibility and community. \n\nAnyway overall i enjoyed the entire series one by one and the ones i didn\u2019t know about even more than Astro world which I already knew about. \n\nPoop cruise ie prob still number one but its a good series albeit filled with what not to do. Unfortunately we know humans and history has a way if repeating itself. ",

DONT DESERVE TO MOVE FORWARD. Cause they already wanna fail in life. NSYNC failed. And they\u2019re in the presence of a Boy Band legend AJ from Backstreet Boys. A band that\u2019s thriving through the decades. Like NSYNC has one okay song and you wanna be a one hit song breakable dumb band? Already talking like failures ngl. ",
