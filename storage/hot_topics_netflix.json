Of course not, but how would it be? It's not possible since we know what it's about. Not many possible inventions appart from the few we saw, and yet to be seen that made and can make the show keep being great.\n\nBut was it awesome? Yes it was, I watched it in 7 hours. As many others did as well.\n\nIt starts of very captivating.\n\nThe main participants (some annoying, not in a good way, but do get better) are introduced well.\n\nThe games are not repetitive.\n\nThe story makes you question what the plottwist will be because of taunts. Some of them not forseeable.\n\nAnd overall the ending makes you feel exactly what you (don't) want to feel, which is a good thing if you ask me!\n\nGreat job!",

Because WWE has a contract with ABXplore, they're apparently not going to stream WWE on \"Belgian\" Netflix. The problem is: AB1 is a channel in French, and nearly no Belgian that speaks Dutch cares about that channel. They dub it too, so it's pretty much useless to most of us, as we can't even rely on English audio.\n\nI think there's a really slim chance I might get it because my profile is in Dutch (and therefore sometimes gets merged together with Netflix Netherlands), but it definitely depends on how their contract is with ABXplore. I tried contacting them, but even for the staff it's really vague. I think I'll just see in a few days, though I'm ready to be disappointed.",
