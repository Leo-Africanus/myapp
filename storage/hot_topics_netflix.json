        "content": "Has anyone ever had their Netflix payment method change to someone else\u2019s they know for seemingly no reason?\n\nSo I was going through my finances and realised I hadn\u2019t been charged for Netflix in quite some time, but I\u2019ve been using it no problem. I log on to my account on the website and the payment method is a card I don\u2019t recognise. As far as I knew, I hadn\u2019t been hacked. \n\nThe only thing I could think of is that a while ago, I logged out of my Uncle\u2019s Netflix account on his smart TV, and into my own. I then went into my emails and found an email I missed that said my payment details had been changed, around 2 weeks after I logged into my uncle\u2019s TV. I didn\u2019t think he could\u2019ve done it because he\u2019d have needed my password to change the payment method, as I don\u2019t think you can do it in the TV app and I didn\u2019t write my password down anywhere. But when I called him, he confirmed it was his card. He hasn\u2019t been paying for double Netflix or anything, he didn\u2019t even notice. I have no idea how this has happened. \n\nMy uncle is not a tech genius in the slightest so I genuinely don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve been able to hack my password, nor do I think he would try to do that. I\u2019m just concerned that mine and/or his details have been compromised. Is there an explanation for this? Could he have changed the payment details without my password without realising he was logged into my account? \n\nEdit: I should also say that the only reason this flagged to me is that I stopped paying for my Netflix several months ago as I barely used it, only to log onto to find it was working again. And that\u2019s when I discovered the unfamiliar bank details that turned out to be my uncle\u2019s.",
