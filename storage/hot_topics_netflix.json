The acting was just perfect.\n\nThe final episode blew me away. When Jamie called and said that he's gonna plea guilty I just stopped breathing. The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much.

Wanting to go to the shops to get rid of it straight away, like couldn\u2019t wait until after his birthday breakfast.\nWhen he arrived at the hardware store, I swear the first shop assistant recognised him and called upon his \u201ccolleague for assistance\u201d to show him who just came into the store. This colleague then proceeded to seem to take the piss out of him (like you would to a suspected nonce) saying weirdly sexual things like \u201cWash in a circular motion\u201d and he was laughing as he said this. \nHe also gave incorrect advice about needing to use a hose and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the paint off which seems like he wanted him to not be able to get it off?? Like some isopropyl alcohol would probably have been able to get that off. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love the fact that this series wasn\u2019t a \u201cwho dunnit\u201d? But was a \u201cwhy did he do it\u201d which was because of toxic masculinity which was brilliantly done. \nBut I wonder whether this \u201cnonce\u201d thing was deliberately done to make people think the Dad had something to do with it for half an episode only to be pulled away. \nMaybe I got mislead. Wonder what other people think. \n",
