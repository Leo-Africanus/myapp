Her next level insane behavior and repetitive but very similar lies (always fearing for her life, even as she is being placed under arrest) makes me think it\u2019s not possible this HASN\u2019T happened before? May she rot in prison, I\u2019d bet my last dollar she\u2019s terrorizing other inmates and guards daily. \nIf anyone knew her before I\u2019d be curious to know your experience. I\u2019m sad the law couldn\u2019t have stopped this from happening but I don\u2019t blame anyone but Susan. ",

Some mention that one person may have agreed, and possibly received money for everyone(maybe just a rumors), but even if that\u2019s true, does it justify broadcasting such personal pain?\n \n- What do we know about the consent process for this kind of media?  \n- Do you think it\u2019s ethical to share such footage if only one person agreed?  \n- Where do we draw the line between public interest and exploitation?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n",

If they wanted to cut the story line to fit into a movie, they could have done the following instead:\n1. Make it into a limited SERIES, to actually address all the major plots and story lines of the book. Or \n2. Make the movie bloody long?? What\u2019s wrong with that - they did that for Gone Girl, and that movie was just as great as the book.\n\nI can\u2019t get over how bad this movie was.

Well there's only one particular part that made me cringe which is when Hal had to tell Kate who the governor of PA was, when there's no way as a political figure you dont know who the gorvenor of a swing state is. \n\nKate is such a brat this season but I'm glad other characters calls out on her behaviour and tantrums.\n\nKate and Hal's complex relationship is great and the time jump helps not to feel like the conflict is over done.\n\nAllison Janney is amazing and they dont make her as an evil meddling character like in season 2 but as an flawed conflicted individual trying to navigate difficult choices as a principle. Love Bradley Whitford too and the charm and comedy weaved into the story.\n\nThey are also make Kate's staying in the UK make sense and be able to retain the characters. They can weaved in the storylines from previous season into a bigger conflicts well as well - not simply throwing them away as unrealted past times.\n\n9/10 highly highly recommend. Oh well I have 1 episode to watch - hopefully it's not a wtf twist as per season 2 ending.",

But the truth is she posted a EBITDA profit of around \u00a32m pounds, but still an operating loss of -\u00a32.9m. This year, she\u2019s had to extend loans of \u00a36.3m to keep it afloat. It\u2019s not successful and hasn\u2019t been, and if you can\u2019t make a company generate a return in 17 years, after that much investment, it\u2019s not going to magically start making a return. And for that \u00a370 million investment to have meant anything, it needs to be able to generate more than that at some point, not just pay it back. Like who in god\u2019s name pumps that much cash into something year after year, as an escalating commitment to failure, and then gets a documentary made about what a big success it is. I\u2019m baffled! I own some of her eyeliners, and now I know David Beckham has partially subsidised them!",

        "content": "My partner and I loved playing the Netflix trivia game on our TV; we liked that it was easy to do multiplayer and had a good range of questions. Sadly, I can\u2019t find it on there anymore and have tried downloading a couple other trivia ones like trivia crack and the like but none of them have an good format for multiplayer or a big range of good questions. Does anyone know why they got rid of it or any good alternatives to the Netflix one to play on either smart tv (firestick) or iPhone? Thanks!",

        "content": "\"A Real Bible. Adult size. Written by Jesus\"\n\n\"Jesus did not write the Bible\"\n\nThe Diplomat Season 3 hasn\u2019t missed a beat. I\u2019m only on the first episode and already hooked. Hal is such a headache, never listens... but I do think he means well. The dynamic between Grace (the President) and Kate (the Ambassador) is fantastic.\n\nThe pacing\u2019s great too. It moves fast but knows when to slow down, like that scene where Kate helps Grace in the bathroom with her shirt. I also love how the show lets the audience in on what\u2019s really happening, even when the truth isn\u2019t said outright... like during the visit with Margaret Roylin.\n\nAnd it\u2019s funny! A political thriller with perfectly timed humor is exactly the escape I needed today.\n",
