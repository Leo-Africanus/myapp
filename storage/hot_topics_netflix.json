On the one hand as someone with an engineering background I'm very interested in engineering cautionary tales. On the other hand I've already read about everything that happened leading up to the Titan submersible disaster in great detail.\n\nSo my main queston in deciding whether it's worth watching for me is the following: does this documentary contain any new information or perspective?",

And what do we get? A notification saying:\n\u201cYour subscription tier is not available in this region.\u201d\nSo\u2026 basically, we can\u2019t use Netflix at all.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 get this \u2014 it hits us with:\n\u201cYou can change your subscription [here]\u201d with a link to upgrade.\nLike that\u2019s gonna make me go \u201coh yeah sure, let me give Netflix more money just so I can use it on my vacation.\u201d Bro, be serious.\n\nI\u2019ve been paying for Netflix for years. I\u2019m not asking for a free ride \u2014 just some common sense. Would it really kill them to say:\n\u201cThis tier isn\u2019t available in your current region. You have 7 days of access while traveling \u2014 enjoy your vacation!\u201d\nGive me a little grace period. A little respect. I\u2019m not a new user. I\u2019m just out of town for a minute.\n\nSo what now? Am I supposed to pause or cancel my Netflix sub every time I leave the country? Is it even worth paying anymore if I\u2019m gone for part of the month? It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated.\n\nAnd this is why people are done with streaming services. They nickel-and-dime loyal users, and act surprised when people jump ship. It\u2019s like they want to lose us.\n\nNetflix \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 stop punishing your paying customers for traveling. It\u2019s not a good look.

        "content": "Hi guys, as the title says I'm looking for a couple series of action shows on Netflix for my grandma. She's home a lot and really enjoys binge watching movies and TV shows. She loves action stuff and enjoys if there's a little romance too. She's watched all of the police and firefighter shows and suits, just so you get an idea of what she's into. She has also watched all of Star Gate SG1 and Hallmark movies as well as antique road show on repeat for like a month. She has varied tastes. But her favorite is action. \n\nIf anyone has suggestions for some shows that I can recommend her I'd greatly appreciate it! We have a plethora of other streaming services but Netflix is her favorite!\n\nTyia",

        "content": "So, Dani &amp; Xander were in a relationship, she feels like he didn\u2019t wanna report to HR until he got offered a job &amp; now wants to cover his ass; they break up because of it, her sister tells her he SA\u2019d a bunch of women at his last hospital, she believes it for whatever reason &amp; then encourages her to file a sexual harassment claim?  Like this can\u2019t be it, I refuse to believe they wrote a female character in this climate that would ruin a man\u2019s career because she doesn\u2019t know how to regulate her emotions.\n\nHer sister also accused a family of neglecting &amp;/or abusing their child; wouldn\u2019t listen when told to leave them alone &amp; as a result Dani almost lost her job for getting into a fight.  So the moral of the story is, Dani\u2019s sister is a horrible person ",
