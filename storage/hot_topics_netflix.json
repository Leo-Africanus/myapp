Was trying to kill some time watching La Palma, and I noticed the actors mouths just seemed to look... wrong. Half the time it tracked with the english spoken word, then sometimes it didn't. When I switched back to Norwegian with subtitles, the actors' mouths and teeth looked VERY different.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be an option to turn this \"feature\" off... Netflix, if you're listening, please add the option to remove this cuz it's just extremely off-putting... we already lose a ton of emotion and context with dubs, but at least the physicality of an actor's face would make up for it somewhat. But now... we've even lost those minute facial expressions from actors with this terrible AI replacement feature... please make it an option and not a forced (bug) feature.",

I recently purchased a 14\" MacBook Pro M4 and I'm testing out the capabilities of the built-in screen.   \n  \nThe display looks wonderful with 4K HDR content on YouTube on Chrome and has no playback issues.\n\nI opened Safari just to test Netflix because apparently it's the only browser that supports 4K HDR playback on that site.\n\nI've encountered a couple of serious and annoying issues.\n\n1. The player defaults to 1920x1080 and needs a bit of \"scrubbing\" for the 3840x2160 resolution to kick in.\n\n2. HDR seems to be completely broken. At first glance, it doesn't seem to work at all even though the debug window says it is working (tested with Arcane and One Piece live action). By sheer luck I managed to observe that in some very specific cases (credits and pictures) the static video content weirdly renders correctly in HDR.\n\ne.g. HDR works here: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81014625](https://www.netflix.com/title/81014625)\n\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nFYI I have a Premium (sky) subscription and I live in Italy if this info helps at all.",

You swipe left or right on whatever comes up, and hopefully land on something you both can actually get behind before your popcorn goes cold.\n\nI\u2019m not selling anything, it\u2019s just a random idea I had to fix a personal annoyance. Not saying it\u2019s perfect\u2014there\u2019s probably some bizarre movies in there\u2014but it might help break that cycle of \u201cwhat do you wanna watch?\u201d \u201cI dunno, what do YOU wanna watch?\u201d and so on, until the heat death of the universe.\n\nIf anyone tries it and has thoughts, I\u2019m all ears.
