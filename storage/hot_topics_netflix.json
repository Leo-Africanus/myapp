Man, I like his positivity, but this season just killed the legitimacy of the series and also of the judges' abilities to understand music and stardom. Jay was amazing (\"perfect!\" they said) throughout and DreTL....well, nice kid, but I dunno how he made it past the first round. \n\nI know Jay will make it big; hopefully he doesn't need the money to kick it off. And I also know DreTL will never be heard from again (sorry buddy). \n\nAnd lastly, I know we won't be watching this show again. No Season 3!. What a joke! ",

She proceeds to cry and beg him to tell her why sir, why'd you kill my daddy??, which unsurprisingly doesn't work.

But you confessed! They found the weapon on you! I am guessing a DI doesn't know what paid to take the fall means?  Only after a few minutes does she finally ask \"who paid you?\" Of course too late, he has passed out. Then she crys more.  Christ on a cracker, are the books this stupid too?

In the early 2000s, the small city of Link\u00f6ping was rocked by a double homicide in broad daylight. Two people \u2014 a child and a woman in her late 50s \u2014 were stabbed to death. But with no motive or suspect, the case eventually grew cold. Nearly two decades later, the police made headway after a genealogist entered the fray.  Starring Peter Eggers and Mattias Nordkvist, the series was directed by Lisa Siwe (The Bridge) and written by Oskar S\u00f6derlund (Snabba Cash). \u201cThough this is a fictional drama series about a crime, it is, above all, a depiction of a human tragedy \u2014 where we place our focus on the victims and the investigation rather than the perpetrator,\u201d Siwe told Netflix. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about the compassion and care for one another that is needed to move on when terrible things happen.\u201d",
