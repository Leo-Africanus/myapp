I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Set in 50 BC, it follows the adventures of a small village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. The titular hero, Asterix, is a diminutive but cunning warrior who, alongside his loyal, super-strong friend Obelix, defends their village with wit, bravery, and a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, granting temporary superhuman strength. Obelix, perpetually strong due to falling into the potion as a child, carries a menhir and loves wild boar and brawls.The series blends slapstick humor, clever wordplay, and historical satire, poking fun at Roman bureaucracy and cultural stereotypes while celebrating Gaulish camaraderie. Each album sees Asterix and Obelix embark on quests\u2014whether thwarting Caesar\u2019s schemes, exploring foreign lands like Britain or Egypt, or protecting their village from internal strife. The comics are renowned for their vibrant art, memorable characters like the tone-deaf bard Cacofonix, and timeless appeal across generations. Translated into over 100 languages, Asterix remains a cultural icon with comic books fans around the world!",

The film\u2019s lean 92-minute runtime, practical stunts, and Lenoir\u2019s intense performance deliver a raw, no-frills action experience.

She wasn\u2019t trying to be perfect, and I didn\u2019t find her annoying like a lot of people did. I honestly don\u2019t get why they felt that way. I always thought she was pretty smart, especially since she was a writer and all.\n\nWhen we found out she was catfishing Joe, I won\u2019t lie, I thought that was a little out of place at first. But once it became clear that she actually cared about him, I started liking her again. What bothered me though was how she seemed to lose herself along the way. She started off strong but kind of got lost in the middle, which was a little disappointing.\n\nThat said, I still thought she was the kind of character who kept you curious, like you wanted to know more about her. She knew how to flirt, knew what to say in the right moments. Her dynamic with Joe, especially in the beginning when they first started getting closer, was really intriguing to me. I just wanted to see more of them together. Maybe that\u2019s just me, though.",

I wondered if Steve Carrell already said he wouldn't film any more seasons so they killed him off. What a turn! But I guess his character was a bit messy, an older man leaving his wife for a younger model, and Anne also confirmed in the show that he cheated on her. I didn't feel as though the cheating confirmation was taken seriously enough, and was swept under the rug by the group and not really acknowledged. Just me? \n\nIt was nice to see Steve brought some Michael Scott humour vibes to Nick, if you know you know!\n\nFinally, my favourite was Domingo Coleman, I thought he was so sassy and funny, my favourite little scene was when they were all taking a photo with Ginny, and the photos would sync to Anne's iPad so he told everyone to pose like they aren't having a good time. And he's the only one doing it! \n\nFinally, a shout out to Anne for dealing with so much and trying to not let her hurt feelings turn to hatred towards Ginny and also reminding her and Nicks daughter that Ginny was a person.\n\nSo will they make a new season?\n\n ",

        "content": "So I keep changing my Netflix accounts every week or month, asking other friends for theirs and so on, some relatives and so on (basically freeloading). Is there any way to track the content watched on all these varied accounts automatically and not manually on Trakt or any other similar app?  \nEdit: also would prefer if also works on other apps too.

        "content": "I get that they made the ending like that to make it seem morally right, you know? To keep people happy, the ones who care about this whole thing of it being the \u201cright\u201d ending. But honestly, I think it should\u2019ve ended with him either getting away and going somewhere else, kinda like an open ending, or just dying. Him going to prison didn\u2019t really make sense to me. But whatever, I can let that go.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t ignore though is how Kate and Bronte survived so unrealistically. There was just no way Kate could\u2019ve made it. She was shot, hit in the head with a hammer, and left in a fire. And we never saw anyone getting out of the fire while Joe was proposing to Bronte. So how would she have survived all the smoke, all that damage? It just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAnd Bronte too. Like yeah, Joe was probably panicking and all, but he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s killed plenty of people. He knows what dead looks like. There\u2019s no way he saw her there, shot in the stomach, underwater for that long, and thought she was dead when she actually wasn\u2019t. That just didn\u2019t make any sense. It kinda ruined the ending for me, to be honest.",

        "content": "For the first time ever, my work computer displayed the message \"Your device isn't part of the Netflix Household for this Account.\" It is only giving me 14 days to use it at work but I honestly do not plan to use it.\n\n  \nThis is the dumbest crap ever, I pay for the account out of my pocket. My husband and I are the only ones who have access to it, and I use it loosely because my husband does not watch TV very often. Generally speaking I have some type of show running in the background while I work at the office and at home because I cannot stand the silence or random hum of talking in the background. \n\n  \nThis should be completely illegal and it honestly makes me want to not use Netflix. No other streaming platform does this or at least it has never popped up when I have had something playing in the background at work. \n\n  \nI understand it is because it is not on the same network as my \"normal\" streaming devices but what would happen if I was to move or got a new wifi network? Is the only way around this is to get another account?",

        "content": "i think the show did a great job incorporating the new era we\u2019re living in. it\u2019s really hard to pull that off in a way that feels authentic, but this show did it really well. i\u2019ve seen a lot of movies and shows come out in the last five years, and it\u2019s like they don\u2019t know when to stop with the slang and the over-the-top plots. when you watch an older show or movie, where there\u2019s less focus on phones and slang, it just feels so good. and i was honestly feeling like something modern was missing, you know? something that would integrate technology in a way that makes it feel real for today\u2019s world. but usually when they try to do that, they go overboard with the slangs, trying way too hard.\n\ni did see some people complaining about him mentioning \u201cdelulu\u201d and a few other things like that, but it didn\u2019t bother me. i thought it was totally fine. the jokes were well-placed, and i felt like they hit at the right moments. that\u2019s one of the things i really liked about this season. it had been a while since i saw something done so well in that department. by the way, if you have any recommendations for shows that have a good plot and use slangs in the right way, especially newer ones, please let me know!",

        "content": "I was watching Oklahoma City Bombing: American Terror on Netflix. At roughly 0:21.20 mark a man is giving a speech about gun rights at a protest at the Lincoln Memorial after the Waco Siege ended. Does anybody know if this man is Kevin Heffernan of Super Troopers/Broken Lizard? He looks and sounds a lot like a younger version of him. I'm struggling to find much information about who gave speeches , but I know Kevin Heffernan was a lawyer, so it would make sense. Any help figuring this out would be appreciated!",
