Yeah, no. Buhbye. Nailed the coffin shut.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this show was early to a very specific vibe that\u2019s everywhere now. Dark but cozy, absurd but oddly wholesome. Violent things happening while people argue about mundane nonsense. Basically existential dread with popcorn.\n\nShows like Ghosts are carrying that torch. Dead people. Ridiculous problems. Jokes that are dumb, sharp and self-aware at the same time. The kind of humor that doesn\u2019t try too hard but still sneaks up and punches you in the face. Politely.\n\nI\u2019m convinced this genre works because most of us are tired, mildly unhinged and coping through irony. We don\u2019t want prestige misery. We want chaos that knows it\u2019s chaos. We want death jokes that somehow feel comforting.\n\nAnyway, RIP Santa Clarita Diet. Gone too soon.\n\nTaken from us mid-bite.\n\nNetflix, I forgive a lot, but I will never forgive you for this one. If ever I get bitten, you know who I\u2019m coming for",

I can let things go, but the one that really bothered me was WHY WOULD ANNA BE MARRIED TO THE BROTHER OF A GIRL WHO WATCHED AND LAUGHED WHILE SHE GOT RAPED??\n\nSure, Jack was flawed, but an overall good man who loved Anna and definitely went out of his way to protect her, but still, you\u2019d think she\u2019d stay far away from those girls and anyone related to them, let alone marry a sibling. Those girls were just plain evil. And they didn\u2019t even have any remorse. Helen making a comment about her dead child? Zoe giving her the finger and telling her to stop holding a grudge??\n\nI wish there had been some backstory of how she and Jack got together. Anything that would explain how she could possibly be content with Zoe being his sister-in-law. I thought maybe she fell in love with Jack before she knew Zoe was his sister? Or maybe she started dating Jack so she could keep Zoe close and somehow get revenge \u2026 but then accidentally fell for him?? Idk. At least some kind of explanation. \n\nAnyway, that is all. ",

It doesn\u2019t seem like that was a commuter friendly town as everyone else drove except her and her timing for being everywhere was impeccable. I knew she could\u2019ve tossed her gown from the first killing but wouldn\u2019t they had found that somewhere along the path to the forest. ",

        "content": "I have a question for people who have read Harlan Coben books.\n\nI have seen some of his adaptations on Netflix. My feelings are...pretty mixed overall. I'll get into it soon. The point is: I hear the books are actually great and get butchered by adaptations. I just want to ask: is that true? I mean, are the books better? And if so, how?\n\nSpecifically, these are the adaptations I've watched so far and my opinions on them\n\n\\-You fool me once, british show. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, there were some stretches in logic, a couple plot holes and a few storylines that ended up not leading anywhere, but overall, it was pretty good and engaging\n\n\\-Caught, spanish show. I was pretty mixed on this one. Even more unresolved storylines, the mystery was not nearly as engaging, plus I think the main character is one of the most annoying main characters ever and I was actually rooting for the villain to kill her in the final episode.\n\n\\-The woods, polish show. This one I did not like. Pretty much all the characters are boring, pretty much all the storylines are pointless, the mystery is not that interesting and the answers we get aren't really worth the wait.\n\n  \nSo, if you have read the books those shows are based on, are they better?And what do they do that makes them better? Honestly, my main issue with all three shows is the overblown amount of characters and storylines, which results in most of them being underdeveloped. Is that problem present in the books or is it done better?\n\nIf you know, please tell me. Thank you for your time.",

Especially considering how they're actually quite detail oriented otherwise.\n\n I wonder if it has to do with the cultural background of the animators (Norwegian?).\n\nAnyone else noticed that?",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all intentional, though reintroduce ads slow down production time release less quality shows. It all works out in the studio\u2019s favor not so much for the subscriber.",

But dialogue and acting was... meh. \n\nOk, things that didn't make sense and I'm unsure if it was just a weird way to think one way and throw us off track? If so... kind of sloppily done. \n\n1) the whole intro. Anna hurrying to clean up her apartment and her tooth being infected or whatever? \n\n2) what was Lexy and Richard's end game?? Why did they have all of that stuff at the lake house? \n\n3) So did Lexy become a news anchor just to get back at Anna or to do what? (See 2) \n\n4) I don't even understand the whole Clyde and Helen side quest. \n\n5) Why did Zoe say to Jack that Anna isn't who he thinks she is. Guessing to side-blame because shit was about to go down?? \n\nI'm sure there's others I am unsure about but that's in my brain rn. ",
