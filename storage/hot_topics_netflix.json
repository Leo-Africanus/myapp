        "content": "This was a series that I enjoyed pretty much, but I can't tell why Netflix makes series so short and then makes you wait a year or more for a new season! \n\nBy the time the new season starts, you've almost forgotten about this show.  This first season was back in 2024 and only had 6 episodes.\n\nIts still not released and I think its supposed to come out on 2027? WTF?\n\nAnyone else feel the same way or know why Netflix does this? They did the same thing with Cobra Kai and Black Mirror!",
