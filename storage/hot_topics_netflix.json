        "content": "This is a brilliant AD for ancestral supplements. Here's how they did it.\n\n1. Paint liver king as a broken, troubled, but \"just trying to get a good message out\" guy who takes all the blame and is the only bad person in this story. Heck, he was a major fraudster it makes sense he would lie, right?\n\n2. Portray the nine ancestral tenets and liver as positively as possible... People saying it changed their life, his kids are healed with no other details given, Brian started the company when he figured out liver was good.  All this can be true as whole foods and better lifestyle choices are good.  No one on the marketing team or ancestral supplements knew about the steroids, he told them he didn't use so they had no idea remember? \n\n3. Separate the brilliant but evil marketing plan that made ALL his supplement companies exorbitant amounts of money from the scam that grew his companies immensely. \n\n4. A mutant physique going viral by taking $12,000 worth of GH per month, eating raw testicles for shock value and denying steroid use to generate more chatter.  He did this to grow his company.  Sure, spreading the word of better living is good, but the main goal is to grow the company.  And they did just that.  Now just make LK the sole evil person and make everyone feel for LK.  \n\n3. Did anyone else notice the beautiful shelf of ancestral supplements the camera panned to right at the end? How convenient, I mean we know liver king lied but he wanted to help and it saved both kids.  Organs and carnivore diets are the key to great health.  Don't want to eat raw organs, let us show you this lovely display of products from ancestral supplements, they are good people who were not in on the scam just profited immensely what a coincidence. Don't buy from ancestral he owns multiple supplement companies. They only told you about one, think that was a mistake? \n\n4. HE LITERALLY TELLS EVERYONE HE'S A FRAUDSTER RIGHT TO YOUR FACE. HE LIED TO EVERYONE.  YOU THINK HE STOPPED BEING FRAUDULENT? C'MON PEOPLE! THE GUY WAS PRINTING MONEY AND DOING FRAUDULENT RECIEPTS.  LITERALLY DOING IMMORAL ASS SHIT TO MAKE MORE MONEY AS HES DOING WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY.\n\nSeriously if anyone thinks this is anything but an advertisement I feel bad for you.  He's duping you AGAIN\n",

Truly. Did they even go to school? Or were they homeschooled by drug addled, morally bankrupt grifters spewing toxic masculinity? The mother seems to be from another country so maybe she\u2019s not the best teacher of English but yikes, you know they had enough money to maybe hire a tutor.\nAnd I found it interesting that his dad was depicted as a sweet, veterinarian (which takes an amount of studiousness) and instead of maybe trying to be like that he makes up this extreme version of what a man is that seems polar opposite of his dad. Odd choice. (Just as odd as smoking cigars which seems completely counter to his \u201cnatural\u201d lifestyle.)\nAnd the brother he says he looked up to is never mentioned as far as where he is now. Maybe they left that out bec he was involved in the criminal enterprises mentioned. I don\u2019t care enough about the guy to look it up, I just think it would have been interesting in the doc. It also would have been interesting if they addressed the children\u2019s allergies. Was that all made up too? If not, in what way were they resolved? As someone who has never heard of him but has a masters degree in food science and applied nutrition I was interested and it was so bad I had to increase the speed halfway through just to finish it quickly. It could have easily been nutshelled into a ten minute YouTube video.",

This guy would've been great in that role. \n\nSome of the fight scenes are spectacular. The whole thing reminds me of Deadwood in a way. Very authentic settings. The political scene is very familiar. \n\nI just can't get past so many Chinese characters with perfect English in San Francisco 1800s.\n",

The martial arts and gore are brutal, realistic and unrelenting from the 15 min mark to finish.\n\nIf this were titled \"Violence: The movie\" it would have been more apt.\n\nPeople get their limbs chopped off, bones used to block bonesaws, intestines flying, glass used in inventive ways, and each segment introduces a final boss.

I personally didn't see much wrong with it. \n\nThe series was OK. The show never did specify why Jade and Billie hated each other so much. Though Billie did bite Simon. And Jade had a bit of resentment to her. It wasn't really just Billies fault. It's common sense in any post apocalyptic zombie game or show. If someone looks like they're about to turn stay the fuck away from them. \n\nBut the show was alright. I liked how the episodes had flashback before and after Racoon City. But with how the series drastically decreased in suspense. I'd honestly rate it a 7/10. \n\nIt was probably one of the few most recent series to hook my attention pretty damn easy. But since it's been about 2 years. And time and time again said to be finished off. Done. I don't think they'll make another. But overall. I liked the series. \n\nPrimarily because It reminded me of Dying Light. And no I'm not comparing the two. If theres any FACTUAL information on why the series wasn't bog or popular. I'd love to get feedback.",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nA few days ago, we upgraded our Netflix subscription to the 4K version for the first time so we could enjoy some newer movies and series in 4K. However, the overview still only shows HD next to the movie/series title for movies that should actually support 4K. \nWe have an LG OLED B9 4K TV. \n\nWhat are we doing wrong, and how can we access the 4K content? \n\nThanks in advance.",

This is just a broken half movie and it is super annoying. Why don't they use their industry weight to fix this when it has been a problem with streamer content for years? Am I just being naieve?\n\nEdit: to clarify, this movie is in English and has parts in Paris, Rome, Taiwan, and Berlin. Those parts have foreign language dialogue that isn't translated, but is translated in the theatrical release. From what I've heard, it is a problem with the distributor and not Netflix.",

One is a credit card with a high limit that I am nowhere near reaching and the other is a debit card with plenty of money in the account.  Both work fine for other purchases and I use them daily.  I don\u2019t have any other cards and I don\u2019t want to lose my account\u2026",
