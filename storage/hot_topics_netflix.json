It was cool seeing more sides of the Squid Games other than the games themselves.\n\nLee Jung-jae does an incredible job in showing the development his character went through and how it has matured Gi-hun.\n\nNew additions like Thanos, Kim Jun Hee, Cho Hyun-ju and others were great additions to the show. \n\nAnd seeing the mastermind play the games, at one point, i thought he actually turned good. But later events proved otherwise\u2026\n\nI want to specifically point out that those last 2 episodes were also INSANE.\n\nMy only complaint is how the season ends, in my opinion it was a bad spot to end it. It kinda feels like were in the middle of an episode and BOOM, ending.\n\nI cant wait to see how season 3 picks up, especially after how it ended.\n\nAnd this last thing is kind of a tangent. I wonder if David Finchers American remake wont be a remake, but possibly a spin off, showing that the organization is global, and season 3 could possibly set that up.",

I updated my household to there because it prompted me to do so, but it kicked my husband out at our residence. It prompted him the same, but then it kicked me out. Is it not possible to watch on 2 different WiFi sources at the same time? Is there not a travel option? I swear there used to be, but again, I haven't been in this situation for many months. What do you suggest? Do I need a second email for my husband? Can I have 2 profiles on my account? Should I downgrade to Standard since I obviously don't make use of Premium? Thanks for your advice.

Got virtually nothing out of them. After the North Korean girl becomes a worker, every second with her felt so pointless.\n\n\nI'm pretty disappointed. Feel like the show didn't get into the nitty gritty of the interesting questions at all. First episode was good fun if nothing else but I really didn't like the direction it went in at all. Maybe would've been better to just release season 2 and 3 in 1 go but this felt like a lot of filler again.\n\n(Also, the insurrection at the end was dumb as shit. Why would they go along with that? And the whole time Gi Hun is iffy about 001 but never suspects it might be the same as last time? Wtf?)",

It was an indie film festival type film on Netflix around 2014-2016, the main characters father was in the police force. The main character took his dad's pistol and met up with his friends. In one scene they were firing it off a bridge and a nearby man chased them down. They spirited to be Marian rappers. Another one of the teens had a girlfriend to which in one scene he climbed through her window and she was using a webcam to stream. In another scene I remember there was a water gun fight and towards the end of the movie they were at a house party where the gun was pulled on a bully.

The only firewood you had available was \u201ccrackling birchwood.\u201d My family was really looking forward to seeing pine this season, and was very let down to see the rerun of birchwood. The fire only lasted one hour and it wasn\u2019t even that warm. During the preview, the fire showed that it was much much bigger.  Very misleading. I tried poking it to feed the flame and it only pressed the television behind the dresser. Of course I ran to grab the water hose to put out the flame as my wife called the fire department. We could hear the fire continue to crackle and see the light behind the dresser. Don\u2019t yall think it\u2019s strange that your fire smelled like cat pee only after the \u201cfireplace\u201d fell? It didn\u2019t even have any aroma before\u2026 we\u2019re hoping the pine smells better. We soaked the flame until the sparks finally put the light out from the flames just as the fire department arrived. The gentleman were so happy we took care of the job that they were laughing with us as they left. I would think yall can update the fire to a safer, more aromatic pine for next year. ",
