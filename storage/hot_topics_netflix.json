For TV sure, but breaking the flow of a film bugs me. \n\nI decided to skip Netflix and go to another streaming service that had less ads or none for a film. When it comes to movie I think I'll be skipping netflix. I still enjoy the shows and the ads are less excessive, but I'm done with movies on Netflix. \n\nCurious if anyone else feels this way. ",

Shutter Island is powerful on the first watch, but once the twist is revealed, a lot of its impact fades. The film leans heavily on atmosphere and shock.\n\nPrestige, on the other hand, is built for rewatching. Every scene matters. The structure itself is part of the illusion, and the   themes-obsession, sacrifice, rivalry, and identity run far deeper than just a single twist. It doesn\u2019t just surprise you; it plays with you.\n\nShutter Island tells you its truth at the end. Prestige hides it in plain sight from the very beginning. That\u2019s the difference. One is a great experience once; the other is a masterclass that gets better every time you revisit it.",

It looks like the screen is only able to update at a really low refresh rate.\n\nI have been wondering if it is part of the cheap recording at the time or very poor digital conversion.  I originally thought it wasn't happening on the sentai stuff, but it actually is,  just less obvious. \n\nThe TV isn't the issue.  I see the same thing on my PC.
