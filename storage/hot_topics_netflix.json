So far this is the only title I\u2019ve come across that has this issue. I just joined this group to see if anyone else is having this issue. Either no one has noticed or they don\u2019t really care? Haha \u2026.so, I\u2019m just wondering, for those with the 4K subscription service, are you able to view Peaky Blinders in DV/Atmos??? I\u2019m in Canada btw so I\u2019d be interested to know that if it DOES work for you, what country are you in. Thanks!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb ",

I have ADHD (and am likely AuDhd) so my memory is complete garbage. I am very ritualistic about rating each thing so that I\u2019m aware if I\u2019ve seen it already.

Now I\u2019m wasting a bunch of time on just figuring this out and that\u2019s really frustrating.\n\nTied into the above, the recommendations are now showing A LOT of things I\u2019ve already seen which makes zero sense to me especially considering that I rate them so it\u2019s pretty clear I\u2019ve seen it from a data standpoint. \n\nFellow neurodivergent folks - what bothers you?\n\nNetflix UX really needs to do specific focus groups to help us with accessibility.
