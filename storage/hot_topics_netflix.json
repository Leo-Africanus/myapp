They definitely left us on a cliffhanger, and I\u2019m curious if anyone else thinks Netflix will renew it for another season?\n\nI really hope they do. There\u2019s still so much to explore with the characters, and I\u2019d love to see more of Cam\u2019s journey as a gay man in the Marines. His character development has been one of the most interesting parts of the show. That said, Netflix can be unpredictable when it comes to renewals (I\u2019m still not over Mindhunter, The Society, and 1899 being canceled). Plus, with the Pentagon\u2019s criticism of the show, I worry Netflix might shy away from continuing it.\n\nStill, Boots was genuinely excellent and absolutely deserves a season 2. What do you all think?",

I remember playing out in the village I was raised in as a child, and there was always one weird house where a scary adult would live. You and your friends would all avoid them at all costs, but sometimes a ball would just go into their garden by accident or you'd just be existing and they'd make your life a misery when they came out, etc. I forgot how scary that used to be as a child and this documentary really reminded me of that fear and power imbalance of an adult making you feel that way when you are just playing and having fun outdoors which should be such a magical part of childhood. I knew something horrible was going to happen in this situation of course, but for some reason I didn't think it would be such a cruel and barbaric murder like that for some reason. Yes, the lady is definitely mean, racist, angry and a nasty bully, but for her to take the life of that wonderful lady and mother, and leave those babies motherless just absolutely broke my heart, I just didn't see it coming. All of that loss and hurt over something minor. One minute they had their lovely mother just advocating for her children and defending them like she had every right to do so, and then next minute she was gone. Her life was lost, and those poor children of hers will never feel the same again. All over that evil lady, who had years to just go live somewhere else if she wasn't happy in a family neighbourhood.\n\nI don't know. It's just really broken my heart. It's just so senseless. ",

Some mention that one person may have agreed, and possibly received money for everyone(maybe just a rumors), but even if that\u2019s true, does it justify broadcasting such personal pain?\n \n- What do we know about the consent process for this kind of media?  \n- Do you think it\u2019s ethical to share such footage if only one person agreed?  \n- Where do we draw the line between public interest and exploitation?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n",
