How can team be this bad in content writing with such fine actors and story premise so good in first season. I mean what an absolute shit. Only good happened with killing eve was rise of Jodie Comer. Last episode i guess is the worst episode of tv history. \n\nI know it\u2019s more about psychological thriller than real spy world but still there should be some sense into it. There\u2019s no urgency, no consequences, and no sense of direction. Characters commit murders, betrayals, and world-altering \u201creveals\u201d and then casually walk away as if nothing happened. Institutions don\u2019t matter. Death doesn\u2019t matter. Revelations don\u2019t matter. Storyline remains the same. What\u2019s the point?\n\nEve was written in worst possible way or casting isn\u2019t done right. All she mainly done is \u201cwide eye\u201d expressions. \n\nJodie Comer is the only reason this show worked at all. Her performance is pure, generational talent effortless physicality, terrifying charm, razor-sharp comedy, and emotional precision all at once. She doesn\u2019t just play Villanelle; she inhabits her. Every scene bends around her. Even weak writing becomes watchable because of her control and magnetism.\n\nA strong pilot. A phenomenal actor. And four seasons of a story that never knew where it was going.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t stay for the plot.\n\nThey stayed for Villanelle.",

        "content": "\\*SPOLER ALERT\\*\n\nAm I the only one that initially thought Jack might be the killer and he was trying to cover himself? Of course different guesses came along after watching the middle to end of the show, but towards the beginning, more and more hints made me think that Jack had a neurological disorder and was murdering people while he was unconscious.\n\nI thought that maybe he started slowly realizing that more and more evidence was pointing at him, which started Priya's suspicion about Jack (shoe size, swabbing his niece, having Rachel's phone and getting it unlocked, a flashback of Rachel bringing up his wife while in the truck which made him angry, and more), and he started panicking as he realized that he himself was doing all of this.\n\nPerhaps that could have been a pretty interesting plot that still had the same ending twist.",
