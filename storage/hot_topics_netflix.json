        "content": "My first example is from the new show Trigger. A man nearly rapes a woman, and the main character (an officer) arrives just in time to stop it. He checks the perimeter and leaves his partner to look at the man\u2019s ankle monitor. The man then tries to kill the partner, but the MC stops him just in time. And guess what happens next? The MC slams him to the ground, then he and his partner just walk away\u2014leaving a man who just attempted sexual assault and murder completely free.\n\nAnother example is in Alice in Borderland. There\u2019s a recurring character who repeatedly tries to rape people, and the group has multiple chances to get rid of him. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but one scene had the main character strangling this guy after he tried to assault what seemed to be his love interest. Yet, instead of finishing it, he just lets him live\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get what kind of message the writers are trying to send here, but it feels like it completely falls flat. Why are they portraying rape like it\u2019s something that can just go unpunished?\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s clear Lyle is a sociopath. Here\u2019s what I know and what want to understand shortly follows:\n-Lyle seemed to always have a weird affinity for Merritt since they were teens. \n-When William Lingard hits Harry from behind, both teens realized the mistake. Then Lyle comes in and beats William, saying \u201cif I hadn\u2019t followed you, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d \n-Fast forward to when he was at Godhaven and he\u2019s giving a video interview, he kept on about Sam Haig being his brother bc if he didn\u2019t follow him, he\u2019d be dead. \n-Add in him being thrown in the hyperbaric chamber with Harry AFTER his death, but denies Harry being dead in his video interview.\n-There are moments of clarity for Lyle, returning Merritt\u2019s necklace, saying how he loved her, then showing extreme displays of hatred, blaming her for his brother\u2019s death.\n\n1. Does Lyle have a split personality disorder? I personally thought he did. Why else show compassion for the tooth infection and how apologetic he was when returning the necklace? (giving a needle nose pliers seemed to be the dumbest move but yet he was able to concoct a whole new life as Sam Haig just to infiltrate Merritt\u2019s life?)\n2. Did Lyle love Merritt? Or jealous that his brother wanted to leave to be with Merritt?\n3. Does Lyle accept that his brother actually died? In his teens he denied it.\n4. Why would Lyle assume William would continue to hurt Harry? I thought the teens knew each other unless Lyle was just looking for a reason to hurt someone?\nBONUS question \ud83d\ude02:\nDid the Mh\u00f2r sheriff know Lyle was the one who actually attacked William? I think this is the case, but at what point did he realize this and why not confess it? I can\u2019t accept the \u201cit\u2019s his ego to not admit he was wrong.\u201d\n\n",

I cancelled my Netflix at 630am, by 930 I somehow had upgraded. The funny thing is the cancelation was put in during the weekday when everyone was at either school or work. Netflix of course had no answer for me other than I made the mistake. I suggest anyone trying to cancel, call the customer service number and have them delete your payment method. ",
