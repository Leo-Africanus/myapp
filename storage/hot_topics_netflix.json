It almost reminded me of one direction when they came together they blended amazingly together for their first performance. Id love to hear others thoughts on the current bands. \n\nBand 2: Landon, Shade, Malik, and Bradley could be an amazing soul/R&amp;B group and I see the potential, loved their auditions and could definitely see them going far!! \n\nBand 1: Donzell, Aaliyah, Cameron, and Katie I dont have too many thoughts on this first group but they had have a lot of powerful voices here and im interested in seeing what direction this group heads in\n\nBand 3: Nori, Wennley, and Brianna \nI think this group needs a fourth, but were quick to rush and form a three piece. It feels like something is missing or out of place to blend all their voices together\n\nOne more band is currently forming but Id love to hear everyones opinions so far! ",

Each contestant performs one by one in to the group of 50, and people are eliminated as the performances go on.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question: doesn\u2019t this give an unfair advantage to contestants who perform later?\n\nFor example, if contestant #3 performs, they\u2019re being judged while all 50 people are still technically in the running. But by the time contestant #40 goes up, a bunch of contestants have already been eliminated, so there are fewer people to compete with or be compared to. That feels like an uneven playing field.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Is there something I\u2019m missing in how the voting or eliminations work that makes it fair? Curious what others think.\n\nOr should I just wait and it will seems clearer later?",
