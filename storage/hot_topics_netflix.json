Anton posted with a new girl? What is happening that these shows have no element of surprise anymore? I thought they used to have to sign a contract.

HOW many movies are you able to find that are in 4K available on Netflix? Just find some spare time to search throughout the genres and movies and series and try to do some math and calculation. For an example, search through random 100 movies and write in the comment section the actual result of 4k movies that you find.\n\nI mean, this cannot be serious. I pay 14-15 EURO a month so I can watch movies in 4K and actually there are only a few out of hundreds. How is this possible?\n\nWhose idea was to put Interstellar on Netflix with that trashy resolution? What is it? FHD? Where's 4K? Where's the IMAX 4K version so I can enjoy that? I am currently at the 36th minute and the quality of face is like painted out of Minecraft game.\n\nDo you have any explanation why I am not seeing titles in 4K, but rather old-trashy FHD?

Just as you hear it, I don't have much time due to my job, and when I do have some free time, I always prefer to play video games rather than, for example, watch a series or movie. I've had Netflix before and was happy with the platform, but when the prices went up and you couldn't share an account anymore, I just stopped using the service. Now, I'm thinking about getting it, since there are some games that catch my attention and having it on my phone makes it more convenient for me to play in my free time. I wonder if these games are really worth it and what their average length is (I imagine each one has its own style and some will last longer than others, but in general). Can these games take months to complete? Or can they be completed in a week, depending on the hours you put in? As I said, I have little time, so I'm more interested in shorter games, preferably so I don't have to pay for the service once or twice.",

It worked with no issues for years.\n\nNetflix support was frustrating to say the least. I just learned they can't even receive a screenshot and was just asked to restart my router, device, everything I already did. I did anyway but yeah no dice.\n\nAnyone experienced the same thing?\n\nImage for reference [https://ibb.co/sJVSgcNB](https://ibb.co/sJVSgcNB)\n\nI mean it almost seems as if there's something in my local network that is blocking Netflix but I checked my Netgear router and I do not see any armor turned on, nor any content filter or any filters at all.

        "content": "I\u2019ve watched a few of the Harlan Coben adaptations on Netflix. They were mostly decent, some I liked more than others.\nThen I started watching other mini series and I keep getting disappointed. \nThe most recent two were \u201cThe Watcher\u201d and \u201cWayward\u201d. I felt like they had such good potential and I was intrigued to say where they\u2019re going, but then the endings were just terrible.\nSo please, if you could recommend a short series with a decent story and a proper, thought out ending, that\u2019d be great!\nI don\u2019t care about genres, I watch everything.\n\nThank you!
