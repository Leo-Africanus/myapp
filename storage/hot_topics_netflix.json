        "content": "If you\u2019re into gritty, no holds barred Wild West stories, this is it. Set in 1857, it throws you right into the chaos of frontier life, no sugarcoating, just raw survival. The landscapes are insane, the action hits hard (not just shootouts, but brutal hand-to-hand stuff), and the story actually moves.\n\nIt\u2019s not all talky drama, but when there\u2019s dialogue, it matters. The main characters are solid. Isaac Reed is a total mystery, and the tension between settlers, Native tribes, and religious groups feels so real. It also ties in actual historical events, which makes it feel even more grounded.\n\nNot gonna lie, it\u2019s dark and violent, so don\u2019t expect any warm, fuzzy cowboy vibes. It\u2019s like if Yellowstone and The Revenant had a gritty baby. Definitely worth the watch if you\u2019re into intense Westerns or just want a break from the usual predictable shows. \n\n",

Why didn\u2019t they blur it out? I see it as Netflix is so big a company to care if pedos watch their shows as long as they get paid and there isn\u2019t anything u can really do. Just boggled me.

I\u2019ve enjoyed the show but leave well alone, cos everything interesting to say about the characters has already been done.  \n\nThe writers stymied the progress of Sam Loudermilk by blunting significant storylines that involved him having to grow beyond his hound dog persona.  \n\nIn S1 he pursues Allison then wins her in final episode, as he is league jumping he\u2019ll have to evolve to keep her heart.  Her character is killed off in 1st episode of S2. \n\nBen marrying Sam\u2019s Ex as S1 big finale story beat, is completely reset to starter positions early on in S2.  Mid S2 they are living back together like it never happened.   \n\nEnd S2 Sam is literally left holding the baby, he\u2019ll sure have to grow up fast now.  Early S3 the baby subplot is wrapped up within 1 episode.  \n\nI wish the writers had the confidence to grow the characters and not contrive to have them in their starter positions every season. It feels like they were making it up on the hoof every season, with no story arc.  \n\nThe show is a gem to discover as a joyful distraction, with Ron Livingston perfecting the grouch.  But any more seasons will lose its charm and overstay the welcome.  It\u2019s of its time and should be enjoyed as such.  ",
