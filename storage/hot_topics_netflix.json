Hell I even was on board when they added Psycho as a sort of meta analysis he had on popular culture to add some filler to an otherwise short story. Then it kept going and going and going. It ends with a parody of Mindhunter, Richard Speck's man tits, and Gein catching Ted Bundy, Gein dying, seeing his mother in heaven, what felt like 95 ending scenes later some kids desecrate his grave and are chased off by the movie monsters he inspired, then finally ends on a flashback with his mom again.   More endings than The Return of The King. Absolute trash. ",

        "content": "I think yes, cinema is dying because people don't like to go there anymore, it doesn't resonate enough compared to the past. There are plenty of reasons, such as rising prices of tickets, streaming services, and more. But we still need to go to the theater for its collective experiences. The shared laugh and shocking factors motivate us to attend movie theaters despite their high ticket prices or simply to keep up the trend. According to history, cinema has provided a major dominance for media experiences; a big screen was an innovative thing for people to view. However, this doesn't resonate with our current status anymore. Everything is provided on screens with endless content, reinforcing the reason not to attend the cinema anymore. Streaming services provide comfort and even cheaper price than the cinema but endless comfort. From the perspective of Cinema, they are trying their best to operate the cinema to compete with streaming services such as ODEON, providing a monthly subscription with endless movies. Well, this strategy doesn\u2019t seem as efficient as it thinks; people are still not attending movies as much as the cinema companies intended. Moreover, movies are not as entertaining as before because the film industries are making sequels to prequels to gain a safety net of profit in box office revenue. Hollywood is literally operated in risk reduction nowadays, to avoid risk as much as possible. This behavior creates a lack of original content that people are demanding. However, maybe we are seeing the fade of cinema as nostalgic sadness because it is full of memories. But why do we still need cinema? People still demand cinema, because of its collective experiences, just like people go to a restaurant.\n\nFor cinema to thrive again, it should reconsider its historical pattern of how cinema counterattacked and learn from its threats. First of all, the appearance of television in the 1940s was a major threat to the film industry, and cinema counter-responded with bigger screens and a spectacle experience, where it created IMAX and Dolby Atmos. For the home video era, the response was blockbusters to overcome the quality of home experiences and increase the need for cinema attendance. For the streaming age, the threat is major due to the unlimited content provided with matchable quality. The convenience and binge culture are major standouts for streaming to dominate the media culture. But how are cinema responding? They are trying to enhance and promote the theatrical experience as much as possible, but it is not as much. I believe there should be technological breakdowns, such as Virtual reality, Artificial Intelligence, and sensory technologies, equipped in theatrical experiences. Unless Cinema stands as a major cultural and technological dominance in the ever-growing competitive environment.\n\n",
