I\u2019ve been trying to find it but think they may have taken it off and can\u2019t seem to find it on google. \n\nOne episode I can remember was of a family. The dad had passed away and was haunting his son and wife but only the son could see him. One scene in particular is the dad ghost crawling up the stairs with the creepiest smile imaginable and the little boy running under his bed where the dad then slithers in and finds him. There was also something with the mom wearing a locket with his picture in it?\n\nI know this is not a lot to go off of but that episode has stayed with me this whole time and literally sent shivers up my spine. I was recently telling my friend about it and she wanted to check out the show but I\u2019m drawing a complete blank. ",

        "title": "Bullet Train Explosion",
        "content": "Bullet Train Explosion is both a modern remake and a follow-up to the 1975 Japanese film The Bullet Train, which also inspired the Hollywood thriller Speed. The story brings back the high-stakes idea of a vehicle that can\u2019t slow down without risking an explosion. This time, it\u2019s the Hayabusa 60 Shinkansen\u2014a sleek, high-speed train racing toward Tokyo. A ransom must be paid before the train reaches its destination, or the result won\u2019t just be the death of those onboard\u2014it could mean disaster for millions in the city.\n\nWe meet the characters, understand the stakes, and in many ways follow the now-established beats\u2014like the government refusing to negotiate with terrorists and efforts to discreetly evacuate passengers. Much of the first half plays out confidently and effectively. The bullet train setting is a treat on its own (as someone who recently traveled to Japan, seeing those stations in the film gave me mild PTSD). But what sets this version apart is that the bomber reveal happens midway through the film\u2014and they\u2019re onboard. From that point on, the focus shifts to the dynamics inside the train, and that\u2019s where the movie starts to lose steam.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/18/bullet-train-explosion/",

        "content": "So I'm on a Desktop PC and watch Netflix through the Edge browser.  \nMy monitor is an OLED (PG27AQDP).  \nWhen ever I enter fullscreen in Netflix, after the UI (playback bar and the age info) disappears the screen gets brighter after a few seconds.  \nIf I move my mouse (to bring back the UI) or if I go to window mode the brightness goes back to normal.  \nAfter the UI disappears again, it will get bright again after a few seconds.  \nIn window mode it stays normal.  \nThe black borders are not affected by the brightness change.  \nThe higher brightness is a huge quality loss, it is like a white/grey filter on top of the video and a lot of detail goes missing.\n\nOnly happens on my OLED monitor, doesn't happen on my older LCD monitor.  \nOnly happens with Hardware Acceleration on. (But that is needed for the DRM/HDCP shizzle, so Netflix allows to play higher quality than 1080p)  \nOnly happens on Netflix (tested Disney+ and YouTube).  \nHappens with and without a second monitor connected. (which pretty much means it happens with and without HDCP 2.2)  \nHappens with HDR on and off.  \nHappens with monitor brightness 0 to 100.  \nHappens with monitor setting \"Uniform Brightness\" on and off.",
