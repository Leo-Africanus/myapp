Clearly there were some ugly people that didn't want the show to continue and put pressure on Netflix.\n\nNow I could say that Netflix are cowards if that is indeed the case as I assume, however, I don't think that. If anything, Thank you Netflix for having the guts to allow this show to exist. To produce it and to put it on your platform. It truly is a hilarious, wonderful, heartfelt show that shows the struggles of Palestinians. I would say it is a love letter to Palestinians and our beautiful culture.\n\nThe actors were absolutely wonderful, and while some of it was just hard to watch, particularly MOs struggles. The show left me feeling good and hopeful.\n\nParticularly I loved the Thanksgiving get together at the farm. It was just beautiful to see all these people who are different come together because it felt they were all family.\n\nSorry if my post sounds corny, but I really did love this show so much.\n\nAnyway, for those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It's a brilliant, clever and outrageously funny show.\n\nThank you Netflix.",

        "title": "His &amp; Hers (Netflix/Book) \u2013 Genuine questions about character choices",
        "content": "Spoilers for His &amp; Hers (Netflix) and the novel\n\nFirst, I want to be very clear up front: this post is NOT victim-blaming, minimizing assault, or being insensitive. The show covers extremely heavy subject matter, and I\u2019m asking these questions in good faith to better understand the characters, their psychology, and the story\u2019s themes.\n\nI just finished His &amp; Hers on Netflix and was genuinely caught off guard by several of the later revelations. I\u2019m still processing some of the character choices and was hoping people who\u2019ve watched the show and/or read the book could help expand on them.\n\nMy main questions:\n\n1. Why did Anna get involved with Jack at all, knowing he was Zoe\u2019s brother?\n\nAnna\u2019s trauma stems from what happened when she was 16; when her friends Zoe, Rachel, and Helen orchestrated the assault, sold photos, and then watched, laughed, and mocked her while it happened.\n\nKnowing this, Anna choosing to be with Jack (Zoe\u2019s brother) was odd?\n\nWas this relationship meant to show:\n\n\t\u2022\ttrauma bonding or unresolved attachment?\n\n\t\u2022\ta way of reclaiming control over her past?\n\n\t\u2022\tself-punishment or denial?\n\n\t\u2022\tor is there more internal context in the book that the show didn\u2019t fully explore?\n\n2. Why is Lexy (Catherine) so fixated on Anna years later?\n\nCatherine/Lexy was also a victim, but she ran away and left Anna behind in the woods. Yet as adults, Lexy seems to direct an intense amount of blame, resentment, and obsession toward Anna.\n\nIs this survivor\u2019s guilt turning into projection? Or does the novel give more insight into her mindset and how she rationalizes this?\n\n3. Did anyone else expect the reveal to be \u201cless extreme\u201d at first?\n\nBefore the woods scene, I honestly assumed the trauma might be centered on bullying or humiliation..not the calculated setup, photos, and assault itself. That escalation completely blindsided me.\n\n4. And bluntly\u2026 how are we meant to interpret Lexy getting her own sister killed? \ud83d\udc80\n\nI understand trauma can seriously distort judgment, but this was downright psychotic. Is Lexy meant to be seen as someone spiraling, or as a cautionary example of unresolved trauma turning destructive?\n\n5. For book readers: what did the show change or leave out?\n\nWere there:\n\n\t\u2022\tinternal monologues or motivations cut from the adaptation?\n\n\t\u2022\tchanges to character dynamics (especially Anna, Jack, Alice or Lexy)?\n\n\t\u2022\tplotlines or reveals that were simplified or altered?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate if novel readers could expand on whether the book gives clearer psychological grounding for these choices, or if the ambiguity is intentional.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in thoughtful discussion from both show-only viewers and readers.",

That said\u2026 this movie was not it.\n\nI haven\u2019t read the book, so don\u2019t come for me- I\u2019m judging purely on the film. From the very beginning, both main characters were insufferable. Poppy leaned too hard into the chaotic, ultra\u2013Type B personality, while Alex was painfully rigid and Type A. We\u2019re told they\u2019re best friends, but the movie never convincingly shows why. I genuinely couldn\u2019t see how they\u2019d tolerate each other for more than 20 minutes, let alone build a long-term friendship.\n\nThe chemistry was nonexistent. On top of that, the emotional cheating while they were both in relationships was uncomfortable - are we just supposed to normalize that now?\n\nThe pacing was off, and the story tried to cram in every rom-com trope imaginable, which made everything feel rushed and forced instead of charming or organic. I kept waiting for it to click\u2026 and it never did.\n\nDisappointing, especially for a genre I usually adore.",

        "content": "I just finished Black Summer and it was fantastic. I googled to see when season 3 was coming out and it said it was cancelled. What an absolute shame. Personally I believe this is the best zombie apocalypse series I have ever seen. It's realism and cinematography is top notch. The acting and performances are outstanding. I really do not understand how Netflix could just let this one go. I am really sad about this one!",

Even my friend the account owner tried but she also couldn't come up with an answer on why it happened. Please help me figure out what happened and is there a way to recover my profile. ",
