As part of an investigation launched by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office on charges of \"hate and discrimination\" and \"inciting the public to hatred and hostility,\" 11 suspects, including actor Cem Yi\u011fit \u00dcz\u00fcmo\u011flu, have been detained. The police are still searching for five other individuals. (The boycott was launched in response to the lack of impartial media coverage during the process that began with Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu's detention and continued with his arrest, as well as the arrest of hundreds of young people.\nOn 2 April, the boycott turned into a general one-day action to demonstrate the power of the public through consumption and to send a message to the entire market. Alongside millions of citizens, numerous public figures also supported the boycott calls.)\n\nSource: HalkTv, BirG\u00fcn Daily",

When I checked Netflix this morning, it said the new season was being released April 3, so I figured I got my dates wrong. I decided to renew my subscription since there's a new season of Black Mirror coming out in a couple of weeks, and as soon as I did that, I suddenly have access to the newest season of Love on the Spectrum.
