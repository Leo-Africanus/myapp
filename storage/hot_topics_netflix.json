        "content": "Many of us love a good procedural. Adolescence was unique in many ways. The single shot experience is amazing. But contrasted with Dept Q, it really showcases a slowed down, normal way of talking that is rare in tv. I'm very much into the story of Dept Q, but far too often the characters are slinging witticisms, even normal ideas, back and forth clearly faster than normal cognition allows. Nothing too wrong with it, its exciting and fun. In early Guy Ritchie movies its amazing. When Jeremey Brett does it as Sherlock Holmes you believe it. But in this show, for me at least, it kinda breaks the spell. Adolescence told a great story in four episodes, and every character was understandably too busy digesting the situation and processing their emotions to be pumping us with dialogue - that is great tv! Fast pace high level dialogue is a choice, a gamble, and ultimately a hard sell, especially for a 'procedural.' ",

If you notice Raymond said that she slept with her college professor and ended his career. I also think a highschool boyfriend too. I think her meds keep her functioning normally, but as she got off them her \u201csiren\u201d ways came out. I think her dad saying it would just be them and touching her was a trigger and going to take Michaela\u2019s role as Mrs. Kell was her response. A trauma response for survival. So interesting!

This, and the \"coming this week\", \"coming next week\", \"worth the wait\" were great functionalities. \n\nanother missing section is games, but dont care about it. was crap anyway, most of the games.\n\nSo I wanted to ask, if something is wrong with my TV (its about 5 years old), or if its a feature and not a bug, or if they plan to update the app. \n\nObviously, theres a workaround, i can still see \"new and popular\" in PC or mobile app, pin it to \"my shows\" and then follow on TV, but it feels cheap and uncomfortable. \n\nany info would be greatly appreciated.",

Ne voyant pas le probl\u00e8me corrig\u00e9, j'ai appel\u00e9 Netflix.\n\nJe suis tomb\u00e9 sur un employ\u00e9 de chez Netflix qui m'a dit que c'est li\u00e9 aux licences qu'ils poss\u00e8dent, aux droits d'auteurs et \u00e0 l'entreprise d'\u00e9dition au lieu de dire que c'est un oubli ou une erreur technique (Mais bien s\u00fbr... !!! Et c'est la marmotte qui met le chocolat dans le papier alu).\n\nComme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 sur la 1\u00e8re ligne, j'ai \u00e9mis plusieurs signalements comme par exemple un \u00e9pisode de \"Classic\" Ben 10, o\u00f9 il y a une distorsion tout le long d'un \u00e9pisode sur l'ensemble des 3 saisons.\n\nNetflix m'avait sorti le m\u00eame baratin pour ce probl\u00e8me-l\u00e0.\n\nJe ne serai pas \u00e9tonn\u00e9 que certains passent par d'autres m\u00e9thodes, plus ou moins ill\u00e9gales, pour un service m\u00e9diocre et abusif.\n\nLa seule chose (positive) : c'est que je ne suis pas le seul \u00e0 l'avoir signal\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s cet employ\u00e9.",

The problem I have is every time we turn on our Samsung TV it\u2019s asking for us to resub. I even deleted the Netflix app\u2026 getting quite annoying and honestly this shouldn\u2019t be happening. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? ",

It is not usable. You see more titles on your phone than a freaking 84in TV. It makes NO SENSE. You have to scroll till your life is half over to go through a decent amount of titles. No upcoming titles anymore.\n\n\nReport it so it never stays. They are looking for feedback ",
