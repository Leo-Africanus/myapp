As part of an investigation launched by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office on charges of \"hate and discrimination\" and \"inciting the public to hatred and hostility,\" 11 suspects, including actor Cem Yi\u011fit \u00dcz\u00fcmo\u011flu, have been detained. The police are still searching for five other individuals. (The boycott was launched in response to the lack of impartial media coverage during the process that began with Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu's detention and continued with his arrest, as well as the arrest of hundreds of young people.\nOn 2 April, the boycott turned into a general one-day action to demonstrate the power of the public through consumption and to send a message to the entire market. Alongside millions of citizens, numerous public figures also supported the boycott calls.)\n\nSource: HalkTv, BirG\u00fcn Daily",

        "title": "My wife and I finished \"Adolescence\" today and I have thoughts",
        "content": "My wife and I finished watching it tonight.\n\nThe dad reminded me a LOT of my step-dad and how my mom appeases him when he gets upset.\n\nWhen I think back to my days in high school and junior high, around Jamie's age I think about how I was angry at my peers and felt bullied. The internet was around for sure but cell phones weren't as big of a thing as they are now.\n\nI also think back to all the times I would be rejected by the girls I liked. I did get into a good amount of relationships but I also experienced some level of bullying by both boys and girls in my adolescent years.\n\nAs a father of a toddler, who will one day grow up and have various guys chasing after her, this is an incredibly eye-opening and scary reality to face.\n\nI'll give some perspective; I have 3 nieces in this age group and one of them is being super influenced by her friends and she's acting out at times.\n\nI won't get into specifics but kids can be cruel and pick at those insecurities. This show is incredibly realistic.\n\nThere's a general lack of respect for authority and parental figures nowadays with the \"iPad generation\". No, Jamie's problems weren't created because he got a computer in his room. I had unfiltered internet access most of my life. But his dad's appeased anger and trying to minimize it, his mom's toxicity to their \"nosy neighbours\", the daughter's bullying not being addressed; all of these points showed that we're looking at a super flawed family and society at large.\n\nThe son of the detective basically trying to play the parents against each other in regards to avoiding school to not be bullied.\n\nThe character of Jade's mother being dismissive and upset of her daughter staying home (in Jade's eyes) right after her best friend was killed.\n\nJamie and his friends are a product of their toxic environment. Kids are like sponges and they soak up everything. Jamie likely stopped doing art because he was bullied for it and thought it was weak and feminine.\n\nWhile I've never killed anyone, I have done impulsive stuff as a teenager. As a parent who grew up in a dysfunctional home, I have to do my best to not start yelling and swearing when I'm frustrated by my family.\n\nWhenever my daughter misplaces her \"binky\" or soother and it's bed time and it can't be found; my boiling point begins and I need to calm myself down. It's incredibly frustrating when you put something somewhere and it's gone. Kids do things that annoy us.\n\nIf I was like my parents, I would be resorting to anger and yelling to release it, but that's not healthy parenting.\n\nSo for that reason, this show spoke to me and kept me intrigued.\n\nI thought at first there would be a twist and it wasn't until Episode 3's end that I realized it spoke truth to us from the start.\n\nHere's the important bit; Jamie very likely raged at his games and other stuff and his family didn't fully comprehend it, since it became \"natural\" to them. Just like lobsters or frogs in a boiling pot. What's normal to your family and life, may be abnormal to most. Jamie likely learned and was modeled angry outbursts from his grandpa and dad.\n\nJust because we aren't hitting our kids, doesn't mean we haven't neglected or abused them in another way. That's the message that they tried to get across.\n\nThe school the kids went to was neglectful and overly packed. That's unfortunately how a lot of primary schools are now.\n\nIn Canada I was starting to experience this in the early 2010's when I finished up high school.\n\nHowever, here's the most important part; not all incels will kill people, but the ones that do are lacking in strong, positive role models and positive attitudes and self image. Due to the conditioning and modeling from a young age, they are likely to see females as not equal. Was Jamie a psychopath; maybe. Especially as he was intentionally trying to imtimidate and toy with the psychologist. But he also thought he had power and control over the situation due to the influences that corrupted his brain.\n\nI'm not an incel, but I've met numerous ones and there's a level of fear and uneasiness they give you. It's hard to explain, but the truly lost ones sound violent and speak in a cold, cruel manner about people they dislike (namely women) and there's a certain level of entitlement they have.\n\nIt's scary how accurate Jamie was.\n\n10/10 show.",

Those men were pathetic- all it took was a pretty girl with a nice body to show them a little attention and they turned to jelly....(Good for her though.) I wasn't sure if she and Phil had a thing or her and Chris did. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed these three episodes more than the first three. But I liked them all. I'd love to see more seasons of the show. There's still some tweaking for them to do. \n\n***Edited to add-\nThis is by far my favorite podcast I've listened to that talks about this show.  \n\nSo far there are 2 episodes, one of them talks about 1-3 and the next one talks about 4-6.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7eUJyjTkELE2KfbxGHbqkF?si=N_LIduBhTuaX7OB6ws5hjw\n",

        "content": "Hi, I know there was a 5 year old thread already about pictures varying from profile to profile, but I've tried everything they suggested and still no luck. My brothers and my parents all managed to change their icons to Sonic ones, but the option doesn't show up SPECIFICALLY on my profile. Is there a solution to this? Maybe it's age restricted, even though I highly doubt that's the case? I've even tried watching a full episode of it, but they're still not available to me. ",

But I notice that the subtitles are kinda delayed in every second half of the series. \n\nAlso I don't like how the subtitles are sometimes placed up, bottom left, bottom right, and so on. In the settings I can only change the subtitle text and language.\n\nIs there a fix for this? So much for accessibility...",

When I used to be in Hungary it worked perfectly and every show had like 5 diferrent subtitle languages. Is there a fix for this or is this really just the way it is supposed to be?",
