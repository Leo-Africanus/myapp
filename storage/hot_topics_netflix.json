They look at whether the science behind the scenario holds up, what the original research actually said, and how newer studies view the risk.\n\n[https://youtu.be/x4D-xg4WhMw](https://youtu.be/x4D-xg4WhMw)\n\nCurious what others think.

Just wanted to share [this Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/watchflix-a-netflix-watch/ndembgeojaahiiibpjhocamieepbbabe) I built in under 4 days \u2014 it lets you **mark Netflix shows as watched** so you don\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve seen.\n\nOnce marked, it puts a little overlay on them (you can even customize how it looks). You can also choose to **hide** watched stuff (though fair warning: hiding is kinda glitchy right now lol) You can click the extension icon to open a full list of what you\u2019ve marked, jump straight to those shows, or remove stuff from the list. It\u2019s been super helpful for me since Netflix doesn\u2019t have anything like this. Its completely open source and safe.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to improve the extension just send me a dm or comment here, I will try to improve it by your feedback.

After all of this, the whole angle with the older cop shooting his daughter knees out because he just wanted to get her to stop and talk?

        "content": "I just finished watching\u00a0*The Platform*\u00a0and honestly went in without expecting much. Maybe just another dystopian thriller. But wow, it completely blew me away. The concept was so unique, and the social commentary was intense without feeling forced. I didn\u2019t think it would stick with me the way it did, but days later I\u2019m still thinking about it.\n\nHave any of you had a similar experience with a Netflix original that really surprised you (in a good way)? Would love to hear your picks.\n\n",
