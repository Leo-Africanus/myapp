Through research I tried to figure out more about her role and the real life events of the story to which there wasn\u2019t a clear cut answer. But anyways, I found her character not needed or necessary for the show. To be honest, I was anticipating that the twist would be she was just a hallucination the entire time but supposedly she\u2019s not. Her character is repulsive and equally disturbing as Ed. Why are we getting a pointless arc of her going to New York to glaze a graphic comic book novelist? Are we supposed to feel bad for a person who set Ed up to defile the body of another side character? Throughout the episodes, I was trying to figure out the motivation of her character, and I was still left confused.\n",

But two episodes in, monsters Ed Gein, is monsters Alfred Hitchcock, psycho, featuring Ed Gein. I get that the making of psycho would make for a very interesting story. I just didn't expect a series about Ed Gein, being about that. Or mostly that. When I watched monsters Jeffrey Dahmer, or the Menendez brothers. I didn't watch a series about a movie based on them. And some hard hitting issues involved with that. Again, would make an excellent series. Not the one I thought I was watching though. Is this a me thing?\nEdit\n\nI made it to episode 4. To all of you who hinted it was going to also be about the Texas chainsaw massacre, this and silence of the lambs, well done. But honestly ffs. If they didn't know enough of Ed Gein to make a series out of it, than don't. No need to make stuff up. Or connect him to movies. Or I half part get that part. But make that it's own series, movies inspired by Ed Gein. Usually monsters takes some creative licence. Here, they took all the licence. Most of this is made up. When it didn't have to be. What he did was plenty to base a series on. What they did was make up shit surrounding this case, give the lead an awful voice the real Ed didn't. And than show,  hey, remember this movie? Wasn't that guy weird. Oooh that and making the lead in the Hitchcock movie gay. And him going, ugh, gay, that is so shit. My life is so shit. *I heard the real actor went through conversion therapy* All of this I hated. Im not watching episode 5. To those who stuck with it, let me know if I got it wrong. Im just done. The acting is fine. It's not them. The series is just so all over the place bad",

(Not the 100 tv show) I also remember near the end of the show, the main character was talking to a tree and the tree held memories and some kind of special power. ",
