It is then made clear that they are both partnered up already. The next day, he goes to her shop where she works and they strike a convo. It feels like there will be cheating already, and i\u2019m just fed up with that storyline. I won\u2019t continue watching this show if the characters are just typical netflix tropes; unrelatable yet oh-so cheesy. Also, it just feels unnecessary to start this cheater narrative when the guy could\u2019ve just been single. So clich\u00e9. \n\nReally wondering why this show is at the top searches. \n\nAnyone can let me know if there will be actual cheating or will they be normal people for once? ",

I'm Italian, and I was watching the video in Italian, so I thought it was a mistake due to the Italian audio, but it wasn't. Torty, after Dennis is put to bed, (from what I remembered) said \"Slow down, Buzzle Lump. The scariest monster of all is diabetes.\" Now, however, he just laughs.

        "content": "They don't treat any of their animated movies and shows right, especially their shows. More often than not they just cancel it after one season or in the case of Inside Job renew then change their mind and cancel it. \n\nThey don't even want to give their animated movies sequels. That is why I almost lost hope, but I think this movie will cause Netflix to come around. ",
