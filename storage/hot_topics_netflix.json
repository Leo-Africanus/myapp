This wasnt a OOPSIE moment. And no Kendra, we have not all broke the law but got away with it, and certainly not to this level. Please, the rationalization of it all. People try to logically rationalize their actions as if it makes them understandable. Girl, Hitler had his reasons too, and was very convincing in his rationale, he still was a monster. That woman gives me chills. I have strong reasons to believe her daughter will cut her off way later in life, when she is going to become more aware. At the moment, she\u2019s too young to fully process it and have perspective. She\u2019s in a bubble. She clearly doesnt seem to fully understand.",

This is about Owen, Khloe, his mother, Kendra\u2019s husband and Lauryn. This should have been about the victims. They should have highlighted everything Kendra took from Shawn (Kendra\u2019s husband.) Kendra is literally a family annihilator without the redrum. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t Netflix put more emphasis on the sexual messages to minors??? Why did Netflix make a mockery of this situation??? Why didn\u2019t they center the other parents? Why platform a literal abuser??\n\n\nY\u2019all might drag me for this but I feel like Lauryn\u2019s reactions are odd. Like I didn\u2019t see any shock or surprise or even anger. I\u2019m extremely surprised that the fact that Lauryn stayed in constant contact with her mother. It almost seems\u2026 dismissive of the whole ordeal. \n\nShawn and Lauryn lost EVERYTHING and Kendra is making it seem cool. I\u2019m just appalled. ",

        "content": "Reading the comments here, most people agree Kendra is a psychopath and pedophile, which: yes absolutely. And I agree she needs to be locked away for a much longer time (and studied).  But there are some other takes I had that I don\u2019t see reflected. What do you think, and what unpopular opinions do you have? Please share:\n\n1. Yes, obviously Kendra was fixated on Owen, even when he was still a little prepubescent boy (sick). And she was jealous of Lauryn for being with him. That\u2019s all the comments I\u2019ve read. But I believe it went much deeper than that. She was also deeply jealous that her daughter was growing into a pretty teenager who had her whole life ahead of her and hadn\u2019t fucked up her marriage, finances and life like Kendra had. Owen was the target of her fixation but It wasn\u2019t only about Owen. There\u2019s a lot more going on. \n\n2. I\u2019m sorry but Owen\u2019s parents/mother are not the heroes people are making them out to be. Why in the free world would they not take the kid\u2019s phone away? He was being harassed into a place of suicidal ideation. They are terrible parents for letting him just deal with it while the mom pranced around pretending she was a star on Law &amp;\nOrder \n\n3. Lauryn\u2019s dad was an incompetent father. I believe Kendra is a master manipulator but what the hell must he have been doing to not see signs that something was terribly wrong? I think he was having affairs/a double life or at the very least was willfully burying his head in the sand. What do you mean you trusted your wife to handle your daughter\u2019s severe sexual harassment and abuse? You didn\u2019t think you should help? You didn\u2019t think the situation warranted all hands on deck? Where the hell were you the whole time? And all he could say about Lauryn now is that she\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d and will be a \u201cbeautiful woman.\u201d  Something is also off with him. \n\n4. Regarding Lauryn's non-emotional reaction to what her mom did to her: Lauryn never had close friends and was always quiet and withdrawn, per all her peers. Owen said she was trying to isolate him from his friends so it was just \u201cthe two of us\u201d. As far as we saw, Kendra was her primary parent, with barely any paternal involvement. Kendra\u2019s sociopathic ways are normal to Lauryn because it\u2019s all she knows. I hope she gets a lifetime of therapy. ",

WTF did we just watch?\n2. What mentally illness do you think she has? And what makes you think that?\n3. Why was she fired?? We need a follow up on this.

She could have just called her daughter ugly, annoying blah blah but she said vulgar things about him. THATS WEIRD. I know this whole thing is weird but it\u2019s even weirder that she was obsessed with him. \n\nI personally would never talk to my mother again. &amp; my mom is by best friend.

Boy were we wrong!  Maggie Kang might be Canadian but she has definitely held on to her Korean heritage when writing this. \n\nThis is about a K-drama as it gets.  The story is right.  The locations really match the types of locations you see in a K-drama.  The music, of course, is what you\u2019d expect of K-pop.  The cast was excellent and I *did* recognize many popular K-drama stars in the credits. \n\nThe got the K-drama tropes down perfectly.  Walking past.  Foodies.  Wrist grabs.  It was all there except of the White Truck of Doom. (IYKYK)  \n\nI have seen some complaints about the ending but I\u2019ve got to tell you, it was about a Korean as it gets.  In these supernatural stories where the being falls in love with a mortal, &gt;!that being *always* ends up sacrificing itself for their One True Love.  Time passes, and then there is a happy reunion. !&lt;  Well, usually.  If there is a second movie, this is what I would expect to happen.  However, I would only expect it to be &gt;!Ji-Un, not the rest of the band.!&lt;  \n\nThe biggest problem I\u2019ve had with the movie is when people ask for recommendations on live action K-dramas.  My first thoughts would be something like *My Demon* or *Vincenzo*.  The problem is those aren\u2019t shows you\u2019d recommend to someone you don\u2019t know and may be a 13 year old girl.  \n\nAny thoughts from other K-drama fans?",

The ratings weren't really good, but not terrible either.",

I found Lauryn\u2019s reaction odd to when the Police are at her house and she finds out that her Mom is the culprit. There was no emotion but Kendra kind of holds her and you see Lauryn extending her arm around her Mom. \nThen Khloe\u2019s Mother made a comment at the end where she says something in the words of Lauryn and Shawn knowing about it and would get away with it because the police who was investigating was not doing his effing job. Is it me or does it seem that there\u2019s more to the story in regard to what Lauryn and her dad knew her Mom was doing? Also, Owen saying he doesn\u2019t talk to her anymore? I just find this whole situation very fishy. Just my opinion. ",

        "title": "UNKNOWN NUMBER THE HIGHSCHOOL CATFISH, NETFLIX -THEORY",
        "content": "I have a theory about this show involving the daughter and the mom. What if the daughter was the one who sent the texts first, and the mom found out and covered up for her? \n\nThe reason i say this is because the daughters reaction when she found out her mom did it was like she already knew this was coming. She had no shock , surprise, or questions at all, &amp; showed no anger (until the dad told the mom to leave, but that seemed like she was more upset over the breakup). The vibe i got from the daughter watching the police cam video was like when a kid gets caught lying. Like she was sitting there listening to someone grill her about being caught.  The way her mom was hugging her and holding her hand seemed like she was saying \"its gonna be okay\".  The reaction was just way too weird and calm. \n\nThe mom also emphasized it didn't start with her. She claimed it started with someone else, and then she continued  it. \nWhat if it started with her daughter, and then her mom sent some texts just incase she would have to cover for her daughter. She probably knew at some point the texts would be tracked. \n\nWhen i was in highschool  i remember  girls \"hacking \" their own accounts for attention, so this theory wouldn't surprise me if true. It was also mentioned  as a theory  in the start of the film. \n\nI also find it odd how forgiving the daugher is to her mom, and how she is praising her.  ",
