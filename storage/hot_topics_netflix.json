        "title": "Black Rabbit is not good.",
        "content": "I miss the old days streaming. There was a time when Netflix was THE place to be for creative filmmakers  and experimental ideas. Now it seems like every new show that comes out is a remake of the last hit show. Netflix has become YouTube. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the latest Jason Bateman Netflix vehicle. Like Ozark, Jason Bateman directed a few episodes of Black Rabbit and even Laura Linney came back to helm an episode. The new series mostly looks great even if the Dolby Vision presentation is too dark at times. The writing however is abysmal. The writer Zach Baylin, wrote Will Smith\u2019s Oscar winner King Richard and The Crow. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the story of two brothers. Jude Law\u2019s character Jake operates a popular NYC restaurant while Jason Bateman portrays Vince, an addict that has a penchant for trouble. Vince is barely scraping by in Reno, NV when things take a horrible turn. Desperate, he calls his brother Jake for help and he secures a ticket to New York. We soon find out this is a habit for the brothers. Things take a turn for the worse when it\u2019s revealed that Vince has an outstanding debt with a local mobster. \n\nOh and I forgot to mention, the show starts with the climax. You know, because there has to be a hook to grab the viewer. I guess competent plotting wasn\u2019t an option here. \n\nOkay, here\u2019s the problem. The characters make the most illogical choices over and over again. Just when you think they\u2019ve got everything under control some new contrivance shows up out of nowhere and the characters make the wrong call yet again as if they do not know how to operate in their own world. Vince is a menace. A tornado destroying everything and everyone in his path, and not only does he take zero responsibility for his actions, but he blames it on the people trying to help him. Most of the characters are unlikable. Much like Ozark but this show is somehow more miserable. \n\nUnfortunately this show feels like a watered down version of Ozark which in itself was a flimsy knockoff of Breaking Bad. It even features the same style of title cards. I feel like I just watched this show. Successful family, seedy underbelly, and a secret. Last time it was called The Waterfront. Or Bloodline 10 years ago. Wait, has Netflix been doing this the entire time?",

        "title": "28 Days To 28 Years Later\u2026",
        "content": "A story about life, death, love, and the biggest penis you\u2019ve ever seen!\n\nBefore we get to the latest film in the 28 franchise let\u2019s talk about the original. When 28 Days Later released in 2002 it was a fresh take on zombie horror before The Walking Dead blew up the genre.\n\nI was excited to revisit the original on Netflix in HD over my old DVD for the visual upgrades. It. Looks. Terrible. Turns out the movie was deliberately shot on a low resolution digital camera to create a raw, gritty quality. Unfortunately the movie looks awful on modern 4K televisions. \n\nThe story begins with the animal to human transmission of a virus which immediately turns the infected into rabid monsters. 28 days later our protagonist Jim, played by a young Cillian Murphy, awakens from a coma to find that society has collapsed, his loved ones are gone, and his life no longer has meaning. His adventure leads to a batshit insane third act that almost seems to switch genres. I liked it, but not as much as I did two decades ago. \n\nA new creative team made a sequel in 2007 but it\u2019s not on Netflix so I didn\u2019t rewatch it. \n\nDirector Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, the original creative team, return to helm the latest in the franchise. In the 23 years since the original, the pair have made great films including Boyle\u2019s Slumdog Millionaire, and Alex Garland\u2019s Ex Machina.\n\n28 Years Later is absolutely GORGEOUS! The lush green hills of England (or Scotland?) are a sight to behold and a much needed contrast from the first film. I watched it in Dolby Vision on an LG OLED and it looks like a tech demo. \n\nA father played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson is teaching his son how to survive in this dangerous world. They live on a tidal island in a peaceful village with its own post fall culture. I enjoyed watching the two movies back to back because it increased my investment in this world. The added lore was fantastic, but they didn\u2019t make the usual mistake of over explaining, and ruining the tension. The new threats are terrifying and succeed at keeping things interesting. Like the first film, 28 Years Later is an adventure that takes a turn in the third act but this time finishes with an even more batshit ending. I am usually not a fan of legacy sequels but 28 Days Later is excellent. With that said, there are strange Terrence Malick-esque dream sequences and images juxtaposed during the first act that confused the hell out of me. Initially perplexing these stylistic choices made sense over time. I think. During some scenes the cinematography looks and feels like a certain video game but that did not detract from my experience. I really like this movie! Check it out and let me know what you think. \n",

Kelsey was so obnoxious the whole show, it seems like she had to always stand out as an alpha female. \n\nOverall I think the show has potential but they need better female host and judge selections next time if there\u2019s a season 2.\n\nWhat are yalls thoughts?",

        "content": "What if 1899 had not been canceled?\nI asked an AI to step into the minds of Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese, the creators of Dark and 1899, and imagine what Seasons 2 and 3 could have been if Netflix had not canceled it. The result feels like a continuation in the same spirit: layered, philosophical, filled with mysticism, physics, and heavy themes of trauma and reality.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udea2 Season 2: The Prison of the Mind\n\nSeason 2 begins with Maura waking up in the year 2099 on the spaceship Prometheus. All the passengers are in stasis pods, and the voyage on the Kerberos is revealed to have been just one level of a vast simulation. At first she believes she has finally escaped, but cracks start appearing. Characters repeat themselves, she sees d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and the environment glitches. The world feels too much like before.\n\nThe twist comes when she realizes that this \u201creal world\u201d is still another simulation. Her brother Ciar\u00e1n appears as the Architect, calm and logical, insisting that humanity cannot face reality without these endless loops.\n\nThe triangle device is revealed to be more than a key. It acts like a command line to reality\u2019s code. With it, Maura can freeze time, duplicate people, and even collapse entire spaces into raw geometry.\n\nThe passengers continue to be trapped in their trauma loops, but now they begin to see that their stories might not even belong to them. Their pain feels programmed, recycled endlessly across different scenarios.\n\nThe season ends with Maura pushing the triangle device to its limits. She breaks through the shell of the spaceship and steps into a world that looks like Earth. But when she looks up at the sky, it pixelates into code. She realizes she is standing in the middle of a simulation farm. There are countless worlds, looping forever.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf0c Season 3: The Origin World\n\nSeason 3 takes Maura into the Origin Simulation. This is the first world ever created by her father Henry after the death of their mother. It was designed to trap grief and preserve a perfect reality, and every other simulation spiraled outward from it.\n\nThe passengers begin to remember fragments of past lives in other loops. Some recall ships, some recall cities, even entire centuries. They realize they have been recycled for ages as actors in a grand theater run by Ciar\u00e1n. Their traumas were never entirely their own, but scripts written into the system.\n\nIn the heart of the Origin World stands the pyramid. It holds two commands. Collapse all simulations into nothingness, which would end the suffering but also erase every trace of life. Or merge all simulations into one final reality, a Garden World that would be imperfect but free of endless loops.\n\nCiar\u00e1n argues for preservation. He believes illusion is mercy, that humanity would shatter if forced to face raw reality. Maura argues for freedom, even if it means imperfection. Without choice, she says, even life is only death repeated.\n\nIn the end Maura chooses to merge. The pyramid dissolves, the code collapses, and the passengers awaken one last time. They find themselves in a peaceful meadow. Their traumas are gone, their memories blurred. For the first time, there is peace.\n\nThe final shot lingers on Maura as she walks with her son. She smiles, but as the camera pans upward the sky flickers once, like a glitch. Then silence. Cut to black.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfad Core Themes\n\nSeason 2 is about illusion inside illusion, freedom that only turns out to be another cage.\nSeason 3 is about the origin of suffering, showing how every loop and every memory comes from grief.\nThe ending is left ambiguous. It could be a true rebirth, or it could be another illusion. The show would have closed on the same philosophical note as Dark, reminding us that healing and doubt often coexist.\n\n\n---\n\nI thought this continuation felt true to the spirit of the show. It gave closure while still leaving questions. Would you have wanted something like this, or would you have written it differently?",

His outbursts, his overall personality and demeanor, the way he seemed to try to use people and shift the narrative in his favor, etc. I used to be a very aggressive and unpredictable person. I was angry, and even violent. When I would get into a rage, I wanted to hurt people. I\u2019ve done a lot of work on myself, trying my hardest to be better. But watching this brought all of these feelings I thought I had overcome back. Feelings of self doubt. Am I a good person? Could that have been me? I was very manipulative, and I still have tendencies to use people to get what I want, even if not out of malice. It\u2019s made me scared of myself. I always thought \u201cI could never actually hurt someone. Kill someone. I have a conscience, I\u2019m not that bad of a person. I\u2019m not that angry.\u201d But now I don\u2019t know.

I do everything I\u2019m supposed to? \n\nBut should I even be thinking this? Is it concerning that these questions even enter my head? That I have to genuinely think about these things? I would like to say I am a kind, decent person, who has a good moral compass, but what if I\u2019m just kidding myself? What if I\u2019m just pretending? \n\nWhat do you think of my conundrum?\n\n(Ps, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to discuss this, but I figured it was adequate as this has to do with a Netflix series.)",

        "content": "I finished my binge of Black Rabbit and Vince's character irritates me so much. He's the older brother who takes no accountability for anything. It's somehow his brother's responsibility to fix everything he touches.  Jake allows him to do it, which is equally irritating. \n\n1) Vince takes out a lien on his mom's house with loansharks and doesn't pay it back. Somehow it's Jake's responsibility to pay it for him\n2) Vince puts his daughter in harm's way because of the loan and guilt trips Jake \"to think about his niece\" when he didn't give two shits about abandoning his daughter in the first place \n3)  Promises to repay the whole amount not communicating with his brother first about where the money has to be allocated first then gets mad about it\n4)  Agreed to watch the waitress around the predator and she ends up ODing, because he got sidetracked \n5)  Guilts his brother for having money after he worked his ass off at the restaurant. Vince just wants the easy way out everytime like a toxic leech\n\n\nIt's like watching a 50 year old toddler. ",
