        "content": "Cassandra was an interesting story that I couldn't help but wonder what happened next. By the time we get to the end, we get that bitter sweet ending. But I was curious on what I missed on the first watch knowing what I know now. I found that the story is actually very sad when you watch it a second time. It lets you see everything from Cassandra's perspective. In the past, the last thing that happens is Cassandra watches her son die and shorts out. Her daughter then starves to death in the room and 50 years past. When she wakes up, she first assumes the boy is Peter. She is obviously very hopeful that her last memory was wrong. But then she notices that it's not Peter and a new family is in her house. What's the first thing she does? She goes to the master bedroom and enters the closet to check on her daughter. You can see when she enters the room and when the wife looks, you can see the closet door close with no one else around. Cassandra went into the secret room. Now at this time the rest of the house starts coming on with an expressionless Cassandra. I believe at this point, the robot is mourning her daughter and losing her mind. You next see Cassandra standing by the pool where I believe she's thinking about killing herself and wondering if she can just fall in and end it. But then she sees the mouse and that's when you know she's gone crazy. She talks to it and runs it over. When the family wakes up, she's not acting like herself anymore. She's pretending to be a house servant for them so she can take over the family and replace the ones she lost. The rest of the story plays out as normal, but now you know where her madness comes from.\n\nI'm glad I took the time to watch it all. It was very interesting.",

        "content": "Okay, I\u2019m not a hater. It takes a lot for me to say that about a show or movie because I can usually find the good in all shows or movies even if it\u2019s silly. The idea of this show was great. A man wanting a divorce, a silly friend group, a new young girlfriend? The perfect concoction of a great comedy/drama pastime. And don\u2019t get me wrong, there were some silly moments that made me smile. I really thought the first episode was good, it pulled me in and left me wanting more and kept me watching. After the failed vow renewal, it just wasn\u2019t good to me. The jokes didn\u2019t land that well, the plot wasn\u2019t thickening it just kind of stayed monotoned. One could argue that this show is a good representation of how life actually is. Well I would argue that this is a TV SHOW and I\u2019m here for some plot. I know all the couples were having issues but it never led anywhere (not that I wanted it to, but it just did absolutely nothing.) so not only was it just small \u201creeling you in and letting you go\u201d moments that just felt dumb, but it also got SO DEPRESSING. I\u2019m not the type of person who can\u2019t handle a bad ending. Sometimes bad/sad endings are the way it needs to be and I\u2019m okay with that. But Nick dying just didn\u2019t feel\u2026 right. And then her being pregnant and it ending that way also didn\u2019t feel right. Everything felt wrong about the way it ended. I almost stopped watching when Nick died but there was one episode left, and I decided to finish it, hoping it would end well, but it just didn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t hate or judge me! I don\u2019t judge you for loving the show. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t :/ I wanted to. I\u2019m sorry. My Ted talk is over. ",

After his father passed away, Facu told me he wanted to buy a Torino to restore\u2014his dad had owned one years ago. Of course, I thought it was a fantastic idea and encouraged him to go for it.\n\nA few days later, he sent me a couple of really beat-up listings from Marketplace, and we ended up finding this one. We\u2019re both from Villa Ballester, but I live in Villa Devoto now (Buenos Aires, AR)\u2014and the car happened to be just a few blocks from my place. We went to see it, and the guy selling it mentioned something about the new series, but honestly, we didn\u2019t pay much attention at the time\u2014we thought it was just some random detail.\n\nA few months later, though, it became a big deal. Facu got a call from the show's production team asking him to bring the car to the premiere. Some automotive outlets like Motor1 also reached out to feature it. The car is beautiful, but the story behind it is even more meaningful. I contributed a few parts from my line of work (locks).\n\nIf you're interested, you can follow the restoration process on Instagram: @theclassicgarage_arg. it's in Spanish.",

They're all really horrible, and seem to be intended for a much younger audience (what made Netflix think I'd enjoy these based on my viewing history?). \n\nOne of the games was literally intended to help very young readers. Each level consists of walking on top of the text for a 1\\~3 sentences story, and interacting with a few of the words along the way.\n\nMost of what I tried (5-6) all seemed like something a 3rd year computer science student did for a project-class over a quarter.

I'm definitely not watching ads.\n\nHowever I'm curious how this has affected their market share and how many users they lost?

Very tense music, long and deep stares, slow movement, a few lines of dialogue, followed by more very intense music and even longer stares and slower movements. I kept thinking \u2018holy mother of god, not every scene needs to feel like it\u2019s the most dramatic moment of the show\u2019.
