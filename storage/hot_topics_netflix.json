        "content": "So all the way back in 2022 the guys who made Stranger Things announced that Netflix was working on a new project for Death Note (completely unrelated to the 2017 movie, to be clear)\n\nStranger Things recently finished, right? The final season is out...so is development on this secretive new DN series still happening or did it get quietly canned? They announced like 3 years ago and from the articles I've read it seems they were still just busy with scripting, maybe filming will finally happen next year???\n\nThen again they also say that they're working on two other projects and maybe even a spin-off to Stranger Things so I dunno.......\n\nHere are the articles btw just in case someone is reading this and thinks I'm talking out of my ass:\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/](https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/)\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/](https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/)\n\nMaybe I'm huffing huge amount of copium but I'm still on the side of \"It's still happening just slowly\", and I have several reasons for my hope:\n\n1. The Death Note anime is on Netflix now and available for world wide users, not just japan, the country specifics dubs aren't available everywhere but it's unusual for Netflix to release one show in so many regions anyhow (\\*that is not a Netflix original)\n2. A metric FUCK TON of merch released this year and there's still more announced to come out in 2026, maybe it's just because the anime is turning 20 years old but maybe also because behind the scenes they are working on some kind of new project, wheter it's this supposed new Netflix series or something completely different\n3. Killer Within and the social media accounts. Killer Within still has decent success and is still getting updates even after the initial hype died down around it, and many Death Note related official social media accounts have been active or have been revived ever since 2024, posting almost every day or every week.\n\nFinally, Death Note is still really damn popular even among new gen anime fans, it just kinda makes sense for it to be revived with a BIG project someday right?...I mean, they did try that in 2017 I guess. :P\n\nIf anyone has any sort of new information, I would appreciate hearing some kind of new info that I haven't stumbled on. Because after writing all this out, I feel like I'm having a Pepe Silvia moment.",

It was selfish as he sold himself over the actual members. Hybe\u2019s hitmaker Bang wasn\u2019t the focus of Dream Academy. Second, Simon doesn\u2019t understand that kpop is a rigorous program. You can\u2019t just wing it. For example, the boys had a staged meeting with the label CEO and they supposedly were nervous. It talked about how they were nervous and couldn\u2019t banter because they didn\u2019t know each other so well. In Dream Academy, most of the girls spent 2 years with each other and had media training. There is a reason why Katseye has so much chemistry. Simon didn\u2019t do any research on why Hybe is successful. He is a dinosaur that is still stuck to live auditions. Two of Katseye\u2019s members Lara and Manon were scouted online.\nThe last thing is December 10 doesn\u2019t even have a single launching today. Katseye had a single that launched with Dream Academy. There is lack of strategy from a producer of supposed hit groups. Yet, I do see potential in one or two members. I can see that he is trying to replicate Harry styles again. It is such a pity that the boys are being used for his ego. Hope they get to release a single at least.",

        "title": "Morally grey ML and overly righteous FL are the most annoying trope",
        "content": "I was watching an old Japanese series now in Netflix \"The black swindler\" plot is cool and all. About ML who is \"the black swindler\" a scammer guy who ONLY scam other scammer. \n\nThe FL is a character trying to be a prosecutor. So she got this overly righteous character. \n\nThese two crossed paths because the FL's uncle got scammed and wanted to off himself by jumping on a train track, the ML saved him and the ML offered his help. The FL was skeptical (which is acceptable bc he's a stranger) and she begged the uncle just let the police handle it rather than accepting a help from a sketchy guy. \n\nThe police, being on the wrong side of justice (typical) basically told them there's nothing they could do to catch the scammers. In fact, the police was basically more busy spending their resources trying to catch the ML rather than other scammers. \n\nThe ML wanted to include the uncle in his scam to scam back the ppl who scammed the uncle. Which the FL was against of her uncle being accessory to a crime and she doesn't believe in \"an eye for an eye\". Long story short, the ML successfully got the uncle money back and basically berates the uncle for trying to off himself when he have a family. Happy ending? But you know what the FL did? She basically told the ML off for getting the money back while yelling \"I won't thank you bc this is still wrong\" yada yada yada gurl even slapped the ML. \n\nFr this girl is pissing me off, I get that she wanna blindly believe the law exists for a reason, but what I cannot accept is all these bs ideal she is talking about when she doesn't contribute to solve the main scam issue. In fact she tried to sabotage the ML plan too many times. And after he got the money back still you wanna complain? Girl, be fr, Turn the money back to the police then. Why you didn't complain to uncle for accepting the money and just look down on the one guy who basically saved your family?\n\nDon't speak about ideals when you don't do anything. It's so annoying in these types of dramas, whoever wrote the character just give one character all the common sense and one character just have too much ideals but no actions. It pissed me off bc they give the ML all the cool traits while the FL is so one dimensional, arrogant and have zero brain cell. \n\nAlso the ML end up being the FL landlord and she still act like she got a stick up her ass, gurl you're too broke to be so arrogant to a guy letting you rent his place for cheap. Mind you the ML just mind his own business and doesn't act like a typical jerk or even stuck up. Dude is still letting her stay despite her insulting him too many times.\n\nIt's only the first episode and I just boiling in hatred for the FL. Thank you for listening to my rant haha",

It just seemed unrealistic like that they connected dots that weren't even there in the first place. I wish they took more time to establish how they could have made a connection between the murders and Elmer. It was just like \"oh 10 people went missing but all of them are definitely dead and i don't know why but it definitely has something to do with this strange boy and his mother\". Like the swimmer that got murdered in the first episode...after talking to the fake witnesses that said they saw only him and he definitely drowned in the OCEAN, how did Carrera refuse to believe any single person and just conclude that he didn't drown???!!! Like obviously we know he didn't actually drown as the viewers but it didn't make sense that she immediately thought \"hmm three people are giving the same account of this man drowning but nope he was murdered\".

It was shocking the jurors even wanted to save face with some ridiculous excuses to literally let the devil loose. The diddler belongs UNDER the jail, k.",

It should have had a few more episodes to feel like a perfect nail to the coffin.\n\nI think everyone knows who killed both of them, but no one says it loud enough, probably because of a lack of evidence, or the fear of what will happen if it\u2019s a hit and miss, when the feeak is influential and financially sound.\n\nIt\u2019s really a shame it's only 50 months, and I suspect, based on the current events, that a pardon might be waiting for him since he seems to qualify for the current pardon scheme. I\u2019m not sure about the legality of that.\n\nIf he gets out, I wonder what safety measures will be in place for all those people.\n\n50cent smile \ud83d\ude02 professional hater.",

        "content": "Enter the immersive art experience, the modern American pilgrimage, which is equal parts spectacle, nostalgia, and Instagram backdrop. Disney and Universal, those amusement-park aristocrats, were the original architects of the phenomenon, training us from childhood to walk into a warehouse full of plywood and fog machines and call it \u201cmagic.\u201d But now, the genre has a new mogul, and its name is Netflix.\n\nYes, Netflix, the streaming giant with the financial reserves of a small nation-state, has debuted its own immersive megaplex, Netflix House. And one of these can be found, improbably, in the once-illustrious Galleria Mall in Dallas, where Saks Fifth Avenue used to stand and where I once bought cologne that promised \u201cnotes of sandalwood\u201d but mostly smelled like commitment issues.\n\nNetflix House is what happens when a corporation throws several vaults\u2019 worth of capital at a single question, What if you could walk into your favorite shows, preferably without having to act or bathe like someone from the actual 1980s?",

        "content": "Remember the good old days? We waited a year\u2014maybe two\u2014for a new **season** of our favorite show. It was painful, sure, but the eventual drop was a single, glorious binge-fest. We adapted. We endured the long waits for the return of hits like the final run of *Stranger Things*.\n\nBut now, the streaming overlords have added a new layer of torture: **Volumes**.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that we waited for what we were promised as \"Season 5\" of *Stranger Things*, only to get Volume 1\u2014a cruel, tantalizing fraction of the story. You get four episodes of vital plot, a massive cliffhanger, and then... nothing. Back to the waiting game for Volume 2, which is essentially just the back half of the same season. The same happened with the highly-anticipated return of *The Family Man*, only for fans to have to wait again between parts.\n\n  \nWe signed up for the convenience of binge-watching, the freedom to control our viewing experience. Now, we are being forced back into an anticipated, staggered release schedule, only without the benefit of the traditional weekly TV model that kept the community discourse alive for months. Instead, we get an initial flash of binge-mania followed by a frustrating, momentum-killing pause.\n\n",
