Idk about the book, but they are 18 years of age on the show. Still taboo because he is a student, but I did want to mention that. Malin did an interview on it recently. \n\nAll in all, if you want a quick and breezy watch with some bonkers moments, take a watch. ",

Also a platform making $$$ off of selling bikini pics of 12-year-old girls is wild. Would be pretty explosive as Alec Celestin recruited and partnered with Lucy Guo who is now the \"youngest self-made female billionaire\".\n\n  \nAny other ideas for a second season?",

        "content": "**Season 1:**\n\nWhy Gi-hun didn't get on the plane: he literally watched 444 people die right in front of his eyes (excluding Il-nam, who died in the hospital), including his childhood best friend. That much PTSD and trauma piled on in six days isn't something one can just shake off. If he *did* go to America, even with his new wealth, he still wouldn't be able to be the dad Ga-yeong deserved, and I think he knew it, too. Besides, what else could he do -just *forget* that the games are still going on, and try to live a happy life knowing 455 more people will get massacred every single year?\n\n  \n**Season 2:** \n\nThe Rebellion: Believe it or not, it was actually the only option. In-ho's suggestion was an illusion of choice -we see the 'O's creeping across the floor barely ten seconds after the lights go out. Even if the 'X's *had* tried to attack first, there would still have been a huge fight, and who's to say none of the main gang wouldn't have been killed accidentally in the chaos? Gi-hun isn't *supposed* to have perfect logic or foolproof planning -he's just as human as anyone else, which is part of what makes him such a great character.\n\n\n\n**Season 3:**\n\nStrangling Dae-ho: Both of them could have handled things a helluva lot better. From Gi-hun's POV, it's all his fault Jung-bae and the others are dead. Geum-ja was right about one thing in '222': *good people beat themselves up about the smallest things*. It's survivor's guilt. Then, at his lowest point ever, he's surrounded by his only surviving friends, who tell him it's Dae-ho's fault. All that guilt and grief reached such a crescendo, he had no idea what to *do* with himself anymore -he'd probably have tried strangling himself in the night but for the possibility of revenge. Admittedly, Dae-ho doesn't really help his case -he stuffs his face with potato, makes no visible effort to approach any of the others and apologise for being too scared to bring the ammo, and sleeps like a log. Before Hide-and-Seek, he also honestly shouldn't have yelled at Gi-hun -that was a dumb call. He thought he could be brave when the rebellion came, but when it was his moment, his courage failed him. He's understandable, really, and tragic because of it -but honestly, who *wouldn't* be like Gi-hun in this situation? He's so overwhelmed with guilt after killing Dae-ho, he almost stabs himself right there in the maze.\n\nJun-hee dying: She didn't really *need* to have a broken ankle -she just went into labour *yesterday*\\- but I suppose there had to be *some* extra handicap for those people who don't understand how hard giving birth is. The fact she was able to walk at all in the last minutes of the maze game was amazing, and it took a huge toll on her strength even without her fractured ankle. She was already fading fast by the time Jump Rope began, and she knew her limits -she already tried practicing tiny hops on the starting platform before Myung-gi approached her, and her ankle gave out on the second shuffle. She also indirectly saved Gi-hun a little while longer -that baby was just about the last thing left tethering him to life.\n\nGi-hun dying: If there's someone who can think to press a button when you're busy in the middle of fighting for your life with a two-day-old baby at stake, I'd honestly like to meet them. Also, how can people talk so casually of him throwing the baby off the tower and walking out alive? (I guarantee most of you wouldn't have the guts to do it yourselves.) He had nothing left in the outside world anymore, not really -the three years between Seasons 1 &amp; 2, his whole life was stopping the games. Dying on his own terms was actually the kindest, most peaceful, and most dignified way he could've gone. He wasn't eliminated by the games. He was set free by himself. *Humans are*\u2026 Whatever *most* humans are, *this* one was worthy of respect.\n\nSquid Game USA: this was actually foreshadowed by the VIPs all the way back in Episode 7 of Season 1. If you don't like it, don't watch the potentially upcoming spinoff.\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry for the monster post, but I just had to get it all off my chest. Thanks for coming to my unofficial Ted Talk, guys!",

I can\u2019t find them at all searching for them in Netflix. It will only give me shows \u201clike\u201d the one I\u2019m searching for. This is consistent across all devices: iPhone, iPad Pro, and a LG OLED tv. Very strange. I hope I get my shows back eventually \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOriginal text:\nI was watching Scandal through again as a passive watch while doing chores and such, and after this last episode (I was somewhere in season three) it didn\u2019t play the next episode and it just\u2026went away completely off of Netflix. Off my continue watching list, and I can\u2019t find it searching either. I googled it and there was a Netflix link announcement from last month, that it was coming back, and that link took me to a \u201cremind me\u201d page for the show on Netflix, essentially saying they will remind me when it\u2019s available. I also noticed (though I don\u2019t watch it) that Grey\u2019s Anatomy is gone too. \n",

They also just wasted it all on the Sekai Taikai instead of exploring more storylines that needed to be wrapped up which ended up leaving so many unresolved in the end. So yeah, they're gonna need to go back and edit the final season for its release on DVD or Blu-Ray. ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always enjoyed Netflix, but one thing that\u2019s become increasingly discouraging over the years is the steady rise in subscription prices. While I understand that costs naturally increase over time, it feels as though the justification often lies in their growing investments\u2014some of which may not resonate with all viewers.\n\nOne area in particular that raises concern for me is their expansion into live sports. While I recognize the appeal for those who follow specific teams or leagues, live sports can be quite niche. Not everyone shares the same enthusiasm for certain sports. For instance, I have no interest in the NFL, so it\u2019s frustrating to see my subscription cost increase to support content I have no intention of watching.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this trend?",

I\u2019ll watch a new show (released within the past few months), finish the season and get invested, only to find out they\u2019ve cancelled it a month later. I\u2019ve found articles saying it\u2019s due to \u201clow viewership\u201d, but they didn\u2019t even recommend the shows to me, no advertising, etc, and then cancel it shortly after, before most people have even heard of the series. I\u2019m starting to consider cancelling my subscription because of this.",

        "content": "UNTAMED is an incredibly thought-provoking limited series that is anything but limited. Its intricate web of plotlines keeps you constantly on your toes, making you wonder what will happen next. The cinematography is beautiful, and the series boasts a phenomenal atmosphere and vigorous character depth that immerses you in its world in an unparalleled and distinctive way. The pacing is tight, which keeps the plot moving at a brisk and engaging rate, but this usually comes at the cost of killing the built-up tension and suspense. The Series starts with a bang, captivating until the end with its dark and astonishing emotional scenes that feel incredibly authentic, brought to life by exceptional acting performances. Overall, UNTAMED is an exceedingly entertaining and remarkably immersive series that trips over itself a few times, stumbling even harder in its final stretch. However, the journey is still very worthwhile.\n\n80%",
