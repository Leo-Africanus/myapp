Let me explain\u2026\n\nHe was right about convincing Cara that he swapped with Sam but if he wanted to follow through with that plan he should have swapped Cara and Sam\u2019s boxes not his and Cara\u2019s. He would then need Cara to swap Sam and his box  (thinking that they were both empty and she still has the million) for him to win. There is no situation where he would have won after swapping his box with either of them. If he swapped with Sam, Cara would have swapped them back leaving Sam the winner and if he swapped with Cara she would have taken it back. Therefore the odds were very heavily stacked against him and he messed up massively.",

Piper also hangs out with OF creators like Sophie Rain which looks like foreshadowing of what she will choose to become when she turns legal age.\n\nLooking forward to her response to all the allegations when she turns 18.

One other guy I know had the same reaction \u2013 we both felt kinda bad for him.\n\nBut then I heard about three women (all therapists, though only for a few years), and they didn\u2019t get that reaction at all. Sounded to me like they identified more with the therapist than the boy. \n\nIt got me wondering \u2013 is this difference just about being a therapist or not? Or could it also be about gender, or who you identify with emotionally?\n\nCurious to hear how others experienced that scene. Did it feel unfair or necessary?\n\n\n",
