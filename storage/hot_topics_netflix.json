I have never heard of this show before and I\u2019m a pretty picky person, but I thought it was fantastic with the exception of a few unrealistic scenes/occurrences in the series. It also had some really great people in it, namely Anna Kendrick, Jessica Williams, and Ego Nwodim. What are you guys think?",

It looks weird and unnatural, not in the charming, spooky\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0way, but in a \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel believable\u201d way. The makeup doesn\u2019t look good either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere, it makes the characters look kind of awkward.\n\nThe plot also feels too childish, like it\u2019s trying to be edgy but still ends up being a teen drama without much depth. The detective/thriller angle is actually a good idea in theory, but the execution feels\u2026 meh.\n\nIt\u2019s below the quality I usually expect from Netflix\u2019s big series, and it\u2019s disappointing because it\u00a0could\u00a0have been amazing.\n\nIs it just me? Or did anyone else go in with high hopes and come out feeling\u2026 meh?",

The plot seems to have picked up in pace compared to season 1, and there\u2019s a lot more tension and drama building up between the characters. I\u2019ve noticed that the writing feels sharper, and some of the storylines are finally starting to pay off after being set up earlier in the series. The new characters they introduced have also brought fresh energy and unexpected twists, which keep things exciting. Of course, there are still a few moments where the pacing slows down, but overall, it feels like the show is heading in a strong direction. I\u2019m curious to hear whether you think the changes have improved the series or if you prefer the way season 1 unfolded.\n",
