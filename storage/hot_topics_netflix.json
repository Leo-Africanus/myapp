Why didn't anyone say to the father when he gave those lies about Mag's father: Didn't your daughter claim to be friends with Mags? If she had been murdered by Jason, why didn't she know already to be afraid of him? Why did she marry someone who she thought had killed her friend?\n\nThere were SO many opportunities here to catch these people up in her lies and to send them to jail forever, and I am just beyond disgusted that there wasn't a bigger push to expose her for the BPD lying fraud she is, and HE is.",

The caption was \u201csharing is caring,\u201d and it showed this app/interface called Artfact Note\u2014basically disguised as an artifact-looking app, but once you enter a specific code, it unlocks access to a bunch of streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, HBO, etc.\n\nI got curious (of course) and tried it out. Been using it for a day and, honestly? It works. I can actually stream shows without the usual login/subscription steps. It really feels too good to be true.\n\nI dug around a bit\u2014checked their privacy policy, user agreement, etc.\u2014and nothing seems immediately sketchy. It explicitly states that it does not collect or store personal data.\n\nStill, I can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s a catch. Either it\u2019s harvesting something quietly, or it\u2019s going to stop working one day and leave everyone hanging. Anyone here tried it or have any idea what the risks might be?\n\nNot trying to promote it, just curious if anyone else has encountered this. Thoughts?",

That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

Then shuts off. \n\nI paid the $17.99 a month for a while to be able to continue the shows. \n\nI figured let them figure out the problem. \nHere I am 6 months later and the same issues. \n\nActually it also kicks me out of Netflix and I have to start to reload again. Only to have it happen minutes later. \n\nThis is clearly intended to go to the $17.99 a month because I am not the only one experiencing. \n\nAnd I order thru Netflix directly. No third party, ",

Like we should feel bad for her?\n\nHer lies about giving birth to Sarah, and how obsessed she is talking about adopting them. She wanted those kids and Jason paid for it. \n\nAlso the RECORDING they tried to use as proof as abuse is insane. Yelling and fighting within families is normal and doesn\u2019t = abuse. Absolutely pathetic excuse. \n\nHer and her disgusting father should still be in prison. I hope she has an awful life. Vile humans. ",
