        "content": "I just finished Black Rabbit and honestly, I think it\u2019s one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen in a long while.\n\nExciting and unpredictable \u2013 Every episode had me hooked. There\u2019s this constant tension and unease that made me lean in, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\nEmotionally provoking \u2013 It\u2019s rare for a show to hit so many emotional notes; anger, sadness, empathy, anxiety and dread. All in the same arc. I found myself genuinely caring about what happened to the characters.\n\nCharacters you invest in \u2013 Even when they\u2019re flawed or making questionable choices, I couldn\u2019t help but root for them or at least understand them. That level of writing and acting is what kept me so engaged.\n\nActing \u2013 Top-tier. The performances felt layered, raw, and real, like you\u2019re watching people rather than actors.\n\nCinematography \u2013 The dark, grey tones of NYC were such a perfect backdrop. It wasn\u2019t just filmed in New York; the city itself felt like a character. That moody aesthetic pulled me in even deeper.\n\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand at all is why The Guardian gave it a negative review. Honestly, did we even watch the same show? For me, it delivered on every front; storytelling, visuals, acting, and atmosphere.\nEdited to add the music matched the dark and gritty theme so well also!\n\nOverall, Black Rabbit just worked. It\u2019s one of those rare shows that stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\n\nAnyone else feel the same way, or equally baffled by the negative takes?\n\n",

I mean, in season 2 he spent the whole time basically volunteering his services for another PD lol. Meanwhile, Detective Frost is more realistically part of a department and has an amusing relationship with a boss who actually makes professional demands of him. There\u2019s pretty good running jokes about the growing piles of unfinished paperwork associated with cases backing up. Lastly, he takes mentoring younger members of the department seriously and that\u2019s pretty sweet to see. \n\n",

It feels like there will be cheating already, and i\u2019m just fed up with that storyline. I won\u2019t continue watching this show if the characters are just typical netflix tropes; unrelatable yet oh-so cheesy. Also, it just feels unnecessary to start this cheater narrative when the guy could\u2019ve just been single. So clich\u00e9. \n\nReally wondering why this show is at the top searches. \n\nAnyone can let me know if there will be actual cheating or will they be normal people for once? ",

        "content": "The first two episodes were nice and all, but the rest devolved into yet another spanish drama (albeit in fallout-pilled suits).\nI wanted to know way more about the details of the plan, especially after Casa de papel.\nThe two families were too weird for me to feel empathy for them (I swear, the dad who's desperate for love and friendship is the most sane of the bunch), the two 'kids' felt so dumb (WHO expects to find a usable blood-purifier after a nuclear carpet bombing?) and it felt extremely anticlimatic for the whole compound to shut down because of a shortcut. Designed by a top-tier architect and her genius engineer of a brother, but beaten by a blockhead with a prison formation to be electrician. And for their super AI (that is CRUCIAL to the plan) not to have a back-up source of power was a bit too much for me.\n\nAaaaand, the CEO's associate's whole arc was basically useless. The dude had a perfect love story (orchestrated by the gang to serve the plan) but got a random info that made him doubt everything. And when we thought he was about to make the whole thing fail..... the gang just offs him. One pushed him into the other's arms, the latter breaking his neck just likmke that, on the street. Unless this death plays an important part in a potential second season, this arc was pointlessly focused upon.\n\n\nAnd tge final problem I have with how mister blockhead \"Muh, my dad's pathetic and my mom's a psycho that regrets I was born\" managed to get out. The command center just needed to cut the power to stop the final elevator. This would have given their staff ten times the time to, idk, release the elevator and off the guy. But no, they all watch him reach the exit (I know he had a tablet, but that wasn't gonna do jack if  the power was cut)",

        "content": "I was watching the movie \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" on Netflix. Since I hadn't seen it in a while, I wanted to rewatch it (obviously also watching the first one). Nothing strange, until we get to the scene where Dennis shows Torty's video to Grandpa Dracula. I'm Italian, and I was watching the video in Italian, so I thought it was a mistake due to the Italian audio, but it wasn't. Torty, after Dennis is put to bed, (from what I remembered) said \"Slow down, Buzzle Lump. The scariest monster of all is diabetes.\" Now, however, he just laughs. I was wondering if it was a mistake or not.",
