        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Netflix subscriber for years, but with the latest price hike for the Premium plan (now $24.99/month!), I\u2019m really starting to question if it\u2019s worth it anymore. They keep raising prices while pushing out content that, honestly, doesn\u2019t always hit the mark. It feels like they\u2019re making us pay for their poor-performing shows and movies instead of focusing on producing quality content that people actually want to watch.\n\nAnd the password-sharing crackdown? I get that they want to boost profits, but it feels like they\u2019re ignoring how modern households actually function. Not everyone under one account lives in the same house 24/7\u2014people go to college, travel for work, or stay with family temporarily. It just seems dumb to alienate loyal customers who aren\u2019t trying to cheat the system but just have a normal life.\n\nA lot of people I know have either canceled their subscriptions or switched to other streaming services that offer just as much\u2014if not more\u2014for less money. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If they\u2019re losing subscribers because of price hikes, why keep doing it? Shouldn\u2019t they focus on improving their content and keeping people around instead of squeezing every dollar out of us?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are you sticking with Netflix, or are you moving on to other platforms?",

That was the most emotional episode(and the best\u2014at least for now) I've ever watched in any form of entertainment. The ending was good, and although I initially told myself I would wait a bit before starting the next season, I ended up starting season 2 the next day or so.\n\nAnd....\n\n\nIt was Great as well. Didn't exactly have the emotional attachment that to characters that season 1 did, but in terms of entertainment, it was just about the same.\nThanos is really funny\n\nThe ending was good for me. \n\nDespite what a lot of people say, I had no problem whatsoever with when the season ended. Obviously, I would prefer it went longer, but stopping the season there,I have no problem with. I can definitely wait and I realise that not everything the season started with needed to be finished before then(like character's development).\n\nSeason 1 was 10/10\n\nSeason 2: 8,5/10\n\nTherefore,by calculation, I rate Squid game:9,2/10\nAbsolutely phenomenal.\nMy favourite show so far except for One Piece(not live action).\n\n",

        "content": "This is the first book that I\u2019ve read of 2025 and I loved it, so when I saw it on Netflix I thought it must also be good\u2026 wrong!\n\nThe accents are bad, but they did not bother as much as the awful deviations from the novel. \n\n1. All of the Nazis are very standard evil characters with no ambiguity. It\u2019s just \u201cdo this or I shoot you.\u201d In the book they are complex characters with varying motivations. \n\n2. A major part of the whole story is Werner Trapped in the basement of the hotel with his friend (I assume in the show its the guy who dies in the bombings at the beginning). They have to survive days in the dark with no food or water before finally finding a way out, in which Werner immediately goes searching for Marie. \n\n3. Werner\u2019s entire backstory is ignored. The characters he interacts with, how he struggles to stay himself while at the school, all ignored. \n\n4. The entire resistance in the show is ridiculous. Etiene wanted nothing to do with it because it endangered Marie, that is until Madam Manec died, then he starts broadcasting codes, but not riding motorcycles and wielding tommy guns. \n\n5. A huge part of the story is how her dad always made puzzle boxes for her to figure out, and the diamond in the house was a puzzle box that she figured out BEFORE Von Rumple shows up. \n\n6. I think the most bothersome for me revolves around the house itself. In the book It\u2019s described as one of the tallest in the town. It is 6 stories high, and the access to the attic is through Etiene\u2019s brother\u2019s room where there is a trap door that he builds into an old, extremely heavy wardrobe. The attic is described as being too short to stand up in and there are no windows. Marie hides in the attic for four days while Von Rumple is searching her house for the diamond, afraid to even move for he may hear her. \n\nThere is so much more missing or altered in the series that I could list, but overall I\u2019m really disappointed in how Netflix took so many liberties with a story that was really well written. \n\nRent over",
