The casting team gets actors that look, sound, and act like the time period. The art, set, costume all bust their butts to be perfect with the time period. Then the idiots in the score/music department think they need to put in modern music. This practice needs to end. Nothing kicks me out of a film harder. You are ruining so many shows. You could make great shows, but instead you make \"just okay\" shows. House of Guinness is one of these shows. Who ever the heck is in charge at Netflix fix this stupidity. If you want to add a modern flair why spend millions making anything period perfect? Why? You may as well casted all Indians instead of Irish looking people. You may as well put the cast in American eagle shirts with cargo shorts. At that point it does not matter. \n\nSincerely,\nA cinema lover",

        "content": "After I finished Squid Game season 3 in June, I was... pretty disappointed tbh. I frequently saw Squid Game being compared to another show, Alice In Borderland. So I decided \"let me check this out\" and I really liked it, in fact I even preferred it to Squid Game. The only thing is, season 2 was genuinely such a perfect conclusion that I myself wondered how they'd do season 3, especially as the manga ends at season 2 except for a short one-shot manga.\n\nI decided to give season 3 a try when it released today. Overall? I'd say its a 7.5/10. It was better than Squid Game season 3 and I didn't regret watching it but it wasn't exactly necessary either.\n\nThe games were fine. I especially liked the Zombies ones. \n\nFor the new character's, although they didn't hit the same as the original's did, I DID like quite a few. Rei especially was a stand-out for me. I remember everyone saw the trailer and thought she'd be annoying/hateable but no, she's probably going to be the fan favorite when this is all over. As a former bully victim, I was rooting for Nobu and am so glad he pulled through. Sachiko reminded me so much of Geum-ja from Squid Game and her surviving was a nice surprise.\n\nOn the other hand... Banda and ESPECIALLY Yaba were so wasted as villains. Yaba could be removed from the season and NOTHING would change whatsoever. He had 2 scenes. Banda was the main villain but he did nothing except hands out the cards to people manipualte Ryuji and try to recruit Arisu. At least Niragi was given a tragic backstory that humanized, this dude was just evil for fun.\n\nThere were a few questions left unasnwered, like where was Yaba in the final few episodes and why was the Borderland's collapsing at the end. It was nice for Ann to play a role due to her remembering everything but I wish she had a bigger role. It was nice to see all the previous cast return in the final episode for sure.\n\nBut PLEASE do NOT do an American spin-off.",

        "content": "I just watched the finale of Next Gen Chef and I found it to be seriously suspect.  \n\nThe show already had some questionable moments.   The episode where they did the brigade service and expected the restaurant to have a different kind of fish substitution, and a substitution for a roaster ingredient to be ready in the normal time frame seemed pretty unfair and unrealistic. Who is going to ask for a different kind of fish? That\u2019s like saying I don\u2019t like beef, do you have lamb (when lamb isn\u2019t on the menu). \n\nA restaurant that\u2019s stocking proteins that aren\u2019t even on the menu is probably going to have food cost issues pretty quickly out the gate. But that\u2019s not even the real problem with the show.  \n\nThe winner was an employee of two of the judges. He was the former employee of one of them, and the current employee of a highly influential finale judge.  In general, I liked the guy and by all accounts he was very confident. Aside from an extremely weird moment where he screamed at London for singing, he was a likable contestant. It\u2019s just when you\u2019re facing people who admired your cooking enough to hire you - TWICE - the question of authenticity really starts to seep in. \n\nBy the end, it just felt weird when he won, and it could have been avoided if they\u2019d just done some homework in booking the judges, or\nbuilt the games blind where they couldn\u2019t know who they were judging. \n\n",

I think with the rise of the manosphere, this isn't as huge of a thing anymor,e but I do find it interesting in how her experience with the brother isn't centered as someone who is roughly the same age and seems close-ish to the brother. Having a little brother myself, he has told me his view of women was shaped by me and my older sister, and he's much more of a feminist because of this. I have guy friends who hold similar views due to the impact of their sister. \n\n  \nBut other than that, how does her brother being a killer who killed based on being rejected impact her? They do talk about moving during the last episode, and it made me wonder if she felt the glares and looks at her or after the dad had that clerk from the hardware store say how he is on Jamie's side, if the dad was frightened for his daughter. \n\nIt's obviously very tailored and focused in a short span of time after he is arrested, but it makes me curious on the effects of this on his sister who could be the victim of someone else's rage. \n\nWhat are yall's thoughts?",

Until this morning, everything worked fine. Suddenly, my desktop (which is connected via Ethernet) started giving me a message that it\u2019s \u201cnot part of the same Netflix Household.\u201d Yesterday it worked without issue.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, the household restriction was mainly intended for TVs, and you\u2019re only able to confirm/update your household through a TV\u2014not a computer. When I asked Netflix chat about it, their answer was basically: *\u201cGrant your 14-day permissions every two weeks to watch, or use Wi-Fi on your computer.\u201d* That wasn't helpful, especially since my desktop is not a wireless compatible device.\n\nA bit more context:\n\n* My Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections appear to use different public IP addresses, though they are on the same Class C network.  It is only IPv4, not IPv6.\n* My Wi-Fi runs through a mesh system wired into my modem/router.\n* My desktop is directly plugged into the same modem/router.\n* It seems my ISP might be assigning more than one IP, which is interesting but might be the issue.\n\nHas anyone else run into this, and if so, how did you resolve it? It\u2019s frustrating since everything was working fine up until today, and now Netflix suddenly thinks my desktop isn\u2019t part of my household and the only help I am given is to connect it to the same Wi-Fi as my other devices are using.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

        "content": "Wow, I just sobbed at the very last scene of the Dad sobbing in Jamie\u2019s room and tucking the teddy bear in. Facing what\u2019s probably been his biggest fear since the day he found out what Jamie did - that he, as his father, should\u2019ve done more. \n\nThere were so many emotions to hold while watching this show and I especially felt it during this episode. I wanted to be angry with his family, because that\u2019s the easiest thing to do when a 13 year old boy does something like this. Assume his family/home life is terrible. But there was this mixture of love, shame, anger, and grief they were experiencing. I\u2019ve seen other comments on here say that the dad was emotionally abusive. This may be my own blind spot coming out as the daughter of a man with anger issues, but I can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s what the series was trying to depict or not. What I saw was a man with temper issues but that those issues were extremely exacerbated by trying to keep it together and being in denial about his son\u2019s actions. Not that people are merely \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d but seeing his family be \u201cgood\u201d people made it a more emotional watch for me. And it makes me wonder how it is Jamie became the way he did. \n\nI felt gutted by the last scene and I thought it did an excellent job of demonstrating the grief they are going through. They are grieving the son they once knew and who they thought he was. They were trying to make sense of how this happened even though they had the best of intentions and were, by all means, a pretty \u201cnormal\u201d family. But as I felt gutted for his family, I had to remind myself what her family must be going through. And how what happened was tragic and Jamie\u2019s actions wreaked havoc upon everyone around him - no one in his family did what Jamie did but they are paying for his actions. But at the end of the day his main victim, above all, is the girl whose life he felt entitled to take, and nothing can ever change that. It\u2019s something his family will have to accept and her family will have to grieve forever. ",
