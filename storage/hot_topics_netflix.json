        "content": "  \nThere\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether *Adolescence* demonizes men and masculinity. But is that really the case? Here\u2019s what the show *actually* explores:\n \n- It critiques toxic environments, not men themselves. The series stars Jamie Miller a 13 year old boy who is arrested for the murder of Katie Leonard. But Adolescence doesn\u2019t portray Jamie as inherently violent, he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online spaces. ([Time](https://time.com/7267884/adolescence-netflix-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Jamie struggles with emotional repression, something many young boys face due to societal expectations. For me the show is more about how important it is for young boys to learn how to manage their emotions and be vulnerable so they do not become violent like Jamie. ([News.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/casual-brutality-hidden-meaning-behind-adolescence-emojis/news-story/a8d7e4d2dbf8260f48e2af5c4c9a0858?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Jamie\u2019s exposure to incel forums and online radicalization is a key theme. The show critiques these dangerous spaces, not men in general. Just like we discuss unrealistic beauty standards for women, Adolescence examines toxic influences affecting young men.\n\nAt its core, *Adolescence* isn\u2019t about vilifying men\u2014it\u2019s about understanding the challenges they face. Instead of rejecting its message, let\u2019s ask: How can we better support young boys before they reach a breaking point?",

Why she started with such questions like father, sexuality? Was she trying to make him confess or just trying to delineate his psychological profile? \n\u2022\t\u2060What do you see in the kid about his reactions and answers?\n\nNo need to answer these specific questions i made. Just say whatever comes in your mind.\n\nIn my opinion, but i repeat that i have no competences in this field, I see the psychologist a bit inexperienced in some moments (maybe is done on purpose for cinematic reasons). I think she was way too emotionally involved and some times gave him the opportunity of taking too much space and to attack her\n\nBy the way\u2026 the kid is a phenomenal actor.",

If anything I tried to find signs that contradicted my original analysis and I really couldn\u2019t find many.\n\nThe entire third episode characterised it so well, down to the body language of the psychologist as she was trying to make her assessment of him. Then the fourth episode gave a lot of context as to how he was raised \u2013 negligent parents, *possibly* a narcissistic father \u2013 on top of the bullying and rampant insecurities, I could go on\u2026\n\nFor those who work in mental health and related fields, themselves have ASPD or have experiences with people who do\u2026 Like am I off base here?",

There were scenes that were longwinded and convoluted due to the length. It could have been 10-12 quick episodes instead of 8 super long ones. A minor nitpick I had is that the piano music they played sometimes was too similar to Only Murders in the Building. The piano music made sense because the characters in OMITB lived in an apartment where they used the elevator.\n\nOn a positive note, I thought the performances were all phenomenal. I absolutely loved Cordelia Cupp as a detective. I do wish the show had been set up for future seasons. She was very compelling as a lead.\n\n\\*\\*Updated to hide which episode I guessed the killer by in case that counts as a spoiler.\n\n**What other murder mystery shows/movies have you seen?**\n\nI've Watched:\n\n* Psych\n* Monk\n* CLUE\n* How To Get Away With Murder\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* Murder Mystery &amp; Murder Mystery 2\n* Knives Out\n* Murder on the Orient Express\n* Sherlock Holmes (the movies and the show)",

        "content": "I'm a big sports fan (WWE, NFL ETC.) and since Netflix diving more into this, I'm trying to figure out why some devices do different things when it comes to frame rate. Watching sports in 59.940 (60 FPS) compared to 29.970 (30 FPS) is like night and day for me (I'm a stickler for it).   Seems like apple and fire tv play the best with this.  59.940 will just work and looks great.  Android and windows, not so much.  On android, I have a Lenovo Yoga Tab 13. Windows, I have tried all the browsers and also the windows store app and still get 29.970.  Any other app or video streaming site lets you pick but Netflix doesnt allow you to choose and it makes no sense.  Does anyone understand why or how to make it work?  If someone has proof that it actually works on windows, please show me and what you are using cause it is getting on my nerves, lol. Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "The anime started slow for me so I was watching the first few episodes on and off. Don't know what happened but somewhere along the way, I got hooked and finished all 28 episodes over the weekend. What a great series this is for me. You go through a somewhat emotional journey with flashbacks that ties up everything all together. Deep story, great character development, battle scenes were fantastic as well. This is a worth a watch!\n\nAdding that I usually watch anime in cc. However, I find the voice dubbing of Frieren (the character) so soothing. Monotone, lack emotions or detached in some way and slow to interpret human emotions. Matches her personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have Full HD plan and a set up that is ridiculously overqualified for watching movies (High end PC as well as very good and stable Wifi), but still it feels like i permanently have to watch in 480p.\n\nI also changed my Profile setting to prefer \"High\" Graphics.
