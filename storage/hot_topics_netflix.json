Since yesterday I cannot find Breaking Bad on the list of available series on the website. Everything was going smooth and fine so far until yesterday. When I was trying to launch BB from a history I got an UI3003 indicating that the product is not available in my country.\n\n\n\n I looked up on the internet and some of the troubleshooting steps involved clearing the browser's history and cache however this didn't work. I launched the Netflix app on my mobile phone with the same issue however when I turned my wi-fi off and switch to mobile data (set to Czech Republic) it reappeared. Does anybody know what may be the reason of this sudden regional exclusion?\n\n  \nThank you.",

        "content": "I just watched S1 E2 of Wednesday last night and it feels different from the pilot. The pilot was closer to being cinematic in quality. Episode 2, the one with the canoe race, feels much more amateurish in pacing, direction, acting, writing, etc. It's like watching someone play an RPG videogame. Most of the characters speak entirely in cliches (the roommate and the queen bee girl especially). The dialog is so clean like how they take turns perfectly and don't really move around while talking. Wednesday gets away with that because she's a creepy deadpan snarker and Ortega pulls off the deadpan thing very well. But, most of the characters aren't suited to it. \n\nIf the argument is \"This is made for teens\", well, okay even when I was a teenager I could tell a good quality screen production from a cheesy one. \n\nIf the rest of the series is like this I'm probably going to be really disappointed, which is too bad because I think Ortega, Zeta-Jones, Guzman, and the kid that plays Pugsley are great casting for the Addams family.",

Instead,\u00a0***Wayward***\u00a0feels like what would happen if Ari Aster, yes,\u00a0***Hereditary***\u00a0Ari Aster, was handed a stack of Judy Blume novels and told to make them deeply upsetting. The setting is the suspiciously quaint Tall Pines, a town where everyone knows everyone, and everyone waves, and everyone would probably lend you sugar, before locking you in a basement and asking you to recite scripture backwards.

The fact that no one suspects that the people they see in their actual reality, were once part of their past. For example, how come Hannah never ever saw a childhood pic of her husband Michael and didn\u2019t flip out when she saw Urlichs son Mikkel before disappearing? This question could apply to any other character and their past/present stories. The only thing they say is that they have some sort of deja vu \ud83d\ude00 like wtf\n\n2. The first two seasons are waaay too slow while the third one is like each episode feels like a new season, so accelerated\u2026 \n\n3. Their naivety \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 for example, how on earth did it take Urlich so long to run DNA tests when they found the body of Mads? How on earth do you not recognise your brother even if the eyes are burnt black?!!!!\n\nIdk, maybe I am missing something and pls educate me but to me this show is way too overrated. And I just cant figure it out how it has so many devoted fans that a lot of people rewatch it almost every year\n",
