She helped so she could own it. So she could parade around as the long-suffering savior. That wasn\u2019t compassion. That was martyrdom weaponized.\n\nThe way she guilt-tripped, overstepped, and then had the audacity to call Simone \u201ctoxic\u201d? Nah. She was the emotional vampire of the show \u2014 draining everyone with her need to be seen as \u201cthe good one.\u201d And when Simone stopped giving her the validation she fed on, she suddenly flip-flopped from hating Michaela to loving her? Girl. That was jealousy, not healing.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t handle not being the center of Simone\u2019s emotional world. So she punished her. Classic narcissist behavior in a wellness cape.\n\nEven when she had a point, she was so smug about it that I found myself rooting against her just on principle. And that cruise? Please. She stayed behind with their dad just so she could get gold stars for suffering. It wasn\u2019t selfless \u2014 it was performative.\n\nJustice for Simone. And prayers up for anyone who\u2019s had to survive a Devon in real life.",

        "content": "Im having a weird issue, hopefully you all here can help me. I was watching Demon Slayer yesterday on my phone, on my profile. Today it won't show up, I have no viewing restrictions on my profile. I swapped to my wife's profile, on my account, on my phone and it pops right up. Any thoughts on why this is?\n\nThanks in advance",
