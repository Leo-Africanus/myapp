The main character was a teenage guy who was always getting into trouble and secretly lived in an unused upstairs room without his parents knowing. I vividly remember a scene where he did something that involved the police, and his younger brother was always helping him out. There was also a scene where he ordered a pizza and had a crush on the delivery girl, and he ended up sitting on the roof while she was there. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've been trying to remember the title forever!",

I have a complex password for both my Netflix and my email account.\n\nI tried to log into my Netflix account this morning and it told me that I didn't have an account associated with my email. Checked my login in last pass and it was the correct email / pass, so I went to my email and found that this morning I had two emails saying my email had been updated and a new payment method was added. Note: these emails have times for only a few minutes ago at that point - like when I was literally trying to log in. Hmm. So, I try to log in again and this time it lets me use my email but says my password is wrong - which means it's changed, because I *know* my password. I go through the change passwords steps which of course goes through my email with a change password link. I get into my account and there's nothing there, no subscription, no profiles, nada. \n\nThus I get on support chat with Netflix, explain the situation, they verify me and ultimately get me my account back. They say that the email had been changed, won't tell me what that was changed to, I can see the new card info that was added, which I removed. I once again change my password.\n\nI asked if they could give me any idea what happened because I need to know how severe of a breach this was on my end and they were very \"we can't tell you anything for security purposes\" no matter how much I told them I feel like I really need to have some sort of idea of what happened. I feel like this could be a their end something that happened - but... I wish I could tell so I know what to do on my end. I guess I can switch it to a different email? ",

        "content": "Netflix has released a new docuseries, \"Bad Influence\", about a kid who was exploited as a child influencer. Her mom posted her all over the internet as a kid with little / no regard for her safety, and made tons of money off of her.\n\nSo, Netflix are now using this kid's story to - you guessed it - make money off the documentary.\n\nHer full name is in it, her face is in it. I've watched the intro in which someone states \"predators were watching these videos\" AND IT SHOWS, with no censoring, the type of videos that predators would seek out - eg, of her dancing as a minor dressed in not a lot.\n\nThe real kicker is that this kid is STILL A KID. She's still 17. And even if she wasn't, I still feel this is exploitative. This is NOT the way to raise awareness of the dangers of child influencing.\n\nAlso - she's very active on social media and hasn't posted about the documentary, which makes me question whether this was even done with her consent. Imagine the mental toll this kind of thing would take on her. It seems to be an awful privacy violation for a child whose whole life has been a series of awful privacy violations. I hope she gets the help she needs and then sues the shit out of them.\n\nIt feels so disgustingly ironic to me. Gross on Netflix's part.\n\n(EDIT: I did watch an episode to make sure I was along the right lines after I posted this. just want to say I 100% agree with anyone saying that the other kids deserve to tell their stories, especially now they're adults. What an awful, disgusting situation all around. My heart breaks for all these kids. We must have better laws to protect our children from the internet. However, I do believe the publishing of the doc could make things worse for the \"main\" child in question, and I don't believe it was published with her best interests at heart. I'm also uncomfortable with Netflix monetising the situation. Thanks to everyone who's discussed this in the comments.)",

        "content": "Every week or so I'm kicked off of my netflix because \"This device isn't a part of your household\" though I'm quite literally using my home wifi where the account was created and all of the users reside an use the account. Genuinely just considering canceling netflix at this point because this is ridiculous. Quickly became one of the most irritating streaming services to deal with, and customer support hasn't been of any help. I have the option to \"watch temporarily\" but then I need to deal with sending a confirmation email to the account owner, which I am not. Like I said, I'm still a part of the household and watching netflix physically in the same household, using the same wifi that the account owner is using. Is this happening to anyone else?",
