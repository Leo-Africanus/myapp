I can never seem to find anything I want to watch or am interested in. Idk when it started but there was a time when basically every Netflix original I don\u2019t dare to watch because I already know it\u2019s going to let me down (except the Monster series like it ok.)\n\nI got a pretzel in my head due to simultaneously knowing that i should cancel and that i do have an attachment to the brand. Getting all the newest movies in the mail for me and the gang to watch was epic and being able to stream on my Xbox was epic in its own right. Does anybody feel similar?",

If she cared for anyone else portions would\u2019ve gone to the actual victims of her father. The truth of the matter is her dad was actually a pretty good dad to her to the point nobody believed he was a killer.  He was a horrible person, I\u2019m not downplaying that it had to be traumatic in some way. But the entitlement and woe is me is just so irritating every single scene was all herself. The victims barely got any attention. ",

Can someone share insights in to why they think this happened? Also how dysfunctional was their brotherly bond.....like why were they okay with each other despite bringing doom to each other over and over again.\n\nI think Junior and Vince were Mancuso's sons....",

        "content": "Having seen the 1st 2 series and currently watching the 3rd one, I have noticed that the main characters are gay or have queer coding. Dahmer of course, the Menendez brothers who are very stange towards each other and I seem to remember one of them being gay? And then Ed Gein, who enjoys dressing up in women's underwear to masturbate. \n\nI genuinely think that this is an underlying systematic assumption we have/make about bad people; that they are sexual deviants and queer. There are plenty of stories I'm sure, about a serial killer who was fully straight and straight coded? Right? I feel weird about it and wanted to share. ",
