Truly. Did they even go to school? Or were they homeschooled by drug addled, morally bankrupt grifters spewing toxic masculinity? The mother seems to be from another country so maybe she\u2019s not the best teacher of English but yikes, you know they had enough money to maybe hire a tutor.\nAnd I found it interesting that his dad was depicted as a sweet, veterinarian (which takes an amount of studiousness) and instead of maybe trying to be like that he makes up this extreme version of what a man is that seems polar opposite of his dad. Odd choice. (Just as odd as smoking cigars which seems completely counter to his \u201cnatural\u201d lifestyle.)\nAnd the brother he says he looked up to is never mentioned as far as where he is now. Maybe they left that out bec he was involved in the criminal enterprises mentioned. I don\u2019t care enough about the guy to look it up, I just think it would have been interesting in the doc. It also would have been interesting if they addressed the children\u2019s allergies. Was that all made up too? If not, in what way were they resolved? As someone who has never heard of him but has a masters degree in food science and applied nutrition I was interested and it was so bad I had to increase the speed halfway through just to finish it quickly. It could have easily been nutshelled into a ten minute YouTube video.",

        "content": "Yes, I have skimmed over (spent one and a half hours searching everywhere) and I've noticed peoples opinions on the show. I personally didn't see much wrong with it. \n\nThe series was OK. The show never did specify why Jade and Billie hated each other so much. Though Billie did bite Simon. And Jade had a bit of resentment to her. It wasn't really just Billies fault. It's common sense in any post apocalyptic zombie game or show. If someone looks like they're about to turn stay the fuck away from them. \n\nBut the show was alright. I liked how the episodes had flashback before and after Racoon City. But with how the series drastically decreased in suspense. I'd honestly rate it a 7/10. \n\nIt was probably one of the few most recent series to hook my attention pretty damn easy. But since it's been about 2 years. And time and time again said to be finished off. Done. I don't think they'll make another. But overall. I liked the series. \n\nPrimarily because It reminded me of Dying Light. And no I'm not comparing the two. If theres any FACTUAL information on why the series wasn't bog or popular. I'd love to get feedback.",

The martial arts and gore are brutal, realistic and unrelenting from the 15 min mark to finish.\n\nIf this were titled \"Violence: The movie\" it would have been more apt.\n\nPeople get their limbs chopped off, bones used to block bonesaws, intestines flying, glass used in inventive ways, and each segment introduces a final boss. The girl fight scene is probably the best I've ever seen in a movie.\n\nI highly recommend this film 10/10. Praise Timo Tjahjanto",

It was beautiful, deep, and totally unexpected for a sci-fi action flick.\n\nThat got me thinking: what if there was a sequel that introduced an alien species with its own version of AI?\n\n-This alien AI wouldn\u2019t be built with empathy or trust.\n\n-It might see human-AI cooperation as weak\u2014or even dangerous.\n\n-Atlas and S.M.I.T.H., being fully synced, would be the only ones capable of communicating with or confronting it.\n\n-Maybe this alien AI tries to absorb or overwrite other AIs instead of syncing\u2014and it forces S.M.I.T.H. to evolve further to survive.\n\nI\u2019d love to see this idea explored\u2014emotion, high-stakes AI conflict, and even bigger questions about consciousness and connection across species.\n\nWould love to hear what others think\u2014and Netflix, if you\u2019re listening, this story needs a continuation!!!",

        "content": "I am a fan of Tom Segura. Enjoy his stand up and listen to his podcasts on occasion. This show was something. It felt like they were just trying to see what they could get away with to get put on air. Very few of the jokes hit with me. I guess I was not the target audience for this show.\n\nWith that being said, who enjoyed this?",

In my lunch break and after my workday, I just need something that's not very dull, psychological superficial shit but still engaging. Have you watched \"The Residence\"? Yes exactly like that. Mostly thrillers are preferred but I'll also take other suggestions. Please don't suggest a sitcom. I've watched all of them. Just need something that I can't stop before ending the episode but can wait for starting the next one. ",

Certain ends to episodes left me wanting to see how the chaos would play out but would just enter the next episode months into the future. \n\nI think the pacing wasn\u2019t for me but entertaining cast. \n\nAnyone else ?!?
