        "content": "We are exactly one week away from Volume 2 dropping on December 25 and it is clear that Netflix is treating this release differently from anything they have done before. While most shows get a single drop, Netflix has carved Season 5 into three deliberate peaks to dominate the entire holiday season.\n\nHere is why this strategy represents a massive shift for the platform.\n\n**The Theatrical Experiment for a Series Finale.** For the first time in the company's history, Netflix is releasing the series finale, The Rightside Up, in over 500 theaters across the US and Canada on December 31. This is a direct response to the Nolan effect, proving that certain events demand a big screen and a crowd. By doing this, they are effectively turning the 2 hour and 5 minute finale into a New Year's Eve blockbuster that competes directly with theatrical films.\n\n**The Holiday Cultural Hijacking.** Look at the dates. Volume 1 hit on Thanksgiving, Volume 2 drops on Christmas and the Finale lands on New Year\u2019s Eve. Netflix is ensuring that for three straight months, Stranger Things is the primary topic of conversation during the biggest family gathering windows of the year. It is a masterclass in sustained engagement compared to the usual one week binge and forget cycle.\n\n**The Return of the Feature Length Episode.** The runtimes for Volume 2, which covers episodes 5 through 7, are essentially three back to back movies.\n\n* Chapter 5: Shock Jock is 1 hour 17 minutes.\n* Chapter 6: Escape from Camazotz is about 1 hour.\n* Chapter 7: The Bridge is 1 hour 37 minutes.\n* The Finale is 2 hours 5 minutes.\n\nNetflix is betting that we will not mind the wait if every episode feels like a cinematic event.\n\nDo you think this Volume release strategy is the future for Netflix\u2019s big budget hits like Wednesday or Squid Game, or is this a one time deal because it is the end of an era? \n\nI think the theatrical finale is a huge win for fans, but it might be the start of Netflix moving away from the all at once binge model for good.\n\n",

        "content": "As we approach the 1 year anniversary of Squid Game 2, I would like to point out something: the soundtrack was AMAZING. \n\nWhile a lot of people may argue that season 1 has the best OST, I would argue that the season 2 ones were just on a different level. It perfectly buttresses the triumph, energy, and hope that characterized season 2 through remixing season 1 songs and introducing some newer, iconic tunes.\n\n***Way Forward***\u00a0is the obvious MVP here. Being a more hopeful, triumphant version of the iconic\u00a0*Way Back Then*, it sends a wave of nostalgia and goosebumps reminding us of the magic that we witnessed with season 1 in 2021. The song then develops into a more darker and mature tone, making us wonder how the season is going to unfold or whether or not Gihun will succeed in his mission to end the games once and for all.\n\n***No Way Back***\u00a0also is a great remix of\u00a0*Way Back Then*\u00a0at the beginning of the season, setting the stage for Gihun's revenge.\n\nWe get a\u00a0***Fly Me to the Moon***\u00a0and some pink solider theme song remixes during the first game.\n\n***A Five People Game***\u00a0was a goofy little edition to the pentathelon games really making it feel like a children's game. But more importantly, during the pentathelon\u00a0***We're Together***\u00a0made all of us cry tears of joy when Hyun-ju's team became the first successful pentathelon team to survive before streamlining the hype into the episode 5 title sequence.\n\n***To You***\u00a0which played during Gihun's pentathelon team game was also perfect, being an energetic and hype song that yet again builds onto the season's core theme of hope.\n\nThen there are soundtracks like\u00a0***Vote I, Vote II (Vote I remastered),***\u00a0and the 5\u00a0***Round the Circle***\u00a0music which perfectly depict and heighten the tensions between players during the voting scene and the frantic fight for survival during the games.\n\nWe can't forget about\u00a0***Let's Go Out!***\u00a0which is yet another\u00a0*Way Back Then*\u00a0remix, this time with an awesome electric guitar cover. It bolsters a sense of hope and spirit at the start of the rebellion.\n\nOf course, there is the mingle song which honestly isn't the best but catchy regardless.",
