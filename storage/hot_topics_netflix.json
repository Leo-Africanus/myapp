It\u2019s stuck on Ecuador, even though I live in Austria and the number saved in my account is my *Austrian* number. No idea how or why Ecuador got involved here, or why I can\u2019t switch it.\n\nObviously, I\u2019m frustrated. I\u2019ve tried contacting customer service, but no luck so far. My payment is due *tomorrow*, and I really don\u2019t want to lose my subscription. I use Netflix all the time.

Both the main characters were unappealing to me and I feel like their relationship wasn\u2019t explored enough, we were never shown actually WHY they liked each other so much. \n\nFelix was okay but I couldn\u2019t care for him. The ep about his family and SA was touching and really sad, but he had nothing else going on for him. He wasn\u2019t particularly affectionate to Jessica, wasn\u2019t shown to like her as a person rather then just being with her because she liked him, his relapse because of her was never even addressed, him still being friends and inappropriate with his exes was never resolved (I think there should\u2019ve been at least one scene where Jessica confronts him and he genuinely reassures her, since she clearly had insecurities and an \u201cother woman\u201d issue from her past relationship). He even cheats on her, NEVER apologises, and expects Jessica to give HIM a break after HER dog died a day later\u2026? UH??? A good looking bum overall. \n\nI was always on the brink of liking Jessica until she did anything. First of all I don\u2019t think the actress was a good choice, her way of acting is whiny in a really annoying way and when she was crying it felt like there was something I was supposed to find funny, but there wasn\u2019t? Her character was supposed to be weird and whimsy in an appealing and alluring way but she came off as just weird for no reason. Again I don\u2019t understand why she liked Felix first of all, I really thought he would be her \u201cI just moved to London and need a British guy to get over my evil ex\u201d who she\u2019d get over with after a bit, since she clearly didn\u2019t love him? Like, being on your phone while watching Paddington with him, saying I love you after like two days of dating,  being clearly upset at how he still interacts with so many of his exes, leaving him alone at her boss\u2019s house party, almost cheating on him on a work trip and never telling him, not wanting him to move in, accusing him of having no ambition? How were we supposed to be glad they get married in the end, they objectively aren\u2019t a good couple?\nEdit: I did love her family dynamic. It was very realistic and heartwarming coming from a family like hers.\n\nDid I get the show all wrong? Why does everyone else seem to love it?",

        "content": "I just finished watching the Amy Bradley docu. Prior to watching it, I wholly believed that she fell overboard and the family were in denial. But after watching the docu (and seeing how uncanny the similarities were in that adult escort site photo), I now think she could possibly also have been trafficked (though drowning overboard is still a possibility).\n\nHear me out - Amy was lesbian. This fact was never highlighted when I previously read about Amy prior to the docu. She was very masculine presenting and what one might term a \u2018butch\u2019. She wore masculine presenting clothes in her pictures with her friends. Her friend explained how scared she was to come out to her parents, and the disappointment the parents felt when she had told them (and how her dad wrote a 3 page letter to her then girlfriend smdh).  Her parents were obviously against her lifestyle despite saying that they \u2018loved her unconditionally\u2019. And she dealt with that unhappiness with alcohol.\n\nDespite her preference to wear masculine presenting outfits, she was literally in a DRESS with jewelry and stuff on the cruise. My conjecture is that she had tried to fit into what her parents wanted her to be (i.e. hetero) whilst she was with them on the cruise trip. And when she was approached by Yellow, she might\u2019ve probably thought well let\u2019s just try and see where this goes since my parents want me to be hetero. And hence it is possible that she had fed into her parents\u2019 dream of her being hetero when she was hanging out with Yellow, and unfortunately, eventually trafficked.\n\nHer parents are still in denial about her sexuality and you can tell from the way they speak about it that they are homophobic tbh.\n\nHappy to hear thoughts on this!",

I don\u2019t think there was one episode where she\u2019s not freaking out about something mundane. It was cute in GIRLS, because Lena Dunham\u2019s character made sense that way, but this was just redundant. Repetitive. And this scene in particular was ridiculous\u2014 if she was truly grieving, she would have been happy that Astrid had Felix there during her final moments.  ",

I really liked the show; the potential it promised kept me hooked ...\nBut eventually with the last scene of the closing episode I can no longer deny it that l'd have loved it had it been two episodes shorter.\n\nThere are infinite twists and turns with too many (and many a times unnecessary) story arcs leading to a crescendo that feels lackluster when you look at the time spent building it all up.\n\nPhenomenal acting, sloppy writing, and lazy editing is how I'll remember this show. Will never be returning for a rewatch though.\n\nA tighter plot, sharper editing and a little Hugh Jackman in the end scene could've done magic \u2728\n\n \nPs: what even was the end scene anyway?\ud83d\ude44",
