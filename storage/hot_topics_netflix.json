        "content": "I think people  forget reality tv is NOT real. It's set up to cause drama. If you dont know how reality tv works you should look into it. I think it's interesting reading these threads, but at the same time I have to remember myself how staged all of it is. So i will explain a little, basically the producers set up scenes for them. The producers will say stuff like \" why dont you go confront so and so\" or \"why dont you leave so and so and go talk to blank\" \n\nFor example joes comment about Madison's body. \nIn this case im 99% sure the producers said something along the lines of \"joe what is your typical body type\" and he explained it. They just chop it up to make it look worse for shock value. &amp; based on how the shows are edited Joe could have even said that at a completely different time, such as auditions.  The producers  could have said \"what type do you usually  go for\"  and then they edidted the clips to make it seem like he was talking down on Madison. \n\nAlso edmond.. poor edmond. Remember theres hundreds of hours of him and they clipped out the parts where he was acting how he was shown, to make him look that way. Even the bed scene could have been edidted and clipped to shit to make him look pushy. I guarantee it was a different conversation about how he is always the nice guy and gets walked over, and then producers edidted it to be about sex, or they chopped clips together, or they told them to say those things, or turn it into a convo about sex. \n\nPeople need to remember that theres likley hundreds of hours of filming,  chopped down to 8 hours. Those 8 hours are highly edited to create a storyline. They move clips around to create a story line, one scene could be from 3 different nights. I remember watching a documentary and they said the producers sometimes add words in, so if you ever look at someone and dont see their mouth lining up with the words, this is why. \n\n-Franken-bites\": This is a technique where editors take parts of sentences from different times and stitch them together to create a new, often out-of-context, quote that wasn't said in that exact way.\"\n\n-Narrative Construction: Producers and editors work to build a story, and they select footage that fits the pre-planned narrative, even if it occurred at a different time. The goal is to tell the \"best story,\" not necessarily present events in a strictly chronological or unvarnished way.\n\n-Reaction Shots: Editors often use \"cutaways\" or reaction shots filmed at separate times and locations to show a contestant's reaction to an event, even if that reaction was originally for something else entirely.\n\n-Confessionals/Interviews: The \"talking head\" interviews are typically filmed after the events have occurred and can be shot over multiple days. Producers often guide participants with specific questions to get sound bites that help explain or set up a storyline, which are then edited into the main action.\n\n- Continuity:\u00a0To maintain the illusion of a single, continuous scene, participants are often asked to wear the same outfits and jewelry for interviews or pick-up shots filmed on different days.\n\n\n-Time Compression: Long periods of filming (e.g., a week or even 21 days for shows like Naked and Afraid) are compressed into a 30-42 minute episode, requiring significant manipulation of time and sequence to create a flowing episode. \n\nNow apply this to every single person on LIB. \n\nReality tv is not real. Which is why its crazy to me that strangers online are so comfortable with bullying the contestants. \n",

Garfield was a Civil War hero and a abolitionist, and he didn't initially want his parties nomination, and is considered one of the last 'log cabin' Presidents, because he like Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Guiteau had hidden the gun in his pocket and the police only found it after taking him to the police station, and the first metal detector was used on Garfield. Guiteau's brain was actually studied, and its thought that his actions may have been due to syphilis, though of course in the 1880s medical tests like that were very unreliable. And Chester Arthur passed a lot of Garfield's corruption reforms. The score was great, made by the same composer that did Game of Thrones and Iron Man. I also thought they nailed Michael Shannon's look, his beard looks very similar to Garfield's pictures. Betty Gilpin's performance was so convincing.",
