        "content": "You\u2019ve probably seen this on your Netflix recommendations\u2014but if not, tune into  ***Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano 3***  live tonight at 8 PM EST, an all-women\u2019s boxing event with international undercards and major titles on the line.\n\nThe event features fighters from the UK, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, the U.S., and Spain, showcasing a global roster of talent. One big name on the card is  *Chantelle Cameron*, who split two fights with Taylor\u2014and never got a third, after Taylor declined the trilogy. That tension still lingers.\n\nIf you watched  ***Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson***  in November 2024, you probably agree that the co-main stole the show. Tonight, that rematch is back\u2014this time at *Madison Square Garden*. Hopefully Netflix\u2019s servers hold up better this time; last time, glitches meant a lot of fans missed key moments.\n\nAs for the main event: Serrano lost the first fight, barely dropped the second by  *unanimous 95\u201394*, and left the ring with a nasty cut. She\u2019ll be coming back for blood. Taylor, meanwhile, is looking to shut the door on the rivalry for good\u2014**this bout is billed as the final chapter of their trilogy**.\n\nFrom top to bottom, this card is loaded. This is surely going to be a night to remember. ",

And then when I saw Lena Dunham in the second episode It hit me. The main character is Lena Dunham in \"Girls\" and this entire show is \"Girls\" repackaged and set in London. EVEN her love interest looks and acts like exactly Adam!! \n\nThe worst part is in an interview Lena Dunham said this show was meant to resonate with Gen Z. How???!!

I've watched through House and The Resident so far, the former being perfect for what I needed (The Resident's romancy side-plots were a bit boring for me). The things that made House perfect was:\n\n- Serious overall show with some comedy/wittiness. (No Sitcoms or pure comedies or whatnot. I like a good plot).\n\n- Each hour episode has its own story. The season has an overall storyline, but each episode itself has its own story that is concluded by the end of the episode. (So, no Audiobooks or Podcasts)\n\n- The mystery element, where the protagonists are spending the episode trying to figure something out, and the something is satisfyingly figured out by the end of the episode.\n\n- Most importantly: The protagonists describe what's going on. In House, the characters would describe down to the detail each symptom they were seeing, the ways the diseases affected the patient, etc. \n\n- Also, I know there's one or two that are basically \"House, but it's about Psychiatry\". None of that. I am in the field of Psychology, I would be too offput by the inaccuracies.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI might try out one of those lawyer detective ones, like Law and Order or whatnot, but I don't know which ones of those would be a good fit. But open to other suggestions as well.\n\nThank you!",

If we change the household, it kicks the other person off and makes them do the same thing. I cannot even AirPlay to the TV or Cast anymore, Netflix blocks it in app or just won't play the episode.\n\nI may have dealt with this until the point where I called customer service on the Netflix app, and after going back and forth with the CSR for a bit, with them trying to tell me I could click the \"I'm away from home\" option (which there was not on the TV), then telling me there was absolutely nothing they can do, no one to escalate to, and that the only thing he could do was \"educate (me) on the way Netflix works now)\". I hung up at that point, and canceled my subscription.\n\nSorry Mr. No-Name CSR, I don't require your education, we'll find something else.",

Honestly, it\u2019s such a bold move to lure viewers in with such great storytelling only to pull the plug without warning. Truly inspiring.\n\nWho needs closure or a satisfying conclusion when you can just leave characters and audiences dangling in a void of unfinished arcs? The way you cancel shows based purely on streaming data instead of giving them time to grow? Absolutely visionary. \n\n\nNothing says \u201cwe value your time\u201d like pulling the rug mid-binge. Really, Netflix, thank you for reminding me not to get emotionally attached to anything on your platform ever again. Great job keeping disappointment fresh and consistent!\n\n",

        "content": "Just finished the (hopefully) final season of You and I couldn't help but check what other people thought about it. Unsurprisingly... everyone hated it. But I just can't help but wonder, what did y'all expect? You is perfect trash TV, it's corny and silly and ridiculous. It has been this way since season 2. The acting is exaggerated, the plot twists are wild, the themes are spelled out, nothing about it is subtle or refined... and that's okay!! It's fun! I love just sitting down and watching something that's manufactured to be purely entertaining. You is a show that pretends to be deep but in reality it's just fast food television, and I don't get why people are taking it so seriously and getting so upset about it, let alone expecting an amazing finale when the show has been kind of bad for the longest time. This ain't Game of Thrones guys. The finale was fitting for what the rest of the show was like, it was over the top and silly and I enjoyed it very much! :D",
