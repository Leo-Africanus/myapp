It is then made clear that they are both partnered up already. The next day, he goes to her shop where she works and they strike a convo. It feels like there will be cheating already, and i\u2019m just fed up with that storyline. I won\u2019t continue watching this show if the characters are just typical netflix tropes; unrelatable yet oh-so cheesy. Also, it just feels unnecessary to start this cheater narrative when the guy could\u2019ve just been single. So clich\u00e9. \n\nReally wondering why this show is at the top searches. \n\nAnyone can let me know if there will be actual cheating or will they be normal people for once? ",

The casting team gets actors that look, sound, and act like the time period. The art, set, costume all bust their butts to be perfect with the time period. Then the idiots in the score/music department think they need to put in modern music. This practice needs to end. Nothing kicks me out of a film harder. You are ruining so many shows. You could make great shows, but instead you make \"just okay\" shows. House of Guinness is one of these shows. Who ever the heck is in charge at Netflix fix this stupidity. If you want to add a modern flair why spend millions making anything period perfect? Why? You may as well casted all Indians instead of Irish looking people. You may as well put the cast in American eagle shirts with cargo shorts. At that point it does not matter. \n\nSincerely,\nA cinema lover",

        "content": "After I finished Squid Game season 3 in June, I was... pretty disappointed tbh. I frequently saw Squid Game being compared to another show, Alice In Borderland. So I decided \"let me check this out\" and I really liked it, in fact I even preferred it to Squid Game. The only thing is, season 2 was genuinely such a perfect conclusion that I myself wondered how they'd do season 3, especially as the manga ends at season 2 except for a short one-shot manga.\n\nI decided to give season 3 a try when it released today. Overall? I'd say its a 7.5/10. It was better than Squid Game season 3 and I didn't regret watching it but it wasn't exactly necessary either.\n\nThe games were fine. I especially liked the Zombies ones. \n\nFor the new character's, although they didn't hit the same as the original's did, I DID like quite a few. Rei especially was a stand-out for me. I remember everyone saw the trailer and thought she'd be annoying/hateable but no, she's probably going to be the fan favorite when this is all over. As a former bully victim, I was rooting for Nobu and am so glad he pulled through. Sachiko reminded me so much of Geum-ja from Squid Game and her surviving was a nice surprise.\n\nOn the other hand... Banda and ESPECIALLY Yaba were so wasted as villains. Yaba could be removed from the season and NOTHING would change whatsoever. He had 2 scenes. Banda was the main villain but he did nothing except hands out the cards to people manipualte Ryuji and try to recruit Arisu. At least Niragi was given a tragic backstory that humanized, this dude was just evil for fun.\n\nThere were a few questions left unasnwered, like where was Yaba in the final few episodes and why was the Borderland's collapsing at the end. It was nice for Ann to play a role due to her remembering everything but I wish she had a bigger role. It was nice to see all the previous cast return in the final episode for sure.\n\nBut PLEASE do NOT do an American spin-off.",
