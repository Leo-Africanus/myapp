        "content": "When the father is discussing with his wife how he saw some awful manosphere videos online because he was just trying to look up a workout video. \n\nThis was such a hard hitting line for me that could go by unnoticed. It is so easy to fall into that pipeline without any intentions of actually looking up people like Andrew Tate. As someone is constantly in the gym and looking up workout and diet recommendations on YouTube, I will almost always run into those kinds of videos and I just ignore them. \n\nSo many friends or fellow gym bros have shifted their attitude into this alpha male, high quality man, Andrew Tate style aggressiveness from YouTube and social media feeding them these influencers when originally all they were doing was looking up workout videos. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly concerning how easy it is and I feel for anyone trying to get into fitness and having to deal with this. Just understand there are normal fitness influencers out there that are not this way. ",

        "content": "I've seen a lot of men on different subs arguing about how the new show Adolescence with Owen Cooper is anti-male. However, I think this is very false. \n\nJamie (played by Owen Cooper) does not become evil overnight; he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online communities. There are many times in the show where I sympathized with Jamie, given that he is just a 13-year-old boy. I think that societal expectations regarding men showing their emotions led Jamie to struggle with emotional repression, which caused him to lash out when he was rejected. And before you say \"he was bullied\", I don't think he was. Jamie asked Katie out when he knew she would be vulnerable, and then she just called him out on it. As someone who was bullied as a kid, bullying is more repetitive. from the show, It just seemed like she had \"bullied\" him this one time. The show more urges people to create better support systems for young men so they learn how to manage their emotions rather than just saying men are bad. \n\nBasically, the moral of the story is to make sure that you are teaching your boys how to show their emotions in a healthy way, ask for help, and learn how to handle rejection. I think this show did an excellent job examining how online spaces can radicalize young boys and how its important to understand the challenges they face like internalizing emotions.",

You know why? Because everybody is entitled to an opinion!\n\nTikTok, X, Facebook, Reddit, everywhere I leave my opinion saying \"I thought it was alright, pretty good, I probably wouldn't watch again though\" I get people saying...\n\n\"You obviously didn't get it \ud83d\ude44 \"\n\"You must have a low IQ, this is only for deep thinkers to watch\"\n\"Sorry that TikTok has rotted you're brain and you can't go more than 5 mins without getting bored\"\n\"You're part of the problem with society\"\n\"We found the Andrew Tate supporter who hates women!!!\" (I'm gay lol)\n\nMy point is that it's OK to not be a big fan of a fictional TV show lol Everybody has an opinion. But it just seems like fans of this show are actively going out of their way to be rude and aggressive towards those who weren't big fans of the show.\n\nI can understand the obvious hate towards those who are wearing tin foil hats or who are actual Andrew Tate supporters, but what is the deal with getting angry with a random person who just didn't like it? Lol\n\nI know it explores sensitive topics but people really need to chill out over this show. One of the key messages was how we behave online and some of the fans are completely contradicting that message imho. They're being SO hateful towards people who have a different opinion. \n\nRant over, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. ",

The conditions of my life led me to believe I had to prove myself and be liked by others.\n\nI definitely cried on episode 4 because this finale really put everything in a neat bow tie.

If anything I tried to find signs that contradicted my original analysis and I really couldn\u2019t find many.\n\nThe entire third episode characterised it so well, down to the body language of the psychologist as she was trying to make her assessment of him. Then the fourth episode gave a lot of context as to how he was raised \u2013 negligent parents, *possibly* a narcissistic father \u2013 on top of the bullying and rampant insecurities, I could go on\u2026\n\nFor those who work in mental health and related fields, themselves have ASPD or have experiences with people who do\u2026 Like am I off base here?",

Is it bad? Is it good?",
