Pretty huge vote of confidence in their specific brand of chaotic, blue-collar comedy after the show's success.\n\nThe quote from their statement is classic: \"thankfully, it's too late for them to back out.\"",

I mean no one be it male or female could have done job so amazingly well. I am surprised how i didn\u2019t see her in anything else, is she underrated? How she has done in other shows or movie?",

        "content": "No spoilers I\u2019m not even on episode 2, barely halfway through episode 1.\n\nBut man, this is by far the best-looking samurai film I\u2019ve seen. The gritty realism and messy, grounded feeling really remind me of \"Blue Eye Samurai\".\n\nI was switching between sub and dub to see which sounded better, and honestly, they\u2019re both really good. With the dub, it\u2019s easier to focus and understand what\u2019s going on, especially how certain characters talk. For example, early on there\u2019s this guy who was also participating and explains to the MC that the samurai there come from different regions. From the dub alone, I immediately got his personality he doesn\u2019t seem as strong-willed as the MC, feels more laid-back and a bit naive compared to the MC and the other samurai, who are very intimidating. That came across clearly in the dub.\n\nIn the sub, though, I read him differently. He seemed tougher, and it was harder to pin down exactly what kind of character he was. That said, I have to give the sub credit: the emotional scenes hit harder. In the first half, when the MC screams \u201cSTAND DOWN\u201d and his voice cracks in defeat, it sounded really powerful in the sub. In the dub, it didn\u2019t feel quite as genuine.\n\nAnother scene set ten years later where the MC is afraid to unsheathe his sword, his hands shaking as his mind relives the trauma, with the screams of his fallen friends drowning out everything else\u2026 that was hardcore in the sub. The dub version felt more toned down compared to it.\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can say for now. Maybe I should just stick to one instead of switching every second, but I really want the best possible experience, which is why I\u2019m here.\n",

Basically, living a life full of lies to get what she wants.\n\nThen she gets involved with a guy (**Lee Jun-hyuk**) who is a legit chaebol but has a deep hatred for dishonest people.\n\n* **Vibe:** It sounds like it could be a mix of *Inventing Anna* but with a K-Drama romance twist?\n* **Cast:** Shin Hae-sun usually picks great scripts, and the chemistry with Lee Jun-hyuk could be interesting since their characters are polar opposites.\n\nI found some more detailed character breakdowns here: [Shin Hae Sun Lives A Life Full Of Lies In New Drama \u201cThe Art Of Sarah\u201d](https://kpop.andxo.com/article/shin-hae-sun-lives-a-life-full-of-lies-in-new-drama-the-art--349dd095aa26/)\n\nIs anyone else planning to watch this?

One episode, she's nobody. Then final episode, she's somebody relevant. \n\nFrom my point of view, the show did a terrible work at developing her character. ",

A terrible story/plot, with horrible dialogue all around and some pretty awful acting. \n\nThe plot.. some high school girls coerce others into the woods in which they get paid to watch girls get abused? One of the girls changes her name and looks and also becomes an anchorwoman at the same place as the main character? She kills her own sister and turns into some sinister person.. Yawn. Lazy, horrible writing. I can go into much more but it\u2019s truly not worth it. \n\nJon Bernthal is great and gives it his best but even he can\u2019t really escape the again, horrible dialogue and plot. \n\nTessa Thompson is objectively horrible. Prior to this she was fine in other things. Not spectacular, not bad. She also is not given help with an awful plot and dialogue but god she was incredibly bad. So many scenes that were laughable and clearly a set of a show with soap opera type acting. \n\nTessa was not the actress to use in this show and well it shows. Nobody could\u2019ve done the story justice sure but she made it a lot worse. \n\nThe climax.. her mom with \u201cdementia\u201d ends up being the killer.. yawn yawn yawn. That whole final act was such a drag and so lame. So many obvious and dumb red herrings all the way across the series. \n\nI typically won\u2019t comment on something that I think is this bad but I\u2019m seeing so much love that I can\u2019t even wrap my head around. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you enjoyed this series, you are easy to please. ",

I love how we saw into Alex and Poppy's friendship so clearly with the how many summers ago flashbacks. At first I genuinely thought Poppy and Alex would never date and due to the title, I thought they would go on vacation and then find their significant others, but I was thankfully wrong. In some of the flashbacks we saw **that** look. You know, the \"I love you\" but can never say look. The film was diverse, sexuality wise, we had Alex's brothers gay wedding, which is expected for a film of this year. I mean quite literally every film I've seen released this year has had that diversity. We had a look into both characters different love preferences. That guy with the boat, I think his name was Buck? Don't quote me on it, and his awful \"momento mori\" tattoo. And Poppy's ex, Trey. Very handsy. Alex had Sarah, highschool sweethearts as Poppy says. I don't know what else to say but, Netflix has had some good originals yet this year and you should definitely watch this one. 10/10.",

Literal shows and movies I've never seen or heard of on the Netflix home page. Has anyone else noticed this or am I just picky? ",
