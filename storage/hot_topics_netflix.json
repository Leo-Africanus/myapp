        "content": "To everyone saying it\u2019s pretty clear in the first episode and all the evidence points to it. \n\nI, like many, was waiting for the plot twist where *anyone else* was the murderer. \n\nAnd I sat with why, one reason is - it\u2019s because we are constantly shown what it looks like from Jamie\u2019s view. Like the lady constable DS Frank said in the school, \u201cRight, the perpetrator always gets the front line. \u2018A man raped a woman\u2019. We\u2019ve followed Jamie\u2019s brain around this entire case\u2026Everyone will remember Jamie. No one will remember her\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also shot in such a way that you *feel* like you are a bystander - right next to Jamie, experiencing everything with him. \n\nFrom the moment they barge into his room, sitting in the van looking out the window, not eating his cornflakes, drawing blood, the strip search and to the room where he keeps denying it. You say yes he punched her but you don\u2019t SEE the knife or the stabbing clearly. \n\nAnd then as the episodes progress, you pick and choose the information that supports your hypothesis. He was bullied, he just retaliated. Someone else has the knife. \n\nThe only impact we visibly see of Katie\u2019s death was her friend - who was hurting but was also rude &amp; violent &amp; \u201ctroubled\u201d. \n\nThe scene with the psychologist also starts with Jamie being beaten - again more sympathy. He likes hot chocolate, he LOOKS so innocent. Boys will be boys, but Katie rejected him, while he was doing a nice thing by showing her support. The only time you feel some sense of horror is when he\u2019s yelling at the psychologist, but then he calms down and says sorry. \n\nUntil he actually says he wants to plead guilty, you don\u2019t *want* to believe it. \n\nThis whole show is a masterclass in **how we erase the victim every step of the way**. The narrative is always from the man\u2019s point of view and we forget the woman. \n\nAnd how to find excuses because we don\u2019t want to believe. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what Katie looked like. But I know Jamie likes hot chocolate and hates pickles. \n",

        "content": "I loved the show, I watched a few days ago, and since then I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of videos and post about the show. Something that\u2019s been bugging me is the hyper fixation of the bullying. I don\u2019t think it should be ignored, it was showed for a reason, however I hate seeing people use it as a justification or excuse for murdering Katie. \n \nJamie was a victim, but not of Katie\u2019s. Katie\u2019s comments were made after he participated in the passing around of her nudes and the negative commentary of her body and then tried to take advantage of Katie\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by asking her out. When she rejected him he felt so insulted and humiliated because \u201chow dare someone who is flat and who no one else wants rejects him\u201d. When she retaliates by calling him an incel he tries to intimidate and scare her and when that doesn\u2019t work he murders her. He then leaves her body on the ground, runs off and proceeds to deny murdering her even though there is OVERWHELMING evidence that he killed her. He feels absolutely no guilt and even tried to validate himself by calling her names later in the series. A lot of people act like Jamie is Katie\u2019s victim or that the names she called him is why he killed her when it\u2019s not. \n\nJamie is a victim of societies unrealistic standards for men, unbroken familial cycles, the school system and other men who prey on insecure, neglected and isolated boys. With that being said I don\u2019t feel bad for Jamie, I recognize what he represents however I feel no sympathy. Jamie still killed an innocent girl because he was insecure. Jamie did not kill Katie because she called him names, he killed her because he felt small and powerless and needed to make someone feel weaker. \n\n(This is just how I interpreted the show, I\u2019m interested to hear yalls opinions!! Just keep it kind please) ",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t seen much discussion about this. People are mainly putting the blame on incels and toxic masculinity. While I agree, I believe the main reason why he lost control is because of his childhood upbringing by his parents while well intentioned. \n\nHis dad experienced physical abuse from his dad. That shapes the way he treats his son. He tries his best but he has a terrible temper as we see the way he confronts the graffiti boys. That scene was chilling since it really reminded me of the way Jamie acted towards the therapist and the girl he murdered. If the dad was holding a knife I could see things turning out differently. He was out of control with his anger hence throwing paint all over his car and staining the carpark. I believe Jamie really didn\u2019t mean to go as far as murdering him. His rage (learnt from his dad) took over and he lost control.\n\nThe way his dad talks to his mum was terrible. Treating her without respect and that would shape Jamie\u2019s view on how men should treat women. This might\u2019ve led him to be drawn to the incel community. Also his lack of self worth could be from his dad as well, never being able to please his dad. As a child, pleasing our parents is our #1 goal and this helps build our self esteem, see us worthy of dating. \n\nIf his dad went to therapy before he had a child and sorted out his rage and his attitude towards his wife, things could\u2019ve turned out a lot better. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I wanted people to pick up this idea more. I hoped this would make parents wary about how they treat their children, how it effects children when they see their parents argue (peacefully talking vs yelling until the other subsides). ",

The obsession with sex for both the boys and girls in the school, the \"sexual marketplace\" competition accelerating bullying between boys, from boys to girls and from girls to boys. \n\nJamie is eerily mature for his age, we see this in how cognisant he is of the situation that he and the people his age are in; but that maturity isn't a true maturity and acts as an illusion which I can understand make people think he is responsible for his actions. \n\nThat maturity is a very fragile one. It's superficial, only existing as an expression on the surface - a performance that others his age copy from social media and force each other to fit into. \n\nI think that's the main point to take from this show.

        "title": "My thoughts on adolescence",
        "content": "Adolescence is a gripping, unflinching look at youth, crime, and the fraying edges of modern Britain. Across its episodes, the series\u2014helmed by writer Jack Thorne and a talented cast\u2014excels at plunging viewers into raw, real-time tension. Episode 1\u2019s chaotic school shooting aftermath and Episode 2\u2019s haunting family fallout showcase its strengths: taut pacing, stellar performances (Stephen Graham\u2019s anguished dad, Erin Doherty\u2019s layered psychologist Briony), and a knack for capturing the messy humanity of crisis. The single-shot style amplifies the claustrophobia, making every moment visceral. It\u2019s a series that doesn\u2019t flinch from tough questions about kids, violence, and responsibility.\n\nBut Episode 3, centered on Briony\u2019s evaluation of 13-year-old Jamie\u2014a boy who\u2019s murdered a classmate\u2014lays bare the show\u2019s limits and a deeper truth: the system is broken. Here, Adolescence shifts from reflection to indictment, exposing a society that breeds tragedy then shrugs. Briony\u2019s session with Jamie, meant to assess his mental state for court, is a microcosm of failure. She corners him with questions about his dad, masculinity, and victim Katie, triggering predictable outbursts\u2014chair-throwing, shouting\u2014that she logs as \u201cvolatility.\u201d It\u2019s obvious stuff; push a kid hard enough, and he\u2019ll snap. As a forensic psychologist, she\u2019s bound by protocol, but that\u2019s the problem: her role confirms the obvious without digging into why Jamie exploded.\n\nThink of HBO\u2019s Chernobyl. There, the RBMK reactor\u2019s meltdown traced back to a toxic mix\u2014Dyatlov\u2019s recklessness, a lying Soviet system. Jamie\u2019s crime has its own synergies: bullying from Katie and peers, manosphere radicalization online, overworked teachers, absent parents, rigid police \u201cprocedure.\u201d He might\u2019ve had a colder streak\u2014less empathy, a shorter fuse\u2014but these forces pushed him over the edge. Briony\u2019s report misses this, stuck on \u201che\u2019s violent when provoked.\u201d It\u2019s like noting the reactor blew up without asking why it was primed to. The episode flashes these culprits\u2014mean kids, social media sludge, adult neglect\u2014but doesn\u2019t indict them. It\u2019s a lost chance to dissect the guilty instances, leaving viewers with a shrug where Chernobyl gave answers.\n\nThe good shines through: Doherty\u2019s Briony is compellingly human, fraying under pressure, and the one-shot format traps you in Jamie\u2019s rage. The series mirrors reality\u2014overstretched schools, toxic online spaces, procedural inertia\u2014with unsettling accuracy. But Episode 3 stumbles by not pushing further. Briony\u2019s protocol sucks by today\u2019s standards; it\u2019s a relic, blind to prevention. She could\u2019ve probed the bullying\u2019s depth, the radical voices Jamie absorbed, the system\u2019s failures\u2014data to stop the next tragedy. Instead, she\u2019s a cog in a machine that files reports while the reactor hums, ready for another blowout.\n\nHow to fix it? The system needs a rethink\u2014protocols that demand context, not just symptoms. Forensic assessments should trace social threads\u2014peer cruelty, online poison, institutional gaps\u2014giving courts tools to address root causes, not just punish outcomes. Schools need resources to spot and stop bullying; parents and platforms must face accountability. Adolescence shows what\u2019s broken but stops short of solutions. It\u2019s a stark portrait of a failing Britain\u2014one that can\u2019t even name its demons, let alone slay them. Episode 3 proves it: we\u2019re still confirming explosions, not preventing them.\n\nEdit: Fixed mistake pointed out by comment. \n\n",

        "content": "This is a fight between Miguel Diaz from Season 6 part 3 of the Cobra Kai series and Colonel Dugan from The Next Karate Kid movie.\n\nWhile Dugan is an adult and Miguel is a teenager, it is important to note that Dugan is clearly the weakest among the evil \"senseis\" (if you can even call him that lol) we've seen in the Karate Kid franchise, whereas Miguel is a world Karate champion among teenagers.\n\nWho wins in a fight?",

It was really eye opening to what goes on online and how it can affect people, especially young people. I\u2019m 18 and had no idea about \u2018incel\u2019 or \u2018exploding pill\u2019, it was terrifying seeing what content anyone can access. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take my eyes of the screen, 4 hours straight I was on the edge of my seat. \n\nI honestly think this is a good programme for anyone raising kids to watch. It was very eye opening.\n\nAnd the acting. Holy shit, I had to remind myself often that it was a to show and not a documentary. Hats off to everyone who worked on the programme.",

Epsiode 1 and 2 were interesting with them finding out details, getting to the bottom of it. episode 3 is just shrink bull shit and episode 4 seems like they were just bored and had to pay their actors, so they ran around filming extra random shit. Am I the only one who hated the show?",

You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

We don\u2019t get to find out why Jamie decided to plead guilty? That was extremely out of character for him, they could at least explain how he got there. And no trial to get more in-depth on Jamie\u2019s motives and extreme, violent beliefs? No sentencing? We don\u2019t get to meet Katie\u2019s family? \n\nIt just really fell short for me, for a piece that\u2019s finally tackling the red-pilled losers and what a threat they really are, it just left me feeling so unsatisfied. I need more. I need to see a fully fledged character arc. Leaving a limited series with hardly any gratification just really does any limited series a disservice, and leaving so much important information out really just takes away from such an important message. It didn\u2019t really have anything that\u2019d hold a mirror up to an incel and explain why it\u2019s so messed up. ",
