Some of my opinions may be slightly biased here BUT I don\u2019t think she did it\u2026 or at least for the most part. I do believe that nursing wards can be quite a cliquey area like mentioned earlier in the documentary. You\u2019d be surprised but I do feel clinical and laboratory environments can be more toxic than you\u2019d imagine. The stress, the grief and maybe the overall mental work these staff perform brings out the worst in them. I believe the ward may have been understaffed, there may have been mistakes made by other nurses in the unit and ultimately Lucy was the scapegoat for them.\n\nOn top of this, I think the documentary also had A LOT of loopholes. Where was CCTV evidence in all of this? Were there not other staff and nurses present during these cases? If so where are their interviews or testimonies? I don\u2019t know, I felt there was a lot missing to really analyse this properly as a viewer as well. I do think Lucy is a bit sketch, some of her comments and her behaviour is odd but I also believe nurse units can be extremely toxic and there is a very good chance they used her as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone\u2019s thoughts?",

It\u2019s about a single mom and her two girls struggling to start a new life in Taipei. It\u2019s told through the eyes of the youngest daughter, the titular left-handed girl. It was mostly shot on location in a night market and the movie captures the vibrant energy of the location with great immediacy. \n\nWould love to discuss the \\*twist\\* and the clues that were foreshadowed.
