America has a big racism problem and it\u2019s not just Susan Lorincz. \n\nIt\u2019s an indictment on the US justice system that I had predicted she\u2019d get away with it or given just a few years in prison. The absolute RELIEF when she got sent down. I hope she\u2019s miserable for the rest of her days. \n\nWhat a beautiful community. I hope the boys and all the neighbours affected are supported through their pain. ",

I think them bringing this up might\u2019ve strengthened their case about her obvious racism as well",

        "content": "...was that this could have been any neighbourhood and could happen anywhere. I remember playing out in the village I was raised in as a child, and there was always one weird house where a scary adult would live. You and your friends would all avoid them at all costs, but sometimes a ball would just go into their garden by accident or you'd just be existing and they'd make your life a misery when they came out, etc. I forgot how scary that used to be as a child and this documentary really reminded me of that fear and power imbalance of an adult making you feel that way when you are just playing and having fun outdoors which should be such a magical part of childhood. I knew something horrible was going to happen in this situation of course, but for some reason I didn't think it would be such a cruel and barbaric murder like that for some reason. Yes, the lady is definitely mean, racist, angry and a nasty bully, but for her to take the life of that wonderful lady and mother, and leave those babies motherless just absolutely broke my heart, I just didn't see it coming. All of that loss and hurt over something minor. One minute they had their lovely mother just advocating for her children and defending them like she had every right to do so, and then next minute she was gone. Her life was lost, and those poor children of hers will never feel the same again. All over that evil lady, who had years to just go live somewhere else if she wasn't happy in a family neighbourhood.\n\nI don't know. It's just really broken my heart. It's just so senseless. ",

Some mention that one person may have agreed, and possibly received money for everyone(maybe just a rumors), but even if that\u2019s true, does it justify broadcasting such personal pain?\n \n- What do we know about the consent process for this kind of media?  \n- Do you think it\u2019s ethical to share such footage if only one person agreed?  \n- Where do we draw the line between public interest and exploitation?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n",

There was a scene with her mother bringing food to her bedroom door in the evening, after work, at the time when the girl would wake up.\n\nMid-film or towards the end, the girl ventured out at night (I remember beautifully dark outdoor scenes in an empty urban space, under heavy rain, with the girl barefoot and in her white nightgown), maybe to bring something / to exchange messages through pieces of paper to a man (who was himself in a difficult life situation?) with whom she has somehow connected (maybe after watching him through binoculars, from her window?) and with whom she would 'talk' by using something (beans, maybe?) as 'code'.\n\nThe male character might have narrated the story, either from the beginning or at some point.\n\n[But I couldn't say exactly how much of the above is actually correct, and how much I'm 'filling up' myself!]\n\nThe film was beautifully written and shot, it was nocturnal, dreamy, haunting, it perfectly captured both the magic and the desperation and hollowness of (the girl's version at least of) hikikomori life.\n\nI remember a lush blue palette: the girl had decorated with blue items and fairy lights (I think) her closet (where she slept, on the floor, as in a tiny bedroom inside her room in her parents' house, that she treated as 'the rest of the apartment').\n\nI remember the look of the film vividly, but I can't remember or retrieve the title!   :(\n\nCan anyone help?",
