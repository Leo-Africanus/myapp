Basically, when I watched these shows the last season hadn't come out yet, so I had to wait for it to come out after I had watched all the other season. That means I watched it with a considerable distance from the rest of the episodes. I also didn't have time to do a rewatch.\n\nIt just sucks. You aren't as attached to the characters anymore, and you struggle to remember events that are important to the plot.",

I think the writers need to kill Rose off, give Peter a new character arc, and explore different storylines for Peter. Also, I love the Noor storyline. She is a great actress and the storyline keeps me interested. \n\nIdk, excited to see where season 3 goes, if there is one. Really hope the writers read Reddit. ",
