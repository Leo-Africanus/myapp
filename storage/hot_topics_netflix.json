Literally everything they mentioned in all three episodes was a complete nothingburger, and it was honestly sad to see how deep the producers were trying to dig to find anything even remotely interesting to put in the doc.\n\nDanny gaining the weight back after the show? Wow yeah, turns out people who have a bad relationship with food before the show didn't magically rewire their entire brains after leaving TBL. Not sure how that's NBC's fault or even a controversial thing, but man did they soak up about 20 minutes just repeating the same thing over and over again.\n\nBob said a mean thing to Joelle one time (which did inevitably get her to finish the 30-second treadmill run)? DUN DUN DUNNNN. Dramatic music and another 15 minutes over the fact that yes, every trainer yells at you when you try to give up during a workout because that's literally the job you are paying them to do.\n\nJillian gave....you guys it's so bad, it's terrible, I'm trembling and shaking even as I type this....CAFFEINE to contestants??? Holy shit ya'll, NBC is basically the devil incarnate let's spend another 20 minutes talking about it.\n\nThe whole thing was mining for any controversy it could possibly find and there just wasn't a damn thing to say. I'm a millennial and as someone who struggled with my weight at the time the show first aired, it was actually really inspiring to see how much diet and exercise was paying off for people who were way bigger than I was. While I may not be able to draw a direct line between TBL and my eventual love of exercise, I know that watching these people get on the treadmill and work their asses off (literally) gave me a model that I continue to follow to this day when it comes to my diet and how I take care of my body.\n\nThis wasn't a documentary about scandal or NBC doing anything wrong, it was just a drag on the most inconsequential events that when you pull back and look at what they actually said, sure as shit wasn't worth 120 minutes of my time.",

YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+ all run in 4K HDR with no problem.\n\nI called Netflix support and they confirmed it\u2019s a **certification issue on their end** \u2014 not a geo restriction, not my internet, not DRM. But instead of fixing it, they literally asked me to **mail them(not even email)** for escalation. Seriously? This is one of the most popular Android TV devices, and Netflix just drops certification like this?\n\nSo:\n\n* Why is the Shield (2019) suddenly *not certified* anymore?\n* Why is Netflix pushing the burden to the customer to \u201cwrite a letter\u201d when it\u2019s clearly a backend whitelist/ESN problem?\n* Anyone else running into the same error?\n\nThis feels like something that should be viral.

He has this money encrypted in this vintage looking portable computer briefcase, but it gets stolen by his accountant to take him the mob boss down. An undercover agent or police officer agrees to meet with the accountant in a hotel. The husband decided to call his tech-nerdy girlfriend through a video call to have her look at it. She was fascinated with the outdated technology. Then a woman with a blonde wig and dressed like a prostitute, breaks into the room and kills both of them. The wife witnessed it, and starts freaking out. Anyways, the husband had met with gun for hire of the mob boss, which is how he got in contact with the accountant, and even took a picture of his face in case he tries to betray him. The wife goes to their apartment snooping around for answers as to why this happened to her husband, and that's when the mob boss' daughter and his bodyguard show up to the apartment to kill her, but the gun for hire ends up killing his boss' daughter. To get rid of the evidence, he makes it seem that the dead body was the wife, and faked her death by burning the daughter's body in the wife's car. The series was on Netflix, and I swear it wasn't in English. PLEASE help me.",

        "content": "Okay, so when Netflix starts playing an episode in a season (any show), it either gives the option to \u201cSkip Intro,\u201d or not. I\u2019m assuming this is based on the length of the intro, in seconds. I think it\u2019s safe to say that\u2019s a fair assumption! I just want to know what the time requirement/allotment is set to before Netflix gives the option to \u201cSkip Intro.\u201d I\u2019ve looked it up in every different way of phrasing this question I can possibly think of, *except here*! I can\u2019t find the answer or even anything that has made me feel like I\u2019m on the path to finding it (maybe a lot of people aren\u2019t asking? Lol)! And I\u2019m not satisfied with a stopwatch, or just counting the seconds (it always varies by a few, obviously, depending on the show). If I could read the fine print in Netflix\u2019s EULA, that\u2019d be fantastic! But I\u2019d really just settle on knowing the answer and *where it was found*! Does ANYONE know??!!",

A show that isn\u2019t slow to start but gets your interest within the first 2 to 3 episodes. Just need 1 recommendation of something that is currently on Netflix so I can download season 1. The shows I\u2019ve watched in the past and really enjoyed (no order): breaking bad, better call Saul, ozark, prison break, suits, money heist. Thank you in advance ",
