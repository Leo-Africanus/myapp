Truly. Did they even go to school? Or were they homeschooled by drug addled, morally bankrupt grifters spewing toxic masculinity? The mother seems to be from another country so maybe she\u2019s not the best teacher of English but yikes, you know they had enough money to maybe hire a tutor.\nAnd I found it interesting that his dad was depicted as a sweet, veterinarian (which takes an amount of studiousness) and instead of maybe trying to be like that he makes up this extreme version of what a man is that seems polar opposite of his dad. Odd choice. (Just as odd as smoking cigars which seems completely counter to his \u201cnatural\u201d lifestyle.)\nAnd the brother he says he looked up to is never mentioned as far as where he is now. Maybe they left that out bec he was involved in the criminal enterprises mentioned. I don\u2019t care enough about the guy to look it up, I just think it would have been interesting in the doc. It also would have been interesting if they addressed the children\u2019s allergies. Was that all made up too? If not, in what way were they resolved? As someone who has never heard of him but has a masters degree in food science and applied nutrition I was interested and it was so bad I had to increase the speed halfway through just to finish it quickly. It could have easily been nutshelled into a ten minute YouTube video.",

        "content": "I saw Thai subscriber saying she thinks about subscribing to HBO because K-dramas are flooding Netflix and I saw other subscribers saying they think about cancelling their Netflix subscription because of the South Korean government flooding netflix with Korean shows.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol visited the United States of America to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK Alliance, and after he  met the co-chief executive of Netflix, Ted Sarandos announced that Netflix would invest $2.5 billion in new South Korean films and TV series.\n\nMany of K-dramas in Netflix flopped in South Korea. yet they were added to Netflix despite their local failures\n\nFor many years, the South Korean government has invested billions into K-dramas and K-pop. the Ministry of Culture and its K-pop department were pivotal in making K-pop globally popular. They also launched TV channels worldwide to promote Korean TV shows, K-pop,. President Yoon also asked his ministers to watch Korean shows and also promoted K-pop and K-dramas in his political speeches. It felt strange to see a president discussing (K-pop) and Korean dramas \u2014 whose primary audience is young women \u2014 inside Congress, which is largely made up of men and women over 50.\n\nWhile many governments around the world support local film and music production to promote cultural development (like films about military or history) and, at times, to promote tourism (some films), South Korea\u2019s government does this to a much greater extent. It focuses on improving the nation\u2019s image, promoting tourism, marketing Korean products, and boosting the economy.\n\n",
