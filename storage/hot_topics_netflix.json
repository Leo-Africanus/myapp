I love a show that has me yelling at my TV. I would like to take this opportunity to list a few of the people in this show who pissed me off.\n\n1. Abbott - Why would you approach someone who you know is a pysopath and serial killer pretty much, all alone, with one weapon? I knew as soon as he followed him he was gonna die, smh. It was so upsetting.\n\n2. Marvin - I completely understand him wanting to help his son and being in denial about how sick he really was, but he was constantly having to clean up Nile's messes. His legacy was also constantly at risk because of Nile's recklessness, but he just kept helping him over and over again. I know that's his son, but I would have called the police on him asap.\n\n3. Shelley - Was anyone else annoyed by Shelley? Why would you be mad at your ex wife for not being able to forgive the man who was driving drunk and caused a crash that killed your child?? And then to blame Aggie for his suicide to her face when she came to you telling you that she thinks Teddy was murdered. Obviously Aggie wasn't 100% in the right for doing things like throwing the brick through his window, but I can understand her anger. Also, having to see him constantly, knowing that he was never punished must have been hell. It's like they all made her out to be the crazy one for being angry.\n\nNile - Obviously he pissed me off cuz his impulse control was dog shit, and he was a terrible person all around, but he made a really good villain. I think a good villain makes the best stories.\n\nHow did ya'll feel?",

        "content": "Almost a year ago now I noticed my \"recently watched\" froze halfway through an episode of a show. Nothing I've watched since has appeared in my watch history or continue watching tabs. \n\nRecently, I discovered that all my watch history is actually under a different profile within the account, being regularly updated from my profile. \n\nNothing I've tried (uninstalling and reinstalling, logging out of the account and logging back in, etc.) has worked to fix it. Any suggestions?",

        "content": "So like a couple of months ago every time we start netflix on our tv it has descriptive audio as default (as in reading everything that is on the tv out loud, profile names, series names, how much time is left in the episode, etc)\n\nI already tried to go in my tv accessibility settings and turn thay off but it shows that it is already off, this exclusively happens on netflix and i cant find any option to turn that off, the only way that seems to work for a couple days is pluging the tv off and on but as i said it just comes back after a while, how can i solve this problem permanently?\n\nSorry for my bad english",
