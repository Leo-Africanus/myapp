She was quite adamant that no account exists and that we must be reading number wrong as there is no way that they couldn\u2019t locate the account with her debit card account number. We\u2019ve been through this process multiple times and the lady ended up telling us that there\u2019s nothing she can do for us. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to go from here as the account definitely exists, I can still watch Netflix on my TV and a monthly payment is still being taken. Is there any way we can get money back, someone higher up than the call centre to email? Or do we just have to suck it up, close the account and create a new one? \n\nWe are in England for context and I\u2019m not angry at the customer service lady, I know they\u2019re trained to read off scripts and can only do what they can do.

        "content": "As streaming libraries merge and ad-tiers become the norm, data tracking is ramping up. One specific method often flies under the radar: Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking.\n\nThe Gist: Advertisers hide high-frequency sounds in TV content that human ears can't hear. But your phone's microphone can. If a random app on your phone (like a free game or utility) has background mic access, it hears that signal and instantly links your TV viewing habits to your mobile profile.\n\nWhy it matters now: With the WB/Netflix changes, linking your TV to your Personal Device is the holy grail for their ad inventory.\n\nThe Fix: Audit your phone's Microphone Permissions. If an app doesn't need to listen to function (like a flashlight or puzzle game), revoke access. That is usually how the bridge is built.\n\nFor those wondering no, a VPN will not stop this. Since the tracking happens physically (sound waves hitting your microphone), no amount of encryption can block it.",

        "content": "Is anyone else experiencing issues with Netflix when using the Safari browser on an iPad Pro 11\" M5 (current: iPadOS 26.2)?\n\nI prefer using Safari over the native Netflix app because the picture quality is noticeably better. For about a month now, if I start playing a video, pause it, leave the app, and then return a little while later, the video freezes, but the audio continues without any problems.",

        "content": "So I put on the Sabrina Carpenter Christmas special, and the audio was WAY off. It sounded like it went through a voice changer to make it super deep and echo-y. At first I thought it was part of a bit, then it continued after the first song so I paused it for a second to think about what was going on, resumed it, and the audio went back to normal\n\nThat was just\u2026weird. Has anybody else ever seen this?",
