        "title": "I liked Wayward and I don't understand the criticism",
        "content": "The series premiered exactly a week ago, I watched it, and I enjoyed it. I didn't once think the actors were bad, a criticism I've seen a couple of times in reddit discussions. I was also very surprised by how they managed to make the dialogue between Leila and Abbie sound realistic and natural compared to how they've made teenagers speak in other Netflix shows, and I appreciated that.\n\nI definitely have no experience in entertainment criticism or analysis; the only way I judge whether the acting was good or bad is how much I believe the actors, and therefore how much I can focus on the plot. This is, of course, very subjective, but the only time I felt a little disconnected from the plot was with Abbie's father. I didn't fully believe his character's outburst or his overall persona, but I don't think he had more than 15 minutes of screen time, and I don't consider it \"bad\" acting\u2014just less compelling. I truly don\u2019t think this show had \"bad actors\".\u00a0\n\nI think most of the criticism I\u2019ve read comes from people that aren\u2019t the show's target audience, which, from my perspective, seems to stem from their personal biases against queer people or from not connecting with or relating to the show's theme, which is intergenerational trauma and how it can cause children, teens, and eventually adults to feel the weight of their parents' unresolved grief or trauma, resulting in deep guilt and a sense of being \"bad kids\", even before they\u2019ve developed a moral compass or an integral sense of self.\u00a0\n\nAs for the protagonist, I can\u2019t thank Mae Martin enough for the representation they gave the trans community in this series. I\u2019ll save that aspect of this review for another subreddit though, as I have read very ignorant and rude comments regarding Mae Martin\u2019s character, Alex, and I hope to minimize that aspect of the discussion in this post.\u00a0\n\nI think the show does an incredible job of showing that there are no \"bad kids,\" but rather they are a direct result of their environment and the extremes parents or families go to in order to \"cope\" with their children, rather than working on themselves or simply trying to connect with them from a place of love, understanding, and empathy. I think all parents should go to therapy at least a few times, which I recognize is a statement that stems from and leads to something much deeper from a historical, sociopolitical, and evolutionary perspective. But, I think many parents should have gone to therapy before having children, and the series does a great job of taking that feeling and amplifying it to a psychological thriller level, while also depicting the dangers of retreats, programs, and poorly researched and unethical therapeutic methods for minors.\n\nOne of Sydney Topliffe's (Abbie) lines from Episode 1, \"When you had kids, what the f\\*\\*\\* did you imagine it would be like?\" that she says to her dad in an outburst, really struck me. I think it captures the incomprehension and frustration that so many children and teenagers feel: \"Why did my parents even have kids?\" Meaning, \"Why did this person or these people bring me into the world only to make me feel every day that they wish they hadn't?\" or \u201cDid they create an idea or expectation of children and family, if any, in their heads that I'm not living up to, or do they simply not like me as a person?\u201d Even though it could never be the kid\u2019s fault truly, they are made to feel as though it is. Another line that captures this sentiment is Toni Collete's (Evelyn) line in Episode 7: \"Birth is... nonconsensual.\"\u00a0\n\nI've also seen criticism that there are plot holes. I finished the series today, and I can't say with complete certainty that I found any plot holes per se, but I did feel that some things were left \u201cup in the air\u201d. For example, I think some character's subplots felt a bit rushed; it would have been interesting to know more about many of them (e.g., Riley and Maurice), but I also understand that it's a miniseries and covers topics that could give much more screen time in order for them to thrive.\n\nAs for the toads (I think cane toads), I do think they're simply symbolic. They're an invasive species that has taken over the town, and in one way or another, they're everywhere, just like Evelyn. Depending on the culture, they also represent different things, such as fertility and abundance, transformation and rebirth, healing and purification, among others (Logan, 2024). All of the articles I found about toad and frog symbolism can be closely associated with the series, including those that presented a negative and evil interpretation of frogs and toads, as most of the characters have different or opposite perspectives of Evelyn, many having both throughout the series and their character's development. Also, I'm sure the show implies that the toads have a role in the making of the drug used on the graduates, which isn't so far fetched in a science-y fiction way as there are psychedelic amphybians. The fact that the phase is called \"The Leap\", is probably also a play on the fact that frogs jump or \"leap\" from one place to another. I also think it could symbolize the term \"leapfrog\", which according to Cambridge Dictionary, can also be used as a verb to describe: \"to improve your position by going past other people quickly or by missing out some stages\". Maybe this could be interpreted as wanting to heal and become your new self with Evelyn's drug quickly, without going through a much longer process of healing and learning to live with your trauma, by facing your past, yourself and others, but that could just be a personal interpretation.\n\nI also read some reviews that said the series dragged on too long, something I personally disagree with. I think almost every aspect of the series contributed to the plot and deserves analysis from an entertainment perspective, but also from a psychological one. If anything, I sometimes felt it was fast paced and I hope they decide to renew for a second season.\n\nIn the future, I would love to rewatch this series with even more attention to detail, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it has incredible potential, I hope Mae Martin takes up more production and acting roles as well.",

I sat through the whole thing and binged without any skips, but I wished I did, or at least watched it in a faster speed. I saw a lot of people having so many questions after watching, and I get it. I feel the same way too, and how I truly wish it could've been a movie instead. not the best series, but it's dragging me to watch it enough even though with a very loose thread. interesting concept though!",

        "content": "Hi,\nNetflix streaming quality sucks. Yes, they have lower bitrate on their streams than competitiors, but i am talking about resolution. It's just inconsistent, what shows or episodes in a series are 1080p, and which are not.\n\nI have the standard plan and watching on the built-in Netflix App on LG TV (WebOS) and can also watch over the Fire TV Stick 4K 2nd Gen. Both can stream up to 4K, and are not limited like streaming on PC (except Edge?). On both devices i have the same result. For example, some episodes of \"Outlander\" are just streamed in 720p, others in 1080p. And on the movie side, \"Ready Player One\" would just play in 720p, no matter what i do. You can't tell me, that Netflix just got a low quality copy of that movie?! And yes, my network speed is more than capable.\n\nI understand, that some shows are not streamed in 1080p, if the movie/series itself is old and of bad quality. For example, Deep Space Nine wouldn't look much better in Full HD, because of the quality of the orginal scan.\n\nBut it seems, that Netflix just favor their own \"Original\" content, that is shown pretty much all the time in good quality. They just don't care, and obviously a lot of people don't care either (Well, if you just watch on your Smartphone or Tablet, you wouldn't mind it so much).\n\nIf you want streaming quality, Netflix is just cheap, because even Big Bang Theory has bad quality (720p and no high bitrate), it's only getting better in the later seasons. Disney Plus on the other hand has on the same series a whole other watching experience (there is much difference in the first seasons, it looks pretty much if it is a different scan).\n\nDo you know other examples like that?\n\nSo i think the problem is on the Netflix side, can't think of anything than writing to their support, live with it or just cancel.\n\nPS: Feel free to discuss. If there is some technical explanation for this, i'm glad to hear about it.\n\nIf the topic doesn't fit here, just remove it another community.\n\nPSS: Typo in the topic, i'm a non-native speaker, but don't know how to edit it.",

For example, I was halfway through the vampire diaries and was watching it last night, today it\u2019s gone. I wanted to watch a studio ghibli film, they\u2019re all gone. What is going on and why is everything good being taken off? ",

        "content": "I STRONGLY believe that she was trafficked and that the guy everyone called \"Yellow\" was in on it. I mean his own daughter even said that she thought he was in on it?? The kicker or why I think she was trafficked is because multiple years after her disappearence the family was sent INNAPROPRIATE PICS OF HER. There is no doubt in my mind that it was Amy in those innaporpirate pics. But let me know what all of you think?",

        "title": "If Netflix *ISNT* Releasing Seasons All-At-Once, Why Not Do Weekly Episodes Instead??",
        "content": "EDIT : I think posters are vastly missing the point that weekly episodic lasts JUST AS LONG as bi-monthly \"chunking\". The argument that \"chunking\" keeps more viewers couldn't be farther from the truth because 8 weeks is 8 weeks no matter what way you slice it up. Also, I do not advocate for weekly episodic. I am, however, stating the lesser of 2 evils. As you were ...\n\n\n\nJust found out that Stranger Things 5 will be airing 4 episodes in November, 3 in December, and 1 in January for \"viewer retention.\"\n\nWhy don't they just start on Thanksgiving with weekly episodes that go throw 3 core holidays? Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years?\n\nPeople talk about it on social media, share their opinions, sometimes it's on talk shows, Game Of Thrones did this best, I don't know why Netflix doesn't do this. WEDNESDAY was the same.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nObviously, just give me the entire season all at once. The premise is that they \\*DONT\\* do that anymore. And honestly, splitting up the seasons of these shows a few episodes MONTHS apart is so much worse than week-by-week episodes for a few months sraight.\n\nAlso, people tend not to give a @#$% anymore after binge watching half the season and then having to wait another month for the rest. Am I only in this way of thinking?",

But now with so called AI the search is slow, and when you search for something out of catalogue thats when you feel it the most. \n\nHas anyone else felt the same. I really need old Netflix search back. Btw this is in netflix app.",
