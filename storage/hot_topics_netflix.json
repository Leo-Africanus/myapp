        "content": "I just recently watched Forrest Gump, Angel &amp; Demons, A Man Called Otto. I didn't know that Tom Hanks is such a great actor. When I was a kid I always saw Forrest Gump on tv every Holy Week. But I don't really pay attention because I'm young and I don't understand. It's 1990's film and I was born on 2000's. When I've watch the movie earlier, I understand why it always shows up on television every Good Friday. It's like a roller coaster of emotions, but I don't really like the ending tho. I think he deserve better through all his hardships. \n\nThe next one is Angel &amp; Demons, I've been to a catholic school and my religion teacher presented this movie. But we only have 1 hour long so it cut off. I'm very interested on that movie, so I finished it also earlier. (7 years in between) I literally forgot who is the protagonist there. At first it's confusing but in the mid I predicted it. But still a great movie tho! I've search every movie I've watch if they won an award and they do.\n\nThe last one is A Man Called Otto. I'm crying all the time thinking that why people have to die? Honestly, I just felt like. I could be like him when I'm old. So I can feel the loneliness too. From start to finish, a very good movie! That's why it's popular here. I'm just mad at myself because in my 22 years old life why did I just discover him now? I love him already!\n\nI'm looking forward to Da Vinci Code next, how 'bout you? Who's your greatest movie actor?",

        "content": "So I watched Thirteen on Netflix recently and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. It might be the darkest movie I\u2019ve ever watched and it\u2019s not even classified as horror. That\u2019s how heavy it is. It\u2019s disturbing because it\u2019s real. There\u2019s no supernatural force, no jump scares or anything like that. Just raw, spiraling human behavior, especially from young girls trying to find their place.\n\nWatching Tracy\u2019s downfall was infuriating. The way she gets pulled into Evie\u2019s world. It\u2019s such a gut-punch because deep down, you can see how much of it is her trying to find validation. It\u2019s not just rebellion for rebellion\u2019s sake. These are kids. They don\u2019t know right from wrong, they don\u2019t understand long-term consequences. They only know what\u2019s cool, what gets them attention, and what numbs the pain they\u2019re carrying.\n\nWhat made me the angriest was the parenting, or the lack of it. Tracy\u2019s mom just stood there so often. Blank-faced. Passive. She\u2019d watch her daughter scream at her, curse at her, break down in front of her and she\u2019d just exist there, like she didn\u2019t know how to act. She said at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s not how I raised you,\u201d which shows she had tried before, but once Tracy spiraled, it was like the mother was too scared or emotionally paralyzed to intervene. And the father? Barely even there. Useless.\n\nThere\u2019s also this eerie transformation that happens with Tracy. At the beginning, she\u2019s just this sweet, insecure girl. But by the end? Her face, her body language \u2026. it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a completely different person. There\u2019s a moment where she doesn\u2019t even look human anymore. Her pain and trauma show up physically on her face. She looked evil. Terrifying, even.\n\nAnd Evie,  I have a lot of thoughts. She\u2019s manipulative, yes, but also clearly broken herself. And somehow, she hides it behind that innocent, \u201ccute\u201d look. But she absolutely destroyed Tracy's life and enabled everything terrible that happened.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an easy watch. In fact, it was painful to sit through. But it\u2019s one of those movies that sticks with you. It\u2019s a reminder that adolescence is fragile, and if adults around don\u2019t step in, don\u2019t really parent, then kids are going to fall into dangerous hands.",

        "content": "I honestly blame TikTok's hype culture for how movies are turning out these days. One of my favorite genres has always been romcoms, but over the years, the quality has noticeably dropped. If you look back, there are so many classic romcoms that still hold up BECAUSE that was the standard for the genre back in the day. Nowadays, it feels like movies are being made with specific actors or tropes just so they can get the TikTok treatment. People know some influencer is going to make a reaction video with exaggerated expressions and fake gasps to hype it up. So they continue spitting out shitty films because this group is so easy to satiate. I see the same exact thing happening with books. Anyone can become a writer these days. All it takes is a few edits and slideshows. \n\nA perfect example of this is My Oxford Year that came out recently. Honestly, that movie was a mess. Sofia Carson's acting was so cringey that I had to pause the film. Yet, all over TikTok, I keep seeing posts about how \u201camazing\u201d it was and how people \u201ccried so much.\u201d I couldn't even muster up any emotional response because the film felt rushed, and the acting was just... not it. I just miss the days when movies were good BECAUSE they were good, not because they were trending on a platform. Thankfully, I was never really one to watch movies or shows when I was younger so there\u2019s tons of classics I haven\u2019t watched. It\u2019s just bothersome that I never see criticism for these terrible movies. ",
