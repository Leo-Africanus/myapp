I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s normal for siblings or parents to live in different cities. We still stay connected, so why can\u2019t we share a Netflix account \u2014 especially when we\u2019re already paying for one with multiple profiles?\n\nNetflix used to be okay with sharing. They even encouraged it back in the day. And now they\u2019re changing the rules just to make more money. It doesn\u2019t feel fair.\n\nWhat\u2019s more annoying is that even though this policy started a while ago, I was still able to use Netflix on my laptop \u2014 just not on the mobile app. But today I got a notification on my laptop saying I can\u2019t use it anymore either. So that\u2019s it, I guess. One more reason to unsubscribe.",

The issue is with my ipad and I assume the issue is because it spends a significant amount of time connected to my mum's ipad when I'm at her place. The issue is even when I'm at home at MY place, connected to MY wifi, that my TV is also connected to, it still tells me that the device isn't part of my household?! And there don't seem to be any options to fix it. I sign out, reconnect wifi, sign back in, refresh app, etc. but nothing makes a difference. What gives? How the eff do I get it connected?\n\nAlso, as an aside, what the hell happens now if I want to watch Netflix outside my own home not connected to my wifi? I travel, spend a lot of time at other people's houses, etc. I get that Netflix doesn't want one person sharing their account with their 10 buddies, but it's genuinely outrageous that I can pay for a service and then not actually use it outside my own house. How does the 14 day temporary access thing work? What if I'm travelling overseas for a month?! At this rate I'm tempted to just unsubscribe because this is outrageous. I feel sorry for kids moving between divorced parents' houses. What a nightmare that must be. \n\nThanks for your help.  ",

Who knows how long those animals were there. \n\nThe contestants are then asked to transport these animals to \"terrariums\" that are basically glass boxes with a thin screen for ventilation on top. It's visible that these boxes are receiving direct sunlight and temperatures must be very high inside.\n\nYou can tell the floor of the boxes are not grass but also glass or transparent plastic. Regardless, that means that if those boxes have been in the sun it's likely that the floors were extremely hot. Once again, who knows how long they remained in those hot boxes. \n\nIt could have been cut, but it doesn't appear that any of the contestants have recieved orientation on how to handle these animals. The show is relying on the contestants fear of the animals for dramatic effect and these aren't domesticated animals, at any time they could jump out from their hands and drop to the floor. \n\nI was actually enjoying this dumb show but I just find extremely distasteful to use non-domesticated animals as \"props\" in conditions that are clearly unhealthy.

        "content": "I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m emotionally prepared for season 7 of BlackMirror, but I\u2019ve been invested since the beginning!! This show in general is a comfort even though it\u2019s so creepy at the same time lol. My rating for each episode would be in the end\n\nEpisode 1: \u201cCommon people\u201d\n3.7/5 - It was a beautiful episode but I didn\u2019t feel a personal connection with the characters. They were both strongly in love with each other, but you can see the desperation within their sufferings as time progressed. The tactics for the health care system truly shows how bad social influences can cause breaking points for people &amp; how far they\u2019re willing to go in order to make ends meet. \n\nOverall this episode was a prime example of the twisted tales &amp; anthology that reveals humanity\u2019s worst traits within greatest innovation.
