I had thought I'd seen most key pieces by now and had moved on to other things when this video popped up in my suggestions. It begins with Bodycam footage not included in the movie or the trial. It shows the neighborhood and police discussions in the immediate aftermath, as well as other footage from that night woven throughout that I haven't seen elsewhere. I thought some of you may find it interesting.  https://youtu.be/lYXD9SMCa-w?si=k3Zi0efuzmhFAxjh\n\nFor those just starting down the rabbit hole: \n\nHere are the full interrogation videos post shooting \n\nInterview 1 \nhttps://youtu.be/puQmH_d8yVw?si=YxWmWv-fCoGlTBax\n\nInterview 2\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lZ74O5qxI0w?si=3IurVUXKQjU0f2vr\n\nFor those who haven't seen the trial, I will post those links as well. There was some pretty important evidence that I wish had been included in trial. She is actually am even bigger monster than what we saw in the movie. Note: Trial videos are about half as long as advertised as there is a lot of dead space to fast forward through such as when the court breaks for recesses \n\nDay 1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/ygm__xISYAM?si=xT2Di6bgMw_Gxe4L\n\nDay 2 (State Rests)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/kJKQqjVfvnE?si=_nApwK5qtP2nafJt\n\nDay 3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/SN8lCIq7ivM?si=EbRML6cWwHN1xTdk\n\nDay 4 (closing arguments)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/EA_K8tmog4o?si=5jDc92HXULnin0W4\n\nSentencing \nhttps://youtu.be/9dHWMI2HEyw?si=GoiRNU2VUwymxzs1\n\n",
