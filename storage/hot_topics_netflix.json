The list of things he doesn't like is long:\nPreferably no fighting or guns. None to little romance. No Asian (so no k-drama's for instance). No extreme dumb humour. No extreme enthusiastic people, because that does not look sincere. No explicit sexscenes. Must be spoken in languages: English, Dutch, German or French.\n\nMovies/series he liked in the past: Home Alone, Jumanji, Cool Runnings, Night at the Museum, National Treasure, Mees Kees, Kommisaris Rex, Tremors, Arachnafobia.",

I launched the Netflix app on my mobile phone with the same issue however when I turned my wi-fi off and switch to mobile data (set to Czech Republic) it reappeared. Does anybody know what may be the reason of this sudden regional exclusion?\n\n  \nThank you.",

        "content": "I just watched S1 E2 of Wednesday last night and it feels different from the pilot. The pilot was closer to being cinematic in quality. Episode 2, the one with the canoe race, feels much more amateurish in pacing, direction, acting, writing, etc. It's like watching someone play an RPG videogame. Most of the characters speak entirely in cliches (the roommate and the queen bee girl especially). The dialog is so clean like how they take turns perfectly and don't really move around while talking. Wednesday gets away with that because she's a creepy deadpan snarker and Ortega pulls off the deadpan thing very well. But, most of the characters aren't suited to it. \n\nIf the argument is \"This is made for teens\", well, okay even when I was a teenager I could tell a good quality screen production from a cheesy one. \n\nIf the rest of the series is like this I'm probably going to be really disappointed, which is too bad because I think Ortega, Zeta-Jones, Guzman, and the kid that plays Pugsley are great casting for the Addams family.",
