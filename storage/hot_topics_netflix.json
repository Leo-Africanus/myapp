Wow yeah, turns out people who have a bad relationship with food before the show didn't magically rewire their entire brains after leaving TBL. Not sure how that's NBC's fault or even a controversial thing, but man did they soak up about 20 minutes just repeating the same thing over and over again.\n\nBob said a mean thing to Joelle one time (which did inevitably get her to finish the 30-second treadmill run)? DUN DUN DUNNNN. Dramatic music and another 15 minutes over the fact that yes, every trainer yells at you when you try to give up during a workout because that's literally the job you are paying them to do.\n\nJillian gave....you guys it's so bad, it's terrible, I'm trembling and shaking even as I type this....CAFFEINE to contestants??? Holy shit ya'll, NBC is basically the devil incarnate let's spend another 20 minutes talking about it.\n\nThe whole thing was mining for any controversy it could possibly find and there just wasn't a damn thing to say. I'm a millennial and as someone who struggled with my weight at the time the show first aired, it was actually really inspiring to see how much diet and exercise was paying off for people who were way bigger than I was. While I may not be able to draw a direct line between TBL and my eventual love of exercise, I know that watching these people get on the treadmill and work their asses off (literally) gave me a model that I continue to follow to this day when it comes to my diet and how I take care of my body.\n\nThis wasn't a documentary about scandal or NBC doing anything wrong, it was just a drag on the most inconsequential events that when you pull back and look at what they actually said, sure as shit wasn't worth 120 minutes of my time.",

(We have dead spots so we set up a mesh system)  \n  \n\n\n* 1st device is the TV downstairs that connects to the router \n* 2nd device is my fianc\u00e9's PC, connected to 1 node via LAN that's connected to the router downstairs\n* 3rd device is my PC, connect to another node via LAN that's ALSO connected to the router downstairs\n\n\n\nSince I am the primary account holder, I am the one receiving the codes via email. And I have to confirm EVERY TIME someone wants to watch on the TV, or when my fianc\u00e9 wants to watch on his PC.\n\n\n\nSometimes, I watch on my tablet, which is connected to the access point from the node connected to my PC. And that doesn't ask for a code, maybe because it's in the same network as my PC. BUT TECHNICALLY, everything is in the same network, just in different nodes. \n\n\n\n  \nIt's getting annoying...how are they unable to recognize 1 mesh system as the same household?

        "content": "So the other day I got Netflix back and everything was fine and dandy, but I tried putting Subtitles on (I dont watch without them, havent for over 15 years, and not just on Netflix - I do CC on live TV too and subtitles on on other streaming services as well). \n\nAnyway I selected the subtitle setting I wanted and now the Audio/Subtitles small menu keeps flashing. I dont have my cursor over it at all. It just shows up every so often and is annoying.\n\nAnd then it gave me a 404 error yesterday temporarily for some reason but I'm sure its unrelated. \n\nAlso it's not just one show or movie, its all of them. Anything I can do? I've already tried logging out and back in. I dont wanna deal with this lol i dont need the small menu opening every 5 seconds.",

        "content": "Back when I first saw Enemy of the State , it felt like over-the-top Hollywood paranoia, all satellites following you in real time, phone taps in seconds, every move tracked which is very typical of the entertainment industry. Watching it again last night it feels way less like science fiction and way more like a Tuesday.  \n  \nThe wild part is we don\u2019t even need spy satellites anymore. We hand over our locations to apps 24/7, leave microphones in our homes, and carry around devices that log everywhere we\u2019ve been. Add in data brokers, security cameras on every corner, and facial recognition in half the apps we use, and you\u2019ve basically got the same surveillance net the movie warned about. Made me super anxious last night about my own data, I don't get spam calls much but I get lots of promotional offers in my mail from places I haven't even heard of. Data gets sold online all the time and it's probably in the subscription agreement if anyone ever read it but is there a way to take these off for sure? It's the internet and nothing truly gets deleted but at least make it less visible. Would appreciate anyone knowing more than I do to tell me how I could try and track and maybe delete my data online.",
