Im guessing  they copy wrote thier name  that means no one can use that name?  And if the answer is yes how do i find an email that someone will read?

Overall, I get the plot but\u2026 I don\u2019t know is it just me or anyone else struggling to understand the drama because of the subtitles on Netflix?",

        "content": "I\u2019m watching \u201cWorst Roomate Ever\u201d on Netflix, episode \u201cRoomate Wanted Part 2\u201d. And I can\u2019t help but think HOW do these people put up with these crazy roomates for so long. The one episode *spoiler* said the FIRST night mans moved in he slept with his dead dog? Why didn\u2019t that lady kick that psycho out that day or move out that day?! She proceeded to let him stay and he proceeded to *spoiler* unalive her dogs. I would never in a million years let someone sleep with their dead animal in a house I was also sleeping in WTF?! Then the episode I\u2019m watching now, this lady is throwing a party to make her roommate \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in hopes he will leave\u2026 girl if you don\u2019t call yo homeboys or cousins to come drag this mans out\u2026 she extra asl having people loud partying and blowing cigarette smoke under his door.. like poor me please leave. Hell no girl that\u2019s YOUR house and ur just sitting around hoping he gone leave? I\u2019d drag a mf out physically and yes I know some of the roomates are murderers that\u2019s why I said bring yo peoples to help you. It\u2019s just crazy what these people allow and put up with.",
