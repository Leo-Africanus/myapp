I\u2019m sick of this money grabbing bs.

        "title": "Another Post about the new Horrible UI change ... with suggestions",
        "content": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!!\u00a0**That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

        "content": "Okay so I know Bloody Mary by Gaga has basically taken over every Wednesday dance edit on the internet. I get it\u2014it\u2019s catchy, moody, and fits Jenna Ortega\u2019s moves really well. And I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve vibed to those edits more times than I can count.\n\nBUT.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the actual song used in the show is Goo Goo Muck by The Cramps. That offbeat, punky, slightly weird 80s vibe? It matches Wednesday\u2019s oddball, vintage aesthetic perfectly. It\u2019s quirky in the exact way her character is. And the fact that Jenna choreographed the dance herself to that track just makes it feel more raw and authentic.\n\nI honestly like Goo Goo Muck more than the sped-up Bloody Mary remix. Not saying the Gaga version isn\u2019t fire, but there\u2019s something about the original song choice that feels way more unique and true to the tone of the show. It has that creepy-cool energy that makes the scene unforgettable.\n\nAnyone else feel like Goo Goo Muck deserves more credit for how iconic that scene became? Or are y\u2019all team Bloody Mary all the way?",

        "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m new to Netflix (finally got it a few months ago), so apologies if this isn\u2019t a thing they allow\u2026\n\nWhat I see in the app (google tv dongle) changed recent, and the new UI is remarkably unusable.  Is there any way to revert the interface to the previous version?  Or is there an alternate view that is better at showing list views or denser information?  \n\nI\u2019ve looked though account prefs and didn\u2019t see anything \ud83d\ude23 but I\u2019m hoping I missed something\u2026",

I am mostly finding myself pressing on my screen during boring scenes hoping it would 2x. also 10sec skip option is a bit too much as much can be missed and I find myself constantly skipping 10sec and then realising I missed something and then going back 10sec again.

        "content": "Hey all,  \nJust wondering if there have been any new Netflix original shows that started in 2025 and are actually worth watching. I'm always trying to catch something fresh before it gets too popular or disappears from the homepage.\n\nLooking for anything that\u2019s well-written, mysterious, or addictive. I\u2019m open to other genres too if the story and acting are solid. Just don\u2019t want anything slow or boring.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen something this year that\u2019s underrated or really good, I\u2019d love your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance.",
