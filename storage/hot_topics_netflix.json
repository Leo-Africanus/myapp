Another episode was there was this well in this kids back yard that did something I can't remember what I'm pretty sure it was time traveling forward. Another episode was about a puppeteer on a beach and he turned a little kid into a puppet. I can't remember any more episodes but I remember the show being awesome and I want to watch it again.",

        "content": "I assume everybody here is aware of the release of the new season of \"Stranger Things\", so I'm no different and decided to watch it as soon as someone told me about it.\n\nI'm not a big a fan of watching any kind of TV shows \u2014 at most I would watch a movie once a month and that's pretty much it. And the thing that got me really confused about this new season of Stranger Things is that it's not even the plot, or atmosphere that makes you binge watch it as soon as you finish 1st episode \u2014 it's the effects, cuts, timing and how it's put together that makes you want to watch it.\n\nLet me cllarify it for you: when you watch movies (or some TV shows too, like Better Call Saul) from 10-20 years ago like Matrix, Inception, Shutter island you just want to keep watching it because of how amazed you are by the plot and the twists are so unpredictable that you have these \"a-ha\" moments where you picture the whole image in your head with the wow effect.\n\nIn case with this new season though, the plot itself seemed okay to me, but while watching it I had a feeling that I'm watching tiktok lol. Just how fast-paced it seemed to me and the constant change of the enviroment, going back and forth between characters. As soon as you supposed to get bored and chill, produecer hits you with another dopamine hit to keep you engaged. So after watching first episode I turned it off as I knew where it was leading \u2014 watching it until 4 am.\n\nIf that't the case, it's not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 they are just evolving to attention span of its users and that's it.\n\n**Is it just my observation or there's somebody else who also felt that way? How do they make them so addictive to keep watching and what are the tricks that are using?**",

The (gorgeous and talented) actress who plays the queen is wearing the most god awful blue contacts. Everytime she is in the light she literally looks like a twilight vampire with these huge cheap looking contacts sitting unnaturally over her eyes.\n\nOf course I understand that the real queen had large blue eyes, but I hate the way these contacts look and it\u2019s all I can look at in any scene where she\u2019s in the light. No one else on the show has such strange contacts in\u2026 \n\nIt honestly looks like she is wearing gag gift/Halloween costume contact lenses sometimes! Has anyone else noticed this? I am only on season one, so do they get better over time? Or is this something I should just do better ignoring? It seems strange to me that a show that went to such lengths to have amazing costumes, sets, and historical accuracy would allow such a wildly weird element and expect people not to notice. ",
