But the consistency that Dexter maintains is unreal.\n\nIn fact it's still airing and having one of the best tv ratings ever. This series dominated the genre of serial killers.\n\nAnd the character Dexter Morgan has been played so well by Micheal C Hall, truly amazing. It's just simply lovely.\n\nThe progression of season and new serial killers introduced in each season keep you hooked with the series.\n\nI am currently on the final season of Dexter and I must say it did not miss any aspect whatsoever.\n\nI am sure most of you have already seen it but, of you haven't, then I must say it's a must watch.",

I actually visited that historical house recently and learned about the front porch campaign. They would bring thousands in by train to hear Garfield. He always tailored his speeches due to the different groups of people that would come hear him. He was a savvy orator. Disappointed they didn't show this.\n\nStaircase.\nI can't believe how many episodes this was. After the trial I checked how many more episodes and couldn't belive how many more to go. I watched it all but have to admit I fast forwarded all the flashback scenes between the couple. Who knows what went on really between those 2 in private. I think he's guilty. ",

It was selfish as he sold himself over the actual members. Hybe\u2019s hitmaker Bang wasn\u2019t the focus of Dream Academy. Second, Simon doesn\u2019t understand that kpop is a rigorous program. You can\u2019t just wing it. For example, the boys had a staged meeting with the label CEO and they supposedly were nervous. It talked about how they were nervous and couldn\u2019t banter because they didn\u2019t know each other so well. In Dream Academy, most of the girls spent 2 years with each other and had media training. There is a reason why Katseye has so much chemistry. Simon didn\u2019t do any research on why Hybe is successful. He is a dinosaur that is still stuck to live auditions. Two of Katseye\u2019s members Lara and Manon were scouted online.\nThe last thing is December 10 doesn\u2019t even have a single launching today. Katseye had a single that launched with Dream Academy. There is lack of strategy from a producer of supposed hit groups. Yet, I do see potential in one or two members. I can see that he is trying to replicate Harry styles again. It is such a pity that the boys are being used for his ego. Hope they get to release a single at least.",

Since Netflix is also on my iPad I signed in there and saw download icon for the content I wanted to watch. Does anyone know why I have to watch the content on my iPad instead of my AppleTV? Thanks for your help.",

        "title": "So...is the Death Note Netflix Series still happening?",
        "content": "So all the way back in 2022 the guys who made Stranger Things announced that Netflix was working on a new project for Death Note (completely unrelated to the 2017 movie, to be clear)\n\nStranger Things recently finished, right? The final season is out...so is development on this secretive new DN series still happening or did it get quietly canned? They announced like 3 years ago and from the articles I've read it seems they were still just busy with scripting, maybe filming will finally happen next year???\n\nThen again they also say that they're working on two other projects and maybe even a spin-off to Stranger Things so I dunno.......\n\nHere are the articles btw just in case someone is reading this and thinks I'm talking out of my ass:\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/](https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/)\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/](https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/)\n\nMaybe I'm huffing huge amount of copium but I'm still on the side of \"It's still happening just slowly\", and I have several reasons for my hope:\n\n1. The Death Note anime is on Netflix now and available for world wide users, not just japan, the country specifics dubs aren't available everywhere but it's unusual for Netflix to release one show in so many regions anyhow (\\*that is not a Netflix original)\n2. A metric FUCK TON of merch released this year and there's still more announced to come out in 2026, maybe it's just because the anime is turning 20 years old but maybe also because behind the scenes they are working on some kind of new project, wheter it's this supposed new Netflix series or something completely different\n3. Killer Within and the social media accounts. Killer Within still has decent success and is still getting updates even after the initial hype died down around it, and many Death Note related official social media accounts have been active or have been revived ever since 2024, posting almost every day or every week.\n\nFinally, Death Note is still really damn popular even among new gen anime fans, it just kinda makes sense for it to be revived with a BIG project someday right?...I mean, they did try that in 2017 I guess. :P\n\nIf anyone has any sort of new information, I would appreciate hearing some kind of new info that I haven't stumbled on. Because after writing all this out, I feel like I'm having a Pepe Silvia moment.",
