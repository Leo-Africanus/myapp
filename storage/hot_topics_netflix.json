I feel like I didn't get enough time with Marty or any of these people before they were genius hardened criminals and almost...bored/underwhelmed by all of it and any vulgarity.\n\nSo far, it feels like if Breaking Bad knew it was a TV show mixed with Mad Men or American Psycho but without the... I don't know!! Justification? Style?\n\nIts frustrating. I want to shake them and wake the whole show up. \n\n\n I ask... did anybody that was IMMENSELY bored by this stick it out and it was worthwhile for you?

There was no downside for an alliance of 5 people voting out 4 others. That would then make it a boring and predictable show when you know who will be voted out.\n\nLet's say the contestant's voted out someone that is not the millionaire, then $100,000 is taken off the prizepool and given to the millionaire. This wiould make sure someone like Lauren isn't voted out and would create higher tensions petween players. Complete anarchy! What do you think?",

        "title": "Am I Alone in My Interpretation of Adolescence?",
        "content": "So first of all, it was an amazing Miniseries - acting, scripting, casting, filming wow!\n\nIt has been interesting to read all the different takes on the show - Some are saying it's anti-male - some are saying it's specifically targeting the red pill culture and misogyny that's rife amongst kids. Some are pointing out how toxic bullies are - heck, some people are doubting who actually stabbed Katie!\n\nBut when I watched it, I honestly thought the beauty was that it wasn't pointing any specific fingers... Or maybe pointing many fingers at many problems coexisting in kids' worlds these days.  Merely highlighting how chaotic and scary kids lives can be and how easily it can all go wrong nowadays.\n\n1. Jamie wasn't specifically red pill or incel - but he's certainly been influenced by some of those ideas - they've found their way into his language - In a similar way to how people in the 90s used to call everything bad 'gay' at highschool 'aww I don't want to go to history class, it's so gay!'  - this way of normalising certain negative beliefs you may not even personally hold, find their way into your language.  He's certainly had some negative influences however - he has also engaged in some bullying of his own making derogatory comments to some women online.  I don't think he's a specifically bad kid though - He deserves punishment, don't get me wrong, but I think we are still meant to care and have compassion for how he ended up where he ended up.\n2. Katie was clearly one of many bullies making life very hard for Jamie - People ask \"why pick on Katie rather than other males picking on him - it must be because of sexism or red pill\" - but honestly the extra pain and shame of being humiliated by a girl you have a crush on ads an extra sting that makes it 'make sense' - not in the sense that Katie is to blame obviously, but just why she might be targetted uniquely with extra resentment.  We are never specifically told what Katie did or said in full, but based on the way her best friend was reacting to police, there was some guilt involved - again, no murder was deserved, but the best friend realised they had pushed Jamie too far and felt conflicted as she's just a teenager herself and doesnt' know how to interpret what's just happened. The show was smart not to specify how exactly Katie bullied him so as not to make it look like she deserved it - The show wasn't about blaming Katie.  Katie was also horribly bullied with her private photos so she's also a victim there, who may well have 'paid it foward' by passing her bullying pain onto a new victim \"Jamie\".\n3. We are clearly shown a school with very few boundaries run by teachers who don't care and don't exert much discipline.  The kids are unruly, the cops compare it to a prison... It's like nobody is paying any attention to anyone.\n4. It's made clear just how horrific online bullying can be - and how easy it is. When the adults were younger, teasing was usually limited to a few perpetrators - but nowadays the whole school can team up and humiliate someone on IG (as they did with both Jamie and Katie) - even if it's just through random emoji reactions to other comments - the sense of shame and humiliation can be more extreme than most adults are aware of.  It got me thinking a lot about how scary that is for kids nowadays for sure.\n\nTo me - it was more a display of what a horrible jumble of circumstances kids can find themselves in - Jamie isn't all evil, he's a confused kid stuck between wanting to be nice, and being told by male and female bullies that he's an incel for being nice and only 'bad boys' win... Katie is likely a typical teenage girl with her own angst and insecurities and she wasn't bullying any more than any other girl sometimes does - but she got caught up in a confluence of events that are more common now than any other time in the past.\n\nIt showed kids with nobody paying attention to help guide them, and as a result, their worst natures come out without regulation - sort of a modern-day 'Lord Of The Flies' in many ways.\n\nWhat I didnt' see was a direct attack on boys or bullies or even red pill - the incel movement is used more as a way to tease and humiliate a boy who didnt' even 100% buy into the dogma - and the red pill ideology was just ONE of the many moving parts that caused a murder and a death to occur that never should have.\n\nAm I alone in feeling this way?",

        "content": "First, let me say I'm so glad that Chris is finally gone. What a piece of work he was. He thought he was god's gift to women and what was with that comment at the end about him being Prince charming?? \ud83e\udd26.\n\n I didn't really care for Sam in the 1st 3 episodes but she's one of my favorites now.\n\nSydnee is playing all the men like fiddles. Those men were pathetic- all it took was a pretty girl with a nice body to show them a little attention and they turned to jelly....(Good for her though.) I wasn't sure if she and Phil had a thing or her and Chris did. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed these three episodes more than the first three. But I liked them all. I'd love to see more seasons of the show. There's still some tweaking for them to do. \n\n***Edited to add-\nThis is by far my favorite podcast I've listened to that talks about this show.  \n\nSo far there are 2 episodes, one of them talks about 1-3 and the next one talks about 4-6.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7eUJyjTkELE2KfbxGHbqkF?si=N_LIduBhTuaX7OB6ws5hjw\n",

With a more articulate host; good chemistry with the guests (if any); more about the fun, slice of life, &amp; things being done than self-congratulating the host, etc.",

I thought maybe his son or someone else by the same name but then I progressed further into the first episode and I heard it\u2026 that heavenly Batman voice we grew up with as kids it\u2019s unmistakably HIS voice for sure. His lines and role were done before his passing. Hearing his voice again truly brought a smile to my face",
