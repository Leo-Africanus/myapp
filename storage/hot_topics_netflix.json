        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m trying to track down a Japanese film I watched on Netflix around 2010-2011. I\u2019m sure it was a sex film. Not sexual scenes but scenes with full blast sex. The movie had explicit sex scenes, comedic elements, and was definitely in the adult or niche section of Netflix at the time.\n\nSome details I remember:\n\t\u2022\tThe film featured actual sex scenes (not just sexual content, but actual explicit scenes) of a young woman and an old man where he feels her up on and begins to try and have sex with her, he tries to penetrate her but she keeps blowing him until he finishes to prevent him from wanting to feel like finishing in her or whatever. \n\t\u2022\tIt had a comedic tone, not taking itself seriously.\n\t\u2022\tThere were scenes involving bugs being used in fights or some bizarre concept along those lines.\n\t\u2022\tAt one point, the suns face turned to the face of one Japanese dude in the film and started talking to him.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the word \u201csex\u201d was in the title, but it\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t recall the exact name. Has anyone seen a film with these themes from that era? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

All three components support HDCP 2.2.\n\nI was happily streaming in 1440p throughout the day when all of a sudden my stream was interrupted by an error message and after reloading the stream was stuck at 1080p again. I've tried clearing the cache for Microsoft Edge and restarting my computer to no avail. Graphics card driver and Windows update are both fully up to date. I pay for Netflix Premium. I also have the HEVC extension installed and I've tried resetting it. \n\nI reached out to Netflix support with the same details and the best advice I got was to try streaming through Safari.

        "content": "Looking for a show to put in the background that I don't have to pay much attention to. \n\nI like the classic sitcoms like The Office, HIMYM, etc but find that the look of a lot of these shows is muted and dreary. Just IRL visuals I guess, but I want something brighter and more saturated. \n\nI took a quick peek at Emily in Paris and it seems to have the look I'm going for, but haven't actually tried the show yet. \n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!",
