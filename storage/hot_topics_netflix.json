I haven\u2019t tried this method on a pc yet or by using just the plane website Netflix but I doubt it would work there. I also don\u2019t know if it work on non-apple devices but it\u2019s worth a shot. Hope someone found this helpful!\n",

Turned on 4 different shows/movies thinking it would be different but after a few minutes, whatever I am watching goes dim and I have to move my mouse on my laptop or the stick on my xbox controller to get the lighting back to normal. \n\n",

I have tried looking up a few lighter shows or movies to watch but it hasn't really changed my selection. It's the same 20ish shows and movies and I'm so tired of it. What are fun, silly, and/or lighthearted titles I can flood my search bar with? Thank you in advance!",
