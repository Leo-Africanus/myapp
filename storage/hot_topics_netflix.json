        "content": "The first season had all the charm anyone could want in a show like this. It was quirky with a darker tone and I greatly enjoyed all the slight nods to the original Addams Family. It seemed like such a strong show. Every episode was good until the season final which I felt was a little over the top and lame. I thought it would pick back up for season two but my gosh was I wrong. The episodes are uncreative and unnecessarily long and to my dissatisfaction all the characters were butchered to an extreme. It hurt so bad to witness Eugene and Pugsley spend all there time causing issues with Slurp. Also, don\u2019t expect Wednesday to show any signs of improvement she seemed to have sorta gained at the end of the first season. Not only is that work erased but it actually feels like it\u2019s declining steadily. It\u2019s like she\u2019s supposed to be a badass but her character seems to have a bad case of main character syndrome. Bringing Tyler back to continue being a whiny jerk was not pleasant either and it was made worse for leaving Zavier out. Don\u2019t even get me started on the writing. It\u2019s some of the cringiest stuff I\u2019ve heard in a while. This is a lot of negative stuff but I can say some good things about the show too. Season 2 was mildly entertaining. Oh, wait. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Feel free to disagree with my opinion but for me this season was a joke.",

In today\u2019s world that feels almost impossible.\n\nAnd then the layers of fake accounts, the endless lies, the way he kept the story alive for so long\u2026 it\u2019s wild. Was there someone else involved helping him cover tracks? Or was Bobby just that good at manipulation?\n\nAlso makes me wonder how many red flags got ignored or brushed off. Did he have access to some kind of insider info about her life? How did he always know what to say to keep her hooked?\n\nHonestly it almost feels bigger than a one-person catfish.

Most appointments I had feel rushed Lab results get thrown at me with no explanation or I get a quick everything looks fine with zero context. It leaves a lot of questions hanging and makes it hard to know what to do next or what even matters.Thats part of what led me to try out EurekaHealth. It\u2019s an AI tool that\u2019s built specifically for health questions not just general chatbot stuff. I use it to make sense of test results, get second opinions based on visit notes, and ask follow up questions I didn\u2019t get to bring up during appointments.  \nWatching The Good Doctor just kind of reinforced how helpful it is to have something that brings that kind of clarity and support into real life even if its through tech.",

        "title": "Wednesday S2: am I the only one?! Am I being too harsh?",
        "content": "I really enjoyed S1 of Wednesday. It had some flaws, but overall a fun concept and use of the Addams IP. \n\nThis season though\u2026 6 episodes so far, and it feels like a completely unfocused mess, and I\u2019m considering just checking out. Where the first season had subplots BUT were NECESSARY red herrings &amp; dead ends as part of Wednesday\u2019s investigation, S2 subplots feel all over the place, as though the writers were just winging it because they weren\u2019t sure what they wanted to do. \n\nThere are also WAY too many returning characters we DIDN\u2019T need. And guest spots that don\u2019t feel like the intended nice surprise they\u2019re meant to be IF they were supported by good writing. They feel shoehorned. Especially Weems. I liked her character in S1, but they made their choice killing her off, and should have stuck with that. She now being Wednesday\u2019s spirit guide is a reach too far. \n\nI also find it perplexing that when Bianca\u2019s power would have been needed at a moment where it could have been life or death for the Nightshades facing Tyler, she doesn\u2019t even attempt to use it. Huh?!?!!?! What about Ajax? When shit hit the fan, he doesn\u2019t attempt to stone Tyler?!\n\nI also take issue with some of the way the Addams are represented here, compared to past media. Yes, the Addams are meant to be creepy &amp; kooky, and part of the gag of The Addams is how off putting &amp; backwards they\u2019re supposed to seem to regular people. But they were NEVER portrayed as bad people, doing bad things, at least to society. The subplot involving Pugsley\u2019s \u201cpet\u201d, and the lack of any genuine remorse from Pugsley &amp; Gomez for the amount of people it\u2019s killed is distasteful. I also dislike that Fester is a lifelong career criminal that escapes any true negative consequences, and even the family don\u2019t take issue with it either. The show handles these sorts of things in a \u201cYeah? So what?\u201d fashion, and it really rubs me the wrong way. \n\nI am at odds as to whether I bother continuing with the remaining episodes, because if Tyler somehow gets a \u201credemption &amp; all is forgiven\u201d arc, that will be the straw that breaks the camels back for me. \n\nCredit where credit is due though: Wednesday &amp; Enid having a \u201cFreaky Friday\u201d was great. It really seemed that both actresses had loads of fun playing each other\u2019s respective characters for that episode, and both did a remarkably good job: they totally sold that they had swapped bodies because they had the personalities nailed.

        "content": "Netflix used to be the bomb. For months, and it's getting worse, there is very literally nothing worth watching. Anything new is likely some 3rd rate movie with subtitles and actors you've never heard of. Or passing off as new, movies from years ago. Used to look forward to checking each day for something good (and there was always something new). Now. Just sucks! What happened?! ",

        "content": "So in Netflix\u2019s Dept.Q, Merritt\u2019s kidnapping was hinted to be tied to corruption and pressure from powerful people. Same with Sam Haig\u2019s case getting closed as suicide while other evidence suggested otherwise. But by the end it feels like that whole corruption angle related to the kidnapping is just dropped. Did I miss something, or is this just a loose end the show never explained?\n\n",

        "content": "Netflix, ever the overeager valedictorian of the Streaming High School Class of 2025, continues its tradition of slamming down original series the way an overcaffeinated sous-chef slams espresso shots before brunch service. Every month, the platform releases a new parade of shows, documentaries, and limited-run experiments that suggest some poor junior executive has a spreadsheet labeled \u201cCONTENT = GOD.\u201d And you know what? It works. The business is good. The business, in fact, is booming.\n\nThe streamer has always had a soft spot for Jason Bateman, who, after perfecting the art of deadpan futility on\u00a0***Arrested Development***, decided to go full Walter White Lite with\u00a0***Ozark****,*\u00a0a show so darkly violent it made money laundering look almost quaint. Bateman didn\u2019t just star in it; he co-created, directed, and sprinkled his Bateman-brand sardonic seasoning all over it. That partnership was too profitable to end with\u00a0***Ozark***, so naturally, Netflix backed the truck up for another project. One that feels like\u00a0***Ozark*****\u2019s**\u00a0younger, cooler, slightly better-dressed sibling.\n\nEnter\u00a0***Black Rabbit***, an eight-episode limited series created by Zach Baylin, who previously wrote\u00a0***King Richard***,\u00a0***Creed III***, and\u00a0***The Order***. This time, Bateman teams up with Jude Law for a story about estranged brothers, set against the backdrop of a Manhattan hotspot so exclusive that you, yes you, will never get a reservation no matter how many points you\u2019ve hoarded on Resy...",
