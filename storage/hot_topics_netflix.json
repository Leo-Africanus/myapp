One other guy I know had the same reaction \u2013 we both felt kinda bad for him.\n\nBut then I heard about three women (all therapists, though only for a few years), and they didn\u2019t get that reaction at all. Sounded to me like they identified more with the therapist than the boy. \n\nIt got me wondering \u2013 is this difference just about being a therapist or not? Or could it also be about gender, or who you identify with emotionally?\n\nCurious to hear how others experienced that scene. Did it feel unfair or necessary?\n\n\n",

Let me explain\u2026\n\nHe was right about convincing Cara that he swapped with Sam but if he wanted to follow through with that plan he should have swapped Cara and Sam\u2019s boxes not his and Cara\u2019s. He would then need Cara to swap Sam and his box  (thinking that they were both empty and she still has the million) for him to win. There is no situation where he would have won after swapping his box with either of them. If he swapped with Sam, Cara would have swapped them back leaving Sam the winner and if he swapped with Cara she would have taken it back. Therefore the odds were very heavily stacked against him and he messed up massively.",

Piper also hangs out with OF creators like Sophie Rain which looks like foreshadowing of what she will choose to become when she turns legal age.\n\nLooking forward to her response to all the allegations when she turns 18.

They masterfully break up the guys alliance and start voting them out.\n\nSam tells Cara off camera the clue about the millionaire was 2 sisters. Later, on camera she asks and Cara knows to lie.\n\nCara has the guts to sabotage her laser challenge with Sydney because she has the assurance that sam will not vote for her no matter what and that sam can probably sway corey.

I feel like they built up Sam\u2019s story, and her great gameplay as the Millionaire, just to have filler time on the show. I had a large feeling that the last person to receive the money, would win the show, and as soon as we got to hear Cara\u2019s I hate to call it \u201csob story\u201d, but we all know tv plays those up lol, I knew she had it in the bag. Her reasoning for needing the money, and them mentioning over and over again how she was a burger cook and didn\u2019t have as glamorous of a job as a lot of the rest, would have connected best with the audience at home. I wholeheartedly believe that production made sure to give her the money last, out of the ones that were left, when she received the money. And in doing so we got to finally see a tiny bit of her gameplay, and a lot of her story at the very end, almost as a way to justify her win that would be confusing to a lot of viewers.",

        "content": "I just wrapped up Queen of the South and now I\u2019m in that random phase where I don\u2019t know what else to watch. But this time, I\u2019m really stumped. Here are the shows that I can remember off the top of my head that I\u2019ve watched (and finished) so far in alphabetical order:\n\n1. Bojack Horseman\n2. Brooklyn 99\n3. Designated Survivor\n4. Disjointed\n5. Godless\n6. Good Girls\n7. Grey\u2019s Anatomy\n8. Maid\n9. Manifest\n10. Midnight Gospel\n11. Money Heist\n12. New Amsterdam\n13. Orange is the New Black\n14. Paradise PD\n15. Queen of the South\n16. Rookie Blue\n17. Space Force\n18. Superstore\n19. The Blacklist\n20. The Night Agent\n21. The Resident\n22. The Residence\n23. Wanted\n24. Wentworth\n25. Zero Day\n\nI\u2019ve watched a few movies here and there but I\u2019m more of a tv show guy because with shows I don\u2019t have to worry about watching something else after two hours or so - tv shows are like an extra long movie.\n\nIf anyone has watched any of these shows and is a fan of other shows, please let me know!! I\u2019m absolutely dying for something new to watch!!! I\u2019m open to suggestions from both American and Canadian Netflix!",
