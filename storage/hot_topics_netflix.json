Kudos to the police officers for catching the criminals and following every clue they left behind.\n\n**spoiler**\n\nI believe this could have been the perfect crime if they had handled the rubbish differently by burning it all, so the police couldn\u2019t follow their trail. But it happened the way it did, so all the time spent planning the robbery ended up going to waste, I guess.\n\nAt the end, Leonardo Notarbartolo still insists that he wasn\u2019t the mastermind of the crime, but just one of the gang. What\u2019s your opinion on this? Was he really just following the gang\u2019s lead, or was he actually the one in charge? I still believe he\u2019s a genius for hiding the fact that he was the mastermind. \n\nWhat happened to Agim, the police officer, in 2015, when he was found in possession of illicit diamonds is truly devastating. I believe he fell in with the wrong crowd and got caught red-handed. I hope he\u2019s living a better life now.\n",
