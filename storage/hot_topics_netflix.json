Why did the salesman killed own his dad when he was working as one of the squid game guards when he was younger? \n\n( I understand he recognised his face during one of the games, but instead of letting him go and accepting his plead etc, why did he choose to kill him?) \n\n2 . What happened to the No-eul\u2019s Daughter? and why was she searching for her? \n\n( No-eul , the girl that was dressed up as the bunny mascot )\n\n3 . What happened to Jun-Ho\u2019s Brother?
