Netflix claims they only keep billing records for a year so they have no record of it. At first I thought I might have been hacked but their customer service is so intent on me ending the account. \n\nTheir customer service actually said,\u201d and just to let you know if your account was created in United States you should be paying us $17.99 not $5.99.\u201d\n\nSeems like I have no recourse and it\u2019s a dirty way they\u2019re getting longtime customers to end their grandfathered rate accounts.",

The premise of it was that they would show what was a seemingly random murder at the start of episode 1 and then the rest of the season would be about everything that led up to that point. I swear it was a multiple season thing with different stories and characters each time, or maybe it was like different shows all kind of linked by a premise. The season I remember most vividly, the initial murder happened on the beach of a lake, and the story behind why the woman did it was because her sickly sister wanted to come out and party with her and they ended up taking ecstasy or something and because of her condition she went into cardiac arrest and the guy who was murdered at the start tried to perform cpr and ended up caving her chest in and killing her. I thought it was called Monsters or something but that seems to be a true crime thing. That\u2019s about all I remember though pls help thank you v much everyone",

Kristen Bell and Adam Brody's chemistry or let\u2019s call it effort to be together- You genuinely believe that Joanne and Noah are deeply in love and would fight this hard to be together.

Imo it gave depth to characters who felt a bit one dimensional in Season 1, like Sasha or even Joane\u2019s parents\n\n3. I liked it had some modern cues- like Noah\u2019s people pleasing nature, Esp the whole Noah arc of relying on social scripts to be a \"good boyfriend\" instead of genuinely showing up for their earlier partner. Infact in S1, I had a problem that they never really showed much of Noah\u2019s side. He felt bit like a love bomber. Even the fact that he sneakily kept slowing down the relationship but wouldn\u2019t confront her? (Reminded me of April and Jackson wedding runaway storyline in grey\u2019s anatomy LOL) \n\n4. The show offers a realistic look at navigating interfaith dynamic. Instead of a dramatic, single episode conversion, the season explores the messy, non-linear process of Joanne contemplating Judaism. Esp considering how faith is literally Hot Rabbi\u2019s careerr! \n\n5. It shows how the honeymoon phase ends, making the main couple face their own tedious, slow moving reality. Noah and Joanne are shown moving past the electric newness of their courtship into the day to day mundane of a committed life. And that\u2019s what S2 meant for me too, not the butterfly in stomach moments but the slow stability. ",

(This one is really important) One of the characters was a green bipedal reptile in a purple wizard outfit with a cap and robes. He may have had yellow stars on his hat and robes as well but not definitive.\n7. The intro to each episode was a very short looping animation of the animal characters dancing in a 2D hand-drawn style over some type of patterned background.\n\nThere is only one possibly false detail, one of the characters may have been a bipedal bear with a top hat (lol now that I think about it it kinda reminds me of freddy fazbear)",
