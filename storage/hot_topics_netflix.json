How in the Howie Mandel doing handstands on a handkerchief did this limited series trend at #1? I\u2019m genuinely shocked at how bad this acting, writing, and over all production turned out to be. It\u2019s so bad I stopped at the start of episode something or other to write this Reddit and I\u2019m already having exceptionally more fun with my limited time on a work night. This series is like someone farted in a closed room with no ventilation after eating at Joes dinner sub 4:00 am. I believe watching the history of how man made Velcro shoes in the 1980s would have been a substantially more valid use of my evening. Who in the wide world of sports memorabilia watched this and gave it a thumbs up? Walking down 22nd street at 3:00 am hitchhiking a ride to New Port Richey would be a more productive use of thumbs or ups. I paused the TV with an \u201cI\u2019m not mad I\u2019m just disappointed\u201d expression and pondered my viewing choices or wondered if I should donate my TV to help educate underprivileged tribes in Papua New Guinea. I think the parents and entire community of people that raised the individuals responsible for making this \u201climited series\u201d monstrosity should be forced to pay a tax and plead guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. I\u2019m beyond words for how incredibly underwhelmed I am at the thought of this dumpster fire to continue. When in the Men are from Mars women are from Venus did Netflix decide \u201clet\u2019s go with this one.\u201d? I would rather go back to the recent Gasparilla parade wearing a thong while eating Icecream than watch this nonsense any longer. Please just say no to drugs and this series, it\u2019s honestly that bad. I may delete my subscription to all streaming platforms and go pray in the Himalayan mountains for a solid year after this waste of hours, minutes and seconds with no purpose. The only redeeming quality is this is a \u201climited\u201d series.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA concerned viewer",

Also the artistic community emanating from Risdy. I was very interested in the tape art project + I was inspired by what art can do to heal and reach others. A central question the documentary raises, is the secret apartment art? I would say, No. It comes off more like a kids\u2019 secret playhouse, a free place to live after the free spaces they lived in Eagle Rock were destroyed by builders. I would be interested in knowing more about the divorce between Michael and Adriana. Obviously, his obsession with the secret apartment is what drove them apart. I was going to recommend it to a friend who lives in Providence and my niece who went to Risdy, but changed my mind.",

Ingrid turning into Dexter - She is committing her first ever murder yet is perfectly fine doing it in such brutal way and being okay with cutting off fingers\n\n3. Ingrid the secret keeper - Why not tell her husband that the daughter he has been looking for and going crazy for is in rehab\n\n4. Ingrid the fake investigator - Why would ingrid want to go to the shady drug dealer having known what she knows\n\n5. Rehab not alerting the police - The two detectives even mentioned that they are spreading their search so the Rehab wouldve heard about it for sure\n\n6. Wannabe Bonny and Clyde - The killer couple being so nonchalant about killing just because they were physically punished as children (yes thats awful but how does that turn you into such insane serial killers)\n\n7. Dumb Dee Dee - Dee Dee not being able to provide any real explanation for why she loved a \"religion\" where the main figure was hiring a hitman to kill of his bastard sons who he abandoned\n\n8. Victoria informing the cult - Why would she inform The Shining Truth about finding her son (Henry Thorpe) when she literally had to escape the place herself?? Make it make sense\n\n9. Super(Old)Woman - The old woman randomly appearing on the 4th floor at the last second out of no where to push Dee Dee off. Firstly, how did she even find them? Secondly, was she running with them up the stairs the whole time? Ludicrous!\n\n10. Ingrid and her Son - Why didn't Ingrid ask Paige how she knew about the son?\n\n11. Gullible PI - Makes no sense that the PI would just buy the story of Alison wanting to meet somewhere far away and get in the car with Dee Dee.",

I get it it\u2019s a small town so they wanted to show solving murder there is not easy but showing them straight up dumb is another thing. It was frustrating to see that even with so much attention and media coverage of high profile murder in town a detective is so easily ruining and manipulating the case with no question asked. I mean the concept and twist was tbh good, it got me and i didn\u2019t see it coming. Last episode first half i was like this is so illogical and they built it all for this and then second half made sense of it all. If they chose better actors, and storyline and plot was played in bit different and more tension filling way it could have been great thriller mystery show but they relied it all on last 20-30 mins which made it frustrating. I am sure many people have different take on it and i would love to hear that. ",
