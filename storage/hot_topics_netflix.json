        "content": "  \nThere\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether *Adolescence* demonizes men and masculinity. But is that really the case? Here\u2019s what the show *actually* explores:\n \n- It critiques toxic environments, not men themselves. The series stars Jamie Miller a 13 year old boy who is arrested for the murder of Katie Leonard. But Adolescence doesn\u2019t portray Jamie as inherently violent, he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online spaces. ([Time](https://time.com/7267884/adolescence-netflix-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Jamie struggles with emotional repression, something many young boys face due to societal expectations. For me the show is more about how important it is for young boys to learn how to manage their emotions and be vulnerable so they do not become violent like Jamie. ([News.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/casual-brutality-hidden-meaning-behind-adolescence-emojis/news-story/a8d7e4d2dbf8260f48e2af5c4c9a0858?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Jamie\u2019s exposure to incel forums and online radicalization is a key theme. The show critiques these dangerous spaces, not men in general. Just like we discuss unrealistic beauty standards for women, Adolescence examines toxic influences affecting young men.\n\nAt its core, *Adolescence* isn\u2019t about vilifying men\u2014it\u2019s about understanding the challenges they face. Instead of rejecting its message, let\u2019s ask: How can we better support young boys before they reach a breaking point?",

You know why? Because everybody is entitled to an opinion!\n\nTikTok, X, Facebook, Reddit, everywhere I leave my opinion saying \"I thought it was alright, pretty good, I probably wouldn't watch again though\" I get people saying...\n\n\"You obviously didn't get it \ud83d\ude44 \"\n\"You must have a low IQ, this is only for deep thinkers to watch\"\n\"Sorry that TikTok has rotted you're brain and you can't go more than 5 mins without getting bored\"\n\"You're part of the problem with society\"\n\"We found the Andrew Tate supporter who hates women!!!\" (I'm gay lol)\n\nMy point is that it's OK to not be a big fan of a fictional TV show lol Everybody has an opinion. But it just seems like fans of this show are actively going out of their way to be rude and aggressive towards those who weren't big fans of the show.\n\nI can understand the obvious hate towards those who are wearing tin foil hats or who are actual Andrew Tate supporters, but what is the deal with getting angry with a random person who just didn't like it? Lol\n\nI know it explores sensitive topics but people really need to chill out over this show. One of the key messages was how we behave online and some of the fans are completely contradicting that message imho. They're being SO hateful towards people who have a different opinion. \n\nRant over, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed that every time Netflix takes over a show that was originally on another platform the drama goes up 100% they\u2019ve taken shows that albeit somewhat serious still had humor and lightness and just completely plunge it into darkness and drama. They kill off characters for no reason and the ending of the shows make no sense. I\u2019m just tired of it. ",
