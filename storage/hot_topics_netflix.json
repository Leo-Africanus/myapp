        "content": "Cara and Sam made a deal off camera to split the money from the beginning. If you rewatch the show with that in mind everything makes sense.\n\nThey tell each other when they are the millionaire off camera. They have to fool the producers and the audience too \u201cthe ultimate lie\u201d to pull it off, so they sell it as best they can.\n\nWhen Sam is the millionaire, despite obvious clues pointing to her, Cara keeps coming up with reasons to go for someone else.\n\nSam gets away with her Justin Timberlake agenda by using it with Cara, how does she not realize when she hears her do it a second time at the table? Cause she\u2019s on her side, she only has to worry about Jaymie catching on.\n\nSam\u2019s go to \u201cfake lying face\u201d when she\u2019s the millionaire was a wide open mouth, she uses it when the person they voted for has no money in the box at the elimination dinner. \n\nWhen Cara is the millionaire she tells sam off camera. They masterfully break up the guys alliance and start voting them out.\n\nSam tells Cara off camera the clue about the millionaire was 2 sisters. Later, on camera she asks and Cara knows to lie.\n\nCara has the guts to sabotage her laser challenge with Sydney because she has the assurance that sam will not vote for her no matter what and that sam can probably sway corey. Only reason she takes that \u201crisk\u201d. If corey moves to vote Cara out, sam would just deadlock it. Both Cara and sam view Sydney as their biggest threat and corey easy manipulated.\n\nWhen Sydney opens her box, fake big open mouth from sam.\n\nAt the end when Cara wins, Sam is kind of weirdly excited and not that upset. After seeing Cara cry due to winning and corey cry due to losing, Sam figures she needs to cry to to sell it and no tears actually come out cause they are fake crocodile tears.\n\nWatch the show again there are more tells not listed here but it\u2019s plain as day. Cheaters Cara and Sam need to be exposed! \n\n\n",

        "content": "\nI just finished the documentary about Piper Rockelle and the ex SQUAD. I feel bad for Piper. She\u2019s such a beautiful, talented little girl. She has so much potential but looking through her socials, it seems like she\u2019s really manipulated by her mother and she believes that everyone who left her is the bad guy. She\u2019s also been really acting inappropriately whilst being a minor. She had so many boyfriends and she doesn\u2019t even delete the contents she made with them (ex bfs)\n\nI think her mom taking advantage of her would similarly lead to her like Sky Bri whose mom is very much supportive on her \u201ccareer\u201d. Piper also hangs out with OF creators like Sophie Rain which looks like foreshadowing of what she will choose to become when she turns legal age.\n\nLooking forward to her response to all the allegations when she turns 18.

We never really saw her game play, at all, but we saw Corey\u2019s the entire season yet he never had a chance to be the millionaire. I feel like they built up Sam\u2019s story, and her great gameplay as the Millionaire, just to have filler time on the show. I had a large feeling that the last person to receive the money, would win the show, and as soon as we got to hear Cara\u2019s I hate to call it \u201csob story\u201d, but we all know tv plays those up lol, I knew she had it in the bag. Her reasoning for needing the money, and them mentioning over and over again how she was a burger cook and didn\u2019t have as glamorous of a job as a lot of the rest, would have connected best with the audience at home. I wholeheartedly believe that production made sure to give her the money last, out of the ones that were left, when she received the money. And in doing so we got to finally see a tiny bit of her gameplay, and a lot of her story at the very end, almost as a way to justify her win that would be confusing to a lot of viewers.",

Why didn\u2019t these parents file a criminal complaint against her if she SA\u2019d your child? \n\nThese parents who filed the lawsuit settled as soon as they got the money. Throughout the series them and the kids keep on saying they are worried for Piper and they wanna save her but, they stopped the fight when a settlement came. Shouldn\u2019t they have continued the case till Tiffany was held accountable by the court? Like why would you wanna make money of this too? \n\nFor anyone\u2019s child who had being SA\u2019d, the better thing would be to see the person who did this face justice rather than take money and forget it. I\u2019m baffled by it. \n\nWhy can\u2019t the law enforcement look into this and investigate all these claims and get the people responsible for this accountable? ",

Everything else on my console also works fine. I've already turned my console off and on again, signed out and back in, turned my console off at the wall and left it for about an half an hour, and uninstalled and reinstalled netflix. Any ideas are helpful.",
