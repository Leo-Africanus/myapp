It made me wonder how much easier it would be today with everything being online.  \n  \nBack then you had to forge documents and physically be somewhere to make the scam work. Now with social media, data leaks and people oversharing, you could probably impersonate someone you have never met just by piecing together public information. Name, address, phone number, old photos, even their signature if they have posted it somewhere (I myself have never changed my phone number or email, I imagine I'm in every database online). The scary part is how official everything can look. A scammer could set up fake accounts, fake email domains, fake phone numbers, and most people would not even think twice if the message looked professional. If someone had enough of your personal data they could probably pass as you with your bank, insurance, or even your employer.  \n  \nI know there is places you can buy data but is there any software or method to help with this stuff? I'd like to know your opinions or advice.",

As someone who knows relatively much about the history of the Second World War I expected, judging by the title, a more thorough history of the Nuremberg trial of which I know less. However, that\u2019s not what I got at all. \n\nThe trial is treated more as a sideshow and the documentary watches more like a general history doc of the Second World War. A missed opportunity to do something unique in my opinion. I get that it is also meant for people who don\u2019t know anything about the Second World War, but I think you can also just introduce the fact that the trial is about the horrors and crimes during that war and then go on with a documentary about how the trial took place. \n\nNow it\u2019s just the worst of both worlds. It\u2019s veeeery general on the war, it\u2019s causes and the way it was lost itself, but then also it just touches briefly upon the different perpetrators. \nWouldn\u2019t it have been far better to go by topic, eg people responsible for the camps, people in general administration, generals etc etc. Or just a couple of episodes where they talk about one person only, eg Speer, G\u00f6ring or Hans Frank? \n\nTLDR: the documentary is not anything like the title would suggest and it feels more like a general history doc of WW2. Generic. ",

        "content": "Halfway through. It\u2019s a fun mystery. I like Cordelia when she\u2019s being her own take on Sherlock Holmes. It should be great. The problem for me are some parts that are so distractingly awful they ultimately stick with me more than anything else. To wit:\n\n- Birding. I\u2019ve never been more annoyed by a main character\u2019s quirk. Every mention of birding felt forced, and not a single analogy landed. It felt like some writer read that specific birding book Cordelia carries around and got a huge inflated ego about it. I will instantly judge anyone I find out is into birding going forward. That\u2019s not fair to them and it\u2019s The Residence\u2019s fault. \n\n- Two unbelievably bad actors. 1) The Secret Service comic relief guy is painful to watch. I feel second-hand embarrassment when he\u2019s trying to make the Kylie Minogue jokes land. Heinous comedic acting. 2) The Congresswoman who constantly interrupts the proceedings. I initially thought they were going for a caricature of boorish, ignorant politicians, but now it seems like she was supposed to be playing some kind of champion of skepticism, challenging the establishment? Either way she comes off like she read the script immediately before each take, took a shot, did her lines, then did them again after the director told her to lay on the sarcasm even more thick. Truly awful. \n\nSnark - These writers cannot do snark. They think they can and that makes it worse. I almost turned it off for good in the office scene when the slimy friend of the president tells Cordelia \u201cThis is bigger than you\u201d and her response is \u201cDo you mean the house is bigger than me, because, like, duh, I\u2019m inside the house!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I had to get this out of my system. Normally any one of those annoyances would be a dealbreaker and I\u2019d happily move on with my life. But I want to see how this ends. And I can\u2019t until I purge my hatred of some do this stuff.

A really good show I was very excited about and told everyone about. \nThey cancelled Resident Alien. \nThey cancelled Snowpiercer\nI can go on and on\n\nYet they still have them on recommendation for people to watch. They should remove them all together if they cancelled \nI'm so sick of Netflix cancelling good shows but keep producing new ones and now they raise the price and make it so you can't share accounts with family members out of household. \n\nOnly reason I still have Netlfix is bc of Wednesday and the Castlevania series\n\nIt makes me so frustrated and mad that they keep doing this and people just take it and do nothing. \n\n\nThis is just venting. I know Netlfix will never change and keep producing shit shows while canceling the good ones. \n",

        "content": "I'm desperately searching for a serie to watch. So please let me know your top 5! They can be older series too. I wouldn't know the name of the category I like (maybe fantasy) but I'm looking for something that has little to nothing to do with daily life things. Preferably something that makes it feel like a different kind of dementia. The series I can think of off the top of my head that I really like are:\n*Sandman\n*The 100\n*From\n*Dark\n*1899\n*The OA\n*Dead boy detectives\n*Locke &amp; Key \n*The end of the f*king world (not really the same category but has little to do with everyday life sh*'t) \n*Strangers things, my least favorite tho (too many seasons, story gets boring but maybe they safe it in the last season)\n*Shadow and bone\n\nI also really like anime, my top 3 is:\n*Spirited away\n*Avatar the last airbender\n*Arcane \n\nMany thanks in advance!
