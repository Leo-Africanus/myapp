The film\u2019s strength lies in its authenticity; every laugh, heartbreak, and quiet moment feels genuine, drawing you into their world. It serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting and impactful those youthful adventures can be.\n\nI really miss road movies like this, where a group of friends embarks on a journey to discover something meaningful.\n\nWhat did you think about this movie? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and feelings after watching it!\n\nAlso, if you have any recommendations for similar movies, please share them below!",

The whole thing about millions of fake accounts being created under people\u2019s names without their knowledge was wild enough, but what got me was how little control regular people had over their own personal information once it was in the system. It makes me think about it, are our systems really that vulnerable nowadays that something like this can just happen to anyone? We spend so much time being told to make stronger passwords and enable 2FA, but if a bank or data broker already has your personal info in their system, what stops it from being misused?",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the writers, the actor or everything else, but I just can\u2019t seem to connect with him. \n\nAlso, the actor\u2019s bone structure doesn\u2019t fit with the overall age casting. I know this show has a lot of complaints about the actors not suiting the ages they\u2019re supposed to be, but at the same time he\u2019s the one that sticks out the most for me, especially next to Danny who is supposed to be his twin.\n\nThe show seems like they\u2019re trying to have Damon and Stefan the remake, but it\u2019s not working because those two were ancient vampires. The dark and broody bit on a teenager without going deeper into his struggles or thought process is just cringe.",

Yeah, the 13 year old viciously killed someone but from a physical standpoint, did they need that kind of man power for what appears to be a 45kg max kid? It feels like such excessive force.",

If I turn the music/sound effects down, the voices are too soft and can't hear what anyone is saying. \n\nThis seems to be the case on most TVs. Mine is an old Hisense ledn32d50, that I Chromecast to, but it happens on smart TVs, too, and I've tried playing with the settings there, but nothing. ",
