But Oh My God, the shots of nature were gorgeous! And of course the acting was great all around. I just liked it, lol.

        "title": "Netflix's Music Streaming Platform Is Coming in 2025, According to Industry Experts",
        "content": "In a bold industry move that could reshape the entertainment landscape, Netflix is reportedly planning to launch its own music streaming platform by 2025. Industry experts and insiders suggest that the streaming giant, already a dominant force in video content, is looking to expand its reach into the music industry, challenging established players like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.\n\n**The Vision:** Netflix has long been synonymous with video streaming, but its foray into music streaming signals a strategic shift toward becoming a one-stop entertainment hub. According to reports, the platform will integrate music streaming with its existing video content, offering users a seamless experience that combines movies, TV shows, and music.\n\nThe move aligns with Netflix's broader strategy of diversifying its offerings and retaining subscribers in an increasingly competitive market. By adding music to its portfolio, Netflix aims to create a more immersive ecosystem where users can enjoy curated playlists tied to their favorite shows, exclusive soundtracks, and even live performances by artists featured in Netflix originals.\n\n**The Netflix Plan:** The music streaming industry is already crowded with heavyweights like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. However, Netflix's entry could disrupt the market in several ways:\n\n1. **Integration with Video Content**: Netflix's unique advantage lies in its vast library of original content. The platform could leverage its popular shows and movies to create exclusive music experiences, such as curated playlists inspired by hit series like\u00a0*Stranger Things*\u00a0or\u00a0*The Witcher*. This integration could attract fans who want a deeper connection to the content they love.\n2. **Exclusive Partnerships and Original Music**: Industry experts speculate that Netflix may partner with artists to produce exclusive music or host live-streamed concerts. Given Netflix's track record of investing in original content, it could also venture into producing music documentaries, biopics, and reality shows centered around musicians.\n3. **Competitive Pricing and Bundling**: To lure users away from established platforms, Netflix might offer competitive pricing or bundle its music streaming service with its existing video subscription. This approach could appeal to cost-conscious consumers looking for an all-in-one entertainment solution.\n4. **Personalization and AI-Driven Recommendations**: Netflix's expertise in data analytics and personalized recommendations could give it an edge in music streaming. By leveraging user data, the platform could offer highly tailored playlists and music suggestions, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nWhile Netflix's entry into the music streaming market is exciting, it won't be without challenges:\n\n* **Licensing and Royalties**: Securing licensing deals with record labels and artists will be a complex and costly process. Netflix will need to navigate the intricacies of music rights to build a comprehensive library.\n* **Competition**: Established players like Spotify and Apple Music have a stronghold on the market, with loyal user bases and extensive music catalogs. Netflix will need to offer something truly unique to carve out its niche.\n* **User Adoption**: Convincing users to switch from their preferred music streaming platforms won't be easy. Netflix will need to demonstrate clear value to attract and retain subscribers.\n\nThe news of Netflix's music streaming platform has sparked mixed reactions within the industry. Some experts believe that Netflix's brand recognition and global reach give it a strong foundation to succeed. Others caution that the company's lack of experience in the music industry could pose significant hurdles.\n\nArtists and record labels, meanwhile, are cautiously optimistic. Many see Netflix's entry as an opportunity to reach new audiences and explore innovative ways to monetize their work. However, concerns remain about how Netflix will handle artist compensation and copyright issues.\n\nFor consumers, Netflix's music streaming platform could mean more choices and a more integrated entertainment experience. Imagine watching a Netflix original series and instantly accessing its soundtrack, or discovering new artists through exclusive content. If executed well, the platform could redefine how we consume music and video.",

I checked what other people were saying after I finished so my opinion couldn't be swayed by others and thank god I didn't. Some points I didn't like were Farhad, Rose (she was off icel), and Tomas specifically what annoyed me was the fact that no one could lie to save their life. BUT I loved the action I think it was 10x better than S1 kinda felt repetitive with the mole or whatever but I still enjoyed it. I'm not no film critic or wtv i'm actually employed but I'm hoping for a S3 with the last scene with Peter and Catherine seemed promising.",

I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. **(EDIT: Just a few days ago, even yesterday, I was watching SPY X FAMILY just fine.)**\n\nI don't know if this information helps but I was also on time with payment for my subscription.

        "content": "So many to choose from.  I'll go first, sticking to Episode 1 (because I bailed by the end of Episode 2 because I couldn't take it anymore).  But please post examples from the entire second season. \n\nRose is a genius computer software engineer, and she goes into a potentially make-or-break meeting with an investor with $50 million dollars on the line for an amazing computer program she helped to create, and....She takes her phone into the meeting. It is not on silent. She is apparently unable to figure out how to  make it be silent as it continually interrupts the meeting, forcing her to finally leave the meeting while her boss explains that she is apparently having an \"off day\" (or something).

We have never played games, we do not intend to play games (at least not on this platform), we even deleted the \"kids\" profile, and there's still no option to get rid of this annoyance. \n\n  \nNetflix, please give us the option to disable the games.
