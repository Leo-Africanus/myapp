        "content": "I\u2019m about half way through the second season of Squid Game reality show and the whole thing seems kinda fishy imo. When my family was watching it, my brother theorized that certain players were actually paid actors that sabotage the game to make it more interesting. He said this during the six legged pentathlon game when the player who was portrayed a spoiler brat did horrendously at it when faces against the twins. \n\nMy brother then theorized that she was an actress planted into the game to be unlikable and get the pre-established \u201cmain\u201d characters through the first game. I felt his claim had some merit due to how badly she in particular did in the game, but I wrote this off as her just genuinely doing terribly and the producers simply playing up her \u201cspoiler brat\u201d past in post-production. Still, I kept the thought in the bad of my mind.\n\nCut to the end of episode 4. Everybody simultaneously agrees to just refuse to play the game. That on its own it very strange. Players had every reason to betray that agreement, and all it would have taken was one team to do so for the whole thing to fall apart. Then they get in teams of 2 anyway, and that\u2019s how the producers decide marbles opponents.\n\nIt seems extraordinary unlikely that ALL players would simply refuse to keep playing, and that the producers either a. had planned on that happening or b. had all the marbles ready to go within minutes of that happening. \n\nHow could the producers have planned on that happening, if all players were genuinely just playing the game?\n\nIt all seemed to line up a bit too well.\n\nMakes me think that the show either has plants disguised as players to influence the outcome or is just outright scripted.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nTL;DR: it seems highly unlikely that the producers of Squid Game reality show could have anticipated everyone refusing to play at the end of game 3. Makes me suspect the show has paid actors or is just outright scripted. What do you think?",

        "content": "So, Netflix is kind of bad when re-watching a series. If you have already watched it, it often doesn't give you the iption to jump into the next episode, so you have to know which episode you were watching and manually look for the next one, which usually starts on the ending credits, so there one more extra step to make it start from the beginning. \n\nIn short, my toddler only likes like 3 cartoons and when he's allowed to watch tv, he watches and re-watches the same thing over and over. As he's to young to know how to navigate the ui, I have to do it for hi, which is particularly bothersome when he's watching 15min episode cartoons (sea of love is even shorter).\n\nI know there is a way to do this via web browser, but there has to be a way to do it via the app... I mean who uses a web browser for Netflix? Also, there are so many apps that give you this option, it's so easy and not a new thing at all.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. \n\nEdit: sorry I cant edit the tittle. It was supposed to say unwatched, not unmatched. ",
