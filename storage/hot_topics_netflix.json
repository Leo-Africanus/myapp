        "title": "I enjoyed \"Wayward,\" this is my review",
        "content": "I enjoyed Wayward. As a matter of fact, I thought it was pretty good. I *did* go into it with absolutely no expectations, simply clicking the link after a brief look at the description. A critique I would have is that the eight episode format felt, to me, sort of limiting. There was a lot that was touched on but not really elaborated upon in a satisfying way. The show may have benefitted from either being shorter and more concise, in order to remove elements that were either unnecessary or improperly explored, or longer, so as to deal with these issues in a more coherent manner and to keep some of the plot points from having such a rushed execution.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re down for a wild, and somewhat tonally inconsistent, ride, then there is fun to be had here. I found it relatively easy to get invested in the characters and their lives. The show was, at turns, endearing, unsettling and downright disturbing. There were twists I honestly didn\u2019t expect and ended up enjoying (sometimes despite the execution and not because of it, but whatever). The psychological drama, I thought, was more often than not well done and satisfying. The fact that one pair of protagonists are teenagers and the other pair are adults allows the series to walk the line between teen and adult drama without fully committing to either audience, and maybe being accessible to both (but I will leave that for you to decide). In terms of acting, some performances were more memorable than others, but I found nothing unserviceable and the main antagonist to be delightfully both creepy and easy to hate.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I feel as if I was able to feel satisfied with the series because I went into it with very little hype. It certainly wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, but it gave me eight hours of solid entertainment and left me wanting to know *more-* about the characters, their pasts and their inevitable fates. That\u2019s the primary pro and con of this series: it is like walking through a museum and looking at its portraits of people and landscapes. You are looking at \"snapshots\", and what both intrigues and frustrates about the experience is that each piece *suggests* so much to the mind, in terms of questions, speculations and fantasies, but the ultimate satisfaction of these suggestions occurs only in our imaginations.\n\nI have not settled on a rating yet, but I liked it, and my initial recommendation is to watch if you\u2019re into some creepy cult-thriller fun with a heavy dose of teenage angst and a penchant for leaving you with more questions than answers.\u00a0\n\n*I press post. I am sitting in a chair. I am crying out for the upvotes...*",

        "content": "I just finished a painful watch of the Ed Gein story and I\u2019m just in shock as to how this got produced. This series really highlights the hypocrisy and inability to tell a story on Ryan Murphy\u2019s behalf.\n\nI\u2019m under the impression that the Monsters series is meant to help empathize with serial killers by showing the abuse they endured, as well to highlight the societal impact these cases have when they are so sensationalized. The main point of the Ed Gein story that I picked up on was that serial killers stories are misconstrued time and time again, and this has negative impacts, like glorifying violence and desensitizing audiences towards situations like this. Such is completely ironic.\n\nThe exact irony this show is trying to call out is simultaneously partaking in that irony on a whole new level. \n\nEd Gein never had an infatuation with \u201cisle Koch\u201d and \u201cisle Koch\u201d never had comic books made about her. Ed Gein also never had a fiance she was completely fictional for this series. Ed Gein also never had any contact with \u201cBirdman\u201d, and it was never corroborated that he had any romantic affiliation with the shop owner he murdered. I could go on about the historical inaccuracy\u2019s of this show. And I understand some artistic liberties need to be drawn to help tell a story, but these plot lines really had no correlation towards telling his story, and were completely made up for the sake of entertainment, it dilutes his story and shows a complete hypocrisy in the shows mission.\n\nIn my opinion a gritty docuseries about his actual life would have been hard hitting. He lived a boring isolated life, and yeah that would have made for less drama in the show, but it would have struck a nerve with the audience. It could have highlighted a truth that I think is extremely interesting; that anyone with a similar mental health disorder could have easily committed the same crimes that Ed Gein did, if their condition where left untreated and consumed by isolation, grief, and childhood trauma. That Ed Gein could have been a peaceful (yet eclectic) member of society if access to mental health care was available to him. \n\nThat would have really driven the shows moral standpoint clearly. That we are all vulnerable, and all deserve empathy, and that media never shows the real truth (and the negative consequences of that).\n\nInstead we got Birdman shaking his boobs in Ed Geins face, and a dance montage of Ed walking up to heaven while owner of a lonely heart plays \ud83d\ude02 pure brain rot.\n\n",

I liked some of the jokes and just the idea of giant robots is cool. everything else sucked. You're telling me after 10 years they have like 8 cadets in training and NO BACKUPS. Killing off Mako was just a bad decision and just like that too. I wished they ATLEAST mention that Pentecost had a son it was kinda weird they did't in the first movie. Newt being controlled does kinda make sense so I give them props to that. The robot designs were cool but they dismissed any element of realism unlike the first one. And they should've added Herc in the second one. \n\nAlso what's the deal with Amara, she was struggling to even get a connection like a day or 2 before the kyjou attacked and all of a sudden she's a pro and knows what she's doing?. \n\nAlso weird decision to kill that one cadet but the rest live? I feel like they thought they needed someone to die to make it a dramatic movie. Would have been better if they either let all of them live or just kill off the majority of them which would have been more realistic because IT WAS THEIR FIRST MISSION. \n\n  \nHaven't even watched the anime Ive heard its shit too so I don't even want to bother. just my opinion ",

        "content": "Just finished watching. First I feel bad for his daughter Kerri and can see the turmoil and how he is still haunting her. Judging from the postings here, many have been harsh on her. She does look a lot like him and I am sure is suffering from the guilt of knowing she lived with a killer and could not save those women, is carrying his DNA which helped find him. Lots of complicated feelings. I respect her for expressing herself publicly. I am not sure if that is the BEST way to move on but I do feel she is sincere about her reason for doing this and it is not for profit. She is a victim too.  She has kids and likely this has impacted negatively her ability to earn a living in the same way most of us do. \n\nCan you imagine seeing yourself referenced in your serial killer dad's notes?  I also heard that Gary Ridgeway, the Green River Killer actually had his son in the car when he picked up some of his victims.  \n\n\nWhat I don't understand is how could she and her mom not find the stuff in the shed. The kill kit in the house could just be tools etc. I have duct tape and rope string etc in a closet and I am not a killer. But the stuff in the shed is bizarre. He also stalked many of his victims for endless hours sometimes at like 3am. Did his wife not notice him missing or soiled clothes, smells, the jewelry.  To sit on the couch and say to him \"He writes like you.\"   WTF?   Reminds me of that movie \"The Dead Girl\" with Brittany Murphy where this one woman played by Piper Laurie , realizes that her husband is a serial killer when she finds all that stuff in the storage shed.   BTK's wife had to know something was amiss. \n\nEven Ted Bundy's girlfriend was one of the anonymous callers to tip police about him. \n\nBTK's  words when he was caught were \"Tell my wife I won't be home for lunch.\"  \nOn its face sounds harmless enough but to me that sounds like a code. Could she have known and was in some sort of Stockholm syndrome hold with him? \n\nI also find BTK odd in that several times he killed with children present. Stalked women who were home alone with small kids. Can't help but think that somehow represented what he thought of families. He had two types of victims middle aged women living alone and women alone with children.   \nOne poor woman he was hiding in 2nd bedroom in her house. I think she even had a guest over and BTK sat in her house the entire time until person left for the evening.\n\nGet a dog everyone. ",

It has great character work.  Both in the teen characters and the adults.  They create multi layered performances that feel real and I can say for people like Alex, George, Kathrine, Nathan Danny and Cole. I've known people like them in my everyday life the actors do a great job of making them believable.  My aunt has a ranch in Ontario, Canada  and raises horses so I connected with that as well. \n\nThis is a great cast who does fantastic work but I find myself connecting most with the characters of Alex and George.  I had to be responsible for my family in elementary school and High School and I love George's struggle with wanting to preserve his land while at the same time wanting to provide and secure his families future.\n\nI encourage a lot of people to give this show a chance.  I think a lot of the actors on this show have a big future.\n\nThe actor who plays Alex would be very good in Disney's MCU as either Cyclops or Nate Grey (X-Man).",

        "content": "Trying to find a limited series that was on Netflix maybe 8-9 years ago. There was a woman lead who produced and starred in the show. Maybe a comedian?  She said her goal was to create the most boring show ever.  She worked in an office with cubicles and in one episode went on a very awkward date. The entire show was awkward but weirdly compelling. There were pencils and old school tech. Not sure where it was filmed but it reminded me of Monterey or N CA. I have tried to find it again many many times but can\u2019t find it. ",
