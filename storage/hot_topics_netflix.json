I just want to know what the time requirement/allotment is set to before Netflix gives the option to \u201cSkip Intro.\u201d I\u2019ve looked it up in every different way of phrasing this question I can possibly think of, *except here*! I can\u2019t find the answer or even anything that has made me feel like I\u2019m on the path to finding it (maybe a lot of people aren\u2019t asking? Lol)!

Wow yeah, turns out people who have a bad relationship with food before the show didn't magically rewire their entire brains after leaving TBL. Not sure how that's NBC's fault or even a controversial thing, but man did they soak up about 20 minutes just repeating the same thing over and over again.\n\nBob said a mean thing to Joelle one time (which did inevitably get her to finish the 30-second treadmill run)? DUN DUN DUNNNN. Dramatic music and another 15 minutes over the fact that yes, every trainer yells at you when you try to give up during a workout because that's literally the job you are paying them to do.\n\nJillian gave....you guys it's so bad, it's terrible, I'm trembling and shaking even as I type this....CAFFEINE to contestants??? Holy shit ya'll, NBC is basically the devil incarnate let's spend another 20 minutes talking about it.\n\nThe whole thing was mining for any controversy it could possibly find and there just wasn't a damn thing to say. I'm a millennial and as someone who struggled with my weight at the time the show first aired, it was actually really inspiring to see how much diet and exercise was paying off for people who were way bigger than I was. While I may not be able to draw a direct line between TBL and my eventual love of exercise, I know that watching these people get on the treadmill and work their asses off (literally) gave me a model that I continue to follow to this day when it comes to my diet and how I take care of my body.\n\nThis wasn't a documentary about scandal or NBC doing anything wrong, it was just a drag on the most inconsequential events that when you pull back and look at what they actually said, sure as shit wasn't worth 120 minutes of my time.",

YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+ all run in 4K HDR with no problem.\n\nI called Netflix support and they confirmed it\u2019s a **certification issue on their end** \u2014 not a geo restriction, not my internet, not DRM. But instead of fixing it, they literally asked me to **mail them(not even email)** for escalation. Seriously? This is one of the most popular Android TV devices, and Netflix just drops certification like this?\n\nSo:\n\n* Why is the Shield (2019) suddenly *not certified* anymore?\n* Why is Netflix pushing the burden to the customer to \u201cwrite a letter\u201d when it\u2019s clearly a backend whitelist/ESN problem?\n* Anyone else running into the same error?\n\nThis feels like something that should be viral.

He has this money encrypted in this vintage looking portable computer briefcase, but it gets stolen by his accountant to take him the mob boss down. An undercover agent or police officer agrees to meet with the accountant in a hotel. The husband decided to call his tech-nerdy girlfriend through a video call to have her look at it. She was fascinated with the outdated technology. Then a woman with a blonde wig and dressed like a prostitute, breaks into the room and kills both of them. The wife witnessed it, and starts freaking out. Anyways, the husband had met with gun for hire of the mob boss, which is how he got in contact with the accountant, and even took a picture of his face in case he tries to betray him. The wife goes to their apartment snooping around for answers as to why this happened to her husband, and that's when the mob boss' daughter and his bodyguard show up to the apartment to kill her, but the gun for hire ends up killing his boss' daughter. To get rid of the evidence, he makes it seem that the dead body was the wife, and faked her death by burning the daughter's body in the wife's car. The series was on Netflix, and I swear it wasn't in English. PLEASE help me.",

        "content": "It's so.. off.  \nIt's completely lost the vibe of the old series and the movie. Gomez is the worst cast I've seen in a long time, Morticia is completely at odds with her mother and daughter.  \nThey're a school of misfits, yet everyone seem to react just like normies to things like eyeballs and murder - Fester thankfully being his old self is the exception.  \nWe have completely ridiculous subplots with competitions vs scouts acting like a parody of marines, that seem to be written for an audience of 4-year olds. There are numerous silly subplots that go literally nowhere.\n\nI fell like I'm watching random scenes from kids movies about summer camp and school, except the dialogue was better in the shows that focused on 7-year olds.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible, it's convoluted and everyone talks like a try-hard emo.\n\nNot to mention the constant exposition, is the target audience persons suffering from loss of short-term memory?\n\nIt is atrocious, I want to like it but it is a burning file of poo.",

        "content": "Sometimes it is clearly officially announced that another season is coming. Sometimes there are rumours and the series isn't officially completed or cancelled.   \n  \nFor the shows where you've watched all episodes, do you keep them in your list or do you remove them? I really want to be notified by Netflix when a new season is released so I currently keep all of them.  But that clutters my list considerably over the years... I have so many shows there that I want to ignore until the new season is available.   \n  \nI wish there was a way to move them from \"My List\" to a \"Remind Me List\" or at least push them to the very bottom of the list...  What's your approach/tips on this?",
