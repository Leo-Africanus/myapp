There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

I realize I need more to see but it's that good.   \n  \nHowever, I don't get the comparison. Outside of being sci-fi shows on Netflix, they're not the same thing. One is an arthouse-like TV show that's not meant to be appeal to wide audience. The other isn't, well at, least past S1. To me, it's like comparing a Tarkovsky movie to a  MCU movie!\n\nDoes anyone else feel that way?",
