I really like shows where teen characters have strong bonds, especially brother\u2013sister dynamics or a sweet, realistic teen love story that develops over time instead of feeling forced or overdramatic.\n\nSchool or family settings are a big plus. I want awkward phases, misunderstandings, growing pains, and those quiet scenes where characters actually talk about what they\u2019re going through. Basically, comedy with a heart \u2014 where you laugh one minute and get emotionally attacked the next.It should be live action not animation.",

Truthfully, if they'd tried to do a modern adaptation of it then ending up with freddie should've felt right\n\nQuite frankly, they should've switched brayden and freddie, give brayden (as freddie's role) more screen time so it adds up to the persuasion plot. If they wanted this show to be a second chances trope it clearly backfired super hard  \nMoreover, i'm pretty sure by the public outrage s2 endgame is most likely going to be braydriana. Riley and Brayden will not work out and neither will freddie and adriana. I hope Adriana and Freddie get the closure they deserve tho\n\nI'm a huge fan of this whole figure skating romance trope. I really liked spinning out and i was super bummed when it was discontinued, i was hoping for this to be bettter\n\nPS- is there anyone who's a fan of adriana and freddie ??? bc as soon as i finished the show and opened insta- all i could see was just insane braydriana love, like yeah their chemistry was off the charts but i couldn't help but feel for the whole freddie and adriana trope too.

The two plot lines of the adult and child aliens play out the same, there's something they want to fix, it seems to be working for a while but the flaws that were obvious from the beginning turn into problems. These are resolved in typical fashion and with the children especially, it's emphasized how they were never in any real danger to begin with. This scene establishes further that these aliens are seemingly untouchable and that every mistake they make is reversible. This is something that already bothered me in the later seasons of Rick and Morty.  \n\nDid they assume the audience has no assessment skills whatsoever? Why is every joke so in your face?? Terry screams at Korvo to find out why he is so stressed (Get it, it's funny because HE is the one stressing him out and doesn't notice) Im so so sick of watching slop like this",

        "content": "Is it just me, or did Season 2 of Sandman feel a little rushed? I still enjoyed it overall and I\u2019m not saying it was bad (nein, not at all), but something about the pacing felt off compared to Season 1. In the first season, everything had time to breathe like characters, motivations, even silence mattered. Season 2 felt more like \u201cokay, next plot point, next scene\u201d without letting things fully settle.\n\nLucifer especially stood out to me. After how intense and meaningful the finale of Season 1 was, I expected that arc to have more weight or long-term impact. Instead, it felt kind of disconnected, like der buildup didn\u2019t fully pay off. Not bad, just\u2026 lighter than expected.\n\nI\u2019m not a hardcore Sandman fan or comic reader, so maybe that\u2019s part of it. Still, as a casual viewer, the shift was noticeable. The ideas were cool, the visuals were great, but the emotional glue wasn\u2019t always there. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it (ja, possible), but I\u2019m curious if others felt the same or if this is just how the story goes.",

(i was wondering why brayden looked familiar).",
