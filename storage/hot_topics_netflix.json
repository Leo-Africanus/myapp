The acting was just perfect.\n\nThe final episode blew me away. When Jamie called and said that he's gonna plea guilty I just stopped breathing. The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much. Made me think about my own kids and the world they're living. ",

Wanting to go to the shops to get rid of it straight away, like couldn\u2019t wait until after his birthday breakfast.\nWhen he arrived at the hardware store, I swear the first shop assistant recognised him and called upon his \u201ccolleague for assistance\u201d to show him who just came into the store. This colleague then proceeded to seem to take the piss out of him (like you would to a suspected nonce) saying weirdly sexual things like \u201cWash in a circular motion\u201d and he was laughing as he said this. \nHe also gave incorrect advice about needing to use a hose and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the paint off which seems like he wanted him to not be able to get it off?? Like some isopropyl alcohol would probably have been able to get that off. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love the fact that this series wasn\u2019t a \u201cwho dunnit\u201d? But was a \u201cwhy did he do it\u201d which was because of toxic masculinity which was brilliantly done. \nBut I wonder whether this \u201cnonce\u201d thing was deliberately done to make people think the Dad had something to do with it for half an episode only to be pulled away. \nMaybe I got mislead. Wonder what other people think. \n",

        "content": "I understand why people praise it so much. The sheer artistry of it is amazing, the performances are mesmerizing, and every aspect of its production (from cinematography to direction) is amazing.\n\nStill, I watched it all in one go and found it wholly unsatisfactory. The \"incel\" theme is used in a very superficial way, ironically much in the same way it is barely understood by the cop father who has to have it explained by his son. It felt to me that it was thrown around just because its hot and actual, fashionable, and they knew it would garner attention. But it wasn't really explored.\n\nEven the attempt at nuance they tried is kind of skin deep: they seem not to want to condemn the boy too blankly but they painted him with brushstrokes so wide and blurry they ended up with an indistinct stain.\n\nThe things that motivate him are really flimsy, especially seen how young he is. It just feels like they wanted to get across how the manosphere is dangerous and how it corrupts the already troubled youth but they didn't craft a believable relation between this statement and the character that represents it.\n\nHis confused yet searing resentment towards women would have been more understandable in a 16 years old boy, who might actually experience some more substantial sexual frustration, and even more so in a 20 years old, or a 30 years old (20-30 being the bracket in which incels are made irl as far as I know).\n\nMy point is that the boy is not depicted as a proper sociopath, not exactly. He comes from a blue-collar family, nice dad nice mom nice sister, his father seems to be quite the positive character and the relationship between his parents is really good. He's not shown as having had worrying episode of violence or sadism as a child, often signs of a budding psychopathy, nor he seems particularly challenged in his discernment. Quite the contrary: he's a good looking, smart, quippy kid that replies with snappy come-backs to a trained psychologist. He's a bit frail if anything, not unlike so many his age. He's been bullied, sure, but that's not the cause of his behavior. It's the fact that he's got into incel culture, into the manosphere - the bullying is just the spark that sets the oil aflame.\n\nThe way his arch is depicted it's too didascalic for my taste, too unreal. A normal kid, with normal kid's insecurities and a nice family to back him up whose mind is warped by an internet subculture with basically no other concurring factor.\n\nDid class play a role in it? Did the atomization of human interactions in the era of social media have anything to do with it? If so how? Did he have any sort of trauma to prime him to commit such a horrible act of violence? Did religion have anything at all to do with it?\n\nWho cares. Good boy does bad thing because toxic masculinity. A very, very superficial point wrapped into a magnificent package.\n\n(EDIT: corrected typos)",

Most of the time i thought they ask most stupid questions ever missing the point, which annoyed shit out of me, that was more distracting than the actual point of a show. Take for example episode one where Bascome said we will process Jamie to a police station (insert name) and to which Mr Miller pointed the obvious \"Of course I know, its right around corner\".",

Not sure, but these folks just don\u2019t come across as very likable. \n\nAnyone else have any hot takes on this newest Netflix game show? \n\n**I\u2019m not trying to soapbox here. I\u2019m not saying they are or aren\u2019t actually likable \u2014 they just don\u2019t come across as likable. They\u2019d probably be lovely to stand next to in a line and gab about whatever with.
