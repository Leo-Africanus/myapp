I wanted to hear Rumi's version of Takedown that humanized the demons.\n\nI think there's huge potential for a sequel here. If Rumi exists, that means that it's possible for demons to be free of Gwi-Ma. Maybe that's what her mom was working on, but them something went wrong and she died. But maybe Rumi can finish her mom's work and figure out how all demons can have a chance at getting their souls back and being free. It would be cool for a sequel to do that kind of \"moral circle expansion\" where people realize that some demons should have a chance too. But I guess it's too progressive... in the movie the general public doesn't know about demons at all.",

        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging. ",

How good the show is, is a factor of how well the big reveal explained all those observed clues.\n\nThe Glass Dome on the other hand, tossed out a bunch of clues, and then swept aside all those dangling clues, and then reveals the real killer, which was a surprise to the audience. But unfortunately that surprising revelation doesn't explain any of the previous hints. So there is no 'a-ha moment' type of satisfaction. And the crimes were just completely out of character for the killer, as well as being highly implausible. And on top of that, the show's pacing was way too slow. Not recommended. ",

The other element though is that many of the things I've seen seemed very bland and unoriginal in a similar way to eachother. Like the cinematography and color grading felt like they were done by the same people or something. I've almost come to think of them as slightly more polished lifetime, made-for-tv movies. \n\nBut since there are so darn many of them, and they're most of what I see on the platform, I feel like I should maybe give them a shot if I'm going to keep paying for the service. \n\nCan anyone suggest some genuinely great Netflix originals that might change my mind about their content? Also, I'd like to hear from any lovers of Netflixes original content and listen to their perspective on why they like it. \n\nThanks!",

        "content": "I\u2019m seeing a lot of people confused and disappointed about the ending of Too Much \u2014 \n\nThe ending was a play off of Sense &amp; Sensibility by Jane Austen. It\u2019s supposed to be the kitschy American dream of a quintessential British experience. In the beginning of the show, you see them watching Sense &amp; Sensibility before she leaves for England. She expects to live on a British estate and have a very \u201cBritish\u201d experience. \n\nThe ending is supposed to feel sort of rushed and nonsensical in an inside joke sort of way. Because if you love period era books and film adaptations, it\u2019s sort of an inside joke that EVERY story has to end with the main character getting married. (It\u2019s even a joke in 2019\u2019s Little Women.) \n\nSo at the very end where they flash to her and Felix dressed in period era costumes (at their wedding), it\u2019s an homage to the ending of Sense &amp; Sensibility where Marianne Dashwood and Colonel Brandon get married. That\u2019s also why he throws the coins into the air. ",

        "content": "I heard Nori from 3quency and Alison are friends, I checked and they did some TikToks together. What do you guys think ? I had no problem with Nori before but now I\u2019m kind of asking myself questions on Nori\u2019s.\n\nWhy would you be friend with the one that bullied her teammates who even spoke about what happened and how it was hard to see their biggest dream of pursuing a career in the music industry getting crushed because of that narcissist mean girl. Even other bands (Siren Society and Soulidified) showed that they don\u2019t like Allison. A member or Siren Society even blurred her face in a group photo lol (deserved). \n\nAlso keep in mind Alison talked about it and never apologized. She said it was evil editing which is proven not to be since her groups members talked about it after the show. So she is also a liar lol.\n\nSo maybe even tho they may not be best friends, I just think this is very weird from Nori to make tiktoks with Alison. \n",

I've tried Dept Q but I just don't know wtf is going on and it seems so slow to get to the plot. I just rewatched Queens Gambit because I couldn't find anything else. I like thrillers, sci-fi. Seen ST. Not sure if I should start Mindhunters because of how heartbroken you guys are it was cancelled. Tried Dark but it's a bit confusing. Suggestions for shows or movies would be great. ",

They don\u2019t have to be perfect, just enjoyable! I enjoy MYSTERY, THRILLER, HORROR, COMEDY. Do not enjoy ROMANCE, WAR FILMS. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\n",
