Few things I need to clarify though-\n\n1) Why did Rose say William saw Lyle on the ferry and got scared ? She meant William saw the man with the cap and not that he identified Lyle considering both lingaard siblings couldn't have remembered how Lyle Jennings looked like now\n2) Lyle acts extremely stupid when he's with his mom. Is this something to do with being abused? Because it is a little difficult to believe he pulled off all those crimes\n3) they never show the motive behind why Lyle targeted Sam. Was that because he ran in similar circles with Merritt or he just wanted to get back at Sam for punching him. Also, did Lyle pretend to be Sam H to know Merritts whereabouts or was he eventually going to know because he was stalking her.",

Some people are acting like the shows goal was to be the next mission impossible or something like that. It's clearly not. Plus, I absolutely love the trope of \"will they? won't they?\" between Emma and Aldon. ",

It seemed obvious much earlier than the final episode that Harry Jennings death was linked to Merritt's disappearance yet it took the team a long  time to finalize this conclusion. I found it hard to suspend disbelief that two people from the same small town Mhor both disappearing off a ferry would not be a huge story where news people would not be poking around and interviewing Ailsa right after the kidnapping. Then for Morck and company not to press harder when first trying to talk to Ailsa I find it hard to believe they would just leave Mhor without talking to her first. Just seemed like they should have figured this out way earlier. \n\nSecondly the police chief of Mhor disappears and no one goes looking for him? I know small town but pretty sure when investigating crimes you radio in where you are going and even then him going missing would have triggered an immediate response which would have included pinging his cell phone. Not really believable it would take more than a few hours. ",

The flair was necessary to ask the question. Anyway, I ditched the subscription last year because I just wasn't using it, but after a nice break I wanted to come back. The price difference between ads and no ads is large enough that I am considering getting the basic ad-supported version, but I wanted to know how bad the ads are. Is it tolerable?
