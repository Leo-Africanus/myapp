Big mistake, apparently, because after making that change one time, every single movie or show that I start has portuguese audio and subtitles, and I have to change it back to english. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe PS5 app doesn't have any \"default language\" settings that I can find, aside from one on the show page that seems to be specific to that show. Of course, changing this to english doesn't stick - every time I come back to a show it has been changed back to portuguese.\n\nMy phone app does have a \"Manage Profiles\" option which allows me to select a language. I changed this to english. In fact, I have changed it to english several times over the last few days, and it keeps changing itself back to portuguese.\n\nThe \"Manage Profiles\" option on the netflix website also has a language option, though this appears to impact the menus rather than the in-show audio. This has been english all along and has not changed.\n\nI have tried logging out and logging back in. I have deleted the app from my devices and redownloaded it. I have logged out of ALL devices and changed everything I could back to english. Nothing changes. On every device, everything always defaults back to portuguese. It's driving me insane.\n\nHas anyone else had a problem like this? Am I missing a hidden setting somewhere? Or do I just have to accept my fate and learn portuguese to continue using Netflix?\n\nEDIT: after some more experimentation I have managed to get to a place where movies play in english, but shows still play in portuguese. This makes even less sense to me, but I guess it's a slight improvement?",

I noticed a few articles spin it as \u201cTyson fans boo Jake Paul\u2019s win.\u201d That\u2019s just not true they were booing the lie they were sold. Everyone was very disappointed with the fight from both fighters. If you look at Tyson\u2019s walk out you can see it all over his face he already knows everyone is about to see this lie they were selling. He looks worrying or sad, not about the fight, but what everyone is about to see.\nI\u2019d go as far to say that someone should get sued for this. They advertise the fight as being real and all out. Leading up to the fight both sides are saying how ready and how crazy of a battle it\u2019s going to be. ALL FALSE ADVERTISING. Then the entire time they are CLEARLY signaling to each other. Looked up Mike Tyson glove biting habit? Not a single picture last night. Maybe they\u2019ll surface soon? Plenty of times Paul had the upper hand and could\u2019ve lit Tyson up. It was a joke. He could\u2019ve easily had the knockout. I don\u2019t gamble, but I could imagine people going into this betting expecting a real fight, and seeing this as infuriating.",

        "title": "Why Netflix\u2019s Marco Polo Series was Peak and Deserves a Third Season",
        "content": "Alright, hear me out. Netflix\u2019s Marco Polo was actually one of the most underrated gems out there. The production quality? Insane. The characters? Iconic. The potential? ENDLESS. We\u2019re talking Game of Thrones-level world-building, but with Mongolian steppes and Silk Road intrigue instead of dragons (no hate to dragons, but Kublai Khan was his own kind of beast). Let\u2019s dive into why this show was pure peak and why Netflix really owes us a Season 3.\n\nFirst up, Marco and Jingim\u2019s dynamic was one for the ages. I mean, c\u2019mon\u2014Marco, the Italian outsider, and Jingim, the heir to the Khanate? It wasn\u2019t just a classic \u201cbuddies who can\u2019t stand each other\u201d thing; it was like watching two people who knew they had to learn from each other to survive. Marco\u2019s worldview and knowledge from the West gave Jingim a different perspective, and vice versa. But it wasn\u2019t some sappy bromance\u2014they constantly had that \u201care we enemies or are we brothers?\u201d vibe. Watching their grudging respect evolve was actually satisfying AF.\n\nThen we had Byamba, Kublai\u2019s other son, who was a straight-up wild card. Byamba was that guy who could\u2019ve gone either way\u2014totally loyal one minute, ready to throw it all away the next. He\u2019s got Kublai\u2019s blood, but he\u2019s way more rebellious and has no interest in all the traditional rules that Jingim is bound by. His interactions with Marco had this \u201cunlikely allies\u201d energy, like they both understood what it felt like to be outsiders, even if for different reasons. Honestly, Marco kind of needed both of these relationships to survive Kublai\u2019s court; Jingim taught him loyalty, and Byamba taught him adaptability.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s talk Kublai Khan. This guy wasn\u2019t just a brutal conqueror; he was a super complex ruler who respected Marco but also low-key saw him as a threat. I mean, that relationship? Tense. Kublai was like, \u201cI could kill you in a heartbeat, but hey, you\u2019re kind of useful.\u201d He was layered, not just some caricature of a leader, which made his scenes all the more intense. Marco Polo didn\u2019t shy away from showing how every decision Kublai made was about holding onto power, balancing loyalty, and maintaining family connections. He was ruthless, sure, but relatable? Weirdly, yes. By Season 2, I was more invested in his life than Marco\u2019s half the time.\n\nAnd can we talk about Hundred Eyes? This man was easily one of the greatest mentors in any series. His wisdom, the way he balanced loyalty and his own sense of honor\u2014it was all just legendary. He even got his own spin-off episode, which just proved how strong his character was. That spin-off was so good it felt like a teaser, but then\u2026nothing. Like, c\u2019mon Netflix, you gave us a taste, and then left us high and dry. There\u2019s so much more we could\u2019ve explored with him and his relationship with Marco and the whole \u201cwise mentor\u201d dynamic that made us care so much.\n\nThe series had serious potential for a Season 3. They left so many threads open! There was Marco\u2019s return to Italy still looming, and the impact his years in the East would\u2019ve had on him and, honestly, on Europe. Plus, the romance, political drama, the family feuds, and literal battles\u2014it was like we were on the brink of watching the world change. We could\u2019ve seen Jingim stepping up, Marco finding himself in his \u201creal home\u201d of the Khanate, Byamba stirring the pot in his own rebellious way, and Kublai facing enemies on all sides, both foreign and family. Don\u2019t tell me Netflix doesn\u2019t see the potential here\u2014like, we all saw it!\n\nLook, if Netflix can greenlight five seasons of Emily in Paris, they can give us one more of Marco Polo. The fans are still here. Just scroll through the subreddits, the YouTube comments, the tweets\u2014everyone\u2019s STILL talking about it. Imagine the hype if they announced Season 3, how they could bring back that mix of historical drama, action, and stunning visuals (shoutout to those Mongolia scenes, BTW).\n\nIn conclusion, if you\u2019re listening, Netflix: Marco Polo was peak TV. The show deserves a conclusion, the fans deserve closure, and honestly, we all deserve to see Kublai, Marco, Byamba, Jingim, and Hundred Eyes in action one last time. Bring it back for the culture.",
