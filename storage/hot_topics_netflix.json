There were representatives from a bunch of different countries that are on a space ship when a bunch of weird things start happening. If I remember correctly it starts happening after they collect some dirt samples.  I think they they're in an alternative universe? I remember a specific scene where someone's limb gets cut off but they're not in pain and there's no bleeding?? \n\nAlso at the same time one on Earth these spaceship/monoliths appear but they don't open until later on in the series. \n\nDoes anyone remember this show?",

It centered around this character who lived in a perfect world with a sentient mountain and his monster friend. He then wakes up forward in time and the current world is ruled by an elephant dictator. The world sucks and his friend is working a boring job. He goes on an adventure to wake up the mountain and eventually ends up in a vampire night club. It was a weird series hope that info can help identify it. Thanks!",

Either have a rule that all first seasons have a closed story arc or give shows time to build viewership.\n\nGood example - dead boy detectives = I'm devastated there's no season 2, but it was a closed arc, all major ploy points resolved and I don't feel that netflix stole 8 hours of my life.\n\nBad example - the midnight club, or a whole bunch of others that I had on a watch list and then removed when I found out they were cancelled but left on a cliff hanger. I have no incentive to watch them now. \n\nAt least where there is a closed arc, I may still go and watch a cancelled show.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",
