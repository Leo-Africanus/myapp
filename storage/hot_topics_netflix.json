Back in the early 2000s he\u2019s wiping blood with bleach, keeping trophies, and somehow dodging every camera in Miami.\n\nFast forward to now and it feels like the walls would close in almost instantly. Between license plate scanners, smart cameras on every block, DNA databases growing by the day, and even random smart devices recording in the background, I don\u2019t know how someone could live that double life. Even his \u201cburner phones\u201d would leave a trail with tower pings and data brokers selling location info. ",

There are numerous silly subplots that go literally nowhere.\n\nI fell like I'm watching random scenes from kids movies about summer camp and school, except the dialogue was better in the shows that focused on 7-year olds.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible, it's convoluted and everyone talks like a try-hard emo.\n\nNot to mention the constant exposition, is the target audience persons suffering from loss of short-term memory?\n\nIt is atrocious, I want to like it but it is a burning file of poo.",

        "content": "Spoilers \n\nNetflix just added the 1998 thriller A Perfect Murder with Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Douglas. \n\nI enjoyed the film, would recommend if you like a good old 90s thriller.\n\nI noticed something that doesn\u2019t make sense. David (Michael Douglas) is married to Emily (Gwyneth). David\u2019s business is in financial trouble and he has big money problems. Gwyneth is from old money and their lifestyle seems to be mostly propped up by her money.\n\nDavid wants her dead because then he will get all of her money, she\u2019s also been cheating on him. In the film they say because David and Emily DO NOT have a prenup then upon Emily\u2019s death David inherits everything- motive.\n\nBut, given she was having an affair, why didn\u2019t David just get a divorce and get half of her money anyway? Emily states they don\u2019t have a prenup. Divorce is a lot easier than hiring a hit man.\n\nAny insights?\n\n",

Watching it again last night it feels way less like science fiction and way more like a Tuesday.  \n  \nThe wild part is we don\u2019t even need spy satellites anymore. We hand over our locations to apps 24/7, leave microphones in our homes, and carry around devices that log everywhere we\u2019ve been. Add in data brokers, security cameras on every corner, and facial recognition in half the apps we use, and you\u2019ve basically got the same surveillance net the movie warned about. Made me super anxious last night about my own data, I don't get spam calls much but I get lots of promotional offers in my mail from places I haven't even heard of. Data gets sold online all the time and it's probably in the subscription agreement if anyone ever read it but is there a way to take these off for sure? It's the internet and nothing truly gets deleted but at least make it less visible. Would appreciate anyone knowing more than I do to tell me how I could try and track and maybe delete my data online.",

Not heavy on plotline but animations, colours, music was pretty awesome.\n\nLooking into the history and BTS of the film was what really caught me (hence sharing article). So much respect for the teamwork, thought and intention.\n\nFelt like it's a milestone for many of us who didn't make it in something but the alternative path brought us towards something we'd never imagined.

Is this how life after fifty goes? \nFirst,  we have Nick leave his very sweet, pretty wife so he can relive his youth. I wasn\u2019t  hoping for a Betty Broderick type reaction from Ann but the whole situation seemed very unrealistic. That divorce would drag on and on and she wouldn\u2019t have carte blanch to his credit cards. So Nick, who doesn\u2019t seem that rich, attracts the young girl and what does he do? He gets her pregnant. Is midnight feedings more fun than Ann\u2019s midnight video games?\nMaybe I just liked Ann too much because here is Nick with this attractive young blond and who does Ann attract? Not the hot surf instructor but instead a bald, wrinkled up weirdo. This is when I said you know I don\u2019t think I really like where this show is headed. \nNow Nick dies, the show is finally picking up in the karma department and surprise, surprise, poor Ann is saddled with planning his funeral. Why doesn\u2019t his adult daughter, who is falling all over new girl friend within six hours of knowing her, plan the funeral. \nEvery time young girlfriend Ginny fiddled with her necklace I was furious. It\u2019s not like it was an engagement ring. I really disliked how easy breezy these May December romances can be. \nI guess Liz Lemon\u2019s character was the most realistic but the frumpy bathing suit was annoying. Come on Liz, we know there\u2019s a great body under there and you don\u2019t need to wear long sleeve suits. Fine you don\u2019t want sun burn but juxtaposed next to Ginny\u2019s matching bikini, the message seemed to be, over fifty women need to cover up their bodies. More evidence of this was poor Ann\u2019s beach outfit choices and she looked pretty hot in that wedding dress so what gives with the caftan? \nSo I don\u2019t think I will be watching season two, especially if it includes poor Ann babysitting Nicks love child. \ud83e\udd2e\n",
