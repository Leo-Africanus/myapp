My mother lives in Chicago and we live in Indiana, which we\u2019ve always used our accounts this way, but starting today probably like an hour or so ago we\u2019ve been kicked out of Netflix because I\u2019m guessing cause she uses it more often than we do that.

(Think Jordan Peele, but with more maple syrup and self-deprecation.)\n\nLet\u2019s be clear from the start. This is not\u00a0***Wayward Pines****.*\u00a0No Shyamalan twists. No forest conspiracy cults. Instead,\u00a0***Wayward***\u00a0feels like what would happen if Ari Aster, yes,\u00a0***Hereditary***\u00a0Ari Aster, was handed a stack of Judy Blume novels and told to make them deeply upsetting. The setting is the suspiciously quaint Tall Pines, a town where everyone knows everyone, and everyone waves, and everyone would probably lend you sugar, before locking you in a basement and asking you to recite scripture backwards. Think Stars Hollow, if Stars Hollow had a headmaster played by Toni Collette and zero coffee shops...",

I imagine even if he fell into a trash can or something from that height, he\u2019d still probably die. I also realize that narratively, his death had to happen and was always going to happen. But Season 2 could follow Jake finding out Vince is alive in another country trying to protect him by faking his death and maybe they make a plea deal with the FBI to catch Mancuso. Wouldn\u2019t make the most sense, but I just love Law and Bateman\u2019s brotherly chemistry and want more of it!",

Munoz then agreed to fight Reynolds and Constante after feeling disrespected.\n\nWhen the pair showed up, they jumped a fence to get to Munoz. Reynolds had a handgun in his waistband, which he allegedly handed to Constante during the fight. At one point, Constante was seen on video striking Munoz repeatedly while holding the weapon, deputies said.\n\nThe fight continued after the gun was passed back to Reynolds. A shot was fired during the struggle, and Munoz was left bleeding from the head. It\u2019s still unclear if he was struck by a bullet or injured another way.\n\nDeputies also noted the gun had been modified with an illegal device known as a \u201cswitch,\u201d which turns it into a fully automatic weapon.\n\nReynolds and Constante were arrested.\n\n[Reynolds &amp; Constante: a cautionary tale in being careful re: sharing your Netflix password](https://preview.redd.it/ua398llofxrf1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e07955aabdf562b102294f9beeaff3b28df1ee)\n\n[news article link](https://foxsanantonio.com/newsletter-daily/two-men-arrested-after-fight-over-netflix-account-escalates-to-gunfire-gun-violence-switch-television)",

        "content": "When the queen takes Floria to throw her down, the prince refuses to let her cut his hand. She calls him weak and proceeds to cut Florias hand and her own hand. I'm unsure if it was intentional, but the queen cuts Florias hand a lot slower than she cuts her own. If it was intentional, she wanted to cause Floria more pain and herself less. And she had the audacity to call the prince \"weak\". It was just such a small detail that I noticed and really just shows how sick the queen is. ",
