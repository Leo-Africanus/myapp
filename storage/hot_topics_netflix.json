They really need to implement some tailoring to their content.  I like kdrama if it is dubbed well.  I don't do subtitles unless there is no choice and it is a good anime.  At no point do I want French or Spanish stuff being suggested, and at no point do I want children's progamming offered to me unless it is he-man or scooby doo.  Also I don't like the 3D rendered stuff in animation.  AND because the algorithm can't get it's understanding of me, I am getting some terrible suggestions.\n\nThat is bad enough, but now Netflix is suggesting stuff to me as if I have not already watched it.  NONE of my progress(red lines) are working correctly...some are sometimes, but shows I finished a month ago are being suggested to me again...\n\nMan.  I think I miss them DVDs sometimes.",
