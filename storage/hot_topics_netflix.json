        "title": "Season 2 of Squid Games (no spoilers)",
        "content": "Wow. The initial episode and scenes before the games were kind of a drag and I immediately looked up online \"Season 2 Squid Games boring\". I saw a lot of people complaining so I almost didn't want to watch and lost interest. I kept watching through my boredom, and once it got to the games, I was so glad I didn't quit. This season was extremely edge of your seat, anxiety inducing, and emotional.\n\nI cried multiple times and became attached to some characters hoping that they would survive. Some scenes I quite literally had to skip through, because they gave me so much anxiety and heart racing anticipation I couldn't stand it... in a good way. I felt sick to my stomach at points and felt like I was almost there in the games. It was a great mix of fear, sadness, and desperation. The characters were developed with such personality.\n\nI was kind of disappointed at the cliff hanger and hoping for more soon. I can't say it was better than the first season because I felt like the first was interesting throughout and left such a lasting impact. But for a second season... I am pleased. I was a little confused about the story line but I think it's funny that the characters I ended up liking, became the main characters.\n\nThey did great with the development and action. They kept me guessing what was going to happen. I rate it an 8/10! It would be 10/10 for me, if the beginning was shortened a little and more to the point. It's amazing that a show and actors can cause you to genuinely feel for the characters and root for them and that's something I always look for in a show.\n\nWho was your favorite character(s)? Mine were #222, #120, #095, and the mother son duo. I liked #456's whole squad! ",

Like, we get it, dude. I swear, it seems like his material hasn't been interesting since he got the divorce and Frankie moved out, and I think plenty of people probably feel the same way also. And the crowd got annoying at times during the special too. Like almost ever word he said evoked an applause from the audience, and I think he got more cheers than laughs that night there were so many!",

If anything I wish there was more resolution to the shootas on the boat (knew it was the Captain immediately lol). But I am looking forward to seeing the third season! I like that it leaves you feeling a bit neurotic about what comes next. And I think it will age incredibly well. What an incredible job that this crew did! Also, visually very fun / horrifying to watch unfold. \nThe games appear extra cold, sterile and sinister. \n\nI really haven\u2019t seen editing this sharp since S6 of Sopranos. It\u2019s like a character in its own right. \n\nI am sure this season will hit a lot harder upon rewatches! I implore those of you somewhat dissatisfied to give it another try before this summer.",

I\u2019m wondering how it was for the people that have the Netflix plan with ads and if it was overkill. \n\nWhat\u2019s your thoughts on the advertisements on a paid platform?\n\nEdit: the title should say \u201cCommercials during RAW on Netflix\u201d. Autocorrect won this time. ",

How do I manage to download it without having to sideload? I don't want to install the APK and put my Netflix credentials on an untrustworthy APK found online. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It only happens on my PC, not on my girlfriends PC. \n\nThe buffering bar keeps resetting every 10/20 seconds, leading to the stream loading for a split second every time that happens.\n\nI've turned off every add-on I can, it's still happening. It's like this for at least a month now.\n\nCan anybody help me fix this?",
