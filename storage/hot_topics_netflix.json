        "content": "Hey everyone! Audio in movies not being great is at this point a well documented thing I believe. Yet it almost seems to be getting worse. I just watched *Extraction* on Netflix because someone recommended it to me. I mostly enjoyed the movie but the audio was so bad. Like there was an emotional scene between two characters but I couldn't understand a single word that one of them was saying. But then the explosions and gun shots are way louder. Sure, to a degree this can be used as a stylistic choice to make the violence more intimdating and such. However it can not be in the interest of the filmmakers that I, as a viewer, end up moving the volume up and down constantly depending if there are people talking or if there is fighting going on. Constantly.\n\nWhen are TV &amp; movie producers going to adress this problem? People have made videos about this on YouTube for years yet nothing is being done about it; what's up with that?",
