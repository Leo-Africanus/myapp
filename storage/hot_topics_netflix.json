I grew up in Philadelphia with a step dad who owned multiple successful restaurants in the city and Jake reminded me so much of him as he was in the early 2000s. Charming, charismatic, ambitious but underneath, stressed out, under pressure, and constantly worrying about money trying to keep up appearances. Even the staff brought back early memories of my life as a hostess/bartender at some of those restaurants/nightclubs. Very close, very tight knit, but riddled with drug use and drama, and overlooking major red flags. I really appreciated the effort they went through in giving the viewer a realistic representation of that world. ",

        "content": "Watched Coded Bias recently and it raised some serious concerns. The documentary dives into how facial recognition and AI systems aren\u2019t actually neutral at all. Because they\u2019re trained on flawed datasets, they end up making mistakes that disproportionately affect women and people of color.\n\nThe unsettling part is how widely this technology is already being deployed in policing, workplaces, schools, even housing, often without the public really knowing or having much of a say. If these systems are already showing bias, what happens when they become a permanent part of everyday life? AI is often framed as being smarter and more objective than humans, but if it\u2019s just reinforcing the same prejudices at scale, is it really progress? At what point do we step back and question whether some decisions, especially around law enforcement and surveillance, should even be left to algorithms at all, how do you trust it with your data? I personally don't let my info surface and try and remove it online, mainly using cloaked for overall security and temp mails and phone numbers. After watching the movie I even read that AI chats have a warning to not feed it real data (idk if that's true? so that's what sparked the use of those).\n\nFor  anyone who\u2019s seen it or works with AI, do you think these are just early flaws that can be fixed with better design and regulation, or are we headed toward a future where algorithms quietly shape more of our lives than we realize?",

        "content": "I just watched the movie\u2014probably late, but wow, that was fantastic. I went ballistic, rooting for complete genocide, and cheered like a maniac for Ashin all throughout her revenge.\n\nFYI: Those people weren\u2019t innocent. Some of the men had been raping her since she was young, while others completely turned a blind eye to what was happening.\n\nSeeing her kneel and beg them to avenge her family, only to discover that they were the very ones who caused her family\u2019s massacre, was brutal. And learning that her father had been tortured for years, with his limbs cut off, was even more heartbreaking.\n\nWhy is the life of Joseon\u2019s people considered more important than her village? They were loyal to Joseon, yet their loyalty was repaid with betrayal. The injustice of it all made my blood boil.\n\nI completely understand why she did what she did. Honestly, I would lose my mind too if it had happened to me.\n\nI\u2019m not usually a fan of series, but I ended up binge-watching Kingdom Season 1 and 2 because of this. The story, the suspense, the raw emotion\u2014it\u2019s all too gripping to ignore.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m still waiting for her to kill that bastard of a commander.\n\nSo\u2026 where is Season 3? I need answers!\n",

        "content": "So, can we talk about *Billionaires' Bunker*? I\u2019m kinda pissed about how it ended. I hate finales like that \u2013 they could\u2019ve at least given us one more episode. Obviously I went straight to Google to check if season 2 is coming.\n\nI *do* love this type of show \u2013 kind of a mix between *Fallout* and *Silo*, but with a melodrama twist. Still, I\u2019m torn. It got so over the top at times that it lost all sense of authenticity, and some of the relationships really started to bug me.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on Guillermo Falc\u00f3n and all his endless affairs\u2026 that got exhausting real fast.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to fully put my feelings into words yet, which is why I\u2019m curious what you all thought.",

All I can remember about the general premise is that a woman wanted a man who was married. She was wealthier and all I know the show was dark and mysterious \ud83d\udc80send help please. I can\u2019t remember if she hurt the wife or something but somehow he was manipulated into sleeping w her or something? \n",
