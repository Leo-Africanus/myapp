        "content": "Happy New Year everyone!\n\nI had some downtime these past few days and decided to binge a couple of Netflix series. One to see what the fuss was all about and an older one just because I like the actor who is in it.\n\nThe first series I watched was The Gentlemen. The first four episodes were okay but I told my wife I don't understand what the fuss is about. This isn't even close to being as good as Breaking Bad, Sopranos or Sons of Anarchy or even The Walking Dead (only because of the first four absolutely amazing seasons). It's not even as good as Yellowstone and I am not all that fond of it either. But at least it has moments of greatness. I told her unless it picks up I really don't know why people like it. \n\nI watched the next episode and was quickly eating my words. It really picked up and by the end of it I was like damn that was good. I would rank it better than Yellowstone but I still don't think it's as good as these other four shows. I hope season 2 ramps things up a notch too. I'm optimistic it will.\n\nThe other series I watched was Clickbait. I actually enjoyed this way more than I did The Gentlemen because it was engaging from the first episode until the last. I really thought I figured out by episode two who did it. I told my daughter it's quite commonly a pheriperal character and the character I suspected lined up with that notion. During episode 7 I was screaming \"Touchdown\" (as I was walking on my treadmill) because I thought my prediction was confirmed. Episode 8 proved me wrong and I am okay with that. It was a unique twist that I am sure very few would have suspected. \n\nAll in all they were both good series and I would recommend them to anyone who hasn't seen them.",
