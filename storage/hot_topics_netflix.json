        "content": "There\u2019s a part of the fandom that\u2019s using the argument that Stranger Things is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi, with fun cast and emotions, but this does not sit right with me at all. \n\nThe show not only has taken so long to finish, but has also been (I think?) Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

Her top lip is huge and barely moves and there\u2019s  minimal expression on her face due to Botox. Some dramatic scenes are ruined from the lack of movement &amp; expression in her face.\n\nOverall I\u2019m a little disappointed",

We watched Weapons on Crave immediately after and the quality was 1000% better. It was insane the difference. \n\nI remember during the Covid pandemic, they sent out a notice saying they were further compressing the streams to conserve bandwidth under high demand, but it\u2019s never come back. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the fence about even keeping my subscription, and I think this is the final straw.

        "title": "So we\u2019re just supposed to know Stranger Things lore from a stage play (The First Shadow) now?",
        "content": "I get that Stranger Things: The First Shadow (Broadway / West End) is meant to deepen the lore, but honestly it feels like it introduces major information that should not be locked behind a stage play that most fans will never see.\n\nThere are things in the show that already felt like loose threads, and now it turns out they are \u201cexplained\u201d in the play:\n\n1. Henry\u2019s cave memory in Season 5, where he\u2019s clearly interacting with / absorbing Mind Flayer-like particles. In the show, this is presented as something mysterious and significant\u2026 but never really followed up on in a satisfying way. Apparently the play adds context, but the series itself doesn\u2019t.\n\n2. The Oklahoma poster in Max\u2019s hand during one of Henry\u2019s memories strongly suggests Joyce, Hopper, and Henry all went to school together. That\u2019s a huge implication; yet across four seasons, Joyce and Hop never say a single word about knowing Henry Creel? Not even a hint?\n\n3. Henry\u2019s early connection to the Upside Down, Brenner\u2019s involvement, and the timeline of how everything starts are apparently much clearer in the play but on screen, it still feels incomplete or oddly rushed.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t expanded lore. It\u2019s that the main TV series feels like it\u2019s missing chapters unless you\u2019ve seen a West End/ Broadway show that:\n\nA. isn\u2019t accessible worldwide,\n\nB. isn\u2019t cheap,\n\nC. and won\u2019t be seen by the vast majority of viewers.\n\nAt this point, it feels like they should\u2019ve done a limited prequel season or special between Season 4 and 5 to properly set this up. Relying on a stage production to carry essential canon just makes Season 4 feel retroactively unfinished.\n\nWith only one episode left, I\u2019m worried the finale will have too much ground to cover, and that casual viewers will never even realize why certain things don\u2019t quite add up.\n\nEnd rant. Curious if this bugs anyone else or if I\u2019m just overthinking it. \n\n\nEdit: No, I\u2019m not saying anyone should fly to New York or London to see the play. Yes, the play exists, and the creators have stated it\u2019s important for understanding the show\u2019s ending. Yes, it might be addressed in the finale, and yes, I\u2019m waiting for the last episode. No, discussing a TV series on a TV subreddit isn\u2019t a \u201clife crisis\u201d or proof that I have nothing better to do; it\u2019s simply something I wanted to talk about.\n",

Ideally you'd think Thomas would be the kinda guy who would blow up the griever pods before escaping the facility. \n\n**3.** The plot change from books had great potential - that Thomas' antibodies had specifically evolved to destroy the virus - but they didn't explore this aspect at all in the climax.\n\n**4.** They never explained (science or medically) how Gally actually came back from the dead. And if they had to leave it so vague and unexplained, they could have easily used that same intentional vague technique to bring back Newt as well.\n\n**5.** So much emotional value and screen time was invested in Chuck's wooden souvenir, but they never provided closure to that aspect, Thomas never met his parents to hand it to them. Ideally it shouldn't have been even shown as a dying promise because logically speaking, how would he even know if his parents are even alive or dead given that there was a deadly virus pandemic out there?!\n\n**6.** Ava Paige says that the virus is airborne and no place on the planet is safe, so how does some island suddenly become safe haven for everyone in the climax of the movie?\n\n**7.** Dr. Mary dies. Ava Paige dies. And in the end even Teresa dies. The doctor with a goatee who was extracting serum from Minho was also sedated by Minho during his escape and the building was blown by the resistance shortly after, so I'm assuming that even he is dead, along with all other scientists in the building. So people who have the knowledge to create serum from Thomas' blood are all gone. So how will the world be cured?\n\n**8.** Speaking of which, the whole climax and ending is just left on a hopeless grim note. Newt is gone. The world is not cured. No closure to the audience on whether WICKED operations were shut down or not. After all the sacrifices, twists, betrayals, tears and blood, no happy ending to the plot and no hint of \"a better tomorrow\" scenario.\n\nThey could have done so much justice to an otherwise great plot.

        "content": "If you think about it, the Mind Flayer does seem like this looming, unstoppable force compared to Vecna. Vecna's powerful, sure, but the Mind Flayer feels like this bigger, more all-encompassing threat. It's not just one dude with crazy powers\u2014it\u2019s this force that controls the entire Upside Down.\n\nIf Vecna had been taken out earlier, leaving the Mind Flayer as the final big bad, it could\u2019ve made for an epic conclusion, especially with the whole \"creature from another dimension\" vibe. Plus, we\u2019ve seen so much of Vecna already and defeated him once, so a new, final enemy could've really upped the tension.\n\nThe final season could've had a nice twist if they just focused on the Mind Flayer and made it a true battle for survival. I think it would've given the show even more of a chaotic, \"can they even win?\" energy. What do you think peeps?\n\n\n",

Nope, gives me error E100 and tells me to use the app on the TV to watch.
