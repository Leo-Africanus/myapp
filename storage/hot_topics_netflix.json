It does this a few times then it starts me back at the beginning. I\u2019m guessing the entire event is over at this point. I\u2019m pissed. They have to do better. They have to make this right.

For context, I\u2019m on a 1-gig fiber connection, which is usually extremely reliable and rarely gives me any trouble. However, I\u2019ve found myself needing to refresh the stream on my PC several times to keep it running smoothly.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t a major issue for me personally, as refreshing on a computer is fairly quick and easy, I can\u2019t help but think about viewers at home who might be watching the stream on their TVs. For those individuals, I imagine it could be quite inconvenient to have to interrupt their viewing experience, potentially get up, and troubleshoot or restart the stream multiple times.\n\nI wanted to bring this up not only to see if others are encountering similar problems but also in case this might be an issue worth investigating further on the technical side. If there\u2019s a broader issue, it might be worth addressing sooner rather than later to ensure a seamless viewing experience for everyone.\n\nLooking forward to hearing if anyone else has noticed this or has insights to share.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Just wanted to invite a constructive discussion about the Netflix Fight night:\n\n- The obvious. The stream quality. I've watched many fights through bootleg links and the quality was 10x better than what we've seen tonight. Netflix is using the same servers that are used for their regular content. It's clear that there was oversight in this aspect and Netflix underestimated the shear demand of live streaming. They need to use dedicate servers for this!!!!\n\n- Rosie Perez and Cedric the Entertainer. Cedric's funny even though he stole Kat's joke. Cedric is absolutely unfit to be calling a damn boxing event. Cedric's HORRIBLE and provides no substance.  Snoop was waaaay more entertaining when he called Jakes fight some years ago. Rosie is bland and doesn't truly know boxing beyond her school fights. It's as of Netflix just wrote a check to someone who needed money.\n\n- Disorganization. While I found Serrano' manager's comments hilarious, it was a bit uncalled for from a professional perspective. It honestly showed how much of a shit show this was and it's all on Netflix. \n\n- Future subscriptions. There is no doubt Netflix will eventually add a tier for live streaming and it will be expensive as shit. Consider their contract with NFL, WWE, and their own shows. It will absolutely suck and cost you a premium.\n\nIt's clearly an event out on for casuals and that's fine but ffs don't cut corners. We pay good money already and I'm still pissed you raised the subscription from the 9.99 Netflix so you fucking owe us!!!",
