        "content": "Just watched this very moving and sad movie by Tyler Perry. The last scene shows Janiyah in the bank with the bank manager, and finally the FBI have turned her phone back on. She receives a call from her mother who is at home and the FBI are with her. She proceeds to tell Janiyah that her daughter has passed away. \n\nThis is followed by a series of what I assumed were flashbacks, but could have been hallucinations showing that she went to the school (because they asked her to come in) but the teacher tells her they didn\u2019t call her. She then turns to look for her daughter and the hallway is empty with no sign of her daughter. (Was that real or hallucination?!) \n\nAlso she turns to the bank manager to tell her the news, and the bank manager says she already knew because she had been informed earlier. \n\nSo my questions are; did Janiyah\u2019s daughter die a while back, hence causing her break down and the narrative about the school calling her in/ lunch money etc was a hallucination? Was the bank manager just playing along when she agreed to look after her daughter (in the event that Janiyah goes to jail)? \n\nOr did Janiyah\u2019s daughter actually die the night before the hold up at the bank, and losing her job etc etc\u2026  and she was not aware until that moment? \n\nJaniyah also hallucinates that the FBI throw a bomb into the bank and surround her and shoot her to death. But then back in reality she walks out with the bank manager in a state of trauma. \n\nThoughts? :-) any other views \u2026 ? ",

Kyla, Cal, Shane, Will, Dave,  new characters that will be main characters... really good development. \n\nBringing back side characters that were in Season 1 to reprise the role in season 2 was FANTASTIC. No Spoilers!!!  At least 3 primary side characters are back for season 2 with new side stories, like getting a \"Pontiac Bandit\" episode, I hope they continue it. \n\nReally good story development, already excited for Season 3. \n\n\nEpisodes had the same vibe as The Office jump from Season 1 to Season 2. \n\nIt is still very much \"guy humor\"... pussy jokes, and ragging on each other, sure.

Everyone has their personal favorites depending on what they value most: hard sci-fi, suspense, animation style, or raw emotion.\n\nBut Jibaro hits different. For me, it\u2019s one of the best modern folklore interpretations ever put on screen. It tells a deeply compelling, emotionally charged story \u2014 without a single word of dialogue \u2014 and still manages to feel more complete and immersive than most dialogue-heavy shorts. The animation is chaotic in the best way, the sound design is absolutely haunting, and the symbolism runs deep.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful, brutal, tragic, and strangely mesmerizing \u2014 a true S+ tier episode in my book. A masterclass in visual storytelling.\n\nCurious to know \u2014 where does Jibaro rank in your list?",
