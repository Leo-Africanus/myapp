Finally, we got to see the final battle and they even fought The Mind Flayer. It was really a movie-worthy spectacle. The songs they used were all bangers and there were surprisingly many of them when there was so few in the middle episodes. Overall one of the best episodes of Stranger Things and a GOOD ending, just what we wanted, not like so many other popular shows that decide to make it a bittersweet / bad ending that ultimately falls flat.  \n\nAlso, major bonus points for Joyce's arc this season. Winona Ryder and David Harbour completely knocked it out of the park.  \n\nA 10/10 episode and finale in an otherwise uneven season. \ud83d\udc4d",

I have heard all about the stage show, but literally none of the background lore of the how the wormhole was created, who that guy in the cave was and the artifact he had in the case, where it came from etc etc was touched on.\n\nAlso, the military and Dr Kay, just said oh well let's go home, no retaliation for the dozens of soldier deaths that can be pinned on Hopper, not to mention deep knowledge of government military secrets - they just let them go back to being a sheriff and no harm no foul? \n\nThere's about 30mins worth footage that should have explained all this...don't get me wrong, i really  liked how each of the characters bowed out, the older kids agree to meet regularly, the younger graduates rise out of the basement one by one ready to  face the future with optimism as the younger Holly generation take their place...even Ted Wheeler woke up from his coma and got to say one word but what happened to Murray! And Vickie, i take it she and Robin aren't together anymore?\n\nI need more information!!! \ud83d\ude29 i liked it, but i wanted more. I feel like only those who've seen the stage show fully know what everything was about and that's annoying for a tv watcher.\n\nPlease discuss and share your views on the finale!",

        "title": "Stranger Things - The Last Love Letter to the 80s",
        "content": "\nhttps://boxd.it/bS28Xj\n\nThe Last Love Letter to the 80s\n\nIn the distant year of 1983, on the night of November 6, an unforgettable situation happened. A situation that changed everything forever.\n\nWhen I think about Stranger Things, the very first thing that comes to my mind is the aftertaste left after watching it.\nI do not clearly remember why I started watching it, but I will never forget the impression it left on me.\n\nFar away, in 2018, when I was still a very young middle school teenager, I found out about the show called Stranger Things and immediately became intrigued by it.\nAs a young big fan of the 80s, of all that style, culture, music, vinyl records, and movies, I instantly understood that I had to watch it.\nI remember that before turning it on, I spent a long time choosing which dub I should watch it in.\nAt that time, I already understood English pretty nicely, yet still not enough to fully enjoy the content that came with it.\n\nDespite all the hesitation, I chose the one that suited my mood quite quickly and immediately began preparing myself for the journey into this wondrous atmospheric world.\n\nJust like the Duffer Brothers themselves, I was anticipating my entry into this entire universe.\nIf they spent years trying to figure out the right niche and a company ready to give them a budget and creative freedom for the creation of their series, then at the same time I was testing my own taste, trying to find my own niche in the world of cinema.\n\nTurning on the first episode, I was mesmerized and pressed myself to the computer screen, closely watching every moment happening on it.\nNot noticing the passing time, I suddenly found myself having finished the entire first season.\nIt stirred me up so much that it went deeply into my heart, making me feel as if Stranger Things spoke my language and was created especially for me.\nFeeling ownership over this creation, as if I had written it, thought it through, and filmed it myself.\n\nStranger Things is a series that crunches all the aspects people loved about the 80s into a new form.\nThe flawless, authentic atmosphere of those times is presented through this fantastic event filled plot.\nCostumes and scenery are filled with tables, armchairs, and all kinds of art attributes from the 80s.\nPeople with their funny hairstyles and hobbies that fit that era.\nThe creators relied on human emotions that appeared in the series through their memories of the 80s and the culture of that time.\nThis series does not just convey the spirit of the 80s. It lives with the cultural identity of that era, with music and an atmospheric original soundtrack written specifically for the series.\nAnd of course, cinematic tricks from all the old movies they took inspiration from. After that, with their help, they found their own cinematic language, which turned into an individual mix, a representation of the 80s, Stranger Things.\n\nHaving felt all of this, in complete joy, I could not let go of this series for months.\nAfter finishing the first season, I immediately moved on to the second.\nAfter finishing the second as well, I went to school and immediately started talking so much about this amazing show to anyone I could see or smell near me.\nFrom my classmates to the class teacher, who was surprised that I also watched this series.\nThose kids whom I studied with in 2018 did not really know about this series.\nI remember that constantly talking about it ended with the fact that many people simply came up to me and said that they had watched it and liked it a lot.\nAnd I, as a proud person, felt that I had fulfilled my mission by passing my cinematic love on to other people, so that they too could feel what I felt.\n\nSince then, many years have passed.\nThe third and fourth seasons came out.\nAnd here we are now, finally having our last fifth season coming out.\n\nEach of them, in some way, repeats or renews its cinematic rhetoric in its own manner.\nBut despite this, the core of the story and its meaning always remained the same. A love letter to the 80s, to the culture of those years, and of course to their specific atmosphere.\n\nThe plot is based on a group of kids who meet a nameless girl, who at first appears to them as Eleven.\nEleven has strong telepathic abilities. Almost a superhero.\nShe is alive, strong, but still a small tiny kid, with emotions like any other child.\n\nNone of those kids knew what awaited them in their near future.\nEspecially if we compare the first and the last seasons.\n\nThat intimate mysterious story in the first season lays the foundation of this whole world, forcing those children to unite not only with each other, but also with the people around them, with whom they become one big team, a family.\nEven if they were not familiar with each other, circumstances forced them to be together in order to fight until the end, despite the deadly nature of the situation ahead.\n\nThis, by the way, is probably one of my favorite cinematic techniques in general.\nWhen different people, who have nothing to do with each other, enter a web like situational story.\nA story where every step, like dominoes, falls and creates a chain of events.\nA chain of random people who, due to different circumstances, end up in different situations.\nSituations that, in the end, lead to the main event, after which they realize that all this time they were looking for each other, knowing or not knowing each other.\nAfter understanding all this, they take every step of theirs, combine it, and become not a blood family, but a spiritual true one, ready to fight together no matter what.\nIt does not matter if they are young or adults, nerds or school kings, here they are together, here they are ready to fight for each other, all for one, and one for all.\n\nThis technique generally is what forms this entire story.\nWithout this technique, nothing would exist here and nothing would happen.\nThese are the fundamental foundations of this world we know as Stranger Things.\nI really love when cinema unites the destinies of different strangers, creating a single whole.\nA whole that becomes dearer and dearer with every passing moment.\n\nWhat is also interesting is how, with every season, these techniques expand, creating new events and situations.\nYes, in some places the situations may seem too cinematic and unrealistic, but this series is not just another disposable teenage product.\nIt is a world that is mostly carefully written out and thought through from the beginning to the end.\nA world whose plot is explained and becomes clearer closer to the finale.\nWith each new season, new partnerships are created.\nThe creators constantly try to mix existing characters with others, trying to create and present to us new connections, new friendships, and of course new tempting sequences.\n\nThe first season is a story that feels intimate, yet its scale slightly awakens, creating a certain intimate indie atmospheric label which, although it stays within its boundaries, hints at future events that might be born.\n\nThe second season, in some sense, remains intimate and atmospheric, but now expands its boundaries, giving a sense of scale.\n\nThe third season slightly moves away from this intimacy, entering the phase of a blockbuster that resembles the very summer movies that were shown in theaters in the 80s, adding more brightness and, as I might say, more silly humoristic points to the entire season.\n\nThe fourth season returns to the darkness of the first two, leaving the element of a blockbuster in its place with all the drama inherent in big pictures.\n\nThe fifth season massively returns to the core roots, rephrasing the origins of the series into something bigger and final.\nTo be honest, the preview of the first episode awakened a strange feeling in me, as if all of this was just unreal, or like a fan version of what the fifth season could have been.\nFor me, this feeling is absolutely understandable.\nAfter all, so many years passed since the last season. Some actors grew up a lot, some were replaced and added.\nYou understand to yourself that watching the finale of a series you grew up with is not quite a familiar experience, because you do not always expect to accept that time flies and everything changes with it.\n\nThe fifth season does not try to stretch itself out or slowly introduce itself.\nIt immediately jumps into the course of events, showing us that this is the end of everything, the beginning of the end of the entire story.\n\nPossibly due to this, at the beginning there was a slight feeling that all of this was fictitious.\nWe had not yet gotten used to it, and we immediately began to feel and see the events.\nYou immediately enter this story and comprehend the fruits of the upcoming, which may hint at what could be in the final battle.\n\nIn the fifth season, our characters are already adults, yet we still see them as those young children who, just like on the very first day of their participation in these events, are ready to fight virtuously for the last time.\nA time to place all the dots over the i, giving, though delayed, a deserved finale.\nLarge scale, dramatic, and with its own highlight, inherent to all the characters and to the atmosphere of the eighties.\n\nAt first, when I saw the fast pace of the first half of the season, as I said earlier, I did not fully believe that I was watching the final season.\nHowever, while watching the first part of the fifth season, I realized that in front of us was an outstanding beginning that was building up its momentum quite well.\n\nThen the second part of the fifth season was released.\nAnd yes, I may have expected more from it.\nPerhaps I would have written some moments differently, added a bit more screen time, and would not have been afraid to answer or expand on the mythology of the Stranger Things world more actively.\nAt times, it felt as if the overall atmosphere and the main narrative of the series were slightly forgotten.\nStill, overall, it is not a bad part at all.\nIn some moments, it is weaker than other parts of the show, but even so, it is not bad and gives us the opportunity to enter the finale.\n\nAfter some time, the long awaited finale was released.\nI do not want to speak briefly about it, because this is a two hour episode which, in conclusion, is executed as a whole feature movie, and gave me a lot to remember.\n\nThe final eighth episode of the series was released separately.\nAnd I fully understand why.\nYou will understand it as well when you watch it.\n\nA large scale picture, shot with a fast but moderate pace, placing and showing the parts of the overall story that were meant to be closed there.\nFor the last time, we move with the characters, see everything that is happening, and see their confrontation with evil for one last time.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers chose a logical narrative line to end the show.\nThe idea and setup are rather predictable, but that does not mean it is terrible.\nOn the contrary, it is definitely calm and good.\nYes, this is a predictable finale, yet, on the other hand, I understand the position of the Duffer Brothers.\nA story that they built for years cannot fail at the end.\nVery few people would want or know how to risk giving unreliable or possibly unsuccessful ideas to such a story.\n\nThe large scale final battle was, of course, massive and entertaining.\nPredictable, yet cool.\nA saturated clash of the heroes against everyone who stands against them.\n\nHowever, then comes the moment when the battle ends.\nAnd it seems that everything is over.\nThere is nothing left.\nHow do you continue the scenario and the rest of the episode from here?\nYou know what? The epilogue.\n\nThe epilogue that we received in the final forty minutes is what brought back the warmth and memories of past seasons.\nI am sure the same will happen to you. After you watch those forty minutes, the realization will come by itself.\n\nIn this epilogue, we finally got the opportunity to see the characters as we first met them.\nPeople with their own lives, inner warmth, kindness, love.\nWe got the chance to see how warmly and kindly they continue to live, no matter what.\nHow their lives change, and how we, the viewers, just like the characters, will also change.\n\nThe epilogue returns us to that feeling of intimacy, like a couch that feels warm and comfortable to sit on.\nWe return to the origins, not to a blockbuster, but to the story of ordinary children and people who made Stranger Things so harmless and heartfelt, despite everything that happened.\n\nWe received an episode that has a logical ending, which may seem ordinary and unremarkable to some.\nBut that is exactly the essence of Stranger Things.\nWe live and experience the fate of ordinary, at first glance unremarkable people.\nPeople who simply want to continue living and doing what they love, with emotions, actions, and reflection.\nA very good episode that, by the end, returns us to what we were missing so much.\nA correct and good return to where everything began.\nTo sincerity, which is what we always came back for.\n\nOne thing I will always repeat for sure, no matter what each season is like.\nStranger Things never forgets that it is firstly a story about friendship, about connection with people, about being ready to help each other.\n\nNo matter how you turn it, whether it is good or bad, I will always know that it will be one of my most beloved shows.\nThe one that has a place in my heart.\nWatching this grand finale is not so much sad as it is a nostalgic reminder of such a long journey.\n\nA journey that I and others went through, how we, still being children, grew up together with the characters and actors of this story.\nWatching how the fate of this entire story, which was built for years, comes to an end is joyful.\nEven though it might be sad to see the end of some characters, I am glad for this ending.\nYou see, it is made with love, giving us, the viewers, a deserved and truthful finale.\nA finale that shows that not everything in our life is smooth.\nAnd even so, this smoothness is not necessary in order to defeat evil.\nBecause when you have people who fight for you, for your sake, and you do the same for them, any evil can be overcome.\nConnection, love, honor, and friendship are what make us human.\nSupporting each other, no matter who we are and how we are.\nAll we must do is just be together through water and fire.\n\nI will always remember this series, and I am sure that we will still meet again someday.\nIt was cool, it was good, it was atmospheric and super nostalgic, as if I myself had grown up in that 80s era.\nThis atmosphere settled so deeply in my soul that I feel like I should have been there myself at least once.\nEven though this is impossible, I still found a way to feel and touch the world of the 80s.\nAll of this is thanks to Stranger Things.\n\nSo strange, yet so atmospheric, so beloved and respected, with its laughter, sadness, darkness, brightness, and of course the moral of the whole story.\n\nAs much as I may not want to say this, I have to.\nLife goes on.\nJust like our heroes were able to continue living, so must we, people, in our difficult and heavy world.\nLive and fight without thinking about the end.\nBecause the end begins and ends only in our head, and life will go on as long as we still believe in it.\n\nStranger Things is still the first and, so far, the only series that I have proudly watched twice, even making my family watch it here and there.\nA kind of tradition that will absolutely stay with me.\n\nWho knows, maybe somewhere far beyond the horizon we will meet this world again.\n\nFor now, I wish everyone great and strange events in their lives, yet as mesmerizing and intriguing as the show was.\nSo that we live, value those close to us, and create our own reality with kindness, achieving all our goals, no matter how heavy and large scale they may seem.\n\nIt was an incredible opportunity to ride this bike together with you.\nA bike that went so far, yet did so with such warmth and care.\n\nThe End.",

The performance just doesn\u2019t feel convincing anymore. The delivery comes across flat, the emotional moments feel awkward, and the character seems like she aged years off screen without the story addressing it. Funny how the show is called Stranger Things, because Millie Bobby Brown becoming unrecognizable in this role was not on my bingo card. Am I the only one who feels this way?",
