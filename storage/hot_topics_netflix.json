But because her mom works for the White House she\u2019s able to make a call and the CIA is just giving a civilian intel on an operation? Then she follows him all the way to Germany just to tell him he\u2019s moving out??? What a wasste of a character. Absolutely enraging. \n\nOne of the worst characters I\u2019ve ever watched.
