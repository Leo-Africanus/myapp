He must have one hell of an agent - he is the star in half the movies on Netflix. \n\nAlso, Chris Pratt is not a good voice actor. I wanted to watch the new Garfield movie but can't tolerate his voice acting. \n\nBoth Wahlberg and Pratt are better off in ensemble casts - they're not interesting enough on their own.  ",

        "content": "The diplomat is my favorite show on Netflix and it's 6 ep run was way to short compared to it's 8 ep first season which also felt to short. As well as the excellent new show Territory was only 6 eps. I was also looking ahead and 2 shows I'm insanely excited for Black Doves and American Primevil are also going to be only 6 eps. It's insane that every few years it feels like they push the ep count lower. Which is extra crazy because they count shows on minutes watched which basically sets new shows up to fail and is the reason we have no new shows.",

They have a sorting of \"Because you liked....\" and do the same thing. I sometimes wonder if they are trying to justify bad shows they have put on the site by pushing people to watch them. Honestly Netflix, when I say I don't like it I really meant I don't like it. I will bend over backwards to not do a thumbs down on a show. Do others notice this or am I just too difficult to profile?",

Therefore is there a list that shows specifically what available in Netflix Spain? \n\n\nThank you.\n",
