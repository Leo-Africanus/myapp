        "content": "okay, in the beginning, i totally loved Brad. I thought he was such a cutie young lawyer who was sincerely interested in Alex's case and helping her with her inheritance. He seemed like a trusted person who he valued her moms wishes for her. HOWEVER.\n\nNina, his girlfriend, was so wonderful and sweet. And the whole time Brad had to play BFF'S with Alex and get WAY too close to her for no reason. I didn't understand why he was so bent on entertaining Alex so much and becoming too friendly with her. She was his client. And he had a great girlfriend (who he seemed like he loved).\n\nAlso the fact that Alex showed no respect for Nina. And how she showed very little remorse for being the reason that Brad could have cheated. \n\nSo no, I was never rooting for Alex and Brad. Though I get why Alex would like him -- he's wonderful, cute, successful, kind, and somehow intertwined with her mom's passing.\n\n\n\nI really saw potential for this plot and film. I thought everything her mother said about Alex was true when the film started. That Alex was not truly living her fullest life for some reason. And I think bringing out 'The List' was a wonderful idea. It was poignant, touching, and sweet everything that her mom articulated about what her daughter may not able to see for herself, or ignoring.\n\nHowever, I think that having it become a thing, of now Alex has to go out and achieve every single goal in order to receive her inheritance and videos of her mom pretty strange, and rigid.\n\nPointing out 'The List' was a great thing to do. But not to make Alex go out and do them for a goal. She has to find it in herself, in her time, to do those things. Not for someone else, like a little checklist. But yes, to give a nice acknowledgement and nudge to Alex- I like. I feel like acknowledging 'The List'  was supposed to be about giving a general outline of things that may bring meaning to Alex's life, who seems lost at the time.\n\n  \nI know this was based off a book, and to be fair it was a cute book idea. But seeing it visually made me realize, that some of these things would not be great in real life. just my thoughts. what are your thoughts on the movie?",
