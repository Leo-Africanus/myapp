It seems clear she came into his life to steal these kids and he was catching onto it. Those recordings just proved that. She was purposely going against what he asked and wanted constantly. He called her out. And she played dumb and innocent. He even said in the recording that she was trying to separate him from his kids. He was \ud83d\udcaf percent correct on this. \n\nI can't believe the two of them were even in this documentary. Unless every person who watches it gets that same disgusting reaction to her that I do, then maybe this helps more in the court of public opinion.\n\nI still have 26 min left. I just can't believe they won an appeal. ",

        "content": "Okay just finished this show: even though it\u2019s trash reality, surprised how some of the characters grew on me ? Some of these people are definitely characters\n\n1.\t\u2060Kelsey and Colt is how imagine Hailey Bieber was like with Justin Beiber irl with his on and off vibe w Selena. Girl is not a girls girls and was willing to be second choice/ be the at the back burner knowing he was messing with someone else, lack of self respect on both Angelique and Kelsey. I liked how Nicole v and Avery handled the Manny situation when they realized they were being played, even though things worked out w Manny and Avery later on it was still much more dignified and considerate of all parties involved and those two were girls girl through and through. She is like 23 and Cole is 31 so I\u2019ll give her brownie points for being young and naive .\n2.\t\u2060Angelique way too possessive/ invested way too soon ignoring the red flags through and through. She does seem to have repressed trauma with that sort of thing, so I hope she heals if she really wants a real commitment. I see a bit of myself in her in previous relationships, it\u2019s like u wanna project ur potential of the relationship or of the person and try to control the narrative, but ultimately u gotta see things for what it is and not project through rose colored emotional glasses. It\u2019s a cannon event\n3.\t\u2060Cole is actually such an airhead?? Everything this man says is so dumb same with Brandon? These men literally have no personality, depth to discipline to be  actual relationship material. They truly are classics sneaky link surface level fling sort of dudes that seem to have stunted their growth. How is Cole like 31 but gives the vibe, intelligence and maturity of like a literal 18 year old. How does anyone find that to be remotely intellectually stimulating or attractive. Again good for a fuck but to be thinking of building a future w men like this you\u2019d losing ur mind like Angelique was trying to be. The lack of control when it comes to lust and being so easily swayed also, just icky. It\u2019s honestly like watching highschoolers but it\u2019s crazy how so many men are actually like this. Ageing but not really. Brandon seemed like he was trying to come around in the end, but it felt performative so he doesn\u2019t get booted off the show. He has wandering eyes and I just see him going through his roster in real life and some highkey commitment issues due to his parents marriages.\n4.\t\u2060Kesley was one of my favs, she seemed very party girl chaotic energy at first but girl has genuine depth to her and smarter than she seemed. Stood on business and I love that for her. She was playful, classy and nice and was not doing Angelique like things when she peeped Brandon\u2019s red flags. Loved that for her.\n5.\t\u2060Loved Nicole V. Girl knows what she wants and u gotta respect her for handling herself with class and being honest. Nicole S. Was also just being real and I think girlie found a real man irl so happy for her. Zoe was a girls girl through and through handled all the situations with sm respect. Loved Avery such a genuine sweet girl through and through.\n6.\t\u2060Idk if I fw Manny he still seems performative and the way he treated samira in the end was super harsh  and cold, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he does the same to Avery, which would be sad because she is truly the sweetest girl on the show.\n7.\t\u2060hot take but I think Zoe should\u2019ve chosen Corinthian he\u2019s the only dude that seemed like a gentleman, like Travis was cool and all but did he even tell her he was making moves w Nicole S. on the low early on? I feel like Zoe and Corinthian had a fresh start and it seemed like Travis got possessive / competitive out of nowhere when he saw another man interested in her.\n8.\t\u2060Lulu and colt could\u2019ve had some potential/ fresh start  since he already made a mess going back and forth w Angelique and Kelsey and disrespected them both. But either way girl dodged a bullet and she\u2019s a whole decade younger. I just see a whole lot of lust on the show not too many genuine connections but that\u2019s reality tv.\n9.\t\u2060Colts mom instant ick. Girl teach ur son to be modest and heal or grow some brain cells.\n10.\t\u2060I do think Manny and Avery\u2019s moms were both super sweet and supportive that was wholesome\n11.\t\u2060i thought Logan would get jumped at but surprisingly no one did, im guessing he\u2019s either not that well off or emotionally closed off that\u2019s why no one did? Just a guess. He did seem like he had red flags for how he got with Nicole. I\u2019m happy for their friendship and I guess he was genuine. That long haired dude. He had an interesting sense of humor but definitely a hard no. It just gives dating up sneaky link sort of personality fr. That basketball player guy was just there I guess",

It's still unsolved, but the wild part is they got James Lewis, the only official suspect for decades, to finally talk on camera before he died. He was never charged for the murders, but did serve time for sending a ransom letter. He had refused every major interview, but he agreed to do this one. They gave him the space to talk about his side of the story.\n\nIt is sooo strange how no one thought about approaching him like this before. And if they did, why didn't he talk? It's so bizzare. ",
