        "title": "The Residence could had been much better!!",
        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging.   \n  \nEdit: Surprised it got Emmy nomination.",

They canceled it, apparently because they couldn\u2019t afford it, even though the show brought in huge viewership numbers. Make it make sense. So many unresolved storylines, it felt like they just walked off set mid-scene. I genuinely hope now that Netflix has picked it up, a 4th season is in the works. It deserves one. We deserve one. I\u2019m honestly kind of mad about it.\n\nNow maybe this is a dumb question, but it\u2019s been bugging me: why did the show seem more focused on who killed Jorge  than on Frankie himself\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, was a full-blown murderer? He\u2019s out of prison again and somehow they still couldn\u2019t charge him with anything? That was beyond frustrating. I get that the writers probably wanted to push Ray to kill him in the end, but still\u2014it felt like everyone was just shrugging off Frankie\u2019s entire rap sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a great show, but man, that ending left me with more questions than closure.",

But today, we're both experiencing the weirdest thing. I tried to create a session, but the link is noticeably shorter than usual and doesn't include the show title in it. I thought that would be fine, but when she opened the link, it just played on its own and refuses to sync. Then she tried to create the session, but the same thing happened to her too.\n\nIt's so weird because it shows in the chat log whenever one of us joins or pauses/plays and whatnot, but it's playing two separate instances. If I play, it's still paused for her, and vice versa. It's refusing to sync, and this has never happened before until today. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a possible fix, or maybe it'll just randomly fix itself after a time? Thanks.",

If Rumi exists, that means that it's possible for demons to be free of Gwi-Ma. Maybe that's what her mom was working on, but them something went wrong and she died. But maybe Rumi can finish her mom's work and figure out how all demons can have a chance at getting their souls back and being free. It would be cool for a sequel to do that kind of \"moral circle expansion\" where people realize that some demons should have a chance too. But I guess it's too progressive... in the movie the general public doesn't know about demons at all.",

But unfortunately that surprising revelation doesn't explain any of the previous hints. So there is no 'a-ha moment' type of satisfaction.

She expects to live on a British estate and have a very \u201cBritish\u201d experience. \n\nThe ending is supposed to feel sort of rushed and nonsensical in an inside joke sort of way. Because if you love period era books and film adaptations, it\u2019s sort of an inside joke that EVERY story has to end with the main character getting married. (It\u2019s even a joke in 2019\u2019s Little Women.) \n\nSo at the very end where they flash to her and Felix dressed in period era costumes (at their wedding), it\u2019s an homage to the ending of Sense &amp; Sensibility where Marianne Dashwood and Colonel Brandon get married.

Using Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D to check the drm it always shows Widevine, no matter if I'm watching a show like stranger things or a movie like oppenheimer. For oppenheimer specifically the resolution is 960x540, even worse than what I get usually",

        "content": "I've developed a bit of a prejudice against the shows and movies that netflix makes and I'd like to try and challenge that thought. \n\nI think partially I'm just annoyed that they're constantly pushing them on you, It feels like 70 percent of the things they suggest are their own shows and movies. The other element though is that many of the things I've seen seemed very bland and unoriginal in a similar way to eachother. Like the cinematography and color grading felt like they were done by the same people or something. I've almost come to think of them as slightly more polished lifetime, made-for-tv movies. \n\nBut since there are so darn many of them, and they're most of what I see on the platform, I feel like I should maybe give them a shot if I'm going to keep paying for the service. \n\nCan anyone suggest some genuinely great Netflix originals that might change my mind about their content? Also, I'd like to hear from any lovers of Netflixes original content and listen to their perspective on why they like it. \n\nThanks!",
