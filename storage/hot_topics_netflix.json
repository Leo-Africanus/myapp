When I switched back to Norwegian with subtitles, the actors' mouths and teeth looked VERY different.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be an option to turn this \"feature\" off... Netflix, if you're listening, please add the option to remove this cuz it's just extremely off-putting... we already lose a ton of emotion and context with dubs, but at least the physicality of an actor's face would make up for it somewhat. But now... we've even lost those minute facial expressions from actors with this terrible AI replacement feature... please make it an option and not a forced (bug) feature.",

The player defaults to 1920x1080 and needs a bit of \"scrubbing\" for the 3840x2160 resolution to kick in.\n\n2. HDR seems to be completely broken. At first glance, it doesn't seem to work at all even though the debug window says it is working (tested with Arcane and One Piece live action). By sheer luck I managed to observe that in some very specific cases (credits and pictures) the static video content weirdly renders correctly in HDR.\n\ne.g. HDR works here: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81014625](https://www.netflix.com/title/81014625)\n\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nFYI I have a Premium (sky) subscription and I live in Italy if this info helps at all.",

        "content": "I have ended up not watching quite a number of shows and films on Netflix where they have more than one language but only bother to include translated text as part of the audio description subtitles. I can't get past the (to me) incredibly distracting text lined of, for example, \"a door slams shut\" that is constantly on screen when I only need a few lines of text to translate foreign dialogue.  \n\nApple handle this very elegantly by having an option for subtitles only for foreign language dialogue (and it uses the main chosen dialogue for the app to be default and all other languages to be classed as foreign and thus get shown on screen). It's the work of a couple hours to code in subtitle tracks like this so please adopt it - and it really is minor work as Netflix carries subtitles for a ton of languages so it should be easy to strip out the relevant parts into standalone foreign dialogue tracks(*)\n\nAlso, I only just noticed this week in the apple TV app, you can select subtitles to appear in your own language then you rewind between 10 and 30 seconds. So that garbled line you missed? Easy, rewind to try and listen again AND have it come up as subtitles. It's such a great feature given how so many modern programmes have very low dialogue levels (I already use dialogue boost on my app but that still doesn't help sometimes).\n\n(* - I've seen people say before on this subject \"What's so hard about having subtitles on all the time\" or \"why don't you just put subtitles on when the foreign language bits come on?\". I'm amazed at what a shit level of service they have come to expect to think like that. These programmes have cost significant money to make, to obtain the rights to, to stream, yet Netflix can't be arsed to spend a day or two creating foreign language subtitle tracks that will benefit thousands to millions of streamers. It's not a free service so why shouldn't they do it?  I watch the programmes to be entertained, to lose myself in for an hour or 2. Every time I have to rewind to turn subtitles on the immersion is broken. It's an easy fix to an annoying issue. It's not just Netflix but they are easily the worst offenders for this).",

        "content": "Hi all, let me explain the situation I'm currently facing. I had recently traveled on holiday for a few days and used Netflix while traveling. Upon returning to my home country, after a day or so, my continued watching tab just disappeared. When I search for the shows I am watching, they do not appear. I have logged out and back in again, but the issue persists.\n\nI have changed browsers, same problem. I restarted my computer, same problem. I restarted my router, same problem.\n\nI contacted Netflix support, they said it could be due to using a proxy (which I wasn't and never have while using Netflix)&gt; I told them that wasn't the case and I was travelling. They said that I can't use Netflix while traveling (funny response, I've used Netflix while travelling for YEARS, and never had an issue).\n\nWhen I switch to a different profile on the account, everything is fine, and the shows that I couldn't search on a different profile appear! I had told Netflix Support that it seems like Netflix is targeting my profile in the account /specifically/, and I have no clue why.\n\nThey had told me to contact my ISP to reset my IP address. I did that, the issue did not resolve. We have multiple networks at home, I've connected to all of them and STILL nothing solved the issue.\n\nFunnily enough, whenever I connect my laptop to roaming data, everything functions fine. Is my profile just a lost cause? I don't wanna start a new profile from scratch again and lose all the progress I have on the shows I've watched. I like the way my Netflix homepage has curated my account. I really don't want to lose that.\n\nDoes anyone have any guidance/faced a similar issue before?",

I\u2019m seriously considering canceling my subscriptions to these streaming platforms because I\u2019m seriously becoming annoyed with how much of a scam this is becoming.",

        "content": "I have messaged netflix support on this too, unfortunatly it did not help.\n\nThe quality on watching a movie or show on computer is insanely bad.   \nQuality on TV, phone works great, except on PC. I dont understand why? [fast.com](http://fast.com) says i have 960mbps internet. My PC is up-to-date and high spec. There should be no reason for it to be 480p(ish) \n\nYoutube allows me to play 4k video with no problems, why is it only netflix. Stupid company",

        "content": "OK, I know this kinda goes against what Netflix does these days, kinda. But with all the series they've cancelled recently (Kaos, MindHunter, Sense8, the OA, Luke Cage etc etc etc) they should just focus on making these high concept ideas into feature length movies - the way entertainment used to be. Then... If it went well, make a sequel!   \n  \nAnyone from Netflix read this sub? Cos this seems like the obvious fix to me...",
