I felt that the real interest was in Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis' characters. Their chemistry was amazing and I wanted to see more! Her and his backstory, ,  how this cult started, who was the first wife, \"hey hey\"? Josh Segarra's character? Like wtf is that about? There is soooo much more to unpack here that is bigger than this storyline! PLEASE MAKE A PREQUEL  or a spinoff with Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis!.  So many questions unanswered!",

And the prosecutors was presenting is as if Janson had strangled her, with no marks on her neck. It's crazy because strangulation can be seen on the outside and not be seen on the outside but have a full on  impact from inside the neck. But what makes this whole case a mystery is that Tom ( the father) and Molly hade bearly any scratches or woundes on them. But parts of Jansons brain was out. If Molly really had been struggled there would have been injuries from inside the neck.He was much bigger and stronger. \n\n I don't believe ether that she was unconscious. Every woman pees while being nervous or it's something she looked up for her story.   \n\nI believe that it was all pre planned. She read about the first wife and made up a story that would fit. Intoxicated him weak and begun hitting him with the bat. Then shouted out so that the father could come up and help her finish the story. Why was there a whole brick in their bedroom?  And why was it so easy for the to hit him with it? Why was blood splattered on the backside of the door ? Was  Mollys mother on the other side the door, preventing him from running out? \n\nIf Tom was there while Janson was alive... he could have them stop the altercation and calm things down, run or even right then call 911 ? \n\nNOOOO ! Tom was an ex FBI agent. He knew how to save his daughter and work around the crime she hade committed. Tom was educating students on investigation after his job at FBI.  \n\nI feel sorry for them kids. Me, myself and I have also been manipulated as a child and used as a spokes person. I understand.

It barely had time to breathe before Netflix pulled the plug.\n\nThis is exactly why people are losing faith in Netflix. You finally make something with original IP, solid cast, great atmosphere, smart writing, and instead of giving it time to grow, you kill it off faster than a ghost hunt in episode one.\n\nMeanwhile, the most mind-numbing reality shows get renewed before the first season even finishes airing. Why? Because they\u2019re cheap and easy and someone in a boardroom thinks short-term numbers matter more than actual storytelling.\n\nPeople keep asking why fans don\u2019t get invested anymore. This is why. You give us something promising, with real potential, then yank it away like it never mattered.\n\nLockwood and Co deserved better. The actors deserved better. And honestly, the fans who actually stuck around and told people to watch it deserved better too.\n\nSo yeah, maybe it didn\u2019t bring in Stranger Things numbers overnight, but maybe if you let your shows breathe instead of canceling everything that isn\u2019t a viral hit in 24 hours, you\u2019d have more to show for it.\n\nNetflix is out here ghosting its own content.

Was Cupcake really the only compromised one? Did Serena just get over her dad dying and Nico being her step dad? The DA was shot in the head and nbgaf? Logan, his brother and the governor's wife crash a plane and we can't see the aftermath? I know they live happily ever after, with a picnic in the forest they all almost died in but come on. \n\nEDIT: I know the whole fate thing, somebody had to die for one to live but HELLA people died.

        "title": "Why I think K-pop Demon Hunters could have been soooo much better",
        "content": "I think there was so much potential but they honestly fumbled so bad. at first I thought i really liked it but the more i think about it, the more i feel like i just liked the idea of it. The animation and music was awesome but i feel like it was rushed and it didn't have as much of an impact as it could have. And don't get me wrong it was still good and enjoyable but i think it genuinly had the potential to be like insanly perfectly awesome.\n\nMy reasons and how they could have fixed it:\n\n1.) The rest of the Saja boys had literally no personality, its unrealistic that Jinu was the only demon with a backstory and personality. It would have been so much more fun to see and connect to all the boys, i wanted to love them but they were practically background characters. It would have been a lot more emotional to see them die if they had actually seemed like real people who had emotions, instead of just zombies.\n\n2.) Rumi and Jinu's romance thingy was so weird and the chemistry was definetly there but we saw so little of it. Again it just felt rushed, they barely met and then all of a sudden they were singing some love song about how being with each other was so freeing and how no one else sees them like they do. I can't imagine who's dumb idea it was to take out the aquarium date and kiss, it wouldn't have fixed everything but they seriously needed a few more quite romantic moments.\n\n3.) Rumi's reaction after Jinu's death seemed so like unemotional. Like she was more upset when she found out that Juni had betrayed her than when he literally died to save her. She shed like 3 individual tears and then started smiling and hugging her friends. That scene honestly ruined everything that they had for me, because it made it seem like she didn't care. The emotion before he died, was fairly on point but after he died it just seemed to completely ignore the fact that the boy who she supposedly loved had just died. I mean I've lost people I love before and it has taken months if not years to heal, and they hadn't even died they just left me.\n\n4.)The actual villain (whats his face, the fire dude) was just sooo boring, like he had no personality the fire persona was eh, honestly pretty bad. It wasn't scary and it wasn't unique or iconic. I mean i looveee a good iconic villain, just a good character design will take it a long way. I mean, take HTTYD as an example, Drago, Grimmel, and even Viggo, they all had unique character design and complex personalities. And i think there would have been soooo many possibilities to make the demon lord dude have an epic design, like hes a demon lord they did awesome with Jinus demon design i don't know why they started slacking off with the fire dude.\n\n5.) Why did Jinu and the other boy band member look and act differently than all the other demons? I feel like all the other demons were literally just ugly zombies who couldn't talk and then you have Jinu who isn't said to have anything special about him whos hawt and talks quite a lot and is capable of emotion. It's inconsistent and it feels lazy.\n\n6.) Mystery and Romance's hair to face proportion bothered me, like why is their head so big? Idk I didn't like it.\n\n7.) Also why could the Saja boys hide their marks but Rumi couldn't?\n\nI have a lot more i could say and suggestions on how they could have made it better but i've already written a lot and doubt anyone will even read this much. Anyways i think we were robbed of a really amazing, complex story that would have been much better as a series than it was a movie. So if netflix actual reads these and needs help making the next movie amazing, because there is going to be another movie obviously, then like ask for a few teenager to read the script, look at the character designs, and watch it before you release it. Try to find some that are really judgy and good writers, Ao3 is a great place to find em, i also volunteer.\n\nAlso was i the only person who was reminded of Zuko and Katara by Jinu and Rumi?",

But the part that goes \"I'm done hidin, now im shining...\" always itched my brain because it sounded soooo familiar to something! And then yesterday my brain decided to sing this wherever that part comes up: \" Aphrodite, Can you guide me?\". ...It was this!! This is what sounded so similar!  For those who might not know its one of the cut songs Jorge made in Epic.",

        "content": "Yeah after watching the movie... I love it to bits! The music, the characters, I could instantly rewatch it again :D \n\nBut it also felt rushed. There is so much plot potential, but it seemed like they didn't really had the time to go in depth with the different characters.. \n\nWhile the Movie was good, I think it would have been better as a mini series, like with 5-6 Episodes. To give those deep plots more screentime.\n\nActually when I first heared about it I thought it would become an Anime like Series. \n\nWhat do you guys think? ",

        "content": "In itself the series is \u201cgood\u201d (a Spanish version of Tiny Pretty Liars), but it pissed me off. It's eight chapters of stress because the characters are softer than bread.\n\nAmaia is cast as the bad guy and I spent seven chapters wanting to pull my hair out because they were all more blind than a drunk at a party, and then in the eighth chapter they give you the typical \u201cshe does something bad because her mother is pressuring her\u201d to make it seem like she has depth and that everything is rolling because the series is already over. Zoe doesn't understand shit, Roque even less and Cristian sucks.\n\nOlympo is almost a Russian mafia, when it's a copy of Adidas. The three enlightened Olympo think they are mafia bosses when you can see eighty kilometers away that they are scumbags, and the viewer knows it and has to see how all the characters wonder \u201cwhat's going on\u201d. Hell, we all know it except the main characters. It's a fucking tracksuit brand, not a multimillionaire company that's getting its ass licked so much (yes, I know that in real life sponsorships are key, but it's not that bad).\n\nThe performances themselves are decent (the best for me is Clara, she comes with experience and I'm glad she didn't stick with what she did in Through My Window), the cinematography is perfect and the soundtrack is meh. You can tell they tried to make another \u00c9lite and let's see how it turns out.\n\n",

        "content": "For example, one of the character's name was literally abs, and he signed his signatures on his abs too. That was literally just about all the special thing he had to show in the movie. If this was the other way around, and a female character was named whatever physical factor that women have more than men(example: boobs) and signed their signatures on that body part, a lot of people will certainly have talked about it by now. This also made me remember a scene in Spider Man(can't remember the movie's specific name) where Peter was forced to be nude in front of an old woman. And he was a minor!\n\nI don't really think that having male characters being like that in the movie was a bad thing, but I feel like society is just either more numb on these things for male, or too sensitive for female's sexualization.",

We live in a romance obsessed culture, and some people will ignore hard facts and red flags to claim a relationship. Our obsession with romance is what makes women such easy victims to predatory personalities. \n\nMy hope is for women especially in marriage obsessed cultures, is to wake up and realize they're more worthy endeavors in life. It's so silly and I'm just so sooo sad for women like Kirat who are stigmatized for being single, and through their desperation are easily fooled.",
