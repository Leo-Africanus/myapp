In the ad, characters literally explain key scenes to each other, spoiling the show we're ACTIVELY watching!?\n\nWhat a terrible decision by Netflix to not prevent this type of thing. I had to yell at my son to close his eyes while scrambling to hit the mute button so it wouldn't ruin the show. I know he's late to the party, but he's just now old enough to watch the show and was so excited to start it.\n\nAiring trailers for future seasons which spoil unwatched seasons is bad enough, but this seems like a new level of disregard. If nothing else, can't they put it some type of setting to disable these types of things?",

        "title": "How Netflix brought interactive voting to \u2018Star Search\u2019",
        "content": "On January 20, Netflix is bringing back the popular talent competition\u00a0*Star Search*, with a twist: For the first time in its history, Netflix will let its audience decide the outcome of a show with live voting. However, unlike how shows have done this in the past, audiences won\u2019t have to send text messages or call a special number to make their votes count. Instead, viewers will vote with their TV\u2019s remote control, or right within the Netflix app if they watch the show on their phones.\n\nNetflix hopes that this level of simplicity will help to make live programs like\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0a lot more exciting, and offer its audience a chance to experience shared watercooler moments that tend to be missing from today\u2019s world of hyper-personalized streaming. \u201cYou can influence the outcome \\[together with\\] everyone at the same time,\u201d says Netflix member product VP Elmar Nubbemeyer. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the Zeitgeist at that moment.\u201d\n\nTo bring real-time voting to\u00a0*Star Search*, Netflix relied on work it previously did for interactive narrative shows. It also snuck voting tests into David Chang\u2019s Netflix show, and showed focus groups segments from two fake shows it cooked up for testing purposes.\u00a0 The company even built internal tools that will help it to repurpose live voting and polling for other live events and shows in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are planning more of these types of moments,\u201d says Netflix\u00a0product designer\u00a0Navin Iyengar. \u201c*Star Search*\u00a0is really the big unveiling of it.\u201d\n\nWhen\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0debuts Tuesday evening, viewers will have two distinct opportunities to make their voices heard. Once a singer or comedian is done with their performance, a graphic will pop up on screen, encouraging each viewer to give it a rating ranging from one to five stars. \u201cWe knew early on that giving a star rating as an interaction was really important,\u201d says Iyengar. \u201cIt\u2019s core to the\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0IP.\u201d\n\nLater on, they\u2019ll also get the chance to choose their personal champion of the night out of four choices presented next to each other on screen. Each voting graphic will remain on screen for about 60 seconds, and the show\u2019s host\u2014Anthony Anderson, best known for the ABC sitcom\u00a0*Blackish*\u2014will respond to the incoming vote tally in real time.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Netflix has done real-time voting like this, but the company has been experimenting with getting viewers more actively involved for almost a decade. In 2017, the streaming service released its first interactive TV shows, which prompted viewers to choose their own adventure through branched narratives. In one scene of \u201cBandersnatch,\u201d an interactive episode of the dystopian sci-fi show\u00a0*Black Mirror*, the viewer has to decide whether the main character should take his medication by pressing left or right buttons on their remote control, with different choices leading to vastly varying outcomes.\u00a0\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91477533/how-netflix-brought-interactive-voting-to-star-search)",

        "content": "*Posted this on letterboxd but I also wanna see a discussion on this here*\n\nWhile watching this I REALLY had to rationalize so so much. I was in an endless rollercoaster of *\u201coh this is bad\u201d \u201cokay yeah no I get it\u201d \u201cno what the fuck\u201d \u201cyeah that\u2019s understandable\u201d \u201cwhat the hell\u201d* and just ended with that.\n\nI am all for messy plots but this was probably just not for me. It deserves this rating *(2/5 stars)* for its execution and filmography at least. What made this movie feel good was how well romanticized it was. Tom Blyth and Emily Bader did incredibly well. For a second, they really make you tolerate emotional cheating, lol. But I also feel like it was so overdone in this movie that in the end, there was just no more rationalizing it.\n\nSo many of the reviews from the ones that have read the book are complaining about parts that were not added and as I\u2019m reading through it all, it makes me thankful they weren\u2019t. What do you mean he was supposed to get a vasectomy after the pregnancy scare even though he wasn\u2019t the hypothetical father? That makes it so much worse.\n\nEverything also felt a bit too romanticized. Kissing in the rain, in the middle of a pedestrian, and during the challengers wind that makes you cheat (iykyk). It felt like they tried to make the kiss scenes feel more immersive, but it just ended up feeling overdone.\n\nAnother thing, Sarah could have said a bit more during that encounter with Poppy at the airport. I understand her implication that \u201cPoppy wasn\u2019t the problem\u201d even though they did end because of her, but it was still a bit vague. It\u2019s probably because she was in a rush and all, but she really could have said a bit more.\n\nAlso, probably the most controversial part of this review\u2014not a fan of the soundtrack. It is so typical and they could have done so much better with some of the song choices. Taylor Swift and CAS, really? But this one\u2019s highly subjective because I think both are a bit overrated. Sorry to anyone who\u2019s a fan of both reading this.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be realistic. What kind of girl who just put on her gloss would make out with someone.",

        "content": "So I saw ST for the first time last November and caught finished the show. One thing that I found interesting is one of the directors said \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if a show can become murky in the middle of it. It can be forgiven with sticking the landing.\u201d/the best part remembered will be the ending. \n\nMy opinion is they didn\u2019t do that. There was just so much questions and plot holes left open. This also made me think about other Netflix shows and their endings. I found it crazy just how much the ending with ST made me not want to rewatch it ever because it felt like they gave up with their characters in the end.\n\nWhile on this subject a show that came to mind that actually did achieve that saying/phrase was Cobra Kai. I know a lot of people have criticism and praise for this show so here\u2019s my hot take. Cobra Kai handled their show and characters better. I felt more emotion for how Daniel, Johnny, and Miguel\u2019s arcs and characters were handled through that show. They didn\u2019t butcher the characters. Even then I can\u2019t complain that the show became murky in the middle. They brought back older characters and introduced new ones which always kept the stakes high. Anyways Cobra Kai is a show I can go back and rewatch with enjoyment. As for ST I can\u2019t say the same with how they handled it. What does anyone else think?",

I saw someone talk about it along his &amp; hers (I loved this show) so I figured I\u2019d watch. The first time Adele and Rob astroproject together I saw the colors of their projections so the show was spoiled for me in that moment. \n\nBinged it this weekend but the last episode pissed me off. I thought Louise was smart when she clocked Adele after Adam caught her Astro projecting. But I lost it when she proceeded to call Adele after David told her not to speak to her. FURTHER, tells her about what she knows about Rob and says he\u2019s going to the police\ud83e\udd28. After her failed judgement you\u2019d think she\u2019d actually listen to David this time. \n\nOnly character I liked in this show was her friend. She\u2019d clock Louis all the damn time and rightfully so but Louis shut her off after. That\u2019s the most level headed person Louis had in her life. Idc how much pity she felt for Adele, all those interactions were just gross for character development. How can you claim to pity someone and sleep with their husband repeatedly\ud83d\ude42?? Her judgement throughout the show was so excruciatingly painful.\n\nAs if she didn\u2019t already act stupid enough. She could\u2019ve called 911 to stop the fire. BUT SHE ASTROPROJECTS???? Wtf was she planning to do in the moment. Like it was so foolish it pissed me off. I knew what was coming next when she decides to astroproject and we see Robs projection in the room as well. I was so livid I turned it off when Louise is confronted by Adele and climbs on her.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen so much stupidity in a plot I was aggravated I didn\u2019t want to watch the rest. Like I\u2019ve never seen a worse ending. The fact that Rob wins and David is still sentenced to hell is just sick. I need to wash this show out of my system and forget I ever watched it ",

        "content": "Netflix made a seven dials mini series, but it's not like the book or the 1981 adaptation. It's a different story, and for some reason, putting Bundle and Gerry together as a couple. The 1981 adaptation was so charming, that I'm not sure if I like this adaptation, all the Netflix version makes me want to do is watch the 1981 film. Which I have on dvd",
