The main protagonist is a 40-year-old lawyer having an affair with a co-worker. She then gets to bond with her estranged father while defending him in a trial of which he is accused of murdering his ex-wife. \n\nThere's a twist at the end that is totally unpredictable if you're not expecting a twist. There's just no hint whatsoever. I'm not the biggest fan of shocking last minute twists, but here it works, because it makes that character even more intriguing. \n\nI'm fascinated by characters who do bad and even evil things, but still feel like real people. What they call \"morally grey\" or \"tragically bad.\" This script has a few of them. \n\nThe reviewer made a casting suggestion for the main lead: Natalie Portman. I agree with him. She's never played a character like this, but she would be really interesting and probably nail it. \n\nThoughts?",

Gorang takes the knife and brutally stabs Trimagasi. That is not the last time we see him as we see him throughout the film as a hallucination when Gorange is given the gas. This makes me think of Vergil from The Devine Comedy or Dante's Inferno because in that book Vergil is sorta a guide for Dante Guiding him throughout the levels of hell. much like how trimagasi guides gorang though the levels of The Pit\n\n",

        "content": "As a huge Formula One fan, I recently finished the new Senna series on Netflix, and I won't lie to you - was a little bit disappointed. A lot of the characters feel quite hollow, which is big mistake when creating a show, but also because these are real people and they're drivers who were on camera a lot, so it feels strange that they essentially become cartoonish rather than authentic and what the person was like in real life, a bit disappointing.\n\nThey also didn't really touch on Senna's faith and religion like, at all. Which is again, a baffling decision considering Senna at one point literally said: \"I saw God visually\"\n\nI think maybe for F1 fans this is going to be quite a frustrating watch, and the question must be raised at this point - should Netflix really be producing F1 content? They've received criticism for their \"Drive to Survive\" series, and now this series as well...\n\nAnyway enough of my rambling, what did you all make of the Senna series?\n\n[Netflix's Senna Critique and Analysis](https://www.dive-bomb.com/article/netflix-s-senna-a-must-watch-for-racing-fans)",
