Not the police, not FBI, not Gabby\u2019s family and certainly not the media. \n\nI feel this legal advice cost them a lot!\n\nFirstly - I believe it cost them their son - to a degree. If they had of spoken to police or FBI I believe he would have been taken in for questioning and possibly arrested or at least monitored very closely. Therefore not escaping so he could end his own life rather than face the consequences of his actions. \n\nSecondly - they lost their daughter. She has not communicated with them since Brian passed away. They never- according to her and her husband- confided in them. \n\nThirdly - their reputations in the community. People are angry at them. Blaming them for not assisting parents desperately trying to find their daughter. \n\nAnd finally financially - they had to pay Gabby\u2019s parents a significant sum - not disclosed - from the settlement of the civil lawsuit. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m wondering - was it in fact sound legal advice?\nWhat are your thoughts?

I understand maybe nerves, and obviously she had known them prior to this happening.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know, the energy she gives me is that she actually had feelings for Brian but was embarrassed about it, so she pushed it away, and wasn\u2019t actually friends with Gabby, or was jealous of her. There\u2019s times where she seems normal talking about them, like the engagement, but then other times not so much.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me that she\u2019s in this documentary about him killing Gabby, and she\u2019s yapping about Brian saying the friend thing or being the love of his life, and the bluebird text. She smiles a lot when talking about him, and then when she talks about him playing guitar for Gabby and \u201chow could I be so blind?\u201d Gives me the feeling he didn\u2019t tell her about Gabby until they found out and she thought he was her lover boy-regardless if they were dating or not.\n\nShe isn\u2019t actually crying at the end.\n\nIdk. I always think I\u2019m reading too much into something and then something comes out and I\u2019m like \u201cI KNEW IT\u201d, lol.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure what this means, I guess I wonder if she knows more than she\u2019s letting on? Gabby had reached out to her ex, and if I know anything about abusive bf\u2019s, they\u2019ll come back around to old \u201cloves\u201d to get an ego boost. Makes me wonder if he ever reached out to her when he and Gabby were fighting, or after Gabby\u2019s death. She seems like she had that relationship with him. \n\nDid anyone else get this vibe from her or am I nuts?",

        "content": "I\u2019m looking for some good psychological thriller or mystery movies/limited series from the last 10 years. I enjoy stories that:\n\n* Have a dark, suspenseful atmosphere\n* Keep me hooked from the very beginning\n* Feature twisted plots with mind games, secrets, or hidden motives\n* Have a serious, realistic tone (no supernatural, sci-fi, or comedy)\n\nSome thrillers I really liked are *Gone Girl*, *Fractured*, *Orphan*, *Copycat*, *Don't Breathe*, *Behind Her Eyes*, and *Hush*. I\u2019d love to find more recent ones with the same kind of tension and mystery.\n\nWould appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!",
