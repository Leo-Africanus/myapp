No explanation on what's going on. Uma's acting was bad.\n\n2 out of 10. Don't watch it.\n\n",

        "title": "What has been preventing Japanese originals from getting their videos (teasers, trailers, and the like) uploaded to the main Netflix YouTube channel lately?",
        "content": "After a long wait, [the first official teaser for Season 3 of Alice in Borderland](https://youtu.be/CaWRDITtT1U) is here. It is shockingly the first Japanese video this year to make it to the main Netflix YouTube channel, rather than merely the regional channels.\n\nThe trailer of Asura, the remake of the 1970s family drama, did not make it. Neither did that of Bullet Train Explosion, a modern reimagining of the action-thriller movie from that same decade that is said to have inspired Keanu Reeves' breakout hit Speed. More recently, the musical drama Glass Heart failed to get its trailer onto the main channel as well.\n\nThat is a major decline from last year, which saw FOUR Japanese originals get even just their official trailers onto the main channel: House of Ninjas, City Hunter, The Boyfriend, and The Queen of Villains. And judging by the attention (or lack thereof) given to 10Dance and Last Samurai Standing, I will be pleasantly surprised if either makes it as well.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea has had healthy representation (barring the numerous works that remain stuck on that country's channel). Obviously there is the final season of Squid Game, but other originals have also had their official trailers hit the main channel. There is Mercy for None, aka the Korean John WIck. There is Weak Hero Class 2. There is even When Life Gives You Tangerines, arguably the first K-Drama to make it. Even Revelations, whose teaser and first trailer were not uploaded to the main channel, got its final trailer in.\n\nThat leaves only five other Japanese (true) originals (not counting Giri/Haji, which first aired on BBC2) whose official trailers have made it to the main channel (at least in my memory):\n\n* Followers (this one actually came before Alice in Borderland)\n* First Love\n* The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House\n* Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead\n* YuYu Hakusho\n\nThe last three of them came out in 2023. That means in the span of two years, seven Japanese official trailers made it to the trailer - a major leap in marketing. But now, a downturn.\n\nIt even extends to the ancillary videos on the Still Watching Netflix channel. Squid Game, just to name a Korean example, has had many of them there. Alice in Borderland? Two, one for each season. The rest have had none - not even YuYu Hakusho and City Hunter, which were adapted from famous manga.\n\nHeck, they even streamed the Squid Game Season 3 launch party! Alice in Borderland might not get the same privilege for its own third season.\n\nSo what gives? Why has Netflix stopped significantly promoting its Japanese originals this year after a somewhat strong streak? Let me know in the comments!",

        "content": "TW: spoilers\n\nI found this show couple days ago and watched almost all of it in one sitting, just finished the second half of the last episode rn and need to pour out my thoughts somewhere. The 70s arc of the main character was the best to watch, even though it was the most emotionally charging part, ngl at some point i was watching it only for her human scenes, because of the vibe (and because i could rest from the uncanny valley).\nThe only part i don't like in it is her son shooting his bullies and never getting caught, it's naive for me.\n\nStill, I'm pissed about the plotholes, like why the house stayed empty for such a long time with a robot inside and the decomposed body in one room, why their rentor haven't checked it first? Where are the squatters? Like an ABANDONED INTELLIGENT HOUSE FROM THE 70s WITH A TRAGEDY ATTACHED TO IT, it sounds like an urbexers wet dream, so again, you want me to believe, that in 50 years nobody got inside? \nAnd better, that nobody found the deceased child in the room OR the robot herself and if someone found them, they didn't go to police with it?\n\nAlso Samira's husband is written so insufferably, he gets more clueless and abusive with every episode, from consequently gaslighting her wife, through sending her to psych ward, cause she's scared of the old, uncanny valley robot, that tried to harm her 3 times previosly, to trying to kill her, because Cassandra said so\ud83e\udd23. I don't think he was meant to be so stupid as a character, he just turned out like that. Juno is weirdly infantilized, like she was playing kindergarten games with Emily, aren't they 9 years old? WHY she didn't drop out of school?? And WHY IN THE LAST EPISODE BOTH OF THE PARENTS WERE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT AND DIDN'T INFORM THE POLICE? LIKE AAAHAGAHSHXHHSKAUSH\n\nBut while watching all of it and being absolutely enchanted with her 70s plotline i started to think, that Cassandra's story would work better as an analog horror series, than as a netflix show.\nGood analog horrors are a rarity rn, i think that after Gemini Home Entertainment and The Walten Files everyone keeps copying. It saddens me, that the idea for her story was already used by netflix, cause it has so much potential for this different form.",

You'll be able to get it back easily!)\n\nGo onto your Netflix account and click \"Manage Profiles\", click on the profile with the vld icon, then click the pencil icon in the corner of the picture\n\nYou should be on a page titled \"Edit Profile: Choose a profile icon\", from there right click and then click \"Inspect\"\n\nAt the top, there will be a list of tabs (Elements, Console, Sources, Network) and two arrows at the end, click on the arrows.\n\nYou'll get a drop-down list, click on the option that says \"Components\" (There'll be a purple emoji next to it...this is because it comes from the chrome extension)\n\nScroll down until you see the word \"LolopiIcon\" and then click on the word (It needs to be the first LolopiIcon option, you'll know you've got it right when the icon you want is highlighted. If your vld icon is for some reason not the first one in your history, you'll need to find the one that applies to your vld icon (The second time it says \"LolopiIcon\" if its the second one in your history, the third time if it's the third one in your history, etc.))\n\nThere should be a section underneath titled \"props\" with orange writing under it, click on the arrow next to the option that says \"icon\" and then copy the ID that comes after \"id:\" (It should say \"AVATAR|\" with a series of numbers and letters next to it)\n\nI will literally venmo someone $5 if they manage to find it and it works.",

Or is there really nothing to watch on netflix?\n\nAnd its now always pushing for me to rewatch everything I've already watched, like just minutes after I've finished something it's the big main full screen suggestion. What's that about? Where's all the good stuff? Is there a way to game the algorithm so I can see the stuff it's not showing me? Or is Netflix really just Korean melodramas and 20 year old terrestrial TV dross.\n\nI'm using netflix so much less since the ui was updated that I'm starting to wonder if the algorithm is designed to find the sweet spot between keeping me paying but watching nothing. :(",

I know Elite is not a really liked tv show, and honestly I stopped watching it after s5 I think, but I liked the...vibes/aesthetic in the beginning, but the amount of sex had me skipping a lot of scenes. \n\nBasically what I want is a good mystery show that has me guessing each episode who could be the hacker/killer/A \ud83d\ude02  ",
