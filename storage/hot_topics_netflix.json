My console showed up as the only activity, from when I'd watched something on there a few weeks ago.\n\nToday I was watching something on my phone (iphone) and decided to check what it looked like there, and the app doesn't show up at all either. But what does show up when I access the settings page is 'iPhone Safari - Mobile Browser' and it adds a new entry of these for every single time I visit the account access page. For a start this is within the app so I don't know why it flags it as safari, and I really don't know why it adds it as a new thing for each visit. I went there a few times to see if it'd updated while I was watching things, and so my account access page now shows 4 entries for safari from when I visited it on my phone, and the console, and still nothing for PC.\n\nI just wanted to see if others were having the same issue? It says not all activity may not be shown but it seems really broken and kinda pointless to have if it really isn't showing most activity like this.",

        "content": "This may be an unpopular opinion, but I really did not like Disenchantment. I watched the first two seasons *hoping* I would get into it, but I never did. Personally, the reason that I found the show disappointing was because I went into it thinking it was going to be some epic fantasy quest plot line. Something comparable to that of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Narnia, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc. but something with comedy as much as adventure, wonder, and advanced world building.  \n  \nThere was virtually *NO* adventure. At least not an epic one, anyway. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think there is DEFINITELY a market for an adult cartoon/fantasy parody series, similar to an animated Order of the Stick (iykyk). But with the plot line it currently has, the whole time, I was thinking, \u201cand *whyyyyyy* is it set in a medieval fantasy world?\u201d The setting didn\u2019t seem to add anything interesting to the story. It could've been set in the real world following a rich heiress instead of a princess and literally NOTHING about the plot would change other than a few visual gags.   \n  \nI wanted to like this show. I really did. I watched the whole first and second seasons hoping it would get more interesting but it never did. As a fan of fantasy adventure quest stories, this was a huge disappointment. The only thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the animation. The animation was *exceptionally* good. But again, I feel like they could've done more with the fantasy adventure aspect of the world. Like I said, there is definitely a market for something like that, but this show wasn't it.",

        "content": "I have the 4k netflix plan. Today I went to watch \"i am not okay with this\" which is supposed to be in 4k hdr. But for some reason it only shows it in just 4k. That specific show only. Along with stranger things season 1. Is anyone else experiencing shows that are labeled as having hdr, not having said hdr? I've tried watching on other 4k devices nothings working. I think its a netflix issue and most shows labeled as having hdr are working just fine.",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI just recently encountered an issue, where I wanted to continue watching a show and an error pops: \"too many ppl are using your account. You should stop the play on the other screen first before to watch what you want \". \n\nIs there a known bug regarding this? \n\nI just checked the account in the browser and did the following steps:\n1) made sure no unknown device is connected \n2) force disconnected every single account, so nothing is connected now, it's clean \n3) changed my PW\n\nWaited a good 20 minutes and it's the same issue! The show that is supposedly watched on a different screen has progressed since then and it is \"halfway watched\".\n\n**What am I supposed to do?** There is no other device connected, I have a new PW and no login is ever recorded in my emails. I want to make sure noone is hijacking my account and I want to use the account I'm paying for.\n\nThank you for the assistance. ",
