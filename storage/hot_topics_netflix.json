        "content": "I just finished Insatiable and found out it was canceled after Season 2, with no proper ending. And for what? It was a hit show, it had a following, it wasn\u2019t hidden in the depths of the platform. It could\u2019ve grown even more if Netflix actually supported it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one show. This is about the pattern. They cancel everything good, especially original, weird, dark, or risky stuff, and replace it with endless reality shows or bland reboots.\n\nWhy do they think viewers will keep trusting them with our time and emotional investment if they pull this every time?\n\nIt\u2019s like they only care about new signups, not long-term fans. They greenlight 100 shows and abandon 98 of them. How is that sustainable?\n\nI genuinely wish I could flood their inbox with 40,000 complaints, because clearly they\u2019re not hearing how angry people are. There\u2019s no point in starting new shows anymore if we know there\u2019s no closure. Same with keeping a subscription. What a waste of a company they are. \n\nI hope I can get so many views on this post that Netflix sees this \ud83d\ude2d  \n\nAnyone else feel like this?",

I really wanted to like it, I tried to like it\u2014but somewhere between the recycled plot points and painfully predictable twists, I felt like the magic of the first season just vanished.\n\nThe original had unpredictability, emotional stakes, and that gritty commentary on capitalism and human desperation. But this one? It felt like they were trying to shock us, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The tension just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAlso, character development took a nosedive. Instead of complex personalities making morally grey choices, we got caricatures running through a checklist of betrayals and \u201csurprises\u201d that weren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\nEven the games lacked originality this time. One of them was so absurdly over-the-top that it felt more like a bad parody of Squid Game than the real thing.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Was I expecting too much? Or has the show just become another victim of its own success?",

        "content": "Just watched KPop Demon Hunters, and I've got a lot of really positive things to say about it. Fun animation and action, the Huntrix girls are really charming, and the music is a bop. I really liked how Celine wasn't forgiven for her catastrophic errors as an adoptive mother.\n\nYet, at the same time, I'm kind of left cold by other aspects. \n\nFor instance, why doesn't Rumi's father ever get brought up? I feel like understanding what drew her parents together would have been really relevant to this theme of split identity.\n\nSpeaking of, the entire \"demons are enslaved to Grima\" plot point is never explored in any great depth. We don't see demons other than Jinu who struggle with being controlled by him, and there are no free demons at the end of the movie who get to decide what their fates will be. The tiger and bird feel like different classes of being with no ability to speak anyway. They spent centuries/millennia being forced to feed him at no benefit to themselves, and it just doesn't matter. None of the demons other than Jinu get any development. \n\nGrima himself was fun at first, but he's boring in his final appearance.\n\nRumi's coming out and embracing herself moment doesn't actually feel like it matters - they complete the spell and the result is exactly the same as if they had never revealed it. The only difference is that, now, she has cool scars she isn't ashamed of, but she and the world are completely unchanged otherwise.\n\nI dunno how to describe it, like this could have been an 8/10 or 9/10 but it's missing a chunk of movie.",

Season 3 Episode 5\n\nThe characters in this episode are bafflingly incompetent and it drags on for way too long and they could have easily had this and episode 6 be the same episode and taken out about 20 minutes of it \n\n21. Season 3 Episode 6\n\nDisappointing, player 333 is probably the most miswritten character I've seen in a while and they really didn't take his character in the right direction and it was all around a pretty underwhelming ending\n\n20. Season 2 Episode 7\n\nAgain just a pretty underwhelming episode not necessary even that bad but it just falls flat\n\n19. Season 2 Episode 2\n\nNot bad just not that interesting \n\n18. Season 2 Episode 5\n\nI honestly couldn't even tell you what happened in this episode apart from the beginning \n\n17. Season 3 Episode 4\n\nOff to a decent start but a bit too long\n\n16. Season 1 Episode 2\n\nNot a bad episode at all but objectively I feel like I can't put it higher\n\n15. Season 3 Episode 1\n\nNot a great episode but it gives season 3 a decent start\n\n14. Season 2 Episode 4\n\nGood idea and we'll executed but they're better episodes\n\n13. Season 3 Episode 3\n\nPretty much same as s2 e4\n\n12. Season 1 Episode 9\n\nMostly solid episode and I honestly would've preferred if it had ended here and left in ambiguous\n\n11. Season 2 Episode 3\n\nOpens the new games well but I prefer other episodes way more and I wasn't hugely invested in most of the characters this episode introduced which is strange considering they all had more screentime than the side characters in season 1 (who were wat better)\n\n10. Season 1 Episode 1\n\nJust a solid pilot episode\n\n9. Season 1 Episode 3\n\nIconic episode that expands its side characters well\n\n8. Season 1 Episode 4\n\nMore build up than anything but it's food build up so I don't mind\n\n7. Season 1 Episode 5\n\nJust a good episode\n\n6. Season 2 Episode 1\n\nSuch a good start so it's a shame the season goes mostly downhill after it\n\n5. Season 2 Episods 6\n\nThis is just a really solid idea for a game and it's really good\n\n4. Season 1 Episode 8\n\nSets up the s1 finale perfectly and if you didn't already, will definitely make you care about these characters\n\n3. Season 1 Episode 7\n\nI know the VIPs suck but if you ignore that, this episode is really great\n\n2. Season 3 Episode 2\n\nIt's so frustrating how great this episode is because it proves season 3 overall could've been so much better\n\n1. Season 1 Episode 6\n\nAbsolutely no explanation needed",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Netflix customer since April 2015. Yesterday, I tried to set up a separate account for a family member using the extra member process. I enabled profile transfer and followed all the steps. It felt off when the system asked for a payment method, and even worse when it actually charged me for the account.\n\nLater, I received an email saying, \u201cYour invitation was declined,\u201d which wasn\u2019t true. We carefully followed every step in the screen, including the unexpected ones like entering payment details. When I contacted support, the only solution offered was to start the entire process over again. No explanation, no mention of a refund, just that they can\u2019t add the account for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d Yet somehow, there was no issue letting someone accidentally complete steps they weren\u2019t supposed to.\n\nAfter 10 years as a customer, this was too much. Poor support like this is exactly what drives people away. So I\u2019m done. Netflix got an extra \u20ac9.49 from me but not a \u20ac more.",
