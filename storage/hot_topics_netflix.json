A few years back, things like Stranger Things, Narcos, and Mindhunter felt bigger, more original, and easier to get hooked on. I actually looked forward to new seasons dropping.\n\nNow I open Netflix and spend way too long scrolling, adding things to my list but never pressing play. A lot of new shows feel rushed or forgettable, even if the idea sounds good on paper. I still watch Netflix, but the excitement isn\u2019t the same.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, or do you think the quality really changed? Are there any newer shows that gave you that old Netflix feeling again?",

        "content": "I\u2019m just here to hate for a second and just see what everyone thinks. I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

Netflix has a long history of arguably terrible UI for navigating the app, but I honestly feel the current one is the worst. \n\nA team of people decided that it was a good idea to have the currently highlighted show consume 1/4 of your screen for an auto play then display just 3 other titles to the right of it. If you click right you get 1 new title visible and if you click vertically you get 4 new titles. Compound this with their constant repeated recommendations and you're bound to get a RSI in your thumb before you find something to watch.\n\nPersonally, I want to select movie/show, then genre, then see grouped suggestions and finally a full list if none of those tickle my fancy. Believe it or not, Netflix had this once a long while ago and has only removed more and more titles from being easily seen as options. It's now so bad, you just get 4 at a time.\n\nThis is ridiculous and I just wanted to rant. I complained to tech support and asked about any settings I could change or if there was a rollback option, but all I got was that the issue was going to be fixed under high priority, which I totally believe 100% *eye roll*",

On episode one with Lorraine missing, I feel that they were way too concerned with trying to pin the son for murder instead of actually trying to find Lorraine. Now don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026. I was convinced that he did it, but we were wrong! So maybe if they would have actually put some effort into trying to find Lorraine instead of solve a murder that never occurred they would have found her a lot sooner. \n\nThey had a search warrant on the house, they knew the carpet was ripped up and yet they decided to leave it there, then they had the audacity to start freaking out because the carpet was gone\u2026. Like DUH if she was murdered (which we now know she wasn\u2019t) of course the murderer would remove the carpet so why didn\u2019t they take it in as evidence??? Then they were talking about \u201cyeah we haven\u2019t had time to call the bank yet\u201d THAT WAS THE ANSWER THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!! And then when he started moving everything to the storage unit they said \u201cwe have the storage unit on lock down\u201d but then ten minutes later they are talking about how he\u2019s been taking stuff in and out of the storage unit\u2026. Uhh I thought it was on lockdown ??? And when they go to his truck in the junk yard and they see blood all over the air mattress they said \u201cshould we call the forensic lab down here?\u201d Well no shit Sherlock. Like holy crap!!! And then every time they went to the sons house that one police officer keep saying she was scared of him more than once and waited for backup even when there was more than one police officer ALREADY there\u2026.. like look, I am a women I know how scary it can be to be around men when you have no idea what they are going to do, but you\u2019re a police officer. If you\u2019re gonna be terrified of doing your job then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a police officer. \n\nThis show mad me so mad watching these two woman. And god forbid if I ever go missing and they end up on the case then you might as well just assume I\u2019m dead because I\u2019m surprised they have ever even solved one case. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being harsh but this is just my point of view on this, what do you guys think??

I\u2019ve started ep. 2 and she\u2019s back in the wheelchair at the hospital to visit her mom. I\u2019m not crazy! I took screenshots and even backed up to the walking scene to make sure it\u2019s the same character. Do they address this?? Sorry if I\u2019m just being impatient but it\u2019s really distracting me from the already busy plot lines. ",

        "content": "So I've recently learnt Harlan Coben is American and a bulk (maybe all) of his books are set in the US but there's a large portion of his adaptations on netflix are set in the UK in kind of non descript vaguely liverpool/manchester suburbs. \n\nDoes anyone know why? It's not usually something that happens with adaptations I was wondering if anyone had any production scoops.",

Its a horrible experience browsing their catalogue.\n\nIf you hover on anything for 2 secs, it just auto starts the series/movie.\n\nAnd before somebody mentions you can just turn it off in setting, no you really cant. Its not possible, and it annoys the hell out of me. I will never pay willingly for something that annoys me like this.\n\nI am sure there are certain metrics that gets sold, used or even clicks they earn or something, because this has been mentioned so many times by people that find it annoying, but they never remove it. They just ignore it completely, so they must earn something by having it like this.\n\nNot coming back until its changed.",

Even in season 1 I got NGE vibes with preteen kids fighting extra dimensional entities while dealing with growing up. While they never mentioned NGE by name as one of their anime inspiration, this would have revealed too much.\n\nNGE series finale was HATED by fans so much that a year later they made a movie to show what REALLY happened to coincide with the finale. The Duffers are purposely doing this for Season 5.",
