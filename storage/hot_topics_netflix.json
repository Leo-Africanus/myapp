It dives straight into some of the most uncomfortable themes that the Myths were originally all about. Not to say there is one true interpretation of the individual Gods, but the Thor we get in TotG is written waaaaay more like the Thor of old, a far cry from the Marvel Thor the majority of modern consumers are more used to.  \nThat's just one example. The Myths are filled to the brim with murder, torture, damnation, war, death just to name a few of the more... comfortable examples.   \nI hope it gets picked back up. I want to see the next chapter of the story. And I absolutely believe it stands well on it's own as a fantastic take on the stories. ",

Netflix is filled with crime documentaries, Korean romantic shows and what not but family/kid shows like these bring back genuine smiles and laughs.\n\nThe Big Show was good, rather surprised me. The main cast was brilliant. Not a minute of lag. Just fun and as it ends (well ended back in 2020 and I\u2019m ranting about this in 2026), I\u2019m genuinely gutted.\n\nBring it back!!",

        "content": "So I am a little late to it, but just now watched the first two episodes of Star Search. I\u2019m not very invested in contemporary music so I didn\u2019t know who Jelly Roll was. I thought he was charming through watching this, noticed a moment when he was talking about the Christian god in the first episode but it was brief so I ignored it. Now at the end of the second episode, I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ll be removing this show from my list. Suddenly the whole thing became a televangelist prime time, which, when we\u2019ve literally mentioned several times already that this show is live for the whole world to see, to me became very tone deaf. I don\u2019t care what kind of religion you practice, as long as you don\u2019t shove it in my face and especially if you\u2019re gonna try to convert me I\u2019m hella out. I just came here to watch some sparkly talent entertainment compete with each other I didn\u2019t ask for missionaries wtf ",
