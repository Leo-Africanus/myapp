        "content": "Someone told me that they don't want to watch Alice in Borderland because of how they perceived women to be treated on the show.\n\nMore broadly, there is a case to be had about that. I think Kuina is the one female character I can think of that was actually given a great empowering arc which lasted until the end.\n\nEven our baddie Ann, the way she was left in Season 3, broken, fragile and in a mental institution was horrible.\n\nBut I also came to realize an uncomfortable pattern that in every season, Usagi who is our leading lady had her character chipped at by an abusive man - and I think they truly did break her.\n\nSeason 1 and Season 2 Usagi was attacked by violent rapist Niragi (a fan favoritie unfortunately).\n\nIn Season 1 she managed to get away. A small moment of empowerment.\n\nIn Season 2, she could not get away from him. She had to cry out for Arisu, another guy, to save her because it was so bad. Usagi was a character who never wanted to be saved by anybody so I don't think people realize how truly vulnerable she was and the lasting effects on her.\n\nIn Season 3 Ryuji targets Usagi but rather than breaking her spirit and body like Niragi, Ryuji broke down her mind.\n\nAnd the one man in her life that is the greenest of green flags, Arisu, he can't undo it. But not only that, season 3 seemed to imply that Arisu thinks of Niragi in a friendly manner as he was edited into the \"Arisu's friend group\" montage.\n\nRyuji dies but Usagi never learns the full extent of what he did to her and Usagi never gets to take back her own power.\n\nRegarding Niragi, Usagi never got to take back her power. She submits and looks the other way when he is next to her.\n\nAnd he won because he got the happy ending being around children with no comeuppance while she got no justice and broken/changed as a character to the point she is now more hated than him.\n\nIf they do a season 4, I do not want to see yet another season of another man abusing Usagi and her getting depowered and made vulnerable yet again. And I think Usagi does deserve a better ending. Ann too.\n\nSo to the person afraid to watch this series because of how the female characters appear to be treated...that's a valid concern I think.\n\nAnd something that I would like to see change too.",

Did they purposely place him into the pod to get the guys high? He wasn't present at the search nor was he present at the meeting held by the guys. He literally just disappears. Please tell me someone else noticed this lol",
