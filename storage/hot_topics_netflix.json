I felt that the real interest was in Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis' characters. Their chemistry was amazing and I wanted to see more! Her and his backstory, ,  how this cult started, who was the first wife, \"hey hey\"? Josh Segarra's character? Like wtf is that about? There is soooo much more to unpack here that is bigger than this storyline! PLEASE MAKE A PREQUEL  or a spinoff with Meghann Fahy and Felix Solis!.  So many questions unanswered!",

But what makes this whole case a mystery is that Tom ( the father) and Molly hade bearly any scratches or woundes on them. But parts of Jansons brain was out. If Molly really had been struggled there would have been injuries from inside the neck.He was much bigger and stronger. \n\n I don't believe ether that she was unconscious. Every woman pees while being nervous or it's something she looked up for her story.   \n\nI believe that it was all pre planned. She read about the first wife and made up a story that would fit. Intoxicated him weak and begun hitting him with the bat. Then shouted out so that the father could come up and help her finish the story. Why was there a whole brick in their bedroom?  And why was it so easy for the to hit him with it? Why was blood splattered on the backside of the door ? Was  Mollys mother on the other side the door, preventing him from running out? \n\nIf Tom was there while Janson was alive... he could have them stop the altercation and calm things down, run or even right then call 911 ? \n\nNOOOO ! Tom was an ex FBI agent. He knew how to save his daughter and work around the crime she hade committed. Tom was educating students on investigation after his job at FBI.  \n\nI feel sorry for them kids. Me, myself and I have also been manipulated as a child and used as a spokes person. I understand.

        "content": "Okay I just finished watching this movie and I just felt it and have seen how queer coded it is, not a way that the characters are actually queer and i dont wanna be assuming that but the plot and the experiences of the characters relate to how I'm experiencing being gay rn and I'm pretty sure other queers out can see it to some degree. The exchange of Celine and Rumi in the final scenes where Rumi's marks got revealed and they talked about it must hidden, \"out faults should be hidden until theyre destroyed\" non-vertatim, it hits me, it's too close to home. And then scenes where Rumi  finally accepted who she is and ready to show everyone that just because she's born as \"half-demon\" she should be ashamed, AND THE SONG\u2014oh my god the songs. Im rambling a bit here u get the idea right? I'm really the most eloquent so perhaps that does see my vision can explain it better than I can. 'Cause if one queer like me watched this show and had a eureka moment where I'm like, \"okay wtf this is so familiar, I swear I had this conversation before\" while sobbing, I'm sure there are others. And of course you can completely disagree with me, I know this is just a movie, it can completely just about kpop idols fighting demons and about friendships. But please remain respectful and let's have civil conversations. I'm very sensitive \ud83e\udd79, just, just dont be rude \ud83e\udd7a",

PLEASE SOMEONE listen to 'What It Sounds Like' and the part is 37 seconds to 48 seconds. I CANT PUT MY FINGER ON IT. IT'S KILLING ME! ;-;",

        "title": "Why I think K-pop Demon Hunters could have been soooo much better",
        "content": "I think there was so much potential but they honestly fumbled so bad. at first I thought i really liked it but the more i think about it, the more i feel like i just liked the idea of it. The animation and music was awesome but i feel like it was rushed and it didn't have as much of an impact as it could have. And don't get me wrong it was still good and enjoyable but i think it genuinly had the potential to be like insanly perfectly awesome.\n\nMy reasons and how they could have fixed it:\n\n1.) The rest of the Saja boys had literally no personality, its unrealistic that Jinu was the only demon with a backstory and personality. It would have been so much more fun to see and connect to all the boys, i wanted to love them but they were practically background characters. It would have been a lot more emotional to see them die if they had actually seemed like real people who had emotions, instead of just zombies.\n\n2.) Rumi and Jinu's romance thingy was so weird and the chemistry was definetly there but we saw so little of it. Again it just felt rushed, they barely met and then all of a sudden they were singing some love song about how being with each other was so freeing and how no one else sees them like they do. I can't imagine who's dumb idea it was to take out the aquarium date and kiss, it wouldn't have fixed everything but they seriously needed a few more quite romantic moments.\n\n3.) Rumi's reaction after Jinu's death seemed so like unemotional. Like she was more upset when she found out that Juni had betrayed her than when he literally died to save her. She shed like 3 individual tears and then started smiling and hugging her friends. That scene honestly ruined everything that they had for me, because it made it seem like she didn't care. The emotion before he died, was fairly on point but after he died it just seemed to completely ignore the fact that the boy who she supposedly loved had just died. I mean I've lost people I love before and it has taken months if not years to heal, and they hadn't even died they just left me.\n\n4.)The actual villain (whats his face, the fire dude) was just sooo boring, like he had no personality the fire persona was eh, honestly pretty bad. It wasn't scary and it wasn't unique or iconic. I mean i looveee a good iconic villain, just a good character design will take it a long way. I mean, take HTTYD as an example, Drago, Grimmel, and even Viggo, they all had unique character design and complex personalities. And i think there would have been soooo many possibilities to make the demon lord dude have an epic design, like hes a demon lord they did awesome with Jinus demon design i don't know why they started slacking off with the fire dude.\n\n5.) Why did Jinu and the other boy band member look and act differently than all the other demons? I feel like all the other demons were literally just ugly zombies who couldn't talk and then you have Jinu who isn't said to have anything special about him whos hawt and talks quite a lot and is capable of emotion. It's inconsistent and it feels lazy.\n\n6.) Mystery and Romance's hair to face proportion bothered me, like why is their head so big? Idk I didn't like it.\n\n7.) Also why could the Saja boys hide their marks but Rumi couldn't?\n\nI have a lot more i could say and suggestions on how they could have made it better but i've already written a lot and doubt anyone will even read this much. Anyways i think we were robbed of a really amazing, complex story that would have been much better as a series than it was a movie. So if netflix actual reads these and needs help making the next movie amazing, because there is going to be another movie obviously, then like ask for a few teenager to read the script, look at the character designs, and watch it before you release it. Try to find some that are really judgy and good writers, Ao3 is a great place to find em, i also volunteer.\n\nAlso was i the only person who was reminded of Zuko and Katara by Jinu and Rumi?",
