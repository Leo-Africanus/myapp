I am so sad because Netflix, in my opinion, does this with so many shows. I wish they would at least commit and do less shows for production. They have so much junk on the platform that is no good, but this was, it really was! Tell me what you ladies and gentleman think below. Am I the only one? I would love to hear your thoughts. ",

        "title": "Netflix Removed My Downloads Unexpectedly",
        "content": "I am currently traveling and will be for pretty much the whole month of July. Before leaving the US, I made sure to download a good bit of content to watch on the different plane flights. Imagine my suprise when not even two days into my trip, all of my downloaded content was gone. One movie I had downloaded just that morning while on a layover. I had only watched one movie and a couple episodes of a new season of a show. Then, to make it worse, I can't re-download any of that content because I hit my monthly limit. On top of that, I tried to download some content on another device, but am not even being given the option to do so anymore even though I have in the past.\n\nI was able to contact Netflix support who could offer no actual explanation for why my content was now missing or why I could not download to a second device. Both devices were showing under my account with titles being downloaded. And their only suggested solution was to pay for a higher tier of service that would allow me to download more content (I'm on the ad supported tier) since the one device that can download content has already maxed it's limit. That has got to be the biggest corporate greed solution ever. Why should I pay more for a service when I am not even getting what I am paying for now? I'm paying for a service that will let me download some content for travel without removing it mysteriously and without warning. I don't need 100 downloads, 15 is fine. I'm also paying for a service that is supposed to allow downloading content on two devices. Yet that isn't working either anymore. Both of my devices are new and fully compatible, and I have downloaded on both in the past. \n\nSo now I have dozens of hours to look forward to on airplanes with none of the content I was really looking forward to watching. Fortunately I still have some content from other streaming services who haven't removed my downloads mysteriously. I've been a Netflix customer since the days of mail DVDs, but this has honestly got me thinking to finally ditch Netflix. It's clear they care more about their short term profit than actually keeping customers.",

        "title": "The story of kpop demon hunters was really weird (SPOILERS)",
        "content": "KPop Demon Hunters is an extremely fun movie, with banger songs, amazing vocal performances, and godly animation (sony is so good at this style). Yes, i loved the movie, but the story just left me confused at the end.\n\nWhile watching the movie, I thought that the movie was about how no one is truly evil, and everyone deserves a second chance. The evidence of this being the girls not wanting to use a diss track to make the golden honmoon because they didn't want to do it with hate, and also Jinu's whole backstory. Yes Jinu did leave his child but Rumi said in the movie that that's not all he is, which led me to believe that this would serve as a signal that demons can also be good. Also, Gwi Ma was the one who used the demons fears to take control over them, so they couldn't be completely at fault.\n\nDespite all this, Gwi Ma dies (which is expected), but every demon dies as well. Are we to believe that all of them deserved that death? Because that's not the message the movie was hinting at earlier. Jinu dies, and yes it could be argued that he paid the price for his sins, but I'd argue that 400 years of tormenting voices of his family was enough torture for the character. I feel like it would've been more interesting if they'd explored the idea of Gwi Ma being evil, and demons the humans who made mistakes and are now paying the price.\n\nThe plot point of Rumi being a half demon was interesting, and led to the actual message of the movie, of not being ashamed of you are, but it could've been explored more. The same applies to her relationship with Celine, which was just served to us through flashbacks.\n\nAlso, not a real criticism, but just a side note, what happened to the missing persons cases, cause their souls are just gone? Was the identity of Gwi Ma and Saja being demons now known to everyone? Did everyone just accept that fact?\n\nTLDR; fucking amazing animation, songs, voice acting (glad they didn't do chris pratt as jinu), and an extremely fun movie, but the plot left more to be desired\n\n  \n(Also, the sort of romance between jinu and rumi was weird, it's literally the 1000 year old anime girl that looks like she's 9 years old, but a little better)",

But instead she just bailed without even saying goodbye.\n\nFuller House: Just a triple wedding that we had been waiting for forever. Didn\u2019t really add anything to the show.\n\n13 Reasons Why: Didn\u2019t see this one, but the reviews of the ending were very bad. I read the book, and if it\u2019s true that, in the TV version, Hannah Baker comes back as a ghost, then it is taking such a giant (bleep) on the book that I couldn\u2019t bear to watch it.\n\nNot sure if I should count GLOW - the ending was never even made because of COVID.\n\nThe endings of OITNB and Never Have I Ever were passable, and I\u2019ve heard good things about the Grace &amp; Frankie finale.\n\nBut still, I\u2019m starting to think that going forward, I should wait for shows to be finished and gauge the reaction before I even start watching them.\n",

        "content": "I have been having problems while watching any netflix content with subtitles turned on. Every time someone starts talking and subtitles appear or when they finish talking and subtitles disappears, my screen does something weird like moving up and down. It is really annoying and makes content almost unwatchable. Any ideas what could be causing this?\n\nI\u2019ve only had this problem in my new &lt;6 months old computer (Asus ProArt P16). I dont remember if it started happening the first time I used netflix but it has persisted for at least some months. This issue affects both the windows netflix app and netflix on google. I\u2019ve tried restarting and redownloading netflix but it hasn\u2019t fixed it. When I turn off subtitles it doesn\u2019t have this issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated\n\nVideo attached showing issue",
