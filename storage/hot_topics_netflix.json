I wouldn't go from burlap sacks to dismemberment to just random dumpings... Rex isn't the only killer. \n\nI thought the documentary would answer big questions like, who are the other victims? Who is the baby? Who was the male? Nope...\n\nAnd if I hear the journalist says she's shocked again... \n\n ",

The acting was just perfect.\n\nThe final episode blew me away. When Jamie called and said that he's gonna plea guilty I just stopped breathing. The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much.

        "content": "I found this series compelling as we explore toxic masculinity and even facets of sociopathy.  As we engage in the content, I can\u2019t help but observe the correlation between violent tendencies towards women and normative porn/social media culture.  We are beginning to see scientific research that observes the net negatives of porn culture and attitudes towards women.  In the series we see a child exposed to explicit images of his peer juxtaposed to images readily available in mass (hard core) and likely heavily edited and surgically enhanced on the internet. \n\nThe main character communicates his dissatisfaction with her (a child\u2019s) breasts.  He called her \u201cflat\u201d as if to describe an object.  As a woman, this is a cultural norm which has pushed in industry.  We are nearly lead to empathize with a murderer who effectively manipulate his own therapist, demonstrated violence, and even sought the destruction of professionalism and empathy for his own gain.  You see a small boy on the unfortunate end of bullying who reacts disproportionately much like his expectations of breasts.  Perhaps this child was also a victim?  \n\nWe are attempting to uncover the true criminals when the evidence is all around us.  Women as objects, exposing children to graphic sexual content, access to social media for children, normalizing violent behavior, and complex misogyny.  As a mother of a 13 year old, social media is off limits and quite honestly never requested.  I\u2019m protecting my kids at all costs because my daughter will NEVER be treated as an object as long as we live.  This show should be a sobering reminder that work isn\u2019t done.  ",

        "content": "Hey,\n\nI moved out of my parents' house a while ago, and now I was hit with the \"this device is not part of the household\" message on my TV.\n\nSince I'm the only one no longer living in that household, vs the three remaining members of my family, I was just going to add my own profile as a non-household member with extra payment. The problem is that I'm the account owner, the one who pays for it, and the one whose profile is set as the main profile. Because of this, it won't let me select my own profile to give access to from a different location, only the rest of my family members.\n\nI did some googling, and realized I likely only have the following options, neither of which are satisfying to me:\n\n\\- I make a new account using profile transfer, change email and payment info of the existing account to my parents' -&gt; not great, because then I'll have to pay more for my own account vs just adding the extra cost for one person, PLUS the cheapest option doesn't even come with good quality  \n\\- My family makes a new account for themselves using profile transfer -&gt; same issue where I end up paying more than with the extra member option  \n\\- I make a new profile for myself on the existing account which I add as the non-household member -&gt; I'll lose my viewing history doing this  \n\\- I make a new account, transfer my profile to it, transfer it back to the existing account as a non-household member, cancel the new account -&gt; very convoluted way of doing it, but possibly the best outcome?\n\nSo if anyone can tell me about another option (ideally how to change the main profile, though from my research so far I'm not very hopeful that's actually possible), that would be very much appreciated because I'm already paying half a fortune for this subscription and I'd very much like to actually *use it.*\n\nThanks!",

Shame really as was pretty good ",
