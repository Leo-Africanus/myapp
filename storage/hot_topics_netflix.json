The production cooked; shooting and editing were elite. One reason that I found it so entertaining was that the first two episodes set up such a satisfying twist in the last episode.\n\nKC and Everett are hysterical foils of each other, not to mention they're both absolutely fucked as individuals. Everyone interviewed are such good storytellers, having a certain southern style humor/charm that doesn't get old quickly. The ending is so good too; there's a feeling of a hero's redemption with KC which ties the story very nicely. All in all, super impressed and grateful to see Netflix invest in this show.

I luckily forgot it for some time but since there are these buttons now in the windows app ui that literally have the numbers \"10\" on them it is even more ridiculous. The rewind is something random between around 10 and 15 seconds. The forward does forward something between 6 and 10 seconds. Unbelievable. Not sure if this is the case on all operating systems, on windows you can easily test it this out with hitting rewind and forward alternately for 5 times each while not playing. What should be the result is that you end up at the same time stamp (I think??), however, you're gonna end up around 30 seconds behind of where you started. ",
