Very original and fun show. \n\nI get that it was probably cancelled due to the poor writing of season 2 but I don\u2019t feel like it was any worse than a show like Night Agent. \n\nI really feel like Netflix didn\u2019t give it a fair chance at all and it\u2019s super frustrating. All they would need for a successful 3rd season is just reveal that Max never died and bam viewership would be through the roof.\n\nWhat do you think? Did the weird second season warrant cancellation?",

And also s3 when Monty\u2019s dad visited Monty in jail he said something \u201cYou did this to a boy\u201d. If Monty had SA a girl\u2026.would his reaction been different. \n\nAlso S4 Estela never mentioned her dad at all, just the call to her mom while she in the bathroom in the lockdown and sees Tyler. \n\nSo did her dad end up in jail ? Or he died? Or ran off with another woman? \n\nThese are my arguments that I can make the case that I consider Monty\u2019s dad a pedophile that sexuality abused his daughter besides the physical abuse of Monty",
