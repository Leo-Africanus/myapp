There have been a series of of young boys who were killing young girls with knives, and it was really upsetting,\u201d director Philip Barantini\u00a0[told TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/adolescence-netflix-cast-creators-behind-the-scenes/)\u00a0this month. \u201cThat was the seed that we wanted to explore, and send a bit of a message and maybe spark a bit of a conversation.\u201d",

I mean Juan wasn't even TRYING to do ANY of what he was doing. And then the fucking show has the audacity to give an absolute ass ending. \n\nI think I'm just in cope with Elena's death because I hate when TV shows or movies just kill off one of the very main roles just for the protagonist to have \"a redemption ark\" or some fucking shit like that. To me, instead of leading onto some sort of season 2 (which I honestly don't even want or need anymore because what would be the fucking point.) But I mean come on. It's so dumb.

I did find her escapades during her stint with the royal family and after trying. \nBut the vitriol directed towards her in this show is excessive, inaccurate and unfair. \nThe show itself is charming. For those who say it\u2019s \u201cun-relatable\u201d she never claimed to try to be. She\u2019s doing her, and surprise, surprise she\u2019s rich. Shocker. I don\u2019t know how people are so offended by her choice of cookware, the fact that she has a large garden, time on her hands to harvest berries, and elaborate utensils when that\u2019s literally her life. If you can\u2019t relate have you considered that you\u2019re not the target audience? I think it would be worlds more offensive if she tried showing people how to bargain hunt or use coupons to seem relatable when clearly that\u2019s not her life. \n\nMeghan comes off as warm and genuine and you can tell the people in her life who she invites on genuinely care about her. The show is used to discuss their friendships and their lives and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s scripted to hype her up. The conversation goes both ways and it\u2019s a show about connecting with people. \n\nShe clearly knows her food. It might not be to everyone\u2019s taste but you can tell she derives genuine enjoyment out of food and preparing it. \nFolks mad that her recipes are not groundbreaking, guess what? None are. Even Pinterest regurgitates recipes that have been around for eons. She is just sharing what she likes. \n\nI think in the first episode she mentions that the kitchen she\u2019s in is not hers, but there\u2019s another main kitchen she cooks from for the majority of the show and that\u2019s in her house, no? \n\nAnyway as much as I\u2019ve never really liked the lady, the amount of vitriol she\u2019s receiving for this show is unwarranted and unnecessary.

Even the insufferable characters had got served by karma at their right time. The characters acted realistically as anyone would do in zombie apocalypse. It wasn\u2019t boring a bit. I binged the whole show in day. I\u2019m currently waiting for season 2. \n\nLast night I started watching Happiness. The first 4-5 episodes were good, not as good as AOUAD but still better than the latter episodes. There are few jumpscare moments. The concept of zombie in quarantined apartment is good and interesting at first. But the pace after episode 5 is so slow that it doesn\u2019t feel like a zombie series. Most characters including ML &amp; FL are insufferable. They act like they\u2019re playing in the park. They don\u2019t have any seriousness about their situations. They are all adults unlike teenagers in AOUAD but act like kids. In this situation someone wants to be residential representative, someone promotes his lawyerings, someone is busy streaming, someone\u2019s busy taking money from his sister. Among them the old couple and their son are the most insufferable. Even FL always goes near the infected like they are normal people. And the chemistry between ML &amp; FL is like they are in any romcom. Even AOUAD has romance which was as it should be in zombie apocalypse but was far better than the romance in Happiness. And ML always poses like he\u2019s in some kind of romcom. I can\u2019t continue this so dropped this after episode 7. Now I regret wasting my time.",
