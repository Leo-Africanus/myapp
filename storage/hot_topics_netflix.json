Untamed, Fringe, Blacklist, Luther, True Detective and Hannibal all had perfect pilot episodes in my opinion that got me invested knto watching the shows fully. If the pilot, second or third episode doesn't hook me i'm out. Not going too waste my time waching a slow burn series with mostly talking and literally nothing happening for the whole episode(s)",

There was a highlight with the eyes being golden, but the book wasn't about that, the book emphasized the height, the symmetry, and how everybody(Pretties) looked the same. Also the plot twist Shay was her original best friend from the very beginning, not Peris. ",

Charming, charismatic, ambitious but underneath, stressed out, under pressure, and constantly worrying about money trying to keep up appearances. Even the staff brought back early memories of my life as a hostess/bartender at some of those restaurants/nightclubs. Very close, very tight knit, but riddled with drug use and drama, and overlooking major red flags. I really appreciated the effort they went through in giving the viewer a realistic representation of that world. ",

I don't have masses to discuss, but yeah, I read some reviews on IMDB afterwards and was pleased to see similar thoughts. \nShe seemed incredibly self absorbed and self righteous. And yeah, she was a lousy friend, lover and partner. I was 100% with Opal when they argued and split. I don't have children, I don't want them either, but there's no way in hell I'd take a child to get their ears pierced, against the parents wishes, and then not tell them. \nShe abused Mars' love for her and took advantage of him. She claimed she didn't want to be like anyone else but \"the struggling artist living in NYC\" is like most of the population there I assume, equally so overdone and cliche \ud83d\ude02\nI also think she was very privileged in comparison to what millions of other women go through. And she was taking advantage of her God mothers generosity. She was very fortunate, and still kept acting like a victim.\nThe actress herself is stunning though. What a beautiful women - her eyes are gorgeous.\nI don't know, I have very mixed feelings on the whole show. I wouldn't recommend it personally. ",

        "content": "Watched Coded Bias recently and it raised some serious concerns. The documentary dives into how facial recognition and AI systems aren\u2019t actually neutral at all. Because they\u2019re trained on flawed datasets, they end up making mistakes that disproportionately affect women and people of color.\n\nThe unsettling part is how widely this technology is already being deployed in policing, workplaces, schools, even housing, often without the public really knowing or having much of a say. If these systems are already showing bias, what happens when they become a permanent part of everyday life? AI is often framed as being smarter and more objective than humans, but if it\u2019s just reinforcing the same prejudices at scale, is it really progress? At what point do we step back and question whether some decisions, especially around law enforcement and surveillance, should even be left to algorithms at all, how do you trust it with your data? I personally don't let my info surface and try and remove it online, mainly using cloaked for overall security and temp mails and phone numbers. After watching the movie I even read that AI chats have a warning to not feed it real data (idk if that's true? so that's what sparked the use of those).\n\nFor  anyone who\u2019s seen it or works with AI, do you think these are just early flaws that can be fixed with better design and regulation, or are we headed toward a future where algorithms quietly shape more of our lives than we realize?",

        "content": "I just watched the movie\u2014probably late, but wow, that was fantastic. I went ballistic, rooting for complete genocide, and cheered like a maniac for Ashin all throughout her revenge.\n\nFYI: Those people weren\u2019t innocent. Some of the men had been raping her since she was young, while others completely turned a blind eye to what was happening.\n\nSeeing her kneel and beg them to avenge her family, only to discover that they were the very ones who caused her family\u2019s massacre, was brutal. And learning that her father had been tortured for years, with his limbs cut off, was even more heartbreaking.\n\nWhy is the life of Joseon\u2019s people considered more important than her village? They were loyal to Joseon, yet their loyalty was repaid with betrayal. The injustice of it all made my blood boil.\n\nI completely understand why she did what she did. Honestly, I would lose my mind too if it had happened to me.\n\nI\u2019m not usually a fan of series, but I ended up binge-watching Kingdom Season 1 and 2 because of this. The story, the suspense, the raw emotion\u2014it\u2019s all too gripping to ignore.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m still waiting for her to kill that bastard of a commander.\n\nSo\u2026 where is Season 3? I need answers!\n",

Oh my god I love it, especially Abbadon is my favorite. Never watched Rick and Morty, does it have the same vibe or is it weirder? Do you know similar show with similar humor? It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s animated or not.  ",
