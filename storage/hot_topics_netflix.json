Like the point TK was where the most sane person is the Walmart gun seller who was also Joe Exotics presidential campaign guy. \n\nJust any documentaries and series that truly makes you laugh at the absurdity at one moment, say \ud83d\ude00wtf\ud83d\ude00 the next, and all in all make you consider changing your morals and values (in this case, becoming vegetarian lol) \n\nThanks!

Lately, it feels like any new series that come out are boring or one dimensional. I don\u2019t like the way the whole narco culture is romanticized, which is why I don\u2019t watch any narco shows but the way the ozarks was produced was so good and so engaging. It really kept you on the edge of your seat with so many elements from the chosen colors to the dialogue. The AO was engaging to me because you had to really pay attention to the story line to understand what was happening and how everyone was connected. Same with Dark. \n\nI wish they\u2019d come out with a show that had complex interconnected characters, a plot that was ever-evolving but with a clear end goal/ resolution for the characters to achieve and a big conflict to overcome. \n\n",
