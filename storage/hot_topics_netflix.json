He doesn\u2019t fight his way out of trouble, he just outsmarts everyone. One second he\u2019s a janitor, the next he\u2019s walking out like a millionaire, and nobody even realizes what happened.  \nWhat I love most is how he uses information. It\u2019s not about hacking or gadgets, it\u2019s about reading people, noticing the small things, knowing how systems work. He uses the kind of details most of us give away every day without thinking twice. That\u2019s what makes it feel so real.\n\nIt kind of made me think about how hard it is to stay invisible in real life now. Cameras everywhere, online tracking, data leaks all the time. He\u2019s changing disguises and I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to stop apps from following me around. Privacy feels like the real superpower now.  \nAnyway, I loved this season and I\u2019m curious if others did too. Did you like how they wrapped things up? Or did it feel a little too over the top?",

        "content": "A lot of people have discussed this documentary already, but I just got around to watching it. Aside from all the insane criminal activity, I think people ignore the behaviour of other people in the documentary because they do not know what it was like to live in a small town and the type of behaviours that arise.\n\n\nFirst of all, any speculation that Lauryn was involved clearly comes from this weird ingroup thing small towns do. You're telling me that in the opening of the documentary they talk about how everyone knows everyone but Lauryn isn't invited to this huge annual Halloween party?\n\n\nSpeaking more on the party, it was a party for children and adults which is strange, and Lauryn was in grade eight or maybe even grade seven when she wasn't invited. That's just disturbing.\n\n\nIn the documentary we hear testimony from Khloe and Khloe's friends and Owen and all their parents and it seems to me that they are a very weird type of clique that is never fully acknowledged. They say everyone knows everyone, imply Lauryn is a vapid sociopath with no emotion, and deny bullying some other girl.\n\n\n\nWhen we hear from Lauryn and Owen's cousin, we can see that they are more reserved and in the cousins case not as conventionally attractive. I feel like the culture of this town was brushed over. I grew up in a small town myself and everything was an exact dead ringer for what I experienced.\n\n\nA final anecdote: there is no way Lauryn has recovered from this situation. She was already \"weird\" to these people and this is just another thing they're going to pin on her and alienate her for. I truly hope she can move somewhere else and live a happier life.",

        "content": "&gt;!Why was the president pressured to make an immediate decision about a counter-strike?!&lt;\n\nI learned everything about Global Thermo Nuclear War from that great 80s documentary, War Games. The counter-strike dilemma was that if the US didn't launch its own nuclear weapons, the missile silos would be destroyed by the incoming attack. In House of Dynamite, that is not an issue. There was only one incoming missile, which might malfunction. The president still had no idea who launched the attack. And even if Chicago got nuked, the president would still have the full arsenal of missiles to launch 15 minutes later, an hour later, or two days later.\n\nIt felt like it was an artificial and unnecessary deadline to create tension, but maybe I missed something that explained it. If this was Independence Day I would just brush it off but Dynamite is (generally) a smart film. Any insights?",

To each their own but the entire time I was DYING to know who sent the missile and what the appropriate response would be. We were given none of this.

I don\u2019t know about you but a movie like this is essentially pointless if we don\u2019t at least get some sort of simulation as to what would happen next. Not to mention, they never even actually confirmed or denied that the missile made impact! What?!? This movie was all suspense, all buildup and no drop.

Instead of responding to that comment, I figured I\u2019d might as well post my feedback now that I\u2019ve watched it. \n\nI enjoyed House of Dynamite. I thought it was one of the more entertaining movies of this year. I can definitely see why some wouldn\u2019t but I did. I watch a movie with two things in mind. (1) Is it entertaining? (2) Is it good?\n\nI\u2019ve watched many movies that were entertaining but not good and many that were really good but not very entertaining. I thought it was definitely entertaining. I loved the dynamic changes in how each primary group handled the tension in this three acts. I thought a couple of the performances were just standout performances a the overall cast was really good. I liked how the whole movie happens on some random day without a cinematic or \u201cblockbuster\u201d type build up feel. \n\nIs it good? Idk yet. I\u2019ll need another rewatch. For those unaware, our nuclear arsenal (and supporting infrastructure) is extremely outdated. However, our missile defense system could pick a gnat off a dogs ass from a 100 yards out. Focusing only on the one GBI (from a realism standpoint) would throw me out of the movie if I was super focused on that. \n\nOverall, I can see why some people wouldn\u2019t like it. I definitely do not agree that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst movie of the year\u201d or \u201cworst produced movie\u201d. It\u2019s just a movie that was made in a manner that won\u2019t appeal to everyone and that\u2019s okay. \n\nWhat do I know though? I\u2019m also a huge fan of VelociPastor. ",

        "content": "[***TV Editor Sabrina Barr reviews The Witcher Season 4***](https://metro.co.uk/2025/10/30/witcher-season-4-netflix-will-face-backlash-give-a-chance-24564507/)\n\nIn 2022, it was confirmed that Henry Cavill would be stepping down as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher and would be replaced by Liam Hemsworth, which returns today with season 4, officially marking the changing of the guard.\n\nWhen the news first broke, fans across the world claimed that the show would never be the same, and might as well be considered as finished.\n\nI won\u2019t lie \u2013 when the first episode opened with a Geralt who was not Henry, I was taken aback. It felt odd to watch someone else\u2019s face with the protagonist\u2019s signature white hair and bulky armour. Almost as though his head had been superimposed onto another body.\n\nHowever, the way that they introduce Liam into the series is smart, bringing his version of Geralt into the fold through a romanticised retelling of their adventures in a storybook. As strange as it was at first, I became accustomed to Liam being in this universe faster than I thought I would, and quickly came to the realisation that he more than holds his own. He\u2019s not trying to imitate Henry \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, if he did just try to mimic his predecessor, he\u2019d be ripped to shreds for doing so.\n\nNonetheless, he still maintains the essence of Geralt, while bringing his own flair to the role. I have to give him credit for taking up a mantle that he knew came with a lot of baggage, and not being afraid to try something different.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of The Witcher, if you enjoy fantasy, if you love losing yourself in other worlds, then season four should be right up your street. There might be some viewers who are critical of the direction of the season after Henry\u2019s exit, but you won\u2019t know what you think of it unless you give it a chance.",
