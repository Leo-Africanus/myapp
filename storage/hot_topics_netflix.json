If not, then why build it so large? If so, then how would he have controlled it? To me this seemed like he wanted to build something big enough that it would seem credible for a small person to fit inside when he called the police.  \n\nAnother thought\u2026 when the kid said \u2018I thought we were doing this for a show,\u2019 I think it spilled the beans that he was always planning to \u2018accidentally\u2019 let the balloon go so he could call the FAA. (Who would ever think to call the FAA?! That clearly seemed planned). So I\u2019m wondering if  it\u2019s possible his kid going missing was not the original plan but just became part of it. Either way, I think jail time was suitable. Thoughts?",

        "title": "Old Guard 2 - did you notice?",
        "content": "So here\u2019s my Old Guard 2 questions: \n\n1- So Quynh is out, but she speaks modern language fluently after 500 years? Also she is completely sane and in control? Does this whole immortality and healing thing applies to mental health as well? \n\n2- did they use young face filters on Charlize ? She doesn\u2019t look normal. Too smooth and toned face like instagram filters. Or is it just me? \n\n3- Discord - completely useless character?! She is the first immortal. Ok, but no background story at all? Tua\u2019s speech implies - he said \u201cshe is the first immortal by design\u201d. Meaning what?? She was designed? Or is it some English phrase I\u2019m poorly understanding (English isn\u2019t my 1st language).\n\n4- the whole immortality lore - Nile being the last one and she is the destroyer because she has the same mark with Discord. Ok but how and who or what decides it? Why now? And how exactly Book gave up his immortality to Andy? Just by thinking about it? I thought there may be some hug or physical touch, some glow or at least something that implies \u201chey it\u2019s done\u201d. But just thinking about it transfers immortality? \nEven let\u2019s say Nile is the destroyer, then how the F the other immortals died before? How Discord is mortal? Is that because their mentality or body gives up? Discord doesn\u2019t seem like she gave up on her immortality. I mean in that case Book would\u2019ve died long ago. How those book lore\u2019s created and by whom? There were times when immortals were known or designed ? I thought Andy was just worshipped as a Goddess. But that was it.\n\n5- storyline was WAAAY off - Andy\u2019s mortality and second immortality wasn\u2019t even revealed. That would be badass if Discord just thought Andy was mortal, may be she would even try to approach her and lie about working together for cure, and then betray her by taking all other immortals, and in the last fight she learns Andy is immortal again, which is what she wants the most, and it would anger her so much and that would\u2019ve lead to more aggressive fight sequence? That would be cool. Now, Quynh herself is mortal too. And she is so cool with it? And nobody said to Quynh \u201cyo, Discord actually let you get captured and thrown into the ocean.\u201d I was like \u201cSAY SOMETHING TO HER\u201d.  Quynh would turn against Discord in the end. And this whole bomb sequence? That was just out of nowhere? \u201cOh hey come to me or I will blow up this country?\u201d And then \u201cI wanna end you because you help people\u201d. Excuse me ?! \ud83d\ude02 did they really sat down and wrote this ? I mean,  these are incredibly strategic immortals fought thousands of wars over the millennias. And this is the sequence you write for these characters\u2019 battle? Chatgpt could\u2019ve written better scenario than this. Discord\u2019s stabbing Tua in the beginning - for what exactly? \u201ci need some books about myself so people don\u2019t know who am I, so lemme stab your immortal ass real quick\u201d. Yeah OK. They were literally pals for centuries, he can tell everyone. And Tua is doing what exactly? Immortal librarian? Sounds cool tho \ud83d\ude02 And what was the scene with Quynh and Andy in the past? No explanation? Am I missing something ? I hope I do, cause that was left out. \n\n6- Fight sequences - the 1st movie fight sequences were the highlight of the movie, they were delicious to watch, old combat styles mixed with modern styles? There was a whole video about choreographing Andy\u2019s fight style. They actually spend time on it. Now in this one? It seemed robotic, weird. First fight scene in the mansion was ok, but other scenes later on? Downgrade from the 1st movie. I was expecting something epic in the last battle with Discord and Andy. And that scene was like someone sketched a good portrait and a toddler scribbled on it. There were good parts but execution and delivery was OFF. \n\n7- acting and directing - Quynh actress: yeah, she didn\u2019t deliver the character. She was slow, kept zoning out of the character, she looked badass and fights scenes were ok, but when she spoke she was speaking like someone just learned how to act, the only time I felt power in her was when she spoke mandarin when she cursed Andy. I was like \u201cdamn girl where was that power in other scenes before?\u201d Uma Thurman was just chilling in the movie. She was like - yeah lemme take a walk around the set and you capture me occasionally. She looked bored AF. I heard that she wasn\u2019t interested in the project because the shooting schedule kept changing. Can\u2019t really blame her if that\u2019s the case. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t feel right to see a sequel to this movie to be done this way. Old Guard 1 was epic. I\u2019m sad. \n",

I love how they use real life cases of psychopaths, interview them of why they kill their victims and then categorise them. I also LOVE the little cases they solve in local communities working with police. I wonder if those contextual cases are based on real stories or is it purely fiction? \n\nAs an African American, I was looking forward to a black FBI agent being portrayed however I appreciate they kept it realistic, their barely were any back then and most serial killers were young white males in late twenties and thirties and would not \nresonate or even respond with a Black agent especially during those times. But in season 2 I\u2019m glad they show a police officer in Atlanta who\u2019s black and he\u2019s very intelligent he impressed me quite a lot with his composure and capabilities. \n\nOverall the show is very impressive, the pace, the dark tone, the chilling atmosphere during those interviews. It reminds me of the criminal series on Netflix where they interview criminals and each mini series is based on a different country but same format.\n\nI will definitely recommend this show to friends and family. 10/10 show it\u2019s up there with narcos and ozark for me \n",

        "content": "Guys I feel like I\u2019m loosing my mind, I watched a Netflix documentary I want to say maybe five years ago, on a missing woman from a  cruise ship, I thought it was Amy Bradley, I remember it well, but now there is one released Ina few days about her? I\u2019m so confused? Mandela effect or am I thinking of a different persons doc, it was definitely Netflix, definitely a woman, definitely a cruise. Have they remade a new one on Amy Bradley?? ",

Some feel like the scripts were free or generated.\n\n\nThey do some really good stuff but the focus is not on it. Is that a weird algorithm thing of the app pushing stuff they flag?\nI don\u2019t think I see reminders a new season of something I\u2019ve watched is released, it\u2019s buried several rows down.",
