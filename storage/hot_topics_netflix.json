        "content": "I am just venting here out of frustration with the not so new anymore Netflix user interface. Many of you probably like it or have adjusted to it, as Netflix\u2019s own research would suggest, but I could not. I tried, I really tried. \n\nA discussion on the drawbacks of the interface has been exhausted so I will not get into it. What I would add is that I noticed that I have been recently spending more time on Apple TV and HuLu. Not out of stubbornness or revenge, but it came organically. The interface of all three platforms is now very similar with the Netflix one being mid pack. I can no longer tell the difference so I would watch whatever is good. I think the new Netflix interface is an opportunity for other streaming platforms to catch up with Netflix and get new subscribers. It might also be the beginning of Netflix\u2019s decline or at best plateau.",

I\u2019m so disgusted just searching her name looking for a discussion on this and seeing soft core porn of a 17 year old. It breaks my heart for her. \n\nThird, how is Tiffany not in jail?

        "content": "At first I thought that the whole spark thing was just a slang term for how psychic people with electrokinesis kinda  like how Wednesday is called a raven but is still considered to be a psychic.\n\nBut no now they are trying to make it sound like each is their own species and even making it where psychics can only get visions.\n\nIt just feels very sloppy and unorganized to me. They shouldn\u2019t identify each power as an individual species since it doesn\u2019t really seem to work like that and the first season kind of lead us to believe these were all under the psychic umbrella. \n\nAnd it depends on how much they get into it and how often these terms are used but i can see it feeling awkward and forced if we get a lot of new identifying terms like this constantly tossed around to apply to things that have existed since last season.\n\nIn the promo video ajax used the term davincci\u2019s which is likely in reference to what xavier could do so i guess thats going to be its own \u201cnew\u201d species now.\n\nIf psychics can only get glimpses of the past present and future then what are they going to do with people that have telekinesis? Since its also considered to be somewhat of a traditional psychic power, are they just going to call them movers or something?\n\nLike there are plenty of series where electrokinesis and pyrokinesis are also considered psychic powers they didn\u2019t need to go and try to differentiate them from being psychic all of a sudden. They could have just said that people utilize psychic energy in different ways and left it at that.\n\nI would have much rather them introduce new outcast species or give us more lore on the fangs,furs,scales, and stoners than whatever the heck it is they are currently trying to do with psychics.\n\nPs. A lot of this is in reference to the instagram promo videos so check that out if you haven\u2019t seen them yet before coming after me for making stuff up.\n\nAlso it would have just been smarter to classify Wednesday and her mother as seers and just split them up into types and give a name to the kind of seer that rowans mom was.\n\nIe. Raven, and doves are a type of seer.\n\n\nEdit: i also have three reasons why I think they are doing this.\n\n1. To be trendy and grab attention.\n2. To make it more palatable to mass audiences whot they think are too dumb/unfamiliar to understand mildly complex magic/power systems.\n3. To get out of introducing new outcast species this season by distracting people with new classifications.\n\nPretty sure at least the first two are right.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong tho still love the show and plan on watching season 2 im just gonna cringe whenever certain topics about the characters abilities come up.\n\nBut i do feel like they sacrificed some of the quality of the storytelling by doing this.",

English is not my native language :)**  \n  \nThe last epsiode shows a agent trying to understand the Carol's influence in office, in relation to the emotional epiphany in the Distraction. The final is discovered that the reason for epiphany is the own agent- in short.  \nThe influence of Carol is that she could bring a emotional conection, a individualization but in the same time a community that one cares about the other. The serie focus on the Carol's search for meaning and conection in the midst (I don't know if the translation is right) of a apocalipse. Carol looking for a value.  \nThe employees try don't lose the sanity with the permanence of the cycle, with the repetition from something that they had already done. They try justify their own existence in office, try distract themselves of the apocalipse. So Carol finds the value on monotomy, a satisfaction. She accepted her situation (the apocalipse) and her state (the work). There is a acceptation to death and routine, and with it, there is also a value.   \nThe insatisfaction about the death can be a insatisfaction about the life. Part of the despair of die is because the person didn't satisfied itself, because someone who stayed good don't care about the death, because this one has been already satisfied, has already with the life \"done\" with the things that the life gave.  \nThe people there stayed in comfort, and try to distract to don't thinking about the discomfort from death. Carol shows a balance between being satisfied with the atual situation but don't get attach, don't being dependent with the life.",

Its like the writer discovered the world of clich\u00e9s and thought it was GREATEST thing ever and incorporated them ALL into this one movie.\n\nMaybe disney had a point excluding any form of romance because wow did it piss me off everytime Jinu appeared on screen, GET A JOB!!! WHY ARE YOU HERE!! YOU'RE NOT CUTE!!!!! YOUR PETS ARE UGLY, IRRELEVANT AND WILL NEVER BE LOVED!!!!\n\nIt was weird how they were trying to both \"demons aren't all ugly and bad and you are VILE for ever thinking that you racist..\" and \"DEMONS ARE HORRIBLE. THEY MUST EXTERMINATED AND HAVE NO GOOD SIDES!!! EXCEPT JINU! JUST JINU! THE OTHER BOYS ARE.. UH..\"\n\nIt's not that I completely hated the movie, not at all!! I enjoyed the beginning ten minutes, I loved the art, I loved the songs.. everything else is garbage but!!\n\nGenuinely I get this was written for kids but you didn't need to make a child write it.. this could've been an equestria girls episode and they still would've done it better.",

It was a hit show, it had a following, it wasn\u2019t hidden in the depths of the platform. It could\u2019ve grown even more if Netflix actually supported it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one show. This is about the pattern. They cancel everything good, especially original, weird, dark, or risky stuff, and replace it with endless reality shows or bland reboots.\n\nWhy do they think viewers will keep trusting them with our time and emotional investment if they pull this every time?\n\nIt\u2019s like they only care about new signups, not long-term fans. They greenlight 100 shows and abandon 98 of them. How is that sustainable?\n\nI genuinely wish I could flood their inbox with 40,000 complaints, because clearly they\u2019re not hearing how angry people are. There\u2019s no point in starting new shows anymore if we know there\u2019s no closure. Same with keeping a subscription.

        "content": "Just finished The Old Guard 2, and while I didn\u2019t quit halfway through (so it wasn\u2019t completely unwatchable), I was definitely disappointed by how lazy and inconsistent the lore is. For a story about immortals from completely different parts of the world who are actively hiding from the rest of the world, it\u2019s weirdly convenient that they all seem to find each other across centuries with no real explanation of how or why. Still with that alone I would have been ok after all they all have centuries to run into each other, right?\n\nWhat really broke it for me was the mentioned connection between the first and last immortal (further explained only by a birthmark they both have for some reason) as well as the whole \u201clegend\u201d about the last immortal which would be born with the power to remove or transfer immortality. A legend someone somehow formulated likely thousands of years before the last immortal was even close to existing. How can there be legends about someone completely unique among a group of already special people nobody should even know about in the first place? The writing just didn\u2019t try at all to make the world feel coherent or believable, which is a shame because IMHO the premise definitely had some potential. If only they made the story based on a somewhat plausible lore (written first) rather than creating a garbage lore based on what they needed it to be to accomodate a raise of stakes for the sequel or whatever.\n\nAnyway what are your opinions random redditors?",
