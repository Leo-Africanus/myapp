I have ADHD (and am likely AuDhd) so my memory is complete garbage. I am very ritualistic about rating each thing so that I\u2019m aware if I\u2019ve seen it already.

Now I\u2019m wasting a bunch of time on just figuring this out and that\u2019s really frustrating.\n\nTied into the above, the recommendations are now showing A LOT of things I\u2019ve already seen which makes zero sense to me especially considering that I rate them so it\u2019s pretty clear I\u2019ve seen it from a data standpoint. \n\nFellow neurodivergent folks - what bothers you?\n\nNetflix UX really needs to do specific focus groups to help us with accessibility.
