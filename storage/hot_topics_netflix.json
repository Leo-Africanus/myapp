Yeah, no. Buhbye. Nailed the coffin shut.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this show was early to a very specific vibe that\u2019s everywhere now. Dark but cozy, absurd but oddly wholesome. Violent things happening while people argue about mundane nonsense. Basically existential dread with popcorn.\n\nShows like Ghosts are carrying that torch. Dead people. Ridiculous problems. Jokes that are dumb, sharp and self-aware at the same time. The kind of humor that doesn\u2019t try too hard but still sneaks up and punches you in the face. Politely.\n\nI\u2019m convinced this genre works because most of us are tired, mildly unhinged and coping through irony. We don\u2019t want prestige misery. We want chaos that knows it\u2019s chaos. We want death jokes that somehow feel comforting.\n\nAnyway, RIP Santa Clarita Diet. Gone too soon.\n\nTaken from us mid-bite.\n\nNetflix, I forgive a lot, but I will never forgive you for this one. If ever I get bitten, you know who I\u2019m coming for",

Entertaining for sure and I appreciated the plot twist no matter how ridiculous it was \n\nBUT There were quite a few plot holes. I can let things go, but the one that really bothered me was WHY WOULD ANNA BE MARRIED TO THE BROTHER OF A GIRL WHO WATCHED AND LAUGHED WHILE SHE GOT RAPED??\n\nSure, Jack was flawed, but an overall good man who loved Anna and definitely went out of his way to protect her, but still, you\u2019d think she\u2019d stay far away from those girls and anyone related to them, let alone marry a sibling. Those girls were just plain evil. And they didn\u2019t even have any remorse. Helen making a comment about her dead child? Zoe giving her the finger and telling her to stop holding a grudge??\n\nI wish there had been some backstory of how she and Jack got together. Anything that would explain how she could possibly be content with Zoe being his sister-in-law. I thought maybe she fell in love with Jack before she knew Zoe was his sister? Or maybe she started dating Jack so she could keep Zoe close and somehow get revenge \u2026 but then accidentally fell for him?? Idk. At least some kind of explanation. \n\nAnyway, that is all. ",

        "content": "I have a question for people who have read Harlan Coben books.\n\nI have seen some of his adaptations on Netflix. My feelings are...pretty mixed overall. I'll get into it soon. The point is: I hear the books are actually great and get butchered by adaptations. I just want to ask: is that true? I mean, are the books better? And if so, how?\n\nSpecifically, these are the adaptations I've watched so far and my opinions on them\n\n\\-You fool me once, british show. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, there were some stretches in logic, a couple plot holes and a few storylines that ended up not leading anywhere, but overall, it was pretty good and engaging\n\n\\-Caught, spanish show. I was pretty mixed on this one. Even more unresolved storylines, the mystery was not nearly as engaging, plus I think the main character is one of the most annoying main characters ever and I was actually rooting for the villain to kill her in the final episode.\n\n\\-The woods, polish show. This one I did not like. Pretty much all the characters are boring, pretty much all the storylines are pointless, the mystery is not that interesting and the answers we get aren't really worth the wait.\n\n  \nSo, if you have read the books those shows are based on, are they better?And what do they do that makes them better? Honestly, my main issue with all three shows is the overblown amount of characters and storylines, which results in most of them being underdeveloped. Is that problem present in the books or is it done better?\n\nIf you know, please tell me. Thank you for your time.",

        "content": "I just finished watching Season 2 of Unlocked: A Jail Experiment on Netflix, and I found it genuinely fascinating, but also far more disturbing than I expected. Compared to Season 1, this season felt much darker, more intense, and emotionally charged. I\u2019m curious how others on this sub experienced that shift.\n\nOne of the biggest things I noticed was how quickly things escalated in Season 2. The power dynamics seemed to form faster and more aggressively than in Season 1, where there was at least some attempt at cooperation early on. Do you think this was due to differences in the group of inmates, the environment, or the way the experiment was structured by the producers?\n\nAnother major difference for me was the overall tone. Season 1 felt more like a social experiment focused on rehabilitation and self-governance, while Season 2 often felt closer to a psychological pressure cooker. Some moments made me question the ethics of continuing the experiment under those conditions. Did anyone else feel that the line between observation and exploitation was crossed more often this season?\n\nI\u2019m also wondering how much the presence of cameras influenced behavior in Season 2 compared to Season 1. It seemed like some participants were more aware of how they were being portrayed.\n\nFinally, do you think there should be a Season 3? If so, what would you want to see done differently, or has the experiment already shown everything it needed to prove?\n\nCurious to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts",

        "content": "As a Palestinian, I was upset with Netflix that MO was only 2 seasons. It seems to obviously be rushed, so I don't think it was the original idea to only have it as 2 seasons. Clearly there were some ugly people that didn't want the show to continue and put pressure on Netflix.\n\nNow I could say that Netflix are cowards if that is indeed the case as I assume, however, I don't think that. If anything, Thank you Netflix for having the guts to allow this show to exist. To produce it and to put it on your platform. It truly is a hilarious, wonderful, heartfelt show that shows the struggles of Palestinians. I would say it is a love letter to Palestinians and our beautiful culture.\n\nThe actors were absolutely wonderful, and while some of it was just hard to watch, particularly MOs struggles. The show left me feeling good and hopeful.\n\nParticularly I loved the Thanksgiving get together at the farm. It was just beautiful to see all these people who are different come together because it felt they were all family.\n\nSorry if my post sounds corny, but I really did love this show so much.\n\nAnyway, for those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It's a brilliant, clever and outrageously funny show.\n\nThank you Netflix.",

        "title": "His &amp; Hers (Netflix/Book) \u2013 Genuine questions about character choices",
        "content": "Spoilers for His &amp; Hers (Netflix) and the novel\n\nFirst, I want to be very clear up front: this post is NOT victim-blaming, minimizing assault, or being insensitive. The show covers extremely heavy subject matter, and I\u2019m asking these questions in good faith to better understand the characters, their psychology, and the story\u2019s themes.\n\nI just finished His &amp; Hers on Netflix and was genuinely caught off guard by several of the later revelations. I\u2019m still processing some of the character choices and was hoping people who\u2019ve watched the show and/or read the book could help expand on them.\n\nMy main questions:\n\n1. Why did Anna get involved with Jack at all, knowing he was Zoe\u2019s brother?\n\nAnna\u2019s trauma stems from what happened when she was 16; when her friends Zoe, Rachel, and Helen orchestrated the assault, sold photos, and then watched, laughed, and mocked her while it happened.\n\nKnowing this, Anna choosing to be with Jack (Zoe\u2019s brother) was odd?\n\nWas this relationship meant to show:\n\n\t\u2022\ttrauma bonding or unresolved attachment?\n\n\t\u2022\ta way of reclaiming control over her past?\n\n\t\u2022\tself-punishment or denial?\n\n\t\u2022\tor is there more internal context in the book that the show didn\u2019t fully explore?\n\n2. Why is Lexy (Catherine) so fixated on Anna years later?\n\nCatherine/Lexy was also a victim, but she ran away and left Anna behind in the woods. Yet as adults, Lexy seems to direct an intense amount of blame, resentment, and obsession toward Anna.\n\nIs this survivor\u2019s guilt turning into projection? Or does the novel give more insight into her mindset and how she rationalizes this?\n\n3. Did anyone else expect the reveal to be \u201cless extreme\u201d at first?\n\nBefore the woods scene, I honestly assumed the trauma might be centered on bullying or humiliation..not the calculated setup, photos, and assault itself. That escalation completely blindsided me.\n\n4. And bluntly\u2026 how are we meant to interpret Lexy getting her own sister killed? \ud83d\udc80\n\nI understand trauma can seriously distort judgment, but this was downright psychotic. Is Lexy meant to be seen as someone spiraling, or as a cautionary example of unresolved trauma turning destructive?\n\n5. For book readers: what did the show change or leave out?\n\nWere there:\n\n\t\u2022\tinternal monologues or motivations cut from the adaptation?\n\n\t\u2022\tchanges to character dynamics (especially Anna, Jack, Alice or Lexy)?\n\n\t\u2022\tplotlines or reveals that were simplified or altered?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate if novel readers could expand on whether the book gives clearer psychological grounding for these choices, or if the ambiguity is intentional.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in thoughtful discussion from both show-only viewers and readers.",
