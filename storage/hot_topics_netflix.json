The spacing and editing made me wish the 2x speed play feature was available on the tv. \n\nI wished it was more buttoned up because the investigator shared some good info but it\u2019s a slog to get through and it feels like not enough people will see it. \n\nWhat did you think?

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently mapping different home devices to different outbound IPs. What special SNAT rules should I add to my router specifically for Netflix to make sure that my devices are seen as being in the same Netflix household? Currently I have something like this:\n\n    INTERNAL_IP_1 -&gt; PUBLIC_IP_1\n    INTERNAL_IP_2 -&gt; PUBLIC_IP_2\n    INTERNAL_IP_3 -&gt; PUBLIC_IP_3\n    ...\n    \n\nShould I SNAT all packets destined for Netflix ASN IPs with the same outbound IP? Would that be enough?",
