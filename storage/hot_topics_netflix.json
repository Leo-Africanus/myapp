Currently the only way to do this is to fast forward until you reach the live spot.  \n\nHopefully someone from Netflix sees this and makes it happen.",

I use it via my PC via internet browser, my Dad uses it via his LG smart TV, and my mom uses it via her Panasonic Smart TV.\n\nMy parents live together in the same house, and the smart TVs are connected via Wlan to the internet. But since like 4 days the Netflix App doesn't work anymore on my mothers TV. It always shows like no connection. Even though the TV has internet, because the YouTube app still works just fine.\n\nIt shows a error code: NW-4-8 ( if i remember correctly, if not will update you tomorrow). Then I read you should put the power away from the TV and from the Internet router. So I did that for like 1 Minute and put the power back on, but still the same. It's still not working and still same error code.\n\nCan someone help? Anyone has a solution? If you need the excact panasonic model, I can tell you tomorrow.\n\nThanks and merry christmas\n\nHave a nice evening\n\nPS: My mom said she did update the TV, but still didn't help\n\nPS2: On the TV I just turned off the power strip (cause you don't really have access to the cable itself without moving the TV), and on the internet router I unplugged the power cable\n\n  \nUpdate: So she just took a few pictures. But she said she tried to delete the app, but didn't work. But coulnd't test it myself, but i belive her \ud83d\ude05\n\nShe said TV is around 10 years old. Didn't expect it to be that old.. So is the TV really to old now to get Netflix access?\n\n  \nHere the pictures - [https://ibb.co/pKYNnYF](https://ibb.co/pKYNnYF)",

        "content": "I just finished watching the entirety of the new season of Squid Game, and to say I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement. It is not bad by any means, but in comparison to its glowing predecessor, it falls short in every way. It felt like I was watching a new action/thriller movie halfway through, and there are so many underdeveloped storylines mixed in. What has occurred in the years that have gone by since the last season? I get that 456 became immersed in hunting down the creators of the game and stocked up on weaponry, but that\u2019s basically all the info the show gives us. \n\nAnyways, without giving away spoilers, I thought the ending of the season felt extremely out of place and even unfinished. I genuinely had to look up if Netflix was releasing the new season in 2 separate parts because of how unfinished it felt. So much is left unanswered, and so many new storylines are created when the old ones have not even been finished yet. Season one felt immersive and created emotional connections in relation each character; season two just feels like a cash grab for a show that never needed a second seqson. ",

I encourage you to watch the series to fully understand my review.\n\nIf i had to describe the series so far in one word itd be:\n\n1. repetitive\n2. frustrating\n\nI just finished watching all 7 episodes and I gotta say it was subpar. The events were too obvious, foreshadowing was shallow, plot twists were also obvious, their voting order was obvious. The show was made far too obvious. I think the games that the characters had to survive in were formed to be alot simpler, to accommodate for western viewers that arent familiar with korean games. Not alot of scenes actually made me surprised, nervous or excited. However, I did feel alot of frustration to the mc's inability to manipulate his peers better.\n\nAs I was watching the series I also realized that the 'surprise' factor was no longer present because of its reoccurring themes from sg1. i.e. the format of the episodes, the methods that characters were developed, how characters reacted in situations...\n\nImo the only good parts of the film were:\n\n1. some metaphors\n2. symbolism\n3. character development\n\nJust to conclude, if you watch this movie off pure dopamine its good. If you use your cognitive ability the series is trash. Imo movies like the joker, joker 2 have a lot more depth to the scenes and are significantly better.\n\n(i didn't want to include too many sections that I did enjoy so that you too can enjoy it. Im not shitting on the series just saying what i think of it).\n\nPlease tell me your thoughts on the movie in the comments.",
