        "content": "I\u2019ve been debating what the saddest/ most emotional movie I\u2019ve see on Netflix was, but I want to know what you guys think. For me, the simple movie called Straw was so emotional and I loved the ending. A similar movie that just twisted me the wrong way was \u201cIn the Tall Grass\u201d. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it sad as much as I would call in unfortunate or confusing. But what do you guys think, what\u2019s the saddest movie on Netflix??",

        "content": "As you guys all probably know, Stranger Things ended just about 2 months ago and looking back at the 4 months I watched it in, those were some of the best days because a show can just leave that impact. Now, it wasn\u2019t just the actual show that made it amazing, getting to watch it with my brothers and cousins, late night watches, and watch parties with some of my favorite people for S5 all contributed to making it my favorite show! Now I know I cannot replicate some of those factors, but an amazing, hooking, emotional show can help start the process of finding a show to cover up the sadness from ST being over. Please recommend a show you think I should watch that will start another stage of happiness and deep thoughts and conversations related to the show. Maybe a show that you just personally loved or even a show where you had a similar experience as I did! Anything, just please give recommendations for shows on Netflix that I will fall in love with. (Show could be on Disney +/Hulu as well)",

Pero no cuadra ya que tienen el mismo ADN, as\u00ed que en alg\u00fan momento de otra L.T. (Linea temporal) antes de la muerte de la hija de Panida, se esfumo por las primeras rupturas temporales que experimento Panida, y la Varee de 2024 (En la L.T de la serie) la adopto, y en esa L.T. se quedo en b\u00facle a raz\u00f3n de las rupturas temporales.\n\nPor el momento esa me convence, de ser otra resulta en un final incestuoso que continua con la nieta, bisnieta, tataranieta, etc. De Panida.  \nAunque el padre no sea el coronel, ya que el mismo lo admite, la panza de Varee-Min sigue ah\u00ed por lo tanto el incesto sigue presente. Okey, ya me volv\u00ed a contradecir. Ya que Varee-Min tiene una panza de embarazada a menos que no sea, supongo que mi anterior teor\u00eda tiene sentido.\n\nEntonces.. que tal que haya tenido relaciones consigo misma con una Varee del 91 (pero hombre) que por las rupturas temporales (y lineales) vino a otra linea en el mismo tiempo y tuvo una hija con la Varee- Esto est\u00e1 muy revoltoso. (por no decir turbio)\n\nBueno.. \u00bfalguien tiene otra teor\u00eda o queda como paradoja o inconsistencia?",

        "content": "New to the forum.\n\nI was always told I would like West Wing, but I have only recently started binging it on Netflix.\n\nI just finished the episode \"In Excelsis Deo\" and it moved me to take the time to share this recommendation.\n\nThe episode can stand alone but there are multiple threads happening in the arc that you will miss...but the main story is about military service, and loss and the honor due and so often unpaid for their service.\n\nI'm 57 - never served myself, but my life was influenced by my father's Vietnam service, which has been a scar on his soul that also wounded us all.\n\nMy father had never seen the Vietnam Memorial and DC - he always wanted to but only got to see the small traveling version some years ago when it passed through his town.\n\nBoth my parents are getting near the end of their lives. I took my parents to DC so he could see it before it is too late. It was a dream of his since it was built.\n\nIt was powerful moment and life event for us all.\n\nI had been to DC but never seen the Korean memorial somehow. Didn't even know it existed which is a shame as it is very powerful.\n\nAfter we spent some time at the Vietnam Wall, we wandered through the park with no particular plan. We approached the Korean memorial without knowing it was there, and as we came up through the trees, the soldier statues appeared like phantoms emerging from the shade cast by the trees we walked through.\n\nIt was a powerful and eerie experience. Like ghosts emerging from the dark I was very impressed and now see that memorial as probably the most powerful in DC. I mention it because the episode features it in the story.\n\nAnyway, I have not often been moved to share something like this, but I thought it was worthy. I found the story moving and beautiful, and my friends were right - so far, it is an excellent show...made only more engaging and honestly, frustrating by the current state of the country.\n\nIt is hard to see a dramatic representation of the presidency and government that is at least somewhat reminiscent - and even, to some degree - honorific - compared to the current permanently stained version of the office. The contrast is actually quite sad, while also giving me some much-needed hope - if only a little bit - hope that maybe in the future we might see something closer to what we once thought of it.",

        "content": "Dearest gentle reader , \n\nAs the S4 is in gossip already, this OP likes to tell her audience that I very much liked beloved Sophie and benedict and the bond they harboured, heavens forbid , I even had a steady feeling that I MIGHT like them as much as I enjoyed Kate and Anthony. But , my dear reader , as the S4 progressed , I realised the love, the bond, the chemistry, everything Kate and Anthony had, bewitched my heart on a level that even though I loved Sophie and Benedict so much , it was impossible for op to love them like little edwand's parents. \n\nAs the season came to an end , I would like to admit that the show could've been a done a lot better if whistledown was still a mystery.

        "content": "Recently I was struggling to get DTS 5.1 surround sound working on my Roku streaming box. Everyone online was saying how incredible the surround sound is with Stranger Things season 5, but I was only getting sound out of my front speakers. \n\nIt turns out there's a little known Roku setting called Volume Mode that disables 5.1 surround sound. Somehow my Roku was set to Volume Mode \"Leveling\". Once I changed that to \"Off\", I was able to watch Stranger Things in glorious room-shaking 5.1 surround sound.\ud83d\ude01 I hope this tip helps someone.",

        "content": "I am situated in Germany and watch Netflix from here. My system language, browser language and netflix's website language are all set to english.\n\n  \nSO why is it, that the video of the episode, for example with supernatural, which started with this BS at S6E1, display german texts. Usually it's \"The road so far\" and then a \"now\", but now it's \"das letzte jahr\" ( the previous year ) and \"heute\" (today). \n\nThis was an issue before but i didn't use netflix for a while, and i reeeeaaally HATE the fact that i get shown a different video, depending on my location. Put it in the subtitles and be done with it.\n\n  \nIs there any hidden setting or something i overlooked to fix this? Please please tell me there is.",
