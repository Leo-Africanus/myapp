        "content": "Has anyone else heard rumors of Netflix doing a second season and covering all the child exploitation and CSAM legal troubles that Passes is facing? Would be interesting to see how they handle as I thought season 1 was fascinating and abhorrent. \n\n\n\nI like how they focused on the blame the parents share, which would be interesting with Passes since they required parental consent for the under 18 creators, though there's claims they allowed a few creators around that. Also a platform making $$$ off of selling bikini pics of 12-year-old girls is wild. Would be pretty explosive as Alec Celestin recruited and partnered with Lucy Guo who is now the \"youngest self-made female billionaire\".\n\n  \nAny other ideas for a second season?",

        "title": "Squid Game kinda lost its original theme in season 2 and season 3.",
        "content": "**A bit of context first:** I was one of those people who watched *Squid Game* as soon as it dropped back in October 2021. I was genuinely thrilled that the show was getting the attention it deserved, and I was really hyped for the upcoming seasons.\n\nThat said, I have to admit\u2014I\u2019m disappointed with how *Season 2* and *Season 3* turned out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re outright bad, but they lost the original theme and depth that made *Season 1* so impactful. The first season was a sharp commentary on Korean society, particularly capitalism. It portrayed a world where the lives of the poor were reduced to entertainment for the ultra-rich\u2014a brutal but honest reflection of societal inequality.\n\nIf Netflix plans to create a U.S. spinoff\u2014or one based in any other country\u2014I hope they do more than just swap Korean actors for American ones. They need to research and present social commentary that fits that country\u2019s context. Otherwise, it\u2019ll just feel hollow.\n\n*Season 1* worked because it explored the darker side of capitalism and the widening gap between rich and poor. Even the twist with Player 001 being the mastermind added a layer of complexity that elevated the story. *Season 2* tried to pivot toward themes like democracy and how easily the masses can be manipulated when money is involved, which had potential, but the execution fell flat. By *Season 3*, the games didn\u2019t feel as engaging, and the characters were far less memorable. It felt like people were dying left and right without much emotional weight.\n\nEven the subplot involving the soldier with PTSD, which initially added a sense of mystery, ended up being disappointing\u2014especially when it turned out he was lying the whole time. The police officer, who had so much intrigue in the first season, felt completely useless across the next two. And Gi-hun\u2019s death, all for the sake of the baby\u2014only for him to never meet his daughter\u2014felt like a bitter conclusion that didn\u2019t land emotionally.\n\nNow there\u2019s talk of a *Squid Game USA* and even a whole cinematic universe. Honestly, I think that\u2019s a bad idea, especially considering how the quality dipped in *Season 2* and *3*. I don\u2019t want this to turn into a franchise where the core idea becomes nothing more than \u201crich people watch poor people suffer,\u201d stripped of any real message or nuance.\n\nI can talk about this more",

There's nothing that's gripping about them.

Now, I'm trying so hard to focus my mind and giving it a chance to barely excite me, but I'm getting bored every passing minute. Please give me suggestions ! ",

After the first few episodes my tops were 1)SZN4, 2) Soulidified, 3)3Quency and Sweet Seduction could have fought for 3 if not for Allison\u2019s attitude cause they all really could sing. Overall I appreciated the judges eliminating bands based on chemistry and their overall blending. By the last episode though I loved the powerhouse voices of SZN4, I definitely believed they could have been more dynamic. I wanted to see a little 1,2 step. 3Quency brought we their voices, entertainment, and chemistry. They deserved the win.  \n\nIn comparison I think about Season 2 of Rhythm and Flow. Watching that felt so frustrating in comparisons. It felt like quite a few mediocre acts moved along too far in the competition. Why was the ultimate winner given kudos for getting the basics of his craft right while his opponent was giving A+ performances from day 1. The premise of the show was to find the best rapper, not go on potential. It felt like the judges were focused on their own preferences rather than what the premise of the show was based on. ",

        "content": "Just finished the last season of The Sandman, and something struck me that I can't stop thinking about: there\u2019s no clear villain. Actually, there\u2019s no real villain at all.\n\nSure, we have Lord Azazel arguably the closest candidate. But can you really call a demon a \"villain\" when evil is literally his nature? He\u2019s doing what demons do. There's no moral twist, no manipulation, just raw, elemental ambition. Even Lucifer, who I fully expected to be the looming big bad this season, didn\u2019t take that role. And honestly, I was a little disappointed she didn\u2019t even show up at Morpheus\u2019 funeral. I kept waiting for her to appear, one last move, one final word but no. Her absence almost said more than her presence could have.\n\nThe beauty of this season, I think, is how conflict arises from duty, grief, pride, and change rather than a singular evil force. Morpheus isn't fighting villains; he's navigating consequences. Everyone's following their nature, their role in the grand cosmic dance, even when it clashes with others. And that makes it all feel more... mythic? More tragic? Definitely more human.\n\nCurious if anyone else felt the same. Did you miss having a \"main antagonist\"? Or did the lack of one make the story hit harder?\n",

I went to log into it on my TV and it said my email didn\u2019t exist in their system??? I got the confirmation email after I created my account so I\u2019m confused what happened. I logged out on my computer to see if I could only have it on 1 device but now I can\u2019t log back in at all. \nHas this happened to anyone else??? Is there some sort of waiting period or trick I need to do?? heeeellllpppp",

I just want to know if this is a glitch or if I actually have to do that. My parents are older and sometimes it\u2019s hard to do the whole \u201csending verification code thing\u201d \ud83d\ude2d.
