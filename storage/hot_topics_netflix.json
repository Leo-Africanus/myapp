What really struck me was how the show captured the pettiness and cruelty of human nature how people would rather cling to the throne and their power than save actual lives. That layer made the story so much more haunting than just the undead.\n\nAnd the acting? Absolutely top notch. Every performance carried so much weight that I found myself invested in every character\u2019s fate, even the ones I hated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been putting this one off like I did, don\u2019t.

They deftly explore the difficult emotions these characters feel with both humor and genuine honesty. From things like self acceptance (Ben) and fear of dating again (Catherine) to the much more serious undertones of missing a parental figure and wanting to have friends (Ester), and family trauma/relationship dynamics (Nathan and Catherine). The characters feel very truthful, their flaws explored with their good intentions and love for each-other ultimately coming through. \n\nThey touch on these topics while still providing room to develop them, leaving the audience not only excited for more world development but also excited to explore these characters on a deeper level. You can feel the passion from the creators in each episode. \n\nI\u2019m so impressed and excited for this show and really hope Netflix invests in it properly. If they do it could absolutely be a classic! I certainly already have it on my rewatch roster and this season alone is one I know will be watched over and over again :) \n\nThank you to everyone who created and worked on this show for giving us such a gem!

        "content": "I miss the old days streaming. There was a time when Netflix was THE place to be for creative filmmakers  and experimental ideas. Now it seems like every new show that comes out is a remake of the last hit show. Netflix has become YouTube. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the latest Jason Bateman Netflix vehicle. Like Ozark, Jason Bateman directed a few episodes of Black Rabbit and even Laura Linney came back to helm an episode. The new series mostly looks great even if the Dolby Vision presentation is too dark at times. The writing however is abysmal. The writer Zach Baylin, wrote Will Smith\u2019s Oscar winner King Richard and The Crow. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the story of two brothers. Jude Law\u2019s character Jake operates a popular NYC restaurant while Jason Bateman portrays Vince, an addict that has a penchant for trouble. Vince is barely scraping by in Reno, NV when things take a horrible turn. Desperate, he calls his brother Jake for help and he secures a ticket to New York. We soon find out this is a habit for the brothers. Things take a turn for the worse when it\u2019s revealed that Vince has an outstanding debt with a local mobster. \n\nOh and I forgot to mention, the show starts with the climax. You know, because there has to be a hook to grab the viewer. I guess competent plotting wasn\u2019t an option here. \n\nOkay, here\u2019s the problem. The characters make the most illogical choices over and over again. Just when you think they\u2019ve got everything under control some new contrivance shows up out of nowhere and the characters make the wrong call yet again as if they do not know how to operate in their own world. Vince is a menace. A tornado destroying everything and everyone in his path, and not only does he take zero responsibility for his actions, but he blames it on the people trying to help him. Most of the characters are unlikable. Much like Ozark but this show is somehow more miserable. \n\nUnfortunately this show feels like a watered down version of Ozark which in itself was a flimsy knockoff of Breaking Bad. It even features the same style of title cards. I feel like I just watched this show. Successful family, seedy underbelly, and a secret. Last time it was called The Waterfront. Or Bloodline 10 years ago. Wait, has Netflix been doing this the entire time?",

Goosebumps. \n\nor when I saw bruno in 2009 the whole place erupting with laughter for the whole film, i'll always remember how I felt in that moment, it really was a magical experience all of which has now firmly become a thing of the past with the introduction of streaming services like netflix &amp; what not. \n\nIt really is a shame how the cinema died off &amp; I miss it greatly.

(Yes, I was just trying to use the thing which I paid for).\n\nBut apparently, since I'm using Linux, I'm unable do so.\n\nAll the content was tagged as HD and the video stats showed that I was streaming 720p content.\n\nSo, I reached out to customer support regarding streaming 4k content using the Netflix Web Application and their advice was to install Windows 11, since \"Linux is an outdated OS\" (as quoted by their customer support chat rep).\n\nI do admit my \"***lack of research\"*** for not reading the browser support for linux which is nested deep down inside 2 links in the Pricing page, but I told them to cancel my subscription and got a no questions asked refund immideately.\n\nIt is really frustrating that this is still an issue.",

        "content": "Hello, I'm a languages student and I want to start listening to some films/series in foreign languages (French and Spanish). The problem is that I don't like watching movies or series, but I know it's a good way to learn new words. I like only few things and I wanted to rewatch some series that I've liked in a different language, but they're not available on Netflix. I've changed the application and the mobile's language but I still don't have the translation and I don't know what else to do. I wanted to watch Tokyo ghoul in French and Avatar (the anime) in Spanish. Is there a way to watch them in a foreign language on Netlifx? ",

I just really hope they don\u2019t cancel this show as there\u2019s huge scope for character development with more seasons. Overall it was very entertaining. \n\nReally good first season and I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s more. ",

You can pop them like m&amp;ms.\n\nSo the wrong Paris definitely did it's job, it was all of the above and entertaining and some parts had me dealing with a bout of secondhand embarrassment. (Hello mechanical bull, I'm looking at you and one very icky rider)\n\nI also love movies that poke fun at those reality dating shows like the bachelor, so that was a nice topper. Over all I thought it was pretty good for one of those crappy made for Netflix type movies. I like christmas-y ones so this was a nice change. \n\nMy personal favorite is still love hard though and a Christmas prince. \n\n\nThoughts, did you enjoy? \nI don't want to say anything that might spoil it but it's so predictable that I don't think anything could tell you what you'd already figure out. \n",

I was signed up for it the instant I saw the trailer. How is this show not the talk of the town on the sub right now? Great acting, overall great story. It was a bit like The Bear meets Uncut Gems to me, and I thought it was absolutely great.\n\nIf you're into the genre, please check it out, because these are the exact type of shows I want Netflix to make more of!",
