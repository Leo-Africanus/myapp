That night I threw on Love on the Spectrum to distract myself and there was this one woman who said something like Sometimes I feel like I love people wrong. And I just started crying cuz its how i feel [sometimes.Im](http://sometimes.im/) def doing everything I can but it lands wrong anyway. Why is it so easy to be misunderstood when youre doing your best? How do you explain that quiet doesnt mean distant and space doesnt mean disinterest?  \n  \nThe next day I put on an episode of Couples Therapytotal emotional spiral I know and Dr. Orna was working with this couple where one partner kept shutting down emotionally and said something like Its not that you dont feel it\u2019s that youre overwhelmed by feeling and freeze. And HOLY HELLL !!! I paused it and just sat there. It was my mirror, exactly me. Not cold just flooded. Weve been trying to work on things since I still have moments where I feel like Im speaking an emotional dialect no one else quite understands.He still gets frustrated and I still shut down.
