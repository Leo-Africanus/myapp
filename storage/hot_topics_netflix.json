French subs only.\n\nI don't know if you realize this, Netflix, but 60% of Belgians have dutch/flemish as their native language. That's what we call a \\~**majority\\~**.  \n  \nSo why do I get the feeling Netflix is only catering to the francophones? Is it because we Belgians are almost always depicted as french-speakers in American movies and shows?  \nOr is Netflix not able to afford the rights to dutch subtitles? We would even settle for English subtitles ffs.",

This is a worth a watch!\n\nAdding that I usually watch anime in cc. However, I find the voice dubbing of Frieren (the character) so soothing. Monotone, lack emotions or detached in some way and slow to interpret human emotions. Matches her personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have thoughts of who it could have been instead or the kind of motive I'd have preferred, but I won't share that either.\n\nMy only criticism is that the episodes should have been shorter. There were scenes that were longwinded and convoluted due to the length. It could have been 10-12 quick episodes instead of 8 super long ones. A minor nitpick I had is that the piano music they played sometimes was too similar to Only Murders in the Building. The piano music made sense because the characters in OMITB lived in an apartment where they used the elevator. \n\nOn a positive note, I thought the performances were all phenomenal. I absolutely loved Cordelia Cupp as a detective. I do wish the show had been set up for future seasons. She was very compelling as a lead. \n\n**What other murder mystery shows/movies have you seen?** \n\n I've Watched:\n\n* Psych\n* Monk\n* CLUE\n* How To Get Away With Murder\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* Murder Mystery &amp; Murder Mystery 2\n* Knives Out\n* Murder on the Orient Express\n* Sherlock Holmes (the movies and the show) ",

It\u2019s hard to describe this mix of moments from the show, memories from my childhood, memories of my kids, and the ambient worry I have in my head now. My wife doesn\u2019t watch intense shows, but I feel that we need to experience it together and speak about it. I was wondering if we could watch it with our older kid as well. I\u2019ve discussed the premise with him, and he seems interested (hard not to). \n\nI feel that watching/reading things together could be a great conversation starter for some topics. Kids and I still read books together before bed, and we had some great chats while reading \u2019The Body\u2019 and \u2018Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\u2019; and we\u2019re currently watching \u2018Atypical\u2019 together, which they really like and very keen to share their thoughts on.\n\nI\u2019m sure his perspective on Adolescence will be completely different from mine (as mine will be different from my wife\u2019s) and I\u2019m both interested and scared. The show doesn\u2019t give you any answers; it seems that everyone sees different things in it and relates to the characters in a different way. What will a teenage boy see in the story, what will their reaction be like, and what conclusions will he get to? How will he talk about it with his friends? Is it too intense?\n\nI know it very much depends on a kid and their sensitivity but what are your thoughts? Has anyone watched the show with their teenage kids?",

I couldn\u2019t help but feel like this moment had some deeper significance, but I\u2019m not sure I fully understood it.\n\nWas there something more to this visit that I missed? Was it meant to be symbolic of something? Would love to hear your take on it!\n\nEdit: [Hollywood Reporter interview](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-residence-finale-killer-revealed-showrunner-interview-1236169599/) with writer and showrunner Paul William Davies.\n\nIn the interview, Davies explains:\n\n&gt;\"In the very end, we see Cordelia make a pit stop to the White House again to speak with Nan Cox (Jane Curtin), who tells Cordelia she knew it was Lilly and that she could\u2019ve just asked her. Did she know all along?  \nI didn\u2019t know I was going to end with that scene, but I loved the two of them together in the first scene they did. I thought it was so dynamic. I really could see how much Cupp respected Nan in a way, like her honesty and how perceptive she was. It was important for Cupp to go back to her and tell her of all people, because she recognized there was an insight and honesty to her that I think she understood and really embraced. The idea that Nan was like, 'Oh, I could see that all the way. That woman was nuts.' That to me was just fun, because it is kind of believable, and I think almost believable to Cupp that she had that insight. The two of them were so delightful together.\"\n\nHonestly, this feels like an unsatisfying answer for why it was chosen as the final note of the show.",

He\u2019d also reposted her photos on to his own insta account, meaning his classmates would\u2019ve seen it. \n\ntake away all the other factors (Katie having her n*des shared, Jamie\u2019s blatant terrible  attitudes towards women, him trying to \u2018get\u2019 Katie at her weakest) wouldn\u2019t just her seeing his aggressive comments be \u201cjustification\u201d enough for leaving the emojis on his photos? \n\nWould it be a mature way to handle the situation? No. But she\u2019s 13. And comments/ messaging on social media is their language. But I can\u2019t help but think if a kid had made openly racist or homophobic comments on someone\u2019s photos which was seen my a classmate, then said classmate posted some emojis reflecting this\u2026. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbullying\u201d it would be calling a spade a spade. ",

        "content": "After watching Queen of Flow, Netflix shows me an ever rotating cast of telenovelas. Not all of them satisfy my cravings for popcorn television.  \n\nBut 4 episodes into Until You Burn, I am sucked in.  \n\nThe story here is a typical brother is seeking to avenge the death of his brother. It looks like he was murdered by someone a wealthy family or connected to them.  \n\nA few things of note in this telenovela compared to others I have scanned or skipped:\n- class theme are pretty typical, but this one is also layering in race on top of the class\n- since there is a race theme here, there are visible Black people and even supporting characters that get screen time and dialogue \n- I don\u2019t speak Spanish so I am watching with English subtitles. I know some words here and there but so some translations look a little funny\n- this show is set in the beach, at sea - really pretty visuals \n- the sounds track is great and seems to be covering a good selection of Colombian music \n- this doesn\u2019t seem to have any cartel angles which is such a common stereotype of Colombian shows, this seems to be a more basic poor guy gets revenge on rich people story - not unlike the show Revenge which I also really enjoyed. \n\nIf you like revenge dramas where the character is playing the long game to infiltrate, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this one, based on the first few episodes. \n\nIt also seemed to be super popular in Colombia - getting like 35-40% prime time viewers so that bodes well for an engaging 60 episodes. And it just finished its run in February so it made it to Netflix quick. ",

We even had her make a new email address and I sent an invite to that. She hasn't received it. And now whenever I try to send it again Netflix just keeps saying 'please try again later '. I don't even know. Just....can someone help on any way? Thank you",

For me, it will always be Archieve 81! \n\nIt was creepy, mysterious, amazing, and literally had what it takes to become a Stranger Things-level show, if not bigger. ",

        "content": "From the desensitised nature of the children in the school only asking for videos of the murder to the cheering and filming in the school fight as well has his friend casually lending him a knife to \"scare\" Katie. The pupils not listening to teachers who are emotionally and physically absent towards all of the children plus the children's refusals to take part/ care about the lessons or authority at all. This is even shown after Jamies  dad confronts the teens who vandalised his car laughing at his genuine struggle and emotion. Jamies behaviour towards women such as the psychologist and his mum and his immediate switches in attitude towards any male figures. The obsessive lying such as about pickles, marshmallows and his small ways of putting the psychologist down like calling her old or being rude about her sandwich as well as his mum where he says shes good at nothing but cooking roast. the obsession with media shown through his isolation into his bedroom after receiving a gaming set up. its not explicitly said he was watch the red pill andrew tate type media however its inferred. the detective who cannot connect with his son in the slightest due to his isolation and even the detective (I believe) viewing him as less than (due to his former popularity and the son not being popular). the way real society has received this media as well many people denying Jamie did it after CCTV showed explicitly what happened or justifying it due to Katies \"bullying\" which was just calling Jamie out on his genuine misogynistic views towards katie and girls in general. Believing he's better than other men as he didn't SA katie even thought he \"had the chance\" and after his guilt was discovered he less regularly said \"i didn't do it\" but switches to \"i didn't do anything wrong\" showing his rationalisation of his actions due to his veiws on women. This show is amazing i've never seen anything so real and so accurate of our society ever. I could write an essay about this show and these are just SOME of the tiny details in the show that i missed at first but its crazly well written and has a scarily accurate depiction of the disheartening youth culture currently so well. \n",
