Netflix has some great concepts and plots\u2014things that should, on paper, make for compelling shows or movies. But somehow, they often manage to stretch the story so much that it becomes boring, even frustrating to watch.Netflix shows are so slow paced.",

I'm tired of them pumping out series like candy, some of which in my opinion are really good, only for them to eventually get cancelled often times after just one or two seasons.\n\nIt's annoying. It's a disservice to subscribers. And frankly, I've been reading books of any series I find online now instead anyways because I've been so conditioned to just assume anything I like will eventually get cancelled anyways. \n\nAnd honestly? The books have been offering me a much better experience overall. I feel better, even if I spend all day reading a book or two, than I would've had I spent it binging a show. I also have the added confidence knowing that I'll be able to finish the series without getting pissed off after wasting so much time watching it only to find out it's cancelled later.\n\nSo yeah... books for the win! Depending on how into books I go I may honestly just get rid of my Netflix subscription altogether.",

        "content": "I first watched House of Cards when I was 15, and I loved it so much that I watched it multiple times ever since. I am also very much a subscriber to Frank's ruthless pragmatism, and was always wondering if it was one of those shows that seemingly glorify a character but are actually a critique or a satire, and well, luckily it's not. \n\nThe writer of the show has stated in multiple interviews that Frank is not a sociopath, he's a pragmatist who does the unpleasant thing when it needs to be done, that Frank isn't evil and that he doesn't operate on the concepts of right and wrong. It's clear from the interviews that if Beau Willimon doesn't fully agree with Frank he at least admires him. Funny enough, he said that when the first episode was about to be released they were warned that killing a dog in the first seconds of the show was going to cost them half their audience and they responded that those who keep watching are the right audience. \n\n&gt; I don\u2019t have a cynical view of politics. I don\u2019t see Francis Underwood as being cynical at all. He doesn\u2019t have an ideology. He\u2019s not driven by idealism, but he is an optimist at heart. He says, \u201cForward progress, momentum. Do something instead of nothing.\u201d That\u2019s an optimistic point of view.\n\nLinks to the interviews: \n\nhttps://deadline.com/2014/06/emmys-beau-willimon-talks-sociopaths-monsters-politics-in-house-of-cards-739745/?utm_source=perplexity\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2015/04/14/399590915/forget-right-and-wrong-house-of-cards-is-about-pragmatism-and-power?utm_source=perplexity",

This confuses me: how can the algorithm have changed completely in just half a day?\n\nAnyways, I logged into the account, changed the password, logged off from all devices. I enabled PIN verification for all profiles and verified email and phone number. What more can I do to ensure that these people can no longer access our account? Or should we delete the account altogether for safety and create another one with a different email adress?\n\n  \nThank you for your help! Any advice is appreciated.",

        "content": "In an Indian version of Squid Game, the show should definitely introduce many characters of different language groups and religions because India is really diverse with many different languages and religions. Some players can be North, South, East, West and Central Indian. I think it would be interesting if a Northeast Indian character is also in the story. Northeast Indians are Indians with East Asian features because most of them have Chinese ancestry. It would be interesting to see characters from different regions because the show can reveal how diverse India is. They should definitely show some Indian characters who are Hindi, Tamilian, Punjabi and Bengali even Indians with different religions like Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and maybe more Indians with other different religions. They could also show Indians with different skin tones like Indians with light, medium and dark skin tone even they could show some Indians with different ancestry. They can show some Indians with Persian and European ancestry. Some Indians with Portuguese and French ancestry like introduce some characters from Goa and Puducherry. They could introduce a character who is a Singaporean of Indian descent even they could also introduce an American, British or a Canadian of Indian descent. I think introducing a character who is a Malaysian or an Indonesian of Indian descent would also be cool idea. It would be interesting if they introduce a character who is an African university student because India is known to have several African students and they even talk about how they struggle with their lives in India due to their appearance. It would also be interesting if they introduce a Mauritian, Pakistani, Nepali, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Afghan and a Bhutanese character. They could also introduce VIPs of different nationalities like American, Russian, Chinese, Brazilian, South African and Arab (UAE). The mysterious island where the games are held can be located somewhere near and a bit far away from North Sentinel Island.",

        "content": "So, I\u2019m watching Netflix and on every show, it will not play the credits. And I\u2019m one of the few people who likes credits, they have nice music. You know that tiny screen it turns into when the credits play and asks if you wanna skip to the next episode? Doesn\u2019t play the credits. Highlighting that window just plays the episode over.\n\nThe Netflix is hooked up to the Sky Box, and the Sky Box has two other slave boxes connected to it. When you play Netflix on those TVs, the credits play. It\u2019s just the main box that doesn\u2019t play them. I was at one point told to turn the Sky Box off and on again to reset it, I even did a hard reset where I cut the power, and rebooted it, but nothing. No change. \n\nCan you help me fix it? Wednesday just started, and I like clicking my fingers at the end\u2026",

I know I need it to watch It's always sunny which should drop soon so I'm not too mad, but wondering what other films and shows are available on the higher priced service. ",

Is there an option in netflix, or do i need to download a firefox addon? I'm paying a subscription, I don't' want stupid ads for stupid phone games I'm not even using because I'm on my computer, so it doesn't even make sense. Repeat again I'm paying for this service, not for ads. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsublzbqdghf1.png?width=3512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6a1e34c1188c169b1ffe13c9f45b3e44ef2eb0a\n\n  \n",
