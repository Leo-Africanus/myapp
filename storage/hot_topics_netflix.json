Shaun walks patients through their options breaks down complicated medicalinfo and never talks down to them its the kind of care a lot of people just don\u2019t experience in real life. Most appointments I had feel rushed Lab results get thrown at me with no explanation or I get a quick everything looks fine with zero context. It leaves a lot of questions hanging and makes it hard to know what to do next or what even matters.Thats part of what led me to try out EurekaHealth. It\u2019s an AI tool that\u2019s built specifically for health questions not just general chatbot stuff. I use it to make sense of test results, get second opinions based on visit notes, and ask follow up questions I didn\u2019t get to bring up during appointments.  \nWatching The Good Doctor just kind of reinforced how helpful it is to have something that brings that kind of clarity and support into real life even if its through tech.",

In today\u2019s world that feels almost impossible.\n\nAnd then the layers of fake accounts, the endless lies, the way he kept the story alive for so long\u2026 it\u2019s wild. Was there someone else involved helping him cover tracks? Or was Bobby just that good at manipulation?\n\nAlso makes me wonder how many red flags got ignored or brushed off. Did he have access to some kind of insider info about her life? How did he always know what to say to keep her hooked?\n\nHonestly it almost feels bigger than a one-person catfish. Either he was way too clever or there\u2019s more to the story that\u2019s never been revealed.\n\nAnyone else feel like some pieces are missing here?",

        "content": "Honestly, I think Worst Roommate Ever made Jamison Bachman look way too one-dimensional. Yes, he was manipulative and parasitic for decades, but he wasn\u2019t openly violent until very late in life. What really stood out to me was how things escalated after he lost his pets.\n\nThe dog being taken away, the court banning him from having animals, then the cat dying while he was in jail \u2014 those weren\u2019t small things. Pets may have been his only real anchor, the only beings that didn\u2019t reject him. Once those were gone, plus his reputation in court and his brother refusing to house him, he basically collapsed.\n\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t fully buy the \u201che killed his cat\u201d angle \u2014 if he was such a bad pet parent, why were his animals alive and well for years? To me it feels more like two unstable people clashing (the last roommate probably had her own issues) until it became explosive. His suicide in jail also says a lot \u2014 not a guy who loved life ruining others, but someone full of self-hatred once stripped of control. Netflix flattened him into a villain, but the real story feels way more tragic and complicated.\n\nIf you look at people like Ricky Morrisey who scammed women and abandoned his dog, or con man like Todd Dean, that\u2019s much colder and more psychopathic than Bachman, who at least took care of his pets. Bachman spiraled after losing them, which shows he had attachments \u2014 twisted, yes, but real.\n\nWhat do you guys take on this? Why did the latest roommate took his dog? Some Reddit posts even suggest she had her own issues (e.g. drugs), which would make this more of a \u201ctwo unstable people colliding\u201d tragedy. If this was handled better, perhaps his brother\u2019s life can be saved. ",

        "content": "I had this fight with my partner that started because I didn\u2019t reply to a text for like 5 hours. I was deep in a task and totally lost track of time but he took it as me being cold or avoiding blla bllaa It escalated way more than it should. That night I threw on Love on the Spectrum to distract myself and there was this one woman who said something like Sometimes I feel like I love people wrong. And I just started crying cuz its how i feel [sometimes.Im](http://sometimes.im/) def doing everything I can but it lands wrong anyway. Why is it so easy to be misunderstood when youre doing your best? How do you explain that quiet doesnt mean distant and space doesnt mean disinterest?  \n  \nThe next day I put on an episode of Couples Therapytotal emotional spiral I know and Dr. Orna was working with this couple where one partner kept shutting down emotionally and said something like Its not that you dont feel it\u2019s that youre overwhelmed by feeling and freeze. And HOLY HELLL !!! I paused it and just sat there. It was my mirror, exactly me. Not cold just flooded. Weve been trying to work on things since. I use OurRitual on my own sometimes to help get thoughts straight before we talk it\u2019s structured but I still have moments where I feel like Im speaking an emotional dialect no one else quite understands.He still gets frustrated and I still shut down. We havent solved it at times I still avoid my phone for half a day and brace for the guilt when I finally open it but I\u2019m not pretending its nothing anymore. That\u2019s new.",

        "content": "something that\u2019s irked me is that their abilities came outta nowhere. like yeah yeah they got powers cause of sickle cell hence why it\u2019s called supacell but like it\u2019s not like sickle cell is like cancer where it comes from radiation or sum else it\u2019s an inherited genetic mutation, why didn\u2019t their powers just be a thing already like laying dormant in them? The thing that\u2019s annoying is there were people with powers in the very first sequence of episode 1 (a healer was tryna escape the organization\u2019s facility) and all their powers come in randomly later on at like different times (or I guess the same time technically cause it was different episodes but that\u2019s\u2026 kinda worse?!) Likee when the series kicks off they all randomly just acquire abilities this late in their lives with no rhyme or reason even though though sickle cell is a genetic mutation you inherit since birth and it\u2019s been established that there are already people with powers being held captive by the evil org feels a bit (immensely) hard for me to suspend disbelief ",
