        "content": "I literally wrapped this show up 20 minutes ago and WOW. I have some strong emotions on this one.\n\nSide note: I am by no means a critic. I just wanted to share my thoughts in case you were on the edge.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast from your typical detective show, mixing in lust, hatred, romance, and love into a twisted story. It was refreshing! Throughout the show I drew sharp comparisons between titles like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, with a distinct splash of the traditional detective themed Hollywood blockbuster. However, even then it was entirely different. \n\nThere is definitely something to be said about the predictability throughout this show. With modern day crime films, I often feel I have a solid grasp of when or how an event is going to take place or come forth, but not with this. This was entirely fresh and entirely unpredictable. The director does a fantastic job of steering the viewers mind; Pushing us to a prejudice and bias that even the most experienced crime thriller fanatics try to avoid. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and its many twists and turns.\n\nI say all this with some slight criticism. In order to accomplish such a rollercoaster of a plot line, I did feel there was a certain loss of realism. The general structure of the plot is gripping, but the actual substance of it can be slightly off putting. I felt as if some of the reasonings were a slight bit of a reach for my tastes, but could be well within the palettes of most viewers.\n\nFrom a cinematographic point of view, the show was well made. The scenery, the mood, and the pacing, was attractive to your typical crime thriller junkie. I have little to complain about aside from the pacing in the last episode. I felt as if there could have been a slight bit more to explore concerning the main protagonist and his trauma, but it was brushed off for the jaw dropping peak of the show (absolutely 100% unexpected). So yes, I will say the cinematography was well done. It\u2019s no Lord of the Rings or Interstellar, but it has more than enough to make the viewing experience pleasurable. \n\nAlso, there were so many morals and lessons put into this story. Maybe it\u2019s just me being impressionable, but I definitely felt there was some moving moments throughout. \n\nI strongly recommend this series and look forward to more similar work in the future. \n\n\n TLDR: Great series. It was a nail biter that had me constantly questioning my theories. There\u2019s some minor misgivings but they are made up for by other plot twists and so on. 8.2/10. Strongly recommend!\n",

        "content": "Why does Netflix, instead of properly separating One Piece by story arcs, split arcs like Zou and Whole Cake Island into \u201cPart 1, 2, 3,\u201d and so on?\nWhy does the Enies Lobby arc suddenly include a separate season called CP9, when it\u2019s clearly part of the same storyline?\nWhy are pre\u2013time skip episodes labeled inconsistently (Episode 1, 10, 30, 40, etc.)? And when new dubs are added, instead of continuing the arc, they\u2019re treated as entirely new \u201cseasons\u201d?\nAnd why are arcs like Reverse Mountain and a few other episodes labeled as a \u201cGrand Line\u201d arc, as if the Grand Line were a short storyline, when most of One Piece actually takes place in the Grand Line, not just a handful of episodes?\nThis makes the series unnecessarily confusing, especially for:\n\nNew viewers\n\nPeople following the dubbed version\n\nViewers who only watch on Netflix and don\u2019t use other platforms\n\nMy proposal:\n\nReorganize One Piece so that:\n\nEach arc is treated as its own season\nPre-arc and post-arc content is merged into the main arc\nFiller arcs are clearly labeled, so viewers know they can be skipped\n\nThe arcs would be organized as follows:\n\nRomance Dawn\nOrange Town\nSyrup Village\nBaratie\nArlong Park\nLoguetown\nWarship Island (filler)\nReverse Mountain\nWhisky Peak\nCoby and Helmeppo\u2019s Diary\nLittle Garden\nDrum Island\nAlabasta\nGoat Island (filler)\nRuluka Island (filler)\nJaya\nSkypiea\nG-8 (filler)\nLong Ring Long Land\nWater 7\nEnies Lobby\nIce Hunter (filler)\nThriller Bark\nSpa Island (filler)\nSabaody Archipelago\nAmazon Lily\nImpel Down\nMarineford\nPost-War\nReturn to Sabaody\nFish-Man Island\nZ\u2019s Ambition (filler)\nPunk Hazard\nDressrosa\nSilver Mine (filler)\nZou\nMarine Rookie (filler)\nWhole Cake Island\nReverie\nWano Kuni\nEgghead\n\nYes, this would result in 41 seasons, but honestly, that would make the series much easier and more enjoyable to watch. It respects the story structure and helps viewers understand where they are in the journey.\n\nWhat do you think?, Would this be clearer than Netflix\u2019s current system?",

        "content": "After the critics choice awards decided to give the show another go.  \n\nEpisode One.   Very chaotic.  It seems very peculiar that the police could break in and essentially tell nobody anything regarding what crime the kid was accused of. Maybe it\u2019s just western bias but every crime show has the cops entering saying your are under arrest for the murder if your next door neighbor blah blah blah.  But this episode did not actually reveal to the parents what happened until the video scene. That being said a very good episode.  \n\nEpisode Two.  I almost feel that you could toss this one in the rubbish bin.  Only thing of value was the possible murder weapon being talked about by someone.  The best friend became superfluous.  The only thing the episode kind of did was say that being a teenager these days is like lord of The Flies and the internet makes everyone vulnerable to abuse and counter abuse. \n\nEpisode Three.  The best episode by far.  The kid finally revealed his previously hidden personality.  She was great. \n\nEpisode Four.   Loved that they focused on the lives of those left behind.  Although the discussion about French kissing and A-Ha seemed quite ridiculous.  I greatly doubt there is any levity in a family preparing for their son to go to trial for murder.  ",
