It got cancelled on a cliff hanger. Its high production cost was cited. Fine, I guess. \n\n1899- had me hooked in the first few minutes. Cancelled. \n\nArchive 81- 8 episodes. The first one was slow to get through, granted, but by the end it was easily one of my favorite horror/suspense shows. CANCELLED. And it\u2019s certainly not the production costs since very little special effects were used. \n\nThere were more shows that got canceled, obviously, but these were the three that really got to me. Seriously considering cancelling\n Netflix now since all they seem to care about is producing trash. \n\n\n\u201cNew on netflix\u201d flair because it\u2019s ironically relevant.",
