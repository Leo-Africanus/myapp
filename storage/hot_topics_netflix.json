The story connects late, dulling the overall impact\n\nFinal Word:\nVisually gripping but uneven \u2014 a film that impresses more in mood than in emotion.\n\n",

Guillermo del Toro once again has proven he\u2019s the best director for the dark fantasy genre of our generation. Highly recommend this film. Loved the acting of Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz and Jacob Elordi. excellent casting as well. I can see this even getting some Oscar nominations. 5/5 for me. ",

        "content": "My main 3 streaming services are HBO, Hulu and Netflix(and YouTube premium, but that's a whole different beast), but I've used others before. I'm not talking about the content on these services or how any company manages their original content, etc. This is specifically about the UI and user experience\n\nWhen I boot up Netflix, it's always snappy, it's always easy to find what shows I've been watching and continue, the app lets me go to a series page BEFORE loading an episode, it's the best about knowing I want to restart a movie/show when the progress bar is near the end, the \"are you still watching?\" prompt is actually consistent. Nearly all of this stuff is either worse or non-existent on the other streaming services I use. Hulu makes me jump through hoops to get to a series page. HBO Max will throw up huge show banner ads I have to scroll through before I can start looking at my library\n\nMaybe there's other streaming services that compete with Netflix more in this regard, but it's something that's really been bothering me lately. If I'm bored and don't know what to watch, I'll boot up Netflix 95% of the time because browsing it feels good compared to my other options.\n\nDoes anyone else here share this opinion? I've tried googling it, but all the Reddit posts are complaining about what shows are available or just complaining about streaming in general",

I am so disappointed this show was cancelled, only found out just now upon finishing the series.  It is probably too late now to collect all of the amazing talent that made this happen, but I wish so much they would, or a different production company would.  Do you all think that is at all possible at this point?  One year out?  So often it takes series to become successful after 1 - 2 years into it\u2026 such an incredible shame to not have faith in this series, we need it now more than ever.\n\nI guess I just wish I understood the industry more than I do.  In my ignorant mind, I would think an old school, heavy clout, heavily connected actor like Jeff Goldblum, or any of the other high tier actors on the show, could call up Amblin Entertainment and the like and get it produced somewhere else if Netflix insisted on canceling it.

        "content": "So I'm now watching GLOW and am well into Season Two.  Just before creating this particular post, I searched to see if there was already a GLOW discussion, and I saw some from discussions from...over 7 years ago??  Is it possible the series is that old?  And if so, maybe it means that Netflix periodically re-releases or puts certain shows (like GLOW) back in the queue for re-watching?  I say this because...I'd never heard of this show until recently, and likely it's because when I signed into Netflix one day...a few months ago...that GLOW appeared at the top of my feed, and so I naturally assumed it was new.\n\nAnyway, for those not familiar, while a show about female wrestling sounds tacky, they've really done a great job with the show...the cast (particularly the female leads, as well as Marc Maron - who is fantastic in his role) is great.  The show is clever...well-executed.\n\nFor those who've already seen the show, I'm curious if, like me, you had assumed that Season 2, Episode 7 was going to be the series finale?  (That was the episode that included a...er...broken ankle - I don't want to give too much away ...any spoilers.... )  Considering that episode, and the way that episode closed out, I actually think it would have been a perfect way to end the series.  So imagine my surprise when I saw 'Next Episode' loading up on my screen.\n\nEither way, if you've not yet watched GLOW, I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso....Hot Spot (with Japanese subtitles) and Pernille (Norwegian subtitles).",

It almost made me want to just stop watching the show altogether though its one of my favorites. I understand AI is kind of a new wave and of course big companies want to jump on the bandwagon but it's really disappointing to see it so lazily and terribly implemented especially when it was completely unnecessary.

Just fine. Kinda like I was watching Mary Shelley's Stranger Things.\n\nIf there's one thing that gets to me about Netflix projects these days, it's the oppressive flattening of all editors, colorists, cinematographers, and directors into a focus group-tested, phone-friendly 21:9 box.\n\nGuillermo Del Toro's movies have, at least until now, always had a *look* to them. Hard to put on paper but if I had to try I'd say it's almost like opening a storybook with wilted pages. Like everything you're seeing is through the lens of dust and water logged spines. The fantastical, whimsical nature of his characters and stories demanded an almost painterly kind of approach, and from Pan's Labyrinth to The Shape of Water there was always a distinct sense that what we were watching was pulled from a fable, or comic, or storybook. But not a copy that was particularly well-taken care of, if that makes sense?\n\nBut Frankenstein is just...yeah, the \"Netflix style\". I could be watching one of his movies, or any other director, and on a blind reveal there's no way I would know the difference.\n\nDirection is supposed to be about that \"stamp\", that thing that's ineffable but still lets everyone know you're watching a Tarintino film, or Scorcese, or Toro. An angle, a color palette, a way of framing the scene. These distinct, inescapable elements of flavor and talent that drip from every frame put to film by the greats of our time.\n\nNot here, though. Frankenstein might as well be a big-budget episode of Wednesday as far as my eyes can tell. Not much difference to be found.\n\nI wonder if it's bad for us, tbh. To have every show and movie we watch compressed into a streamer-friendly, phone-ready format that pulls every imperfection off the screen in favor of streamlined choices that retain subscriber interest, and therefore, shareholder value.\n\nNo difference in vision, no change in shots. Colors, same. Vision, same. Palette, same.\n\nUgh. I miss the old studio system sometimes.",

        "content": "I\u2018m being serious and hoping to gain external input to balance out my own perception and biases.\n\nIt feels like in a vacuum, Inside Job had everything it needed to at least finish the story it tried to tell.\n\nIt had a, in my opinion, highly differentiated setting that was directly connected to the current cultural zeitgeist with its focus on conspiracy theories and media manipulation. \n\nThrough that setting, it had touchpoints with \u201eolder\u201c generations (Moon landing conspiracies, JFK), younger generations (Social Media and media in general) and everything in between with stuff like the Illuminati. \n\nIt had two main characters that had tangible growth and a supporting cast that had its moments.\n\nIt had personal storytelling which included parenthood and trauma.\n\nIt feels like all of the above could be attributed to shows like Hazbin or Southpark which are going strong. \n\nI know media is more complex than being a checklist. But what happened? Did Netflix calculate KPIs that were too unrealistic? Did it not resonate?",

        "content": "So my mum hates anime, she thinks its weird and claims it is all pornagraphic. However she quite enjoys the Avatar Netflix live action show and we have bonded over Alice in borderland. Because of that I'm thinking of watching some live action anime addiptations with her. My current plans are:\n\n1. The zom 100 movie\n2. The one piece liveaction show (I've never watched the anime so I wouldnt have the issue to comparing them)\n3. Maybe one of the kakegurui liveactions. I adore the anime so I'm scared of how bad they'll be, but I don't wanna write them off\n\nI have most streaming services, though I don't have crunchyroll.",
