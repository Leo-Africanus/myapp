It's British, so it involves an NHS hospital setting background, but nonetheless realistic from my perspective as a former healthcare provider. Excellent acting, good story line. Bravo, netflix. \n\nNow if I could just find a good thriller series that doesn't jump the shark ",

I kept wishing she would have reined her face in at least 50%. It was just too much. Too much quivering. Too much warbling. Get it together woman. \n\nBrittany Snow is in everything these days. \n\nThis was one of the best Netflix original series in awhile. They\u2019ve been pumping out a lot of junk lately. I was genuinely excited to hit play on the next episode and see how this all ended up. ",

The film is in Albanian (which might be unusual for many viewers here), but it comes fully translated and subtitled in English. I\u2019m very curious how the movie plays for foreign audiences and how it compares to other indie films from around the world.\n\n**If anyone would like to watch it, I\u2019m giving away free screener links.**  \nJust comment or DM me \u2014 all I ask is that you share your honest feedback after viewing.\n\nA little about the project:\n\n**The Film:**\u00a0*Vlog#13*\u00a0follows a travel vlogger who heads into the wild nature and deep caves of P\u00ebrmet, in southern Albania. What starts as an adventure gradually turns into something much darker. The movie blends raw natural environments with a tense, intimate style.\n\n**Production:**\u00a0We shot everything on real locations \u2014 forests, rivers, mountains, and underground cave systems \u2014 with a very small team and zero sets. It was demanding, unpredictable, and one of the most challenging creative experiences of my career.\n\n**Ask Me Anything:**  \nI\u2019m open to any questions about:\n\n* Independent filmmaking\n* Shooting in difficult natural environments\n* Working full-time as an indie director/producer\n* International distribution and VOD release\n* The story and process behind\u00a0*Vlog#13*\n* Cinema in Albania\n* Anything else you\u2019re curious about!\n\nThanks for having me, and I\u2019m excited to share the film with anyone interested!",
