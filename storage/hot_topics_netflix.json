Only seven episodes anyway. I hope there's a prequel tho.",

If so, it's worth my time to keep doing it.

There is some good acting and actors that carry the story, as well as some not very good acting and actors that actually (whether intentionally or not) keep it light and silly, but I didn\u2019t actually see that as a turnoff.\n\nIf I expected Black Sails I\u2019d probably hate it, but my wife and I found ourselves bingeing it and laughing with it (and sometimes at it which was just as enjoyable). The story wasn\u2019t deep but kept us watching all the same, would definitely watch a second season.\n\nDid anyone else get into it?",

Perhaps both views can be correct, but it is safe to say the medium has found its intended audience in 'Samuel', a light hearted, and uniquely rich journey through the eyes of a young boy who uses sketch animation to bring life to the various stories which compromise his diary. \n\nSamuel demonstrates a micro series type of storytelling, making short entries in a diary each a distinct episode, while tying them together through the common themes of growing up, falling in love, and socializing as a preteen. \n\nThe messages of each story are often as relatable as they are personal, rich with flaws of life as a child growing up at the turn of the century. The additional wrinkle of 'Samuel' taking place in the early 00's makes it as much a fresh experience for younger audiences, as it is a look back for older ones. \n\n'Samuel' may perform well as its own one season micro series, or it may continue to grow as the titular character does. In either case, such a vibrant, heartfelt experience told in such a succinct way is a welcome addition to the world of 'coming of age' media. It is a beautiful story that will leave one not only looking back, but looking forward.",

        "content": "Many viewers today feel that almost every Netflix series includes homosexual characters or themes, even in stories where such elements do not appear essential to the plot or character development. This creates a perception that representation is sometimes added by default rather than arising organically from the narrative. While diversity and inclusion are important and deserve respect, storytelling feels most authentic when characters, relationships, and themes serve the story rather than distract from it. When representation appears forced or repetitive, it can reduce emotional impact and make viewers question creative intent. Audiences generally appreciate realism, subtlety, and relevance, regardless of the subject being portrayed. What many people are seeking is not exclusion, but balance\u2014where all forms of representation feel natural, meaningful, and justified within the context of the story. Strong writing allows characters of any identity to exist without making their identity feel like a checklist item. Ultimately, good storytelling should prioritize depth, coherence, and authenticity over trends or perceived obligations.",

        "content": "Yesterday, I got an email with 2FA code to log in a new device, even though I never logged in anywhere, so I immediately went to the website manually and changed my password. When I checked the login history, there were no new entries, so it looks like nothing was logged.\n\nThat's absurd, I want to know it, it's not the same if some chinese hobo tried to steal my account than if the login location is near me (e.g. someone's trying to pull a prank like changing my avatar/name or add weird stuff to my watchlist).\n\nFortunately, 2FA is in place, but I want to know where that last login location is. Can someone please help figure it out?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "title": "Secret Mall Apartment on Netflix... genius art project or peak privilege?",
        "content": "I just finished Secret Mall Apartment and I honestly don't know where I stand on it. The story is a total 2000s fever dream. It\u2019s about eight artists building a hidden 750sq-ft flat inside a Rhode Island mall and living there for years. The lo-fi footage they captured back in 2003 is incredible, but the doc raises some massive questions that I haven't stopped thinking about.\n\nOn one hand, you have Michael Townsend and his crew, who frame this as a \"living art\" protest against corporate gentrification. You can\u2019t help but be impressed by the pure audacity it took to smuggle cinder blocks and furniture past security for four years. For the \"art is life\" crowd, it\u2019s an inspiring story about reclaiming space from billionaires.\n\nOn the other hand, the film itself acknowledges a huge elephant in the room: white privilege. The artists admit they likely only got away with this because of how they looked, and some of the \"magical\" reenactments (like using a diverse cast of actors for a mostly white project) feel like they're trying to rebrand a very specific, privileged experience into something more universal. It also touches on the heavy personal cost, showing how Townsend\u2019s singular obsession with the project eventually led to the end of his marriage.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see what everyone else thinks!!\n\nIs this a brilliant act of resistance that proves art can happen anywhere?\n\nOr is it just a case study in how \"mischief\" is only called \"art\" when the people doing it have a certain level of privilege?",
