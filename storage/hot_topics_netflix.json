A few years back, things like Stranger Things, Narcos, and Mindhunter felt bigger, more original, and easier to get hooked on. I actually looked forward to new seasons dropping.\n\nNow I open Netflix and spend way too long scrolling, adding things to my list but never pressing play. A lot of new shows feel rushed or forgettable, even if the idea sounds good on paper. I still watch Netflix, but the excitement isn\u2019t the same.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, or do you think the quality really changed? Are there any newer shows that gave you that old Netflix feeling again?",

        "content": "I\u2019m just here to hate for a second and just see what everyone thinks. I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

It's the kind of movie where it tempts you to switch it off in the first 20 mins, but oh man, am I glad I didn't. It's an absolutely brilliant movie. Yeah, it has a few flaws, but at the end of it, I was thinking what the hell did I just watch, but in a good way!\n\nCan't recommend this enough.

On episode one with Lorraine missing, I feel that they were way too concerned with trying to pin the son for murder instead of actually trying to find Lorraine. Now don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026. I was convinced that he did it, but we were wrong! So maybe if they would have actually put some effort into trying to find Lorraine instead of solve a murder that never occurred they would have found her a lot sooner. \n\nThey had a search warrant on the house, they knew the carpet was ripped up and yet they decided to leave it there, then they had the audacity to start freaking out because the carpet was gone\u2026. Like DUH if she was murdered (which we now know she wasn\u2019t) of course the murderer would remove the carpet so why didn\u2019t they take it in as evidence??? Then they were talking about \u201cyeah we haven\u2019t had time to call the bank yet\u201d THAT WAS THE ANSWER THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!! And then when he started moving everything to the storage unit they said \u201cwe have the storage unit on lock down\u201d but then ten minutes later they are talking about how he\u2019s been taking stuff in and out of the storage unit\u2026. Uhh I thought it was on lockdown ??? And when they go to his truck in the junk yard and they see blood all over the air mattress they said \u201cshould we call the forensic lab down here?\u201d Well no shit Sherlock. Like holy crap!!! And then every time they went to the sons house that one police officer keep saying she was scared of him more than once and waited for backup even when there was more than one police officer ALREADY there\u2026.. like look, I am a women I know how scary it can be to be around men when you have no idea what they are going to do, but you\u2019re a police officer. If you\u2019re gonna be terrified of doing your job then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a police officer. \n\nThis show mad me so mad watching these two woman. And god forbid if I ever go missing and they end up on the case then you might as well just assume I\u2019m dead because I\u2019m surprised they have ever even solved one case. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being harsh but this is just my point of view on this, what do you guys think??

        "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished the diddy documentary and wow. He is so much more disgusting and vile than I already thought after watching that. I\u2019m curious to see what everyone thought and picked up on. There are definitely a lot of questions that still need to be answered and things I\u2019m curious about, but I\u2019ll start with this because I feel like it was really skimmed over and it seemed so much more important to me? Lil Rod mentioned they were recording and a guy named \u201cG\u201d went into the bathroom with diddy and Justin, and was shot twice. My question is, why is this not being talked about more? Lil Rod literally said he pretty much has disappeared. Is there no current investigation on this? It was skimmed over in the documentary which surprised me as I feel like this is huge and can pin diddy to a murder. ",

I get we all like different things and genres but Netflix has some incredible originals they've made: virgin river, Ransom Canyon, Leanne, you. I think it's still worth money and getting the ad free for a few extra pounds definitely enhances user experience\nThe only negative I have is that they've got rid of friends &amp; the big bang theory...not many own a dvd player anymore and Netflix was the only platform that showed these series without having to purchase each individual season etc. Just my opinion \ud83e\ude77",

        "content": "I watched Members Only: Palm Beach and the whole time I had a very odd feeling, like something was off. Visually everything checks out: luxury cars, massive mansions, yachts, ocean views, etc.\n\nAt the same time, the people in the show feel strange. The outfits look cringe and overloaded, kinda Chinese market-style. The overall vibe comes off as kitschy. In Europe this aesthetic disappeared a long time ago. In Italy if someone dressed like this showed up at a high-end event here, the reaction would be\u2026 complicated. Real wealth here usually shows through restraint, quality, and taste. Loud luxury feels outdated by decades.\n\nBecause of that, the show feels staged. Expensive scenery, dramatic behavior, exaggerated styling.\n\nAmericans, is this an accurate reflection of how wealthy elites in the US actually look and behave, especially in places like Palm Beach? Or is this more of a dressed-up TV version made for drama?",
