It had me laughing, crying, and just feeling all the feels.\n\nSerious credit to the actors, producers, and screenwriters for real.

Garfield was a Civil War hero and a abolitionist, and he didn't initially want his parties nomination, and is considered one of the last 'log cabin' Presidents, because he like Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Guiteau had hidden the gun in his pocket and the police only found it after taking him to the police station, and the first metal detector was used on Garfield. Guiteau's brain was actually studied, and its thought that his actions may have been due to syphilis, though of course in the 1880s medical tests like that were very unreliable. And Chester Arthur passed a lot of Garfield's corruption reforms. The score was great, made by the same composer that did Game of Thrones and Iron Man. I also thought they nailed Michael Shannon's look, his beard looks very similar to Garfield's pictures. Betty Gilpin's performance was so convincing.",

Then in another challenge for the bottom 3, the judges chose something that he was very good at as he exclaimed proudly that he started off his careeer doing just that for many years\u2026 which they all had to know! I feel like this was planned to purposely save him. \n\nCarla should have been booted a while back for not listening to feedback from the overseer chefs like 3 different times. \n\nWhen they chose Courtney to be head chef in brigade challenge, she clearly didnt kno what the fucc to do. Yet they didnt put her on the chopping block.\n\nNikki is lowkey hot af. When she is wearing jus her tanktop for in between shot interviews, holy crap she looks like a pornstar.\n\nThe clear standout in this entire show is Andrew.
