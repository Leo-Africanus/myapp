        "content": "This may be an unpopular opinion, but I really did not like Disenchantment. I watched the first two seasons *hoping* I would get into it, but I never did. Personally, the reason that I found the show disappointing was because I went into it thinking it was going to be some epic fantasy quest plot line. Something comparable to that of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Narnia, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc. but something with comedy as much as adventure, wonder, and advanced world building.  \n  \nThere was virtually *NO* adventure. At least not an epic one, anyway. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think there is DEFINITELY a market for an adult cartoon/fantasy parody series, similar to an animated Order of the Stick (iykyk). But with the plot line it currently has, the whole time, I was thinking, \u201cand *whyyyyyy* is it set in a medieval fantasy world?\u201d The setting didn\u2019t seem to add anything interesting to the story. It could've been set in the real world following a rich heiress instead of a princess and literally NOTHING about the plot would change other than a few visual gags.   \n  \nI wanted to like this show. I really did. I watched the whole first and second seasons hoping it would get more interesting but it never did. As a fan of fantasy adventure quest stories, this was a huge disappointment. The only thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the animation. The animation was *exceptionally* good. But again, I feel like they could've done more with the fantasy adventure aspect of the world. Like I said, there is definitely a market for something like that, but this show wasn't it.",

        "title": "A Wrong Paris (2025) - review",
        "content": "The Wrong Paris - it has everything, but something seems to be missing.\n\n\nThe brand new romantic comedy from the most famous digital streamer debuted recently and has already achieved great success. Starring former Nickelodeon teen star Miranda Cosgrove, in her second original work on Netflix (her first original work on the streamer was \u201cA M\u00e3e da Noiva\u201d, another big recent success on the platform) and Pierson Fod\u00e9 (The Perfect Date).\n\nSummary\nDawn (Miranda Cosgrove), a metallurgical artist, lives in the interior of the US state of Texas with her grandmother Bird and her sisters, dreaming of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming a real artist. Dawn, responsible, dedicated herself to working at a local caf\u00e9 for a long time due to her private financial funds to study art in Paris. She actually manages to pass university, however, without the full scholarship, her savings are insufficient.\n\nOne of her sisters, a fan of reality shows, suggests that she sign up for the current production, the \u201cHoneypot\u201d or \u201cHoney Pot\u201d, a competition between women with 20 thousand dollars guaranteed to those selected for the great contest in search of the keys to the heart of a rich single man, which conveniently would take place in the City of Lights \u2014 or that's what the participants thought.\n\nSelected and gaining the affection of one of the show's producers, Dawn finds herself ready to reach the Eiffel Tower house. However, she is surprised by the production's prank, and the primary cause of the film's name, which lands her in Paris, Texas, less than 100 km from her home. Remaining in the dispute only for contractual reasons, she soon arouses the interest of the millionaire of the moment, Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fod\u00e9), a handsome cowboy, initially determined to be eliminated immediately. Throughout the dispute, between tests and intrigues typical of reality shows in confinement and some extra game moments, she will allow herself to live this passion.\n\nComments and opinion\nHome to many successful relationship reality shows, Netflix ironizes its own productions. From the beginning, Honeypot is presented as a self-criticism, properly a parody of the reality television genre. The entire structure and characters involved in the dispute are stereotypes of the most common human types to expose themselves in front of the cameras: the rich and spoiled influencer, the old school biker, the nerd, the free lover, the forgotten celebrity, the alternative girl, etc.\n\nThe film was directed by Janeen Damian, who has experience in the romantic comedy genre. He has already directed two other Netflix productions in the same style: Christmas Eve and Irish Wish. In The Wrong Paris, she inserts all the common and pleasant elements of romantic comedies, being quite predictable, which is no demerit. After all, when watching films or series of this type, we want an escape valve from the chaotic everyday life, where we have little or no control over what is going on around us. The constant presence of Dawn's family is an especially pleasant difference, constituting the viewer's voice within the film.\n\nEspecially her grandmother Bird, an emotional component of the plot, frequently advises her granddaughter and encourages her. Sometimes he interferes in the story that the most anxious audience would like to do for themselves. Miranda brings beauty and humanity to the film; It is perfectly possible to be indignant with her regarding the \u201cvillainess\u201d's far from discreet advances on the handsome millionaire. She conveys the character's insecurities well and definitely makes us fall in love with her too \u2014 an essential element for any self-respecting romantic comedy. Pierson fulfilled what his character needed: he delivers someone who is attentive, concerned, handsome and very passionate about the protagonist. There could be a slight touch more chemistry between the two characters (annoying me? Maybe).\n\nFeaturing beautiful landscapes and an interesting cast, the film also stands out for the quality of its production, ideal for the romantic comedy genre. Despite this, the story could have been better worked on. At 1h45 long, the extremely light plot (a good sign) goes by too quickly. There could be better development of the \"villain\" and the protagonist's confidant, through dialogues between them and the main character. In my opinion, there could have been more frank dialogues between the protagonist couple, giving a more solid basis for the passion between them. Some moments between Paris, Texas, and Paris, France, appear to occur with an expressed passion, without much emotional basis. Maybe 15 more minutes of film wouldn't hurt the production.\n\nWith an insightful critique in the background of the futility of influencers and the world of reality shows, limited to the formulas of the genre, it could have promised more than just a light and pleasant romantic comedy for a late afternoon when you just want to turn off your brain and disconnect from the busy routine, with cute moments starring passionate characters. I would have easily given that away. I think it was designed to be a single film, but there could be a sequel expanding this wonderful universe, especially Dawn's relationship with her family, especially her sisters.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4.5 STARS",
