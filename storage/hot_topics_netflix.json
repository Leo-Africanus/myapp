        "content": "Just finished watching. First I feel bad for his daughter Kerri and can see the turmoil and how he is still haunting her. Judging from the postings here, many have been harsh on her. She does look a lot like him and I am sure is suffering from the guilt of knowing she lived with a killer and could not save those women, is carrying his DNA which helped find him. Lots of complicated feelings. I respect her for expressing herself publicly. I am not sure if that is the BEST way to move on but I do feel she is sincere about her reason for doing this and it is not for profit. She is a victim too.  She has kids and likely this has impacted negatively her ability to earn a living in the same way most of us do. \n\nCan you imagine seeing yourself referenced in your serial killer dad's notes?  I also heard that Gary Ridgeway, the Green River Killer actually had his son in the car when he picked up some of his victims.  \n\n\nWhat I don't understand is how could she and her mom not find the stuff in the shed. The kill kit in the house could just be tools etc. I have duct tape and rope string etc in a closet and I am not a killer. But the stuff in the shed is bizarre. He also stalked many of his victims for endless hours sometimes at like 3am. Did his wife not notice him missing or soiled clothes, smells, the jewelry.  To sit on the couch and say to him \"He writes like you.\"   WTF?   Reminds me of that movie \"The Dead Girl\" with Brittany Murphy where this one woman played by Piper Laurie , realizes that her husband is a serial killer when she finds all that stuff in the storage shed.   BTK's wife had to know something was amiss. \n\nEven Ted Bundy's girlfriend was one of the anonymous callers to tip police about him. \n\nBTK's  words when he was caught were \"Tell my wife I won't be home for lunch.\"  \nOn its face sounds harmless enough but to me that sounds like a code. Could she have known and was in some sort of Stockholm syndrome hold with him? \n\nI also find BTK odd in that several times he killed with children present. Stalked women who were home alone with small kids. Can't help but think that somehow represented what he thought of families. He had two types of victims middle aged women living alone and women alone with children.   \nOne poor woman he was hiding in 2nd bedroom in her house. I think she even had a guest over and BTK sat in her house the entire time until person left for the evening.\n\nGet a dog everyone. ",

They sounded helpful but after a while and after resetting just about everything, I still had trouble getting into my account. This is when I decided to just cancel everything and I told the Netflix customer service to cancel my entire subscription and account. They then told me not to log in because this would reactivate my subscription. Fast forward to today, when I noticed a Netflix payment on my bank account and I was shocked. Apparently I had been paying 19 euros (instead of the 9 euros I was paying before cancelling) for the last months since cancellation. \n\nNaturally, I called customers support and they told me there was a completely different email address registered to my bank account. They did direct this to me as someone must have been able to access my email (which has 2FA so that must be impossible). Hopefully, they did cancel everything now and I do feel stupid for not noticing this earlier but it did not cross my mind to double check as I assumed it was cancelled. My question is, how is this possible and is there any way I can get my money back? Netflix told me the services were used so this won't be possible, but obviously they were not used by me as I did not have access to this account or email. What do I do? ",

I can't understand why the writers decided having such a dislikeable villain as the main character would be a good idea. Nearly \\*all\\* of the other characters experience character growth and change, but Devi just keeps adding more fuel to the dumpster fire, and it stinks. I am halfway through season 2. I only keep watching the series because I want to know what happens with the \\*other\\* characters.

Who's to say he wouldn't save the biggest known monster for last, jack the ripper?orr.. War crime is technically true crime. Whats to say he isn't saving the worst criminal story depiction known to mankind for last? (Austrian painter) It's a leap to say but I believe it's probability because we know now that Ryan Murphy wouldnt stray away from filming that part of history, and he does like to go all out. Who knows maybe, but we already got confirmation for season 4 and who the story is about, this is just for the seasons down the road. ",

I get writers take artistic liberties for entertainment but what they came up with was just so perverse. Mary Hogan was a former madam in Chicago? Bernice was a desperate old kinky cougar looking for a sugar baby? Was this to make us feel less sorry for them? Like maybe they deserved it bc they weren't \"virtuous\"? There's very little background online about either of the victims, at least nothing I could find, so I cant understand why they made these choices for these women?
