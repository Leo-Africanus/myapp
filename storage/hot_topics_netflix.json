        "content": "\nMy family has been Netflix members since 2018. We live internationally, where I work in education. Like many expat families, we travel frequently - we\u2019ve lived across multiple countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nLast week, my wife traveled overseas to care for her sick mother. Meanwhile, our children and I stayed home for school. We continued using Netflix on our various devices as we always have.\n\nNetflix\u2019s automated system flagged this as \u201cunusual activity\u201d and permanently cancelled our account. When I contacted customer service, I was told:\n\n\u274c There is no appeals process\n\u274c There is no formal complaint procedure  \n\u274c The decision cannot be reversed\n\u274c Seven years of customer history means nothing\n\nThe representative literally said: \u201cOnce the system detected the issue, then there\u2019s no option to recover it.\u201d\n\nSo Netflix\u2019s algorithm is judge, jury, and executioner. No human review. No consideration of our account history. No recognition that international families exist. No way to appeal an automated decision.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fraud prevention - it\u2019s punishing legitimate customers for living globally.\n\n@Netflix - Is this really how you treat long-term international subscribers? Where\u2019s the humanity in your customer service?",

That time has been replaced as of recent by some pretty big misses.\n\nEven the shows I can think of from this year like Untamed, Wayward, Waterfront, Hunting Wives, Black Rabbit etc are all lacking a lot. It feels like the only shows Netflix sometimes hit on are British dramas. \n\nSo if you are reluctant to check it out, don\u2019t be. (In my opinion of course) ",

We spoke a lot about the culture and history of Vietnam with more focus on the war. He was from the North and his family were part of the communist party. But he was neutral and explained the whole scenario. One thing I was clear, that there's no good guy or bad guy here. Both the sides had committed war crimes. But then I visited the War Memorial, I felt the US did horrific attrocitices. They equally killed civilians as did the communists. So all in all, I had a belief that all 3 parties, The communists of North, South Vietnamese and The US were all equally guilty of inflicting so much pain to common people and created so much disruption that no one could live happlity during that period in time. \n\nBut after watching this series, I feel the South Vietnamese were the neutral guys who got stuck between the North and the US.

There is an iPad app available. With the M1 chip Apple even enabled that you can compile iPad apps for MacOS without any issue.\n\n  \nWhat do you think is Netflix reasoning against a MacOS app? Even freakin WINDOWS got one.",

        "content": "Netflix did something that is so frustrating. They made it so that you can no longer see the more info/details page anymore. you click on a show or movie and it starts playing automatically. There is no way to turn this off. I even contacted support and they said it's to make things more engaging, no longer do you need to sit and decide the content will play and you can decide for yourself so Netflix gets more minutes/hours of streaming time by just automatically loading the show.\n\nplease help me get the first 5 signatures\n\n[https://c.org/wRhWBRrcmt](https://c.org/wRhWBRrcmt)",
