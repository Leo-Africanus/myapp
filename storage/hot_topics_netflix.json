Yeah, no. Buhbye. Nailed the coffin shut.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this show was early to a very specific vibe that\u2019s everywhere now. Dark but cozy, absurd but oddly wholesome. Violent things happening while people argue about mundane nonsense. Basically existential dread with popcorn.\n\nShows like Ghosts are carrying that torch. Dead people. Ridiculous problems. Jokes that are dumb, sharp and self-aware at the same time. The kind of humor that doesn\u2019t try too hard but still sneaks up and punches you in the face. Politely.\n\nI\u2019m convinced this genre works because most of us are tired, mildly unhinged and coping through irony. We don\u2019t want prestige misery. We want chaos that knows it\u2019s chaos. We want death jokes that somehow feel comforting.\n\nAnyway, RIP Santa Clarita Diet. Gone too soon.\n\nTaken from us mid-bite.\n\nNetflix, I forgive a lot, but I will never forgive you for this one.

I can let things go, but the one that really bothered me was WHY WOULD ANNA BE MARRIED TO THE BROTHER OF A GIRL WHO WATCHED AND LAUGHED WHILE SHE GOT RAPED??\n\nSure, Jack was flawed, but an overall good man who loved Anna and definitely went out of his way to protect her, but still, you\u2019d think she\u2019d stay far away from those girls and anyone related to them, let alone marry a sibling. Those girls were just plain evil. And they didn\u2019t even have any remorse. Helen making a comment about her dead child? Zoe giving her the finger and telling her to stop holding a grudge??\n\nI wish there had been some backstory of how she and Jack got together. Anything that would explain how she could possibly be content with Zoe being his sister-in-law. I thought maybe she fell in love with Jack before she knew Zoe was his sister? Or maybe she started dating Jack so she could keep Zoe close and somehow get revenge \u2026 but then accidentally fell for him?? Idk. At least some kind of explanation. \n\nAnyway, that is all. ",

There was absolutely no solution!! \n\nWhere does that build up energy go?!?! I\u2019m literally shaking in my blanket and it just stops!!??!! Nope, no movie is worth me going through all that. \n\nSO MANY unresolved storylines\u2026.ugh. I would rather not have watched it at all.. okay my rant is over \ud83d\ude02 ",

        "content": "I can go the info screen without an episode starting on the app on my phone but when I\u2019m watching on my tv there\u2019s no way to just go straight to the info screen anymore. It just starts playing the show when I click on it and I have to wait for it to load so I can click on series info from there. I want to know if there\u2019s a way to change that because sometimes I want to see more about a new show without it auto starting or if I exit the episode I\u2019m watching without letting it get far enough through the credits, it\u2019ll start that episode completely over instead of going to the next one. It\u2019s just generally annoying and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any app settings that I can find but I want to know if there\u2019s a way to change it that I\u2019m just missing.",

        "content": "I had mixed feelings about this show. Just binged watched it and I couldn\u2019t believe those 3 girls would SING AND LAUGH happy birthday WHILE Anna was being SA\u2019d. That was beyond sadistic. \n\nAs f\u2019d up it was to kill them, they deserved everything. \n\nAnd Catherine Alexis (Lexy) was such a b when Anna said a couple times she didn\u2019t know the other girls would bully her let alone the fact Anna STEPPED IN when those trifling men were going to SA HER. she also was a b to kill her sister and then tried to act like she was sad. \n\nThe grandma killing all the girls didn\u2019t make sense logistically esp as she would\u2019ve had footprints in the wood (they found footprints but didn\u2019t see the other set?) and there should\u2019ve been fingerprints SOMEWHERE  but I know they did that so the twist would be such. \n\nAlso, did she walk EVERYWHERE? how the hell she end up at the lake house? It doesn\u2019t seem like that was a commuter friendly town as everyone else drove except her and her timing for being everywhere was impeccable. I knew she could\u2019ve tossed her gown from the first killing but wouldn\u2019t they had found that somewhere along the path to the forest. ",
