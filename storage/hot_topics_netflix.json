It all consists of telling stories about psychosis actors, the Texas massacre, film producers who were inspired by him, and above all, romances they have had and experiences that are not real or are still theories.\nI thought I was going to see how Ed Gein acted, the things he did, what he did with corpses, everything. But instead I find that shit. \nI had a lot of hype for this season, I thought it would be good and above all that it would be the creepiest of all. But it feels pretty bad. It's morbid of me to want to see more of what the crimes were like and how he really acted, but damn, that's better than wanting to see stories that never happened about his life.",

It was so different from anything I have seen before. Strange, emotional, and full of mystery. The way the story was told kept pulling me in. I kept wondering what would happen next.\n\nAfter I finished I looked it up and saw it had a lot of praise but was cancelled after only two seasons. That made me kind of sad because I really feel like it could have gone somewhere even bigger if it had more time. Netflix has so many shows that end up disappearing under the radar, even when they are really good.\n\nSo I wanted to throw this out to the community. What is a Netflix show you think deserved way more attention? Not the big ones everyone talks about, but those hidden gems that maybe only a small group of people know about.\n\nFor me The OA will stick with me for a long time. I keep thinking about its ending and the questions it leaves open. I wish more people had seen it so we could talk about it.\n\nI would love to hear your picks. Is there a show you watched on Netflix that surprised you and deserved more love? Something you wish had gotten more seasons or more people watching? I feel like this could turn into a great list of hidden gems we all need to check out.\n\n",

        "content": "I've been a customer since DVDs. Was super excited to cut the cord. Was all about streaming, didn't once opt for the cheaper plan, but it's finally happened. I've reached the end of my list and Netflix is no longer keeping up with my viewing habits. \n\nI'm wondering if stranger things will be my last month subscribing. I used to be able to count on having a show that was fine that i didn't care much about, but was interesting enough to put on with the wife. Neither one of us are very stratified or interested in what's left. There used to be something to at least consider each month, but since they started splitting seasons it's more like something every three months. \n\nWe quit HBO/max when they stopped delivering new content just before the discovery merger, though it became clear paying for months of zero content was their plan. Disney is just as bad. We're just paying for a library. As soon as the youngest is old enough to not break disks I'll probably dig out the player and cancel that too. Cancelled prime due to the ads.\n\nApple was doing the best, but the drip is slow, so we're waiting for content.  I'm not against reading a book or checking out from the library. I have always loved movies and tv, but what I love is story and novel content. \n\nI know a bunch of you are agrieved over cut and cancelled shows. I hear that, but I didn't much care as long as something was around to watch. I think we might move to streaming 3 months out of the year or something. \n\nBasic cable was somehow better, and I'm throwing up in my mouth saying that.\n\nBut maybe I'm just not being surfaced good content that exists? What we've liked (here or elsewhere): bsg, last air bender (not the live action), fullmetal alchemist, outlander, stranger things, lupin, sandman, wednesday, good place, severence, big door prize, lucifer, game of thrones, firefly, trek (Voyager, strange be worlds), bridgerton (i tolerate it), witcher, wheel of time, rings of power, umbrella academy, lockwood &amp; co, ted lasso, unstable, murder bot, pluto, mrs maisel, shadow and bone, upload, disenchanted, warehouse 13, eureka, cobra kai, lost in space, Westworld, merlin, dragon prince, community, andor, murder bot, arrested development, Queens Gambit\n\nProbably more too... But Netflix thinks I just like horror or trash romance. I actually kinda hate horror, it's only when the writing is very good that I get past that. I watched squid games (for the wife) and wouldn't choose to put myself through that again \n\nI've bounced off: black mirror, the boys, foundation, supernatural, most of the new star wars stuff, most of the new trek stuff, halo, most sitcom/reality stuff\n\nThen there stuff that I'd watch, but only if there's nothing else: altered carbon, top chef, mandalorian, and other stuff where the vision or writing isn't quite good, but I'll deal because it feels like they were trying.",

        "content": "There\u2019s a lot of contradictory feelings after watching this show, evoking questions I couldn\u2019t shake. And I think I have an answer. What makes this show so powerful isn\u2019t just its retelling of a notorious killer\u2019s story, it\u2019s how it examines the way we, as viewers and as a culture, respond to horror itself. The series constantly moves between Ed Gein\u2019s real life and the films his crimes inspired, like Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This isn\u2019t just a storytelling choice; it\u2019s a reflection on how cinema has transformed real human tragedy into art, often by exaggerating, sexualizing, or dramatizing it to evoke emotion. But where those films turned horror into spectacle, this show turns it into introspection. It forces us to sit in contradiction, to see Gein as both a monster and a victim, to feel empathy for someone we know we should despise. That conflict, the disgust we feel for our own compassion, is the emotional core of the series. The show uses that contradiction not to excuse him, but to expose the blurry moral line between understanding evil and consuming it as art. In the end, Monster: The Ed Gein Story isn\u2019t just about Ed Gein at all. It\u2019s about us and our fascination with darkness, our need to categorize people as purely good or evil, and our discomfort when art refuses to let us do that. It\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t give us the comfort of moral clarity, and that\u2019s what makes it so unsettling and, ultimately, so meaningful.",

And that he never dug his mother up. \n\nBut somehow here that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened?\n\nIt\u2019s known he made furniture, bowls and a skin suit out of the people he dug up. \n\nI\u2019m only on episode 4 and it\u2019s like pulling teeth trying to watch this show at this point. \n\nAlso what with parallel story about Alfred Hitchcock that wasn\u2019t shown at all in the trailers?\n\nRyan Murphy should not be allowed to make shows anymore.  \n\n\nUpdate - I\u2019ve been corrected, he turned one of his victims into his \u201cmother\u201d and put his mother\u2019s clothes on her. That is my mistake \n",

        "title": "Monsters: Ed Gein (Not that bad)",
        "content": "Before anything, I am open to genuine educated discourse about this topic as it may be touchy for some.\n\nI just recently finished watching the new Monsters series and I have to say, I feel like people are dragging it. I don\u2019t think the series was actually that bad at all tbh. If you aren\u2019t someone who\u2019s interested in crime and horror films and didn\u2019t know anyone mentioned in the series, then I can see how it threw you off. I will say creating a fake storyline between Richard Speck, Ted Bundy, and Ed gein was completely unnecessary, especially being that there were no correlations between each person. However, i think this series really humanized Ed gein and is it bad to say that I felt genuine sympathy for him. The series prompted me to look further into his case and he wasn\u2019t a serial killer the way media infamously portrayed him to be. \n\nNow I want to clarify, I DO NOT advocate for violence or harm to anyone in any way. I do think though, had there been earlier intervention and his diagnosis been caught earlier, his crimes could\u2019ve been prevented. Granted this was back in a time where mental health education was relatively brand new, and berated. If Ed\u2019s mother was indeed extremely religious and verbally violent, it\u2019s easy to see how this happened, forcing a co-dependent relationship with Ed, creating this person who quite literally couldn\u2019t live without his mother. It always makes me sad finding out that once medicated and properly treated these people turn into model citizens. If I\u2019m being honest, the series really shined a light on just how important mental health research is. Not everyone with a mental illness is a criminal, however, a lot of criminals have extremely unchecked mental illnesses. The way they described Ed gein also made me think he might\u2019ve had some delayed mental development but again, being that this was in the 1950\u2019s and he was born in 1906, I\u2019m sure schizophrenia was all they cared to search for, because even that they had little to no knowledge about. \n\nI know I might get crucified for this but I wouldn\u2019t say Ed Gein was a bad person. What he did was bad of course. No one should be able to take someone\u2019s life, mental illness or not. The matter of the fact though, is that he was extremely unwell, always had been. The death of his mother threw him into this new world and it accelerated his mental decline. Being alone, with schizophrenia, and possibly other undiagnosed mental illnesses, he tried to cope and he couldn\u2019t. He was in denial that his mother was gone and so believed that if he \u201cre-created\u201d her, she\u2019d still be there. And that is really sad to me. \n\nIt seemed like the Planefield WI PD also just needed someone to pin the rest of the missing persons on someone. I read the other cases they \u201csuspected\u201d him of and there was no connection other than they found he killed two people so he must\u2019ve killed more in WI. ",

        "title": "Wayward and Mae\u2019s acting (spoilers)",
        "content": "I literally spent the whole first episode repeatedly questioning who would cast Mae for a role in this show, and a lead role none the less, just for the episode to end and Mae\u2019s name being cited as the creator and (sometimes) writer. Their acting was so incredibly horrible, it felt like a self insert fan fiction where they could be the \u201cgood\u201d guy and wear tank tops that show off their biceps, and then occasionally take it off to show their tattoos and muscles. They\u2019re so flat and lack any genuine emotion or expressions and should have never been given a lead role, even if they created it, was the director not doing their job? Why\u2019re they being out acted by literally EVERY character and child in the show. Even that little cute kid that won the mountain episode was amazing despite barely having any speaking lines. I think they were out of their depth and should\u2019ve stayed as a creator but had the self awareness to understand that they weren\u2019t fit for this job.\n\nThe show itself was really interesting and had a lot of potential, however, there were some confusing plot lines. Honestly, for the most part, it seems like the \u201ctherapy\u201d they do actually helps the kids confront their issues in a way? But then Abbie told Leila that it was just Evelyn messing with her head and that her original memories were actually true. This was kind of confusing because it seemed like blocked trauma coming out but if they meant for it to be just a manipulation of Evelyn then I think it didn\u2019t translate fully for me. Of course this isn\u2019t to say that everything happening at the school wasn\u2019t fully insane. The ending also didn\u2019t sit right, specifically Alex\u2019s character arc. How does the character who is constantly trying to do good end up staying through that? Is it because he keeps violently hurting people over and over again so now he feels connected to her because \u201cawe babe we\u2019re both murderers &lt;3)? He pissed me off so much every time he would hurt someone because, for example, with that one dad whose house he went to, he could\u2019ve fully stopped him and told him that he wasn\u2019t a spy, but he chose to beat his ass till he was half dead? If they meant to show that Evelyn was right because he repeated the patterns of his fathers violence even while actively trying to be different then that would make sense, but I think the way they wrote the story, and once again, Mae\u2019s HORRENDOUS acting, it didn\u2019t translate well. I suppose it would also make sense why he chose to stay given Evelyn\u2019s scene telling them that he doesn\u2019t love his wife and he just loves the idea of the family she can give him, but I think these thoughts and emotions should\u2019ve been expressed in a better way, because with Alex\u2019s constant flat tone and facial expressions regardless of what\u2019s happening in the scene, you\u2019d think there were pebbles up there.\n\nAlso, a little note of appreciation for the actress who played Evelyn, she was AMAZING, her character deserved a bigger, better show.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I think writing all of this down helped me understand some decisions that I hadn\u2019t considered.",
