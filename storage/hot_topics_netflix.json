I'll check the network, still connected to the one and only router in the house, and do the update anyway. Then, a few days later, another device (on the household list) will pop the same issue. This has been going on for a while and I've been constantly having to update the list on each device when it happens. I'd really appreciate some help with this as it's getting to be such a hassle. Maybe I'm missing something about screens on netflix or something? I have no idea. But if anyone knows about or has gone through similar, any info on this would be awesome. Thanks!",
