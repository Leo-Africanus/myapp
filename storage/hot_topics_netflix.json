        "content": "# Love Is Blind \u2013 The Engagement Speedrunner\n\n* Talks about marriage before knowing your last name\n* Makes \u201cour song\u201d a track they heard once in the pods\n* Defends their fianc\u00e9 even when the receipts are televised\n* Calls breakups \u201cgrowth moments\u201d\n* Says \u201cI knew the second I heard your voice\u201d but can\u2019t remember your birthday\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Proposal Paige***  \nPaige\u2019s toxic superpower is mistaking adrenaline for intimacy. She believes love is purer when you can\u2019t see the person, but still stalks your Instagram the second the wall drops. She thrives on tearful declarations, awkward family dinners, and proving to everyone at the reunion that \u201cwe\u2019re stronger than ever\u201d (right before unfollowing each other).\n\n# Too Hot to Handle \u2013 The Self-Help Casanova\n\n* Wears swim trunks to breakfast meetings\n* Learns one breathwork technique and becomes the villa\u2019s \u201chealer\u201d\n* Breaks a $30k rule because \u201cthe vibe was right\u201d\n* Calls every hookup \u201ca spiritual connection\u201d\n* Uses Lana as an excuse: \u201cShe didn\u2019t *say* I couldn\u2019t do that\u201d\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Tantric Tyler***  \nTyler can\u2019t go 12 hours without kissing someone, but will lecture you about \u201cinner work\u201d while rubbing sunscreen on their abs. His redemption arc involves crying once in a workshop circle and suddenly being everyone\u2019s relationship coach \u2014 despite leaving the show with two exes and no prize money.\n\n# The Circle \u2013 The Emoji Manipulator\n\n* Ends every sentence with \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude02\u2728 to seem friendly\n* Keeps a chart of who said what and when\n* Accidentally slips slang their catfish persona shouldn\u2019t know\n* Starts alliances they never plan to honor\n* Overreacts in messages to cover awkward silences\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Filter Frankie***  \nFrankie is a master of digital double lives. She\u2019ll \u201cbestie\u201d you into trusting her, then use your own confession against you in a group chat. Frankie\u2019s DMs are 60% flattery, 40% reconnaissance \u2014 and she knows exactly which selfie to post when she\u2019s in danger of getting blocked.\n\n# The Mole \u2013 The Friendly Backstabber\n\n* Suggests wrong answers like they\u2019re gospel\n* Volunteers for every key role\u2026 then botches it\n* Pretends not to know how to read maps\n* Gaslights teammates into thinking *they* messed up\n* Claps when someone else gets blamed\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Sabotage Sasha***  \nSasha is charming enough to carry the group\u2019s groceries \u2014 and just careless enough to drop them \u201caccidentally\u201d before a checkpoint. She thrives on subtle chaos: swapping clue cards, \u201cforgetting\u201d the time limit, and watching trust disintegrate. The smile? Weaponized.\n\n# The Bachelor / Bachelorette \u2013 The Rom-Com Gaslighter\n\n* Gives \u201cwe\u2019re meant to be\u201d speeches to multiple people\n* Keeps the drama starter \u201cone more week\u201d for ratings\n* Calls every one-on-one date \u201cthe most special ever\u201d\n* Has breakup tears timed to the golden hour\n* \u201cFor the right reasons\u201d is their drinking game\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Rosewood Ryan***  \nRyan is a walking slow-motion montage. He\u2019ll kiss you under fireworks, then hand the next rose to someone who insulted your outfit. He survives on love triangles, family skepticism, and speeches that sound like they were rehearsed in a limo. Bachelor Nation loves him until they realize he\u2019s auditioning for *Paradise*.\n\n# Temptation Island \u2013 The Overconfident Heartbreaker\n\n* Swears they \u201ccouldn\u2019t possibly\u201d cheat on camera\n* Has their first slip-up before unpacking\n* Calls infidelity \u201ca necessary test\u201d\n* Starts a villa romance *and* keeps messaging their ex\n* Proposes on finale night to prove everyone wrong\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Tempted Trevor***  \nTrevor arrived as \u201cthe loyal one,\u201d but the combination of ocean views, bottomless cocktails, and 12 singles with perfect teeth transformed him into a statistics study in bad decisions. His specialty is crocodile tears, claiming \u201cwe were on a break,\u201d and somehow walking away engaged.\n\n# Love Island \u2013 The Casa Amor Chaos Machine\n\n* Says \u201cI\u2019m loyal\u201d 12 hours before cheating\n* Practises speeches for firepit recoupling\n* Makes the balcony their betrayal HQ\n* Falls in love twice in one week\n* Thinks a tanning session counts as quality time\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Balcony Bree***  \nBree\u2019s loyalty lasts exactly until Casa Amor. She thrives in slow-motion entrances, whispered flirts during workouts, and returning from a \u201ctest\u201d fling with a justifying monologue. Her most used phrase? \u201cMy head\u2019s been turned.\u201d\n\n# Perfect Match \u2013 The Netflix Multiverse Villain\n\n* Knows your messy ex from another show\n* Switches partners mid-date\n* Drops gossip right before elimination\n* Flirts to get strategic alliances\n* Always has the \u201ctea\u201d no one asked for\n\n**Character Brief \u2013** ***Crossover Corey***  \nCorey is a franchise veteran \u2014 three Netflix dating shows deep and counting. He thrives on multi-season drama arcs, stirring pots across villas, and framing every choice as \u201cstrategy\u201d while collecting new followers like souvenirs.\n\n# ",

I feel like everything that was good was taken out. Every scene was either changed or replaced entirely by a new scene. A lot of the characters were portrayed different in the movie from how they were written. I never expect an adaptation to be spot on but if they really wanted to change everything then why even call it an adaptation at that point? Just write a different story!",

        "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know how I feel about it. A part of me wants to hate it because it just felt so messy and unsatisfying by the last episode.  I saw a lot of people being annoyed that the watcher wasn\u2019t revealed but i felt like it was pretty obvious that it was the neighbours, especially when you consider them being in the tunnel, their group about conserving the houses, everyone getting letters once they have a bad interaction with them, and the fact that the man is a librarian and they mentioned theres a typewriter. One thing that annoyed me badly was the tunnels, they were so desperate to find out but yet didn\u2019t go and explore the tunnels better themselves, the answer literally could have been revealed by then. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that when the two ladies invited Nora over, she hears the thuds, left looking terrified, just to never bring that up again. I really wanted to like it and I felt like it could\u2019ve been great if they actually properly worked on the storyline. ",

I\u2019m on an iPhone 11 so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the issue but otherwise I\u2019m stumped, does anyone have an answer?",

        "content": "Hi, I use Google Chrome on my laptop, and when the \"Use graphics acceleration when available\" settings is turned on, Netflix glitches when in fullscreen. The screen is kind of \"jumpy\"  it makes it unwatchable.\n\nThe problem is, if I turn off the setting in Chrome, then it's Youtube that glitches in fullscreen, and some websites like Canva stop working properly.\n\nIm tired of having to turn it on/off all the time. Is there a definite way to make Netflix work properly on Google Chrome while still having the setting turned  on?  And without having to use another browser.\n\nBy the way this setting is in Chrome Settings &gt; System &gt; Use graphics acceleration when available\n\nthanks",
