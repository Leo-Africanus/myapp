Well now that I'm older, and I also have a better relationship with my dad, I've learned that I'm allowed to watch/listen to/read the same things he does and like it and it doesn't have to mean anything. \n\nI'm biting the bullet. I saw a reel the other day on Instagram with some dude from the show, played by Giancarlo Esposito, walking out of a room with HALF HIS FACE GONE??? And I was like DAMN! Apparently he knocks his role out of the park and I do love the guy. \n\nSo, am I in trouble? Is it really a great show? Will I find myself sucked in? Be honest lol I wanna know how bad I'm about to fixate on this shit. I wanna know how dynamic and bingeable it is. ",

Hulu, paramount, peacock, prime are all working just fine.\n\n  \nUpdate: I was speaking with customer service via chat. The rep asked for my entire card number to verify my account. Before proceeding, I looked on reddit to see if this was legit and per some convos, it seemed to be. After confirming, the chat ended with the rep stating she sent a password reset link.....I never told her I needed my password reset. I told her I was having an issue with the netflix app freezing. Starting to think I just got scammed.....",

        "content": "The third and final season of Alice in Borderland is just right around the corner. Been seeing an influx of people on YouTube reacting to the show. Squid Game, too, had just recently wrapped up and with a controversial finale at that. \n\nAnyway, I had just finished watching a reactor saying that Squid Game was \"way better produced\" and had \"way better casting\" than AiB. *To each their own* of course, but I guess I was a bit taken aback by this comment since I personally felt like AiB actually took the notch of the survival show genre higher. This is not to say that Squid Game was bad or anything. I also liked Squid Game, especially the first season. In fact, I think that Squid Game had more of a social commentary than AiB. It's just that when it comes to the games and overall premise, I'm definitely more biased towards AiB. \n\nBTW not saying that people should like AiB more than SG. I could see why some people would like SG over AiB. It's just my personal bias when I say that Squid Game is not in any way \"waaaay better\" than AiB. They might be equally good, but SG is definitely not far off better than AiB imo.\n\nFor those who have watched both, which one do you like better?",

Was it to show how they're trying to live despite Jamie's actions? Or was it only like that because it's a one take show? i understood the coming back home ride when Jamie calls, but i'm very confused about the going to the store ride where the mum and dad talk about their first meet and stuff like that.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been a C# .NET developer for my entire 17-year career, primarily building domain-driven, object-oriented internal line-of-business web applications on smaller teams (never more than 10 people).\n\nI keep seeing Netflix salaries posted online and they\u2019re significantly higher than what I\u2019m making here on the east coast (Pennsylvania). It\u2019s got me curious about what actually drives those compensation levels - is it the scale, the technical complexity, the culture, or something else entirely?\n\nI realize complexity probably varies wildly between teams at Netflix, so maybe this is impossible to answer broadly. But I guess what I\u2019m really wondering is: do I have what it takes to work there?\n\nI don\u2019t consider myself anything special - just a solid software engineer who enjoys problem-solving. But when I see those salary numbers, I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s a whole different level of engineering happening that I\u2019m not exposed to in my current role.\n\nHas anyone made a similar transition from traditional enterprise development to a company like Netflix? What was the biggest adjustment?",
