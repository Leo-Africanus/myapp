She\u2019d get excited when I turned it on and would snuggle me and watch the show. So, occasionally, I check and see where to watch it in hopes that they\u2019ll get added to a service that we already pay for. \n\nImagine my shock today when I looked up the Mr Peabody and Sherman Show and there was an official Netflix page that lead me to the app where I could push the remind me button. I was ecstatic! My girl and I could watch our silly cartoons again! Until I looked closer and found zero other information on these shows coming back online. \n\nDoes this mean that the show is coming back or have I been bamboozled? It also shows up for Home: Adventures with Tip and Oh and Turbo Fast, but again, I have found no other information. ",
