On the one hand as someone with an engineering background I'm very interested in engineering cautionary tales. On the other hand I've already read about everything that happened leading up to the Titan submersible disaster in great detail.\n\nSo my main queston in deciding whether it's worth watching for me is the following: does this documentary contain any new information or perspective?",

At the end of his shows, it's like we all went on this journey, and I didn't realize how much I needed that lately. \n\n\nAnyways - as we were watching, I thought to myself \"huh, it seems that when comedians do a comedy special on Netflix, they're going on tour and they might come to Toronto\"... \nAnd sure enough, Justin is! \n\nWe got tickets to his show in Toronto, and I'm super stoked for it. \nAnyone else going? \nAnyone here seen him live before? What was your experience?",

        "content": "So I\u2019m on vacation in the Caribbean with my girlfriend \u2014 we live together in CO, and like most people these days, we pay for the cheapest version of Netflix (with ads) because streaming\u2019s gotten outta control. Between all the different platforms, we keep it low tier just so we can still have access to most stuff.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re chilling on vacation, decide to throw on a movie, and go straight to Netflix \u2014 our usual go-to. And what do we get? A notification saying:\n\u201cYour subscription tier is not available in this region.\u201d\nSo\u2026 basically, we can\u2019t use Netflix at all.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 get this \u2014 it hits us with:\n\u201cYou can change your subscription [here]\u201d with a link to upgrade.\nLike that\u2019s gonna make me go \u201coh yeah sure, let me give Netflix more money just so I can use it on my vacation.\u201d Bro, be serious.\n\nI\u2019ve been paying for Netflix for years. I\u2019m not asking for a free ride \u2014 just some common sense. Would it really kill them to say:\n\u201cThis tier isn\u2019t available in your current region. You have 7 days of access while traveling \u2014 enjoy your vacation!\u201d\nGive me a little grace period. A little respect. I\u2019m not a new user. I\u2019m just out of town for a minute.\n\nSo what now? Am I supposed to pause or cancel my Netflix sub every time I leave the country? Is it even worth paying anymore if I\u2019m gone for part of the month? It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated.\n\nAnd this is why people are done with streaming services. They nickel-and-dime loyal users, and act surprised when people jump ship. It\u2019s like they want to lose us.\n\nNetflix \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 stop punishing your paying customers for traveling. It\u2019s not a good look. Especially when all we wanted to do was watch a damn movie on vacation.",
