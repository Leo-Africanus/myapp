        "content": "The first season had all the charm anyone could want in a show like this. It was quirky with a darker tone and I greatly enjoyed all the slight nods to the original Addams Family. It seemed like such a strong show. Every episode was good until the season final which I felt was a little over the top and lame. I thought it would pick back up for season two but my gosh was I wrong. The episodes are uncreative and unnecessarily long and to my dissatisfaction all the characters were butchered to an extreme. It hurt so bad to witness Eugene and Pugsley spend all there time causing issues with Slurp. Also, don\u2019t expect Wednesday to show any signs of improvement she seemed to have sorta gained at the end of the first season. Not only is that work erased but it actually feels like it\u2019s declining steadily. It\u2019s like she\u2019s supposed to be a badass but her character seems to have a bad case of main character syndrome. Bringing Tyler back to continue being a whiny jerk was not pleasant either and it was made worse for leaving Zavier out. Don\u2019t even get me started on the writing. It\u2019s some of the cringiest stuff I\u2019ve heard in a while. This is a lot of negative stuff but I can say some good things about the show too. Season 2 was mildly entertaining. Oh, wait. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Feel free to disagree with my opinion but for me this season was a joke.",

After watching the last episode and finding out that there won\u2019t be a third season, and that Wolf King Season 2 is the final season, I think they could have just made the ending differently, giving us viewers closure on the story. But instead, they leave us on a cliffhanger and imply that another season might come. But no, there won\u2019t be a third season, \u2019cause it\u2019s canceled according to news outlets. So, given this info, the people who made the second season shouldn\u2019t have done that at all. Now I\u2019m just disappointed.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/09rdqjbwsjof1.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd28c7e6c77cd584cd951213a1bf6b56be75f74\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts on Nikki Rodriguez, who plays Jackie (lead) in My Life with the Walter Boys. I recently found out that she\u2019s actually **33 years old**! This makes sense because her vibe feels much more **mature** than her character, who\u2019s supposed to be **15 or 16**.\n\nYou can definitely tell she\u2019s older in some ways. For example, the lines around her eyes and her smile lines really show her age and add to that mature impression. Plus, the way she carries herself feels much more adult. She graduated from Roseville Area High School in Minnesota in **2010**, which fits with her being older.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that older actors sometimes take on teenage roles, but it feels off for someone **over 30** to be playing a teenager, and this casting choice detracts from the **authenticity** of the show. Honestly, her acting is **subpar,** and she feels too mature for the role and struggles to embody a teenage character, especially given that it's almost **20 years** since she was that age.\n\nETA: Her real age is in the public domain and has been reported on social media and news sites.\n\n  \nEdit to add: My observations were about acting authenticity, not a personal attack. Physical characteristics matter when an actor is portraying a much younger character. This is a legitimate critique of casting and performance.",
