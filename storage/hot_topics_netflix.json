He's been able to pivot to \"Jokes for Max\" in a really heartwarming way. \n\nBut there are two points I want to emphasize:\n\n1). How in recent seasons when he is traveling he is very conscious to discuss the societal issues and humanitarian efforts going on in all of these countries/cities. It might feel heavy handed at times, but it is the minimum he can do to raise awareness for good causes.\n\n2). How he treats the people he works with and the people he cares about. Almost always in each episode he has a scene where he's having the camera crew getting in on trying the food, too. He will typically treat the local fixers to meals which reinforces this as well. But most of all what I thought was touching this season were his personal stories with his dad's Filipino nurse and his Guatemalan nanny - how he went out of his way to honor them during these journeys. \n\nCombined to me shows someone who cares for his staff no matter how long you worked for him. Feeling like the Everybody Loves Raymond royalties are doing a bit of good in their afterlife. \n\nPhil if you see this, I love ya. \n\n",

To say the least. \n\nThis series is a thousand things all at the same time. Shocking, Sexy, Violent, Mysterious, And even Comical.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard much about it. And I only checked it out because of an instagram reel. But I\u2019m glad I went down the rabbit hole. \n\nDo yourself a favor and watch the top 10 highest rated episodes on IMDB.

With an extremely time limit, hoards of people and a need for face paced decision making, the game really brings out the worst and shows what people will do when placed under high stress situations. I know that\u2019s what most of the games are supposed to do, but this one just makes it better because when placed in a situation like this where everyone is yelling, people make decisions that might not be what they would usually do, but what they need to survive. I don\u2019t know if this makes any sense, I just needed to rant.",

In Windows sound settings - everything was detected fine with \"Dolby Access for Home Theatre\". Local files were fine playing Dolby Atmos with MPC-HC or VLC but any streaming platform would not work. I would only get \"Spatial Audio\" which was nothing other than Stereo when played through my amp.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nIf you do a\u00a0**fresh/clean**\u00a0install of Windows 11 24H2 (Upgrading from previous versions will\u00a0**not**\u00a0have the issue) then you will be missing the AC-3 (\"Dolby Digital\") codec as per the following article.\n\n**The cause:**\n\n[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-in-media-player-d5c2cdcd-83a2-4805-abb0-c6888138e456](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-in-media-player-d5c2cdcd-83a2-4805-abb0-c6888138e456)\n\n**The fix:**\n\nDownload these and install - restart your system.

        "content": "\n\nIt kinda felt off.\n\nFirst of all, Gi-hun killing Dae-ho made no sense, him not even regretting it and then going back to his \u201cI\u2019m not evil like them\u201d persona when he was tested on whether he would kill the other contestants before the final game. Like obviously, he is kinda like them. He just killed a dude who literally did nothing wrong and who was crying and saying \u201csorry\u201d. Literally killed him with his bare hands. Bye. And then he refuses to kill the front man or the other players before the final game (who are actually bad people and did commit clod blooded murder multiple times and were planning on killing a BABY). no instead he goes after the one guy who actually wanted to help him but physically and mentally couldn't anymore. I get that Gi Hun wasnt really in the right state of mind but them attempting to go back to: oh gi hun you're actually a good person your not evil and you have principles'?? Like no he doesn't, it just felt so hypocritical to me. \n\nThis show keeps killing every character, and too many characters too soon, where just the most useless characters were left (I\u2019m looking at you, Player 100). So the last episode didn't really have any high stakes in my opinion and didn't feel that intense. \n\n\nAlso, Player 333\u2014what happened there? I know he was a shitty person, and I was okay with exploring that side of him, but we never really got an explanation or build-up to why he\u2019s actually this psychotic, to the point that he was willing to sacrifice his own baby. Like what? That came out of nowhere?? Needed better writing so we could understand what was even happening.\n\nI liked Gi-hun\u2019s last words, but that\u2019s about it in terms of what I liked about the ending. So many things didn\u2019t make sense\u2014 Jun ho literally circling the island for what felt like an eternity just to shout \u201cWHY\u201d to his brother and watch him go up and down a platform (not gonna lie, that was kinda funny). Like what was the point of that storyline? I\u2019m just so confused. The Front Man is still out there thriving, but In ho just doesn\u2019t care anymore? Bro moved on\u2014maybe he got sea sick \n\nThe Front Man literally had no screen time and wasn\u2019t affected by ANYTHING that happened. He was just so nonchalant about it, like it\u2019s a regular workday (probably is). But like, come on, dude.\nAlso literally no confrontation between front man and Gi hun?? What was all that build up in s2 for? Why wasn't there any conversation? Gi Hun literally just walked it off lmao he wasn't even mad about the betrayal he was like alright fine bye. \n\nDo we really have any indication that the games actually stopped in South Korea? 'Cause I don\u2019t think so. The VIPs left unaffected. Sure, the whole place burned down, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from just finding another location or building it up again. We got no real indication that this was the end of the games in SK.\n\nGi-hun sacrificing himself for a CGI baby (okay\u2026). I get it\u2014this is supposed to feel realistic and mirror corruption in real life, etc.\u2014but it just didn\u2019t feel well-executed. The build-up was weird and disjointed. Players acted way too out of character, and it just didn\u2019t feel satisfying. It felt rushed, like they just flipped a light switch\u2014\u201cokay, games are over, moral of the story is corruption will always win, and bye.\u201d",

I generally don't watch much Netflix\u2014my family does\u2014but lately, I've wanted to watch some series at night before going to sleep.\nThe thing is, I've watched two episodes halfway through, and my phone always freezes and then shows a green screen in the scariest way possible (like a dying GPU), which causes the phone to shut down completely.\nWhen I turn it back on, everything is normal.\n\nThis doesn't happen with any other streaming app or video player. I can't seem to find anything about this issue\u2014just people experiencing a green screen, but not having their phones freeze.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI just wanted to get your take on this. Do you actually enjoy how Netflix handles its series these days?\n\nThey drop a handful of episodes\u2014fewer and fewer \u2014and then split the season in half, making us wait\u00a0*years*\u00a0to get the rest. It\u2019s honestly driving me crazy.\n\nPersonally, I much prefer Disney+'s strategy of releasing one episode a week. It builds hype, whereas Netflix's approach kills it.\n\nLike... do they really think people still care about a show after all that time?\u00a0I can barely remember what I had for lunch, let alone a series I watched ages ago.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think. Am I alone in this?",
