        "title": "Night Agent - Plot Holes - Season 1",
        "content": "Watching the show for the first time. Pretty decent. Solid 7. Some unsatisfying plot holes though. Just thought I would create a list of them here. Feel free to add more in the comments. \n\nEPISODE 4 : Lorna's Death\n\nPeter and Rose meet Lorna, who clearly understands that there\u2019s a massive conspiracy and that assassins Dale and Ellen are hunting anyone connected to it. Lorna even carries a shotgun and helps Peter and Rose with intelligence they uncovered, which shows she\u2019s competent and aware of danger. Yet, despite knowing that she\u2019s now a potential target \u2014 with Dal\u200be and Ellen actively tracking their movements \u2014 she chooses to return to her isolated home alone with no backup, no protection from authorities, and no attempt to stay with Peter or Rose, even though she could have at least sought safety or helped defend them. Her decision makes little logical sense given what she knows, and it feels like a classic \u201cplot hole\u201d or plot\u2011induced stupidity moment where the story advances only because a capable character inexplicably makes an implausible choice. \n\nEPISODE 5 : Peter and Rose Don't Check Their Car For Bugs or Bombs After Leaving Georgetown Library \n\nPeter and Rose uncover the conspiracy tying the metro bombing to Turn Lake Industries  whose CEO, Gordon Wick, donates heavily to Vice President Ashley Redfield, suggesting Redfield may be involved in the cover\u2011up and potentially even behind the assassination scheme. They research this at the Georgetown University library, and it\u2019s clear that the stakes are enormous: the Vice President\u2019s daughter Maddie goes to Georgetown, her Secret Service detail knows Rose and Peter are there, and Redfield\u2019s position implicates the White House itself in the conspiracy, and that he has likely reported their location to Dale and Ellen. Despite this, and despite the fact that Dale and Ellen are already tracking them (a tracker is placed on their car), Peter and Rose leave the library without checking for bugs, calling for backup, switching vehicles, or taking any obvious security precautions, even though they know they\u2019re likely now fully compromised and in danger. It reads like an idiot\u2011plot moment where real tactical instincts and basic spycraft are ignored just to keep the narrative moving forward \u2014 your classic \u201ccharacters would never behave this way if they actually understood the risk.\n\nEPISODE 7 : Peter and Rose Are Discovered At The Pier With Jim's Boat \n\nPeter and Rose both know that Peter has been incriminated for the kidnapping of Maddie. Logically Peter is being thoroughly investigated and his apartment is being combed over by multiple agencies. Peter knows this because he's trained in counterintelligence. He must know that there is clear evidence tying him to his Godfather Jim. Peter must know that his Godfather Jim will very likely be interviewed. From there it would be easy to make the connection between his Godfather Jim and locations that they frequented together which might be isolated. Once again we have a plot hole where Peter who displays many characteristics of a very careful meticulous and intelligent FBI agent once again not displaying those characteristics in order to move the plot forward. It's not very satisfying for the audience when characters who are supposed to be more intelligent than they are act like idiots and you have elements of an idiot plot where the way the plot moves forward is characters act like idiots. \n\nI still like the show it's got good pacing, but I can't deny the idiot plot elements are irritating.

        "content": "I\u2019m just here to hate for a second and just see what everyone thinks. I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

Seeing people's personal backgrounds and giving us a reason to like the band. Them all posting on social media in real time as promo. They could've budgeted this by cutting out the whole LA trip and doing all that stuff in the uk as I mentioned for episode2. \n\nInstead it feels rushed. Doesn't seem like they mix well together - Nicolas and john shouldn't have to change their personalities just to fit in, that's obviously not gonna work long term. \n\nAlso 90% of simons comments are about how they look and their age lol which just feels creepy but suppose if they'd cut that out they wouldn't have any footage of him left. \n\nWhen they refer to it as a documentary, and the footage of his family life, I think they potentially had a different plan for what they wanted it to look like but either changed their minds or did it badly. They needed to commit to documentary style or competition format not both.",

Netflix has a long history of arguably terrible UI for navigating the app, but I honestly feel the current one is the worst. \n\nA team of people decided that it was a good idea to have the currently highlighted show consume 1/4 of your screen for an auto play then display just 3 other titles to the right of it. If you click right you get 1 new title visible and if you click vertically you get 4 new titles. Compound this with their constant repeated recommendations and you're bound to get a RSI in your thumb before you find something to watch.\n\nPersonally, I want to select movie/show, then genre, then see grouped suggestions and finally a full list if none of those tickle my fancy. Believe it or not, Netflix had this once a long while ago and has only removed more and more titles from being easily seen as options. It's now so bad, you just get 4 at a time.\n\nThis is ridiculous and I just wanted to rant. I complained to tech support and asked about any settings I could change or if there was a rollback option, but all I got was that the issue was going to be fixed under high priority, which I totally believe 100% *eye roll*",

        "content": "Show : The Night Agent - Season 1\n\nWatching the show for the first time and generally enjoying it \u2014 I\u2019d probably give it around a 7 overall so far. Good pacing and tension. That said, there were a few moments in later episodes where I wasn\u2019t sure if I missed something, so I wanted to ask how others interpreted them.\n\nEpisode 4 \u2013 Lorna\n\nWhen Peter and Rose meet Lorna, she seems very aware that there\u2019s a large conspiracy unfolding and that Dale and Ellen are actively eliminating people connected to it. She\u2019s clearly capable and prepared (the shotgun, her background, the intel she provides), which made me wonder about her decision to return home alone afterward. Given what she knows, I wasn\u2019t sure why she wouldn\u2019t stay with Peter and Rose, seek protection, or take additional precautions. Did I miss something that explained why she felt safer going back on her own?\n\nEpisode 5 \u2013 Leaving Georgetown Library\n\nAt the Georgetown library, Peter and Rose uncover connections between the metro bombing, Turn Lake Industries, and Vice President Ashley Redfield. With Maddie attending Georgetown and her Secret Service detail aware of Peter and Rose\u2019s presence, it seemed like their location might already be compromised. When they leave for the White House, I found myself wondering why they didn\u2019t check the car, change vehicles, or call for backup \u2014 especially given how cautious Peter is elsewhere in the season (burner phones, surveillance awareness, etc.). Was this meant to show urgency, or is there an in-universe explanation I missed?\n\nEpisode 7 \u2013 The Pier and Jim\u2019s Boat\n\nBy this point, Peter knows he\u2019s being investigated for Maddie\u2019s disappearance and that his apartment and personal connections are likely under scrutiny. Knowing that Jim is his godfather and that their relationship could be uncovered, I was curious why the pier felt like a safe enough location. It made me wonder whether Peter underestimated how quickly investigators could connect those dots, or whether the show intended this as a calculated risk.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m still enjoying the series and plan to finish it \u2014 I just wanted to see how others interpreted these moments, or whether there are explanations that become clearer later on.",

I was pleasantily surprised at what a clever and fun horror movie it was, definitely recommended if you like horror films.\n\nToday I was going through my List and saw that I had added - It's What's Inside and so I decided to watch it. It's the kind of movie where it tempts you to switch it off in the first 20 mins, but oh man, am I glad I didn't. It's an absolutely brilliant movie. Yeah, it has a few flaws, but at the end of it, I was thinking what the hell did I just watch, but in a good way!\n\nCan't recommend this enough. You will be pausing quite a bit because it will twist and turn your brain!\n\nAny other good reccomendations?",

        "content": "Them basically writing shows to \"accommodate\" for the idea that people are probably going to be scrolling on their phones while watching them, so they simplify and dumb down their shows so people can still understand what's going on while paying attention to something else. [x](https://medium.com/enrique-dans/second-screen-viewing-netflix-succumbs-to-the-dictatorship-of-the-smartphone-6b639c829fec)\n\nand quite frankly, I think this is a horrible idea. one that's going to do more harm than good. we should ***not*** be dumbing down media and art as a whole *just because* some people *might* not happen to be paying full attention.\n\nand Stranger Things 5 was a clear example of this. a good majority of the dialogue was overexplainy, exposition dumpy, unnatural and held your hand and basically treated you like you were stupid.\n\nand if THIS is any indicator of how netflix is about to write their shows in 2026 and onward? respectfully count me out, because..... \ud83d\ude2c",

        "content": "I absolutely would not want either one of these two goobers on my own/my family\u2019s missing persons case. Both of these woman seem to share the same brain cell\u2026. On episode one with Lorraine missing, I feel that they were way too concerned with trying to pin the son for murder instead of actually trying to find Lorraine. Now don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026. I was convinced that he did it, but we were wrong! So maybe if they would have actually put some effort into trying to find Lorraine instead of solve a murder that never occurred they would have found her a lot sooner. \n\nThey had a search warrant on the house, they knew the carpet was ripped up and yet they decided to leave it there, then they had the audacity to start freaking out because the carpet was gone\u2026. Like DUH if she was murdered (which we now know she wasn\u2019t) of course the murderer would remove the carpet so why didn\u2019t they take it in as evidence??? Then they were talking about \u201cyeah we haven\u2019t had time to call the bank yet\u201d THAT WAS THE ANSWER THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!! And then when he started moving everything to the storage unit they said \u201cwe have the storage unit on lock down\u201d but then ten minutes later they are talking about how he\u2019s been taking stuff in and out of the storage unit\u2026. Uhh I thought it was on lockdown ??? And when they go to his truck in the junk yard and they see blood all over the air mattress they said \u201cshould we call the forensic lab down here?\u201d Well no shit Sherlock. Like holy crap!!! And then every time they went to the sons house that one police officer keep saying she was scared of him more than once and waited for backup even when there was more than one police officer ALREADY there\u2026.. like look, I am a women I know how scary it can be to be around men when you have no idea what they are going to do, but you\u2019re a police officer. If you\u2019re gonna be terrified of doing your job then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a police officer. \n\nThis show mad me so mad watching these two woman. And god forbid if I ever go missing and they end up on the case then you might as well just assume I\u2019m dead because I\u2019m surprised they have ever even solved one case. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being harsh but this is just my point of view on this, what do you guys think??
