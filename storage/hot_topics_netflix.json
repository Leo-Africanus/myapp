        "content": "Please do not kill my for this, I can understand some of the appeal such as the animation and some of the jokes being kindaa funny (most of them weren\u2019t) and it was entertaining to watch with zero brain cells. But people calling it a masterpiece, I don\u2019t really get I.\n\nTLDR: clique gacha life story, confusing theme with the demons, bad dialogue, fast pacing, etc gripes.\n\nThe story was clique, I thought there could have been some potential with the beginning of the idols passing down their roles cleansing demons to show the shift from religion to pop culture (idk something like that, just something more interesting) but it ended up just being a cheesy gacha life type story with \u201comg I\u2019m the secret kpop demon girl while my friends are hunters, need to show them my demon scars\u201d felt just corny and the message was also kind of conflicting considering they accepted the main character for being a demon but not the less attractive demons that they kill and even the saja boys, like what are they trying to say? Are demons good or bad. \n\n\n\n\nAlso some bad dialogue, especially for the side girls who get almost zero attention on their arcs and just get it said out loud, like in the doctor scene where the guy just says random \u201cissues\u201d about zoey and mira which literally aren\u2019t shown at all in the story, along with just general corny and clique dialogue but I can maybee excuse it since it\u2019s a kids movie.\n\n\n\n\nLastly I feel the Saja boys were just kinda skimmed over? While I don\u2019t know if this is true but apparently each one of them were supposed to represent something wrong in the kpop world which I did not see, I thought they were just playing off of tropes for kpop (maknae for baby and visual for Abby kinda) but if that was there intention they did a bad job, especially since the HUNTERX girls don\u2019t experience any of those issues themselves and the guy who helps produce for them is super sweet. Which take this one with a grain of salt cause maybe people watching it are overthinking it.\n\n\n\nAlso I thought the songs were almost below average for kpop? I\u2019m not much of a kpop guy (I use to be a fan in the 2010s but grew out of it) but i feel like these songs were kinda cheesey but again I don\u2019t listen to modern kpop so idk. \n\n(Also I guess I can\u2019t blame them for fast pacing cause they were forced to cut the movie down but I feel like maybe the story could have been changed a bit as a result? I don\u2019t know)\n\n(Also don\u2019t come at me with the \u201cit\u2019s just a kids movie\u201d excuse cause spiderverse was genuinely so good and made by the same studio with much more substance and better pacing) \n\n\nTell me what you think cause this was just my opinion on the film. I understand why some may like it but the masterpiece claim seems a bit of a stretch.",

A good storyline, strong characters, and a little intensity go a long way for us. Bonus points if it\u2019s the kind of show that makes you say, \u201cOkay, one more episode\u2026\u201d\n\nIf you and your partner have a favorite series that really pulled you in, we\u2019d love to hear it. Thanks in advance for the recommendations! ",
