I know it is just fiction and all that. Still, as a watcher, I cannot get myself across the fact that the things they show on these series are insulting to our intelligence as viewers. In The Diplomat, the British prime minister speaks to the US Ambassador with much insolence. It has nothing to do with diplomacy norms.",

If they had of spoken to police or FBI I believe he would have been taken in for questioning and possibly arrested or at least monitored very closely. Therefore not escaping so he could end his own life rather than face the consequences of his actions. \n\nSecondly - they lost their daughter. She has not communicated with them since Brian passed away. They never- according to her and her husband- confided in them. \n\nThirdly - their reputations in the community. People are angry at them. Blaming them for not assisting parents desperately trying to find their daughter. \n\nAnd finally financially - they had to pay Gabby\u2019s parents a significant sum - not disclosed - from the settlement of the civil lawsuit. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m wondering - was it in fact sound legal advice?\nWhat are your thoughts?

If he was so merciful why wouldn\u2019t he just shoot her like he did himself? I think it\u2019s just another lie to fuel his. I also want to point out that almost every post on her instagram has the caption edited to include a long paragraph about their day and tags Brians account at least 5 times, while her original captions are typically an emoji or one word. And her last post was August 25th titled \u201cHappy Halloween\u201d. Um halloween isnt for 2 months?? and wouldnt that have been posted after her death? Just some of my thoughts. ",
