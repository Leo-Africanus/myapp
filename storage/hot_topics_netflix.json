I love a show that has me yelling at my TV. I would like to take this opportunity to list a few of the people in this show who pissed me off.\n\n1. Abbott - Why would you approach someone who you know is a pysopath and serial killer pretty much, all alone, with one weapon? I knew as soon as he followed him he was gonna die, smh. It was so upsetting.\n\n2. Marvin - I completely understand him wanting to help his son and being in denial about how sick he really was, but he was constantly having to clean up Nile's messes. His legacy was also constantly at risk because of Nile's recklessness, but he just kept helping him over and over again. I know that's his son, but I would have called the police on him asap.\n\n3. Shelley - Was anyone else annoyed by Shelley? Why would you be mad at your ex wife for not being able to forgive the man who was driving drunk and caused a crash that killed your child?? And then to blame Aggie for his suicide to her face when she came to you telling you that she thinks Teddy was murdered. Obviously Aggie wasn't 100% in the right for doing things like throwing the brick through his window, but I can understand her anger. Also, having to see him constantly, knowing that he was never punished must have been hell. It's like they all made her out to be the crazy one for being angry.\n\nNile - Obviously he pissed me off cuz his impulse control was dog shit, and he was a terrible person all around, but he made a really good villain. I think a good villain makes the best stories.\n\nHow did ya'll feel?",

        "content": "So I\u2019m a long time subscriber of Netflix. Few days ago all of a sudden Netflix is acting as if I cancelled my membership, gives me error E111 on mobile, asks me to send me a link to my phone via SMS when I try to watch on TV. There is a timer that shows for how long the link is valid, counting down 5 minutes, but always after 5 seconds the tv will just skip to the screen where I can select which plan I want to buy. When I try to select a plan I get an error. When I try signing in on web, I get an error telling me to try again later and that they are having tech issues. Support chat is not available for some reason, calling them doesn\u2019t work as well. No VPNs, no multiple households. Just all of a sudden stopped working. I see that my last billing was a few days ago and actually left my banking acc. What can I do?",
