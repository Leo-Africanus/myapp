Is it a case of \"unless it goes viral, its a failure?\"\n\nThe economy of streaming services is pissing me off.

There is a scene where they are visiting a theater, (outside). One or two of the characters are looking through a box of props. and a knuckles like character (sonic) picked up a skull and referenced Shakespeare. \"to be or not to be, that is the problem\" He then got corrected because he said it wrong. I am 100% sure that scene exists because we had a skull decor and my sister, who was very young, picked it up and recited the same thing (wrong)\n\nAny help would be valued, and any further questions I will try to answer\n\nEdit: solved its mutant busters",

At the end of the chat, the representative gave me two different email addresses I could use to give feedback on my experience. I wrote out a nice long email detailing my experience, and...it bounced back. From both addresses. I just called phone support and was told that the addresses I was given were for outbound emails only, and that they didn't have a customer service feedback email address. When I asked how I could give feedback on my experience, I was told that the only way is by mailing a physical letter to their headquarters in Los Gatos, CA. (Oh, the irony). \n\nBlindly mailing a letter off makes me think I'll never know if it was received or seen, and I certainly wouldn't expect to ever hear back from anyone. So now I'm looking for a way to give feedback on my experience (and hopefully find a solution to what prompted my call in the first place) either online or via email. Does anyone know of anyway that I can do so? ",

It\u2019s a phenomenal solution that makes browsing Netflix possible for them. The feature still works on all other streaming services, including YouTube. They can cast their home screen and browse the Netflix catalogue while casting, but as soon as they try to put on a show it all falls apart. This isn\u2019t a matter of convenience, it\u2019s the only way they\u2019re able to navigate the UI. I have tried to show them how to do it normally, and I usually get responses like \u201cthat\u2019s too much for me, it\u2019s not worth the hassle\u201d. \n\nAny solutions, or should I contact Netflix support?",
