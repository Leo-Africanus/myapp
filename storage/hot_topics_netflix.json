It was so different from anything I have seen before. Strange, emotional, and full of mystery. The way the story was told kept pulling me in. I kept wondering what would happen next.\n\nAfter I finished I looked it up and saw it had a lot of praise but was cancelled after only two seasons. That made me kind of sad because I really feel like it could have gone somewhere even bigger if it had more time. Netflix has so many shows that end up disappearing under the radar, even when they are really good.\n\nSo I wanted to throw this out to the community. What is a Netflix show you think deserved way more attention? Not the big ones everyone talks about, but those hidden gems that maybe only a small group of people know about.\n\nFor me The OA will stick with me for a long time. I keep thinking about its ending and the questions it leaves open. I wish more people had seen it so we could talk about it.\n\nI would love to hear your picks. Is there a show you watched on Netflix that surprised you and deserved more love? Something you wish had gotten more seasons or more people watching? I feel like this could turn into a great list of hidden gems we all need to check out.\n\n",

It all consists of telling stories about psychosis actors, the Texas massacre, film producers who were inspired by him, and above all, romances they have had and experiences that are not real or are still theories.\nI thought I was going to see how Ed Gein acted, the things he did, what he did with corpses, everything. But instead I find that shit. \nI had a lot of hype for this season, I thought it would be good and above all that it would be the creepiest of all. But it feels pretty bad. It's morbid of me to want to see more of what the crimes were like and how he really acted, but damn, that's better than wanting to see stories that never happened about his life.",

        "title": "Wayward and Mae\u2019s acting (spoilers)",
        "content": "I literally spent the whole first episode repeatedly questioning who would cast Mae for a role in this show, and a lead role none the less, just for the episode to end and Mae\u2019s name being cited as the creator and (sometimes) writer. Their acting was so incredibly horrible, it felt like a self insert fan fiction where they could be the \u201cgood\u201d guy and wear tank tops that show off their biceps, and then occasionally take it off to show their tattoos and muscles. They\u2019re so flat and lack any genuine emotion or expressions and should have never been given a lead role, even if they created it, was the director not doing their job? Why\u2019re they being out acted by literally EVERY character and child in the show. Even that little cute kid that won the mountain episode was amazing despite barely having any speaking lines. I think they were out of their depth and should\u2019ve stayed as a creator but had the self awareness to understand that they weren\u2019t fit for this job.\n\nThe show itself was really interesting and had a lot of potential, however, there were some confusing plot lines. Honestly, for the most part, it seems like the \u201ctherapy\u201d they do actually helps the kids confront their issues in a way? But then Abbie told Leila that it was just Evelyn messing with her head and that her original memories were actually true. This was kind of confusing because it seemed like blocked trauma coming out but if they meant for it to be just a manipulation of Evelyn then I think it didn\u2019t translate fully for me. Of course this isn\u2019t to say that everything happening at the school wasn\u2019t fully insane. The ending also didn\u2019t sit right, specifically Alex\u2019s character arc. How does the character who is constantly trying to do good end up staying through that? Is it because he keeps violently hurting people over and over again so now he feels connected to her because \u201cawe babe we\u2019re both murderers &lt;3)? He pissed me off so much every time he would hurt someone because, for example, with that one dad whose house he went to, he could\u2019ve fully stopped him and told him that he wasn\u2019t a spy, but he chose to beat his ass till he was half dead? If they meant to show that Evelyn was right because he repeated the patterns of his fathers violence even while actively trying to be different then that would make sense, but I think the way they wrote the story, and once again, Mae\u2019s HORRENDOUS acting, it didn\u2019t translate well. I suppose it would also make sense why he chose to stay given Evelyn\u2019s scene telling them that he doesn\u2019t love his wife and he just loves the idea of the family she can give him, but I think these thoughts and emotions should\u2019ve been expressed in a better way, because with Alex\u2019s constant flat tone and facial expressions regardless of what\u2019s happening in the scene, you\u2019d think there were pebbles up there.\n\nAlso, a little note of appreciation for the actress who played Evelyn, she was AMAZING, her character deserved a bigger, better show.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I think writing all of this down helped me understand some decisions that I hadn\u2019t considered.",

It's not the same actors but they're dressed and look exactly like the characters. They even recreate a scene from that show in this one. \n\nI couldn't believe my eyes, I was seeing another show within this show. Ryan Murphy should just make mindhunter season 3, he basically recreated it. \n\nBut they have ed gein solving the ted bundy case, what is going on? It's like they didn't have enough content for all 8 episodes so they just went crazy with the last one. Also episode 8 is boring, outside of the crime origin part, ed by himself in the mental hospital just isn't interesting. They also have 2 dance sequences and the show just drags at the end. Theres no more plot just end the show. \n\nThey also beat you over the head with ed influencing psycho, Texas chainsaw massacre and silence of the lambs. They only have one shot of the silence of the lambs. I think it's kinda unfair that we get backstory of how psycho and texas chainsaw massacre was made but only 1 shot for silence of the lambs \n\n",

I also knew that since it was close to October I should watch it during the month. \n\nGreat idea, because it's the perfect thing to watch to get into the Halloween spirit and at the same time get some light-hearted horrors.

        "content": "The Ed Gein story is horrifying and grotesque. It inspired so many Hollywood killers like Leatherface and Norman Bates. But man, Ed Gein in the Netflix show is so funny. I find myself laughing way more than I expected. His voice is so goofy, it is almost cartoonish.\n\nThe show feels a bit unfocused. The whole Nazi influence angle about him being inspired to make human skin lampshades by Ilse Koch the Beast of Buchenwald is likely true in part, but they overstate it. Gein was interested in true crime, human atrocities, and other disturbing things, but the show paints him like he was a Nazi. They could have mentioned it once and moved on, but they really overdo it. That scene at the Tavern especially felt so weird and unnecessary.\n\nIt is also much more historically inaccurate than I expected. They take way too many artistic liberties. I even googled some of the stuff he supposedly did, and a lot of it never happened. The show invents characters like a romantic interest, suggests he influenced or consulted on other crimes, exaggerates his psychological state, and misrepresents his family and relationships.\n\nHitchcock intentionally did not show the gruesome shower scene in Psycho, but this show goes full on with it, making people disgusted and frightened. Most of what happens on screen never actually happened and is just for drama, which is fine if it is focused and well done.\n\nAnyone else find it tonally all over the place? Like half thriller-drama, half accidental comedy? I wanted to like this because the Monster series was intriguing and I learned stuff about Dahmer and the Menendez brothers, but this just feels like modern Hollywood slop. ",

        "title": "Netflix Has Gone Downhill",
        "content": "I\u2019m bracing for downvotes, but hear me out: Netflix has gone down. Not crash-and-burn down, but a steady slide from must-have to \u201cI\u2019ll resub when there\u2019s a buzzy release.\u201d I get that plenty of people still love it, but what used to feel like discovery now feels like searching, and that shift matters.\n\nThe biggest crack is trust. Too many promising shows get axed after a season or two, so viewers stop investing. It\u2019s hard to recommend something when you might be setting a friend up for a cliffhanger that never gets resolved. Netflix still lands hits, but fewer cut through the noise, and the middle tier\u2014the quirky, mid-budget series that built the brand\u2014has thinned out. What\u2019s left is an awkward mix of glossy tentpoles and disposable reality.\n\nPricing and policies haven\u2019t helped. Between tier reshuffles, an ad-supported option, and the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix asks for more while delivering less certainty. If I\u2019m paying premium, I want premium clarity: finished stories, a strong middle class of originals, and an interface that helps me find them. Instead, the algorithm cycles the same tiles, autoplay shouts at me, and the Top 10 often reads like a marketing strip rather than a reliable compass.\n\nThe binge model, once Netflix\u2019s superpower, is showing its limits. A full-season drop creates a weekend of hype and a Monday of amnesia. Competitors that pace releases weekly keep conversation alive longer, which builds community and anticipation. Netflix\u2019s experiments with split seasons feel more like damage control than a coherent strategy for keeping shows in the zeitgeist.\n\nI know the counterpoint: scale demands broad bets. Serving the whole world means optimizing for averages, and averages don\u2019t produce many cult classics. There are still gems\u2014especially international series\u2014but they\u2019re buried under repetition and generic thumbnails. Personalization should feel like a path that widens as you walk it, not a carousel that loops you back to the same five options.\n\nWhat would winning look like? Start with a renewed commitment to finishing stories\u2014greenlight responsibly and communicate clearly about endpoints. Reinvest in the mid-tier that keeps people engaged between megahits. Rethink curation beyond raw engagement: elevate human-programmed shelves, surface more staff picks, and rotate true discovery rows weekly. On product, make autoplay opt-in, expand \u201cbecause you watched\u201d with smarter, transparent explanations, and let users pin interests so the home screen adapts to them, not the other way around.\n\nAnd if you disagree, that\u2019s fine. I expect pushback, maybe even a pile-on. But the criticism comes from a place of former love. Netflix made streaming exciting because it felt bold and curious. Lately, it feels cautious and crowded. The audience is still here, willing to be surprised. The question is whether Netflix wants to be surprising again.\n\nIf you\u2019re still all-in on Netflix, tell me what I\u2019m missing and what\u2019s genuinely great right now. I\u2019d love to be convinced to stay subscribed year-round instead of hopping in and out for the next shiny release.\n\n",

It was his imagination that created her.\n\nMy arguments:\n\t\u2022\tHe had schizophrenia, so he imagined many things that weren\u2019t there or forgot things.\n\t\u2022\tWhen Adeline came into his house and said she was going to clean up, she started doing that. But when the police arrived, you could see how filthy the place really was and that nothing had been cleaned.\n\t\u2022\tThe psychologist in the series even said that he hears other voices encouraging him, when in reality, it\u2019s his own thoughts. You can also hear Adeline saying, \u201cHave sex with a corpse,\u201d to Ed Gein. That was what he was thinking at the moment, but he thought she was the one saying it.\n\t\u2022\tIn the last episode, it\u2019s mentioned that the asylum has to make budget cuts, so it\u2019s possible he wasn\u2019t getting his full medication anymore. His schizophrenia might have partially come back, which is why Adeline Watkins appeared in his mind again.\n\t\u2022\tIn the last episode, we see that she\u2019s the same age as when Ed was arrested, so in his mind, she never aged.\n\t\u2022\tBefore anyone argues that she had separate scenes without Ed Gein \u2014 like when she went to New York \u2014 Ilse Koch, the Nazi, also had scenes where Ed wasn\u2019t present. He just wanted to make it seem real in his mind.\n\nI think they wanted to show us by him saying. Don\u2019t kill people to her. He grew as a person and was saying to himself. I\u2019m not going to kill people again. Because it is wrong \n\nI know she really existed; she said she had a relationship with him, but later she took it back.\n\nI think Ryan Murphy wants us to decide whether it was real or not since many people believe she actually had a relationship with him, while others say she was a liar.\n\nJust like in The Menendez Brothers, you also see the parents\u2019 side \u2014 that they\u2019re proud of their kids. Ryan Murphy does this to make us decide which side is real. That\u2019s exactly what happens in this series \u2014 he wants us to decide whether she was real or not.\n\nLet me know if you disagree \u2014 I\u2019m curious to hear your opinion on my theory.",

        "content": "So I know they said that the show was based on their friend\u2019s experiences in a Troubled Teen institution but from interviews, it seems like their friend was there for conversion therapy. \n\nWhen watching this show I was kind of taken aback by how accepting everyone was of a transman in 2003 and was confused about the camp not being homophobic, again in 2003. \n\nDidn\u2019t most of these schools have conversion therapy, at least back then? Mae\u2019s character Alex even hinted at it when talking to one of Laura\u2019s ex classmates. \n\nI wonder if this was a choice by Mae because they were planning to play the main character? So it would be normalized in the show and it wouldn\u2019t be odd that the town just accepted and respected a transman? \n\nIt just feels disingenuous to the time, but I was a kid and living in the bible belt so maybe my memory is skewed. \n\nI think it should have been a plot point to be honest, it would add more to the story.

I\u2019m not sure if this allowed on this sub, sorry if not!\n\nMy boyfriend created his Netflix account on his TV, and never linked his phone number, or verified his email.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an issue until he tried logging on the mobile app, to find his email wasn\u2019t working. \n\nThrough a lot of rabbit holes, we found he misspelt his email. Now, he created that misspelt email account, but can\u2019t login to it, due to Gmail flagging it. We have to wait a few business days for it to be repealed.\n\nWe tried contacting chat support for Netflix, but the help we got was very short and rude. They kept sending up the same three suggestions that pop up on the main Netflix help page. Which is no help to us, we can\u2019t access the email. \n\nWe kept pushing for help, to which the Netflix support agent said no one would help us, and the account is now under monitoring.\n\nIt\u2019s to the point where we are considering going to the bank and having them cancel Netflix for us. Does anyone have any suggestions on what we can do? This has been a huge headache, and a big turn off for Netflix. ",
