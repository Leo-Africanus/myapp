She said her goal was to create the most boring show ever.  She worked in an office with cubicles and in one episode went on a very awkward date. The entire show was awkward but weirdly compelling. There were pencils and old school tech. Not sure where it was filmed but it reminded me of Monterey or N CA. I have tried to find it again many many times but can\u2019t find it. ",

Who's to say he wouldn't save the biggest known monster for last, jack the ripper?orr.. War crime is technically true crime. Whats to say he isn't saving the worst criminal story depiction known to mankind for last? (Austrian painter) It's a leap to say but I believe it's probability because we know now that Ryan Murphy wouldnt stray away from filming that part of history, and he does like to go all out. Who knows maybe, but we already got confirmation for season 4 and who the story is about, this is just for the seasons down the road. ",

I can't understand why the writers decided having such a dislikeable villain as the main character would be a good idea. Nearly \\*all\\* of the other characters experience character growth and change, but Devi just keeps adding more fuel to the dumpster fire, and it stinks. I am halfway through season 2. I only keep watching the series because I want to know what happens with the \\*other\\* characters. No fault of the actress--she got dealt this sh\\*t script, but at this point, best end would be Devi dies. Very few people in her life wouldn't be better off without her.",

I get writers take artistic liberties for entertainment but what they came up with was just so perverse. Mary Hogan was a former madam in Chicago? Bernice was a desperate old kinky cougar looking for a sugar baby? Was this to make us feel less sorry for them? Like maybe they deserved it bc they weren't \"virtuous\"? There's very little background online about either of the victims, at least nothing I could find, so I cant understand why they made these choices for these women? The only thing I could come up with was Ryan Murphy really doesn't like women.",

His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety in 1957 after authorities discovered that he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned keepsakes from their bones and skin. He also confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957. It is believed Gein's actions were caused by severe psychosis.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished watching Boots on Netflix and wanted to share some thoughts.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how the show treats LGBT characters in a natural, realistic way. Unlike series like Heartstopper, it\u2019s not overly sweet or romanticized  it has humor and light moments, but it doesn\u2019t sugarcoat everything. The LGBT aspect feels like one part of the characters\u2019 lives rather than the sole focus, and, at least from my perspective, it avoids stereotypes.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think about this approach. Did you notice how the show handles LGBT representation without making it the only focus? Did this affect how you connected to the characters and the story? Personally, I found this more realistic style refreshing compared to more \u201cfeel-good\u201d shows, and I\u2019d love to know if others felt the same. Were there particular moments that felt especially natural or well-balanced to you?\n\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts and hearing how others experienced the series!\n",

        "content": "I just finished watching the Victoria Beckham documentary and I really enjoyed it. I came to like the Beckham\u2019s after watching the first documentary that featured David and the whole time I was thinking when are they gonna do a series about Victoria? I really like their love story and hope that Netflix does more on them in the future especially now that David owns his own soccer team.",

        "content": "Is it no longer considered bad taste to make shows about murderers that almost exploits the suffering of others through glamorization? It is one of the most tasteless and disgusting shows I've ever seen. There are better ways to make an impact without having to watch 10 scenes of a dead bodies getting f***** and 600 people getting grotesquely murdered with every brutalized second on display.\n\nEdit: I have no problem with violence or gore in film, TV, video games etc. However, if im gonna have to watch some guy fuck a dead body for the love of the game every 10 seconds, the plot better be good and add something interesting to the conversation. If not, im not interested in some murder porn fantasy that isnt made in good faith to the people who actually suffered that freak. But, I shouldn't expect anything more from the company that also released catering to pedos.",
