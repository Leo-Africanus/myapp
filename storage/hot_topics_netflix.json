And when it shows the mom watching them the night she killed Rachel it shows Rachel all normal and happy exiting the truck and saying bye. If they just got in this physical fight I don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve appeared all happy walking out of his truck? \n\nAnd what kind of teenage girls pay men to rape another teenager and just watch, what do they get out of that? It shows Rachel getting paid but is she not rich herself why does she need the money? Also, these men are so despicable to do something like this then what\u2019s to stop them from not paying and raping all of them for free? \n\nAnd why is Lexi mad at Anna when Anna saved Lexi from getting raped at her own expense? And does she know her husband is sleeping with Anna? If yes, why is she ok with it and what were they planning on doing at the lake house?\n\nWhy did Zoe tell Jack Anna isn\u2019t who you think she is based on the 20yr old rape? If anything that would be bad on her not Anna? \n\nSo many unanswered questions/plot holes ",

Hwang is producing the series, which has been described as a 'high-stakes casino crime drama,' but there is at least one element in the description that sets this new series apart from Hwang\u2019s most well-known work.\n\nIn The Dealer, Geonhwa is a casino dealer who has to return to the shadowy world of illegal gambling after she falls victim to a scam and has to put her wedding plans on hold. However, to give her an edge at the tables, she 'is compelled to tap long-suppressed supernatural abilities,' which sounds like such a fun spin on the Squid Game formula of high-stakes tension and uneasy alliances with huge sums of money on the line.\" -full article [here](https://www.thepopverse.com/tv-squid-game-netflix-creator-next-project-the-dealer-supernatural-twist)",
