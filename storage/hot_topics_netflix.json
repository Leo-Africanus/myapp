        "content": "At some point in the past five years; perhaps between the eighth season of Love Is Blind and the 437th rebranding of The Bachelor; televised dating quietly stopped being about dating. Instead, it became a parade of bronzed narcissists dry-humping on bean bags for the chance to sell flat tummy tea and boner pills to strangers on Instagram. Into this rich tradition steps Netflix\u2019s latest entry, Sneaky Links: Dating After Dark, a show that dares to ask: What if your ex-booty call was also your soulmate? (And what if you were filmed trying to figure that out while shirtless, emotionally stunted, and surrounded by Ikea furniture?)\n\nIf you, like me, are 43 years old and unaware that \u201csneaky link\u201d is Gen Alpha for \u201cbooty call,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. Apparently, the term \u201cbooty call\u201d was too on-the-nose for a streaming platform that also produces prestige dramas about Elizabethan corsets and talking bears. Instead, we get \u201cSneaky Links,\u201d a phrase that sounds like a sketchy URL you click by accident while searching for airfare.",

Half way through the show I thought this was sci-fi and then it got weirder and weirder. I skipped through most of the family scenes  to save some time and I was mostly curious where they're going with this. Then came people dying mysteriously, cartoon villians from the government performing medical experiments on people searching for \"the Holy Grail\", \"The Major\" who's way up the ranks to conduct large operations that even the NSA is not aware of. The scientist who's there to explain shit to people with psychic powers called \"the calling\", things disappearing, symbols, egyptian mythology, dead people coming back to life, Noah's Ark, and other \"mysterious\" phenomenon.\n\nI got even more excited when I realized there's 4 seasons of this. I don't know how it was even possible to stretch this for that many seasons and this got my curiosity even more. Most of the time I'm just skipping through the episodes until I get to see Michaela's pretty face but everything's all connected. Wow.\n\nTwenty years from now, this is gonna be a cult classic.

My PC is in a different room and I like to play shows while I work.\n\nWhat made it more frustrating is that Netflix sends a code by email that expires in 15 minutes. Each time the email took around 20 minutes to arrive. After five failed tries it made me wait 24 hours before I could try again.\n\nI checked and the only devices connected are inside the house.

The black policeman pissed me off, but I also understood where he came from, bc my grampa used to say similar things. The white police officer made me mad also, cuz why was he so racist for? The husband was saying slick ish too\ud83d\ude44\nI just wish it was a bit longer to show the aftermath. But overall it was an 8/10.",

Is it a GOAT\ud83d\udc10 or Overrated...?\n\n  \nFor me, it\u2019s a **GOATED** show and easily the **best I\u2019ve ever watched**.  \n*PS \u2013 I haven\u2019t watched Game of Thrones yet. Still need to find out if that can beat Breaking Bad for me. My hopes are low.*",
