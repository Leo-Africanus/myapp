I'm always trying to catch something fresh before it gets too popular or disappears from the homepage.\n\nLooking for anything that\u2019s well-written, mysterious, or addictive. I\u2019m open to other genres too if the story and acting are solid. Just don\u2019t want anything slow or boring.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen something this year that\u2019s underrated or really good, I\u2019d love your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Loosely based on true events the drama is very engaging but troubling in the brutality of the crime. Subtitling (or dubbed English) from Hindi is good but occasionally the spoken English (not captioned) is hard to make out. Acting is very good with the dramatic focus being on the under resourced local police identifying and tracking down the suspects against background of political pressure. I like getting an insight into The culture of both police and locals. But be warned: though not graphicly shown, the discussion of sexual violence is stark.",

But then I thought about it, and it has a lot of depth. Maybe I\u2018m overthinking this, but this series shows us how easy it is to make the women the villain, how to frame them and how we do so easily believe it. Looking back, I just ignored the signs of Kiki being just nice without any agenda. The whole time I expected her behaviour to be calculating and cunning. I  jumped to the conclusion that she must be the bad guy as the show wanted us to believe at first. Even her behaviour contradicting this assumption didn\u2019t sway me at first. But now I see the man who manipulates the viewers perspective. I so easily believed Peter when he talked about his alienation from his kids and it being kikis fault. But when she talked about how small the marriage made her and how horrible the kids were to her, it didn\u2019t quite resonate as much. Frightening tbh, particularly because I would go as far as saying I have definitely and massively educated myself about the patriarchy and intersectional feminism. Maybe I\u2019m interpreting too much, but if you look at it from a feminist perspective then it - amongst other things - shows us the sway of men\u2019s opinion\u2019s still and the smear campaign that always hits the women ten times harder. It shows us the dangers of dependency, especially as a woman. So, I kind of liked the show. I liked how it was over the top mostly and also sometimes even a bit satirical while dealing with heavier topics.  Let me know what you think and what your interpretation is",
