        "content": "I am on Episode 4 of Season 1. Please no plot spoilers other than whether it gets better in your opinion or not.\n\n\nI really wanted to like it but I cannot get over how bad the writing is. I think it's a mixture of two things:\n\n\n1) It's very clearly a show for children, written with plenty of those comedic gags that only children find funny. This is in contrast to the way that Stranger Things was technically for children but managed to appeal to adults too, by avoiding really non-adult humour. Example from Wednesday: a character puking all of a sudden in someone's face. I can totally see a 8 year old finding this hilarious. Which is fair, but I thought it was also a show that adults would enjoy.\n\n2) The writers assume the viewer is either really dumb or has no memory, with the amount of repeating main facts/plot points in a very unnatural way. A lot of past plot is spelled out by the characters telling each other what happend (where they clearly know) so they the viewer can know, rather than what would be more natural, to imply it for the viewer to figure out.\n\nExample A (paraphrasing, but basically how it went down): Two characters meet after the years. \nCharacter 1: Remember when we met years ago\nCharacter 2: Yes I hid in the coffin during the funeral but I couldn't get out.\nCharacter 1: I found you and saved you in time.\n\nI mean, nobody talks like that about an event they both participated in.\n\n\nExample B.\n\nThere is this school ball called \"The Raven\" which characters talk about going to, from time to time.\nThen cut to a scene of a big ballroom and the school headmistress welcoming the guests saying \"Welcome to this year's raven!\"\nLike who talks like that?\nImagine showing up to your office Christmas party and the organiser saying \"Welcome to this year's Christmas party!\"\nIt's such a weird thing to say. Firstly, it's OBVIOUSLY \"this year's\" since it's happening now. Secondly everyone knows what party it is, that's why we came here.\n\nAdditionally, the characters *constantly* talk to themselves aloud when alone in rooms, to explain what they are thinking of what they are going to do. \n\nLike ok, sometimes people talk to themselves but in this show every character does it in every scene they are alone. It is sooo weird and unnatural",

Third episode made me realize that u can\u2019t feel bad for Jamie he has no remorse for what he did and clearly has issues. I feel bad for Jamie\u2019s family the most however especially the dad last episode I almost cried and I am a grown man. I do however think if the dad took more interest in his art and encouraged him and made him feel comfortable about himself he wudnt go down this path same with the mum as well they shudnt had been so hands off. The Detective realized this and started to spend more time with Adam which would help him in the long term.",

Netflix has officially wrapped up its [upfront](https://www.adweek.com/category/tv-upfronts/) discussions, closing its third annual TV upfront talks.\n\nAmy Reinhard, the company\u2019s ads president, announced the news, saying the streamer \u201cmore than doubled\u201d its overall commitments, which was in line with its expectations; saw year-over-year growth across categories such as retail, CPG, health and wellness, entertainment, and tech; and finalized deals with all major holding companies and independent agencies.\n\nRegarding its offerings, the streamer\u2019s ads leader said clients were looking forward to live programming, including WWE Raw, with Netflix partnering with DoorDash as the presenting sponsor for the new season. Meanwhile, the streamer sold out all in-game inventory for its upcoming [NFL Christmas Day games](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-pitch-to-advertisers-nfl-christmas-games/), closing partnerships with Accenture, FanDuel, Google, and Verizon for in-game and broadcast features.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the company, advertisers were also excited about its upcoming content slate, which includes the final season of Stranger Things as well as new seasons of Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Nobody Wants This, and Running Point. Netflix has also secured partners for its upcoming new programming, including an untitled Will Ferrell golf series.\n\nIn addition, Reinhard noted that clients were interested in new features from Netflix Ads Suite, which were originally [announced in May](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-adtech-upfront-partnerships/), and include enhanced data capabilities, expanded buying and measurement solutions, and new creative formats.\n\nAt the end of July, Netflix [announced its programmatic integration with Yahoo DSP](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-expands-ad-buying-access-yahoo-dsp/), which will be available to clients globally in October, and expanded its programmatic measurement with iSpot in the United States, now offering attribution measurement along with reach and frequency.\n\nThe streamer is also planning to expand its international measurement partnerships, having secured its first partner in APAC with Australia\u2019s OzTAM. The streamer said it\u2019s the first global streaming service to have its audience measured and reported by the company. Netflix also integrated with Kantar IBOPE Media in Brazil to validate campaign audiences, offering advertisers enhanced insights into individual reach and cross-media effectiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, on the targeting front, Netflix expanded its language targeting to support eight languages across its ad-supported countries, expanding from English and Spanish to French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to building a long-lasting ads business that not only drives impactful return on investment for our clients but also offers an entertaining and relevant experience for our members around the world,\u201d Reinhard said in a statement. \u201cAs we head into our third year of business this fall, we can\u2019t wait to continue to deliver a must-buy opportunity with leading technology centered around our must-watch Netflix series, films, and live events.\u201d\n\nWith the news, Netflix joins other companies like [NBCUniversal](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/nbcu-close-upfront-highest-ad-sales-volume-ever/), [Fox](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/fox-wraps-upfront-2-billion-sports-properties/), [Disney](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/disney-upfront-has-growth-in-sports-and-streaming-overall-volume-consistent/), and [TelevisaUnivision](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/televisaunivision-upfront-historic-digital-growth/) in closing its upfront talks for the 2025-2026 cycle. Similar to other publishers, Netflix did not disclose total volume or whether CPMs (cost to reach 1,000 viewers) increased or declined.\n\n[Netflix Says It Will \u2018Roughly Double Ads Revenue\u2019 This Year With \u2018Nearly Complete\u2019 Upfront](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-nearly-complete-upfront-secures-double-ads-revenue/)\n\nThe upfront closing comes not long after Netflix reported its Q2 earnings, where executives noted that the company was on track to double its ads revenue in 2025.\n\nAt its [upfront event in May](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-adtech-upfront-partnerships/), the streaming giant announced several adtech advancements, more robust branded partnerships, and said its ad tier reaches 94 million monthly active users globally.\n\nAmid upfront conversations, Netflix made a significant leadership move, with [Julie DeTraglia, vp, ads measurement strategy, exiting the company](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-vp-of-ad-measurement-julia-detraglia-exits-streamer/). DeTraglia [joined the company](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-builds-up-advertising-team-days-before-new-avod-tier-launches/)\u00a0in 2022 ahead of Netflix\u2019s ad tier launch, spearheading global measurement strategies to help build and develop the streamer\u2019s ads business, including its verification partnership with DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science.\n\nDuring its last upfront, the streamer also had a leadership shakeup, with [Peter Naylor, Netflix\u2019s former vp of ad sales](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/netflix-ad-sales-vp-peter-naylor-exits/), exiting in July 2024.\n\n# [Saleah Blancaflor](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/saleah-blancaflor/)\n\nSaleah Blancaflor is a TV reporter at ADWEEK.\n\n[@saleyley](https://twitter.com/saleyley)| [saleah.blancaflor@adweek.com](mailto:saleah.blancaflor@adweek.com)",
