How does this work with my \"Household\" account? \n\n**Scenario B:** same account, except I have a summer house in one state and a winter house in Florida.

        "content": "Already posted this but it got removed for some reason.\n\nI just finished watching *Million Dollar Secret*, and the ending totally threw me off. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but I\u2019d love someone to help clear it up.\n\nAt the end, only **Sam**, **Cara**, and **Correy** are left.  \n**Sam** doesn\u2019t get to move any boxes, so she\u2019s not important for this part.\n\n**Correy** thinks **Cara** has the money, but he wants to trick her into thinking he believes **Sam** has it.  \nSo when it's Correy\u2019s turn to move the money, he moves it into **his own box**, thinking he successfully tricked Cara.\n\nThen it's **Cara\u2019s** turn, and somehow she guesses correctly, moves the money back into **her** box, and wins.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m confused:\n\nIf Correy really thought he tricked Cara into thinking **he thought Sam had the money**, then he should\u2019ve moved the money into **Sam\u2019s box**. That way, if Cara believed the trick, she would\u2019ve swapped **Correy\u2019s** and **Sam\u2019s** boxes \u2014 and Correy would end up with the money -- thinking she kept the money for herself (or she could have not moved the boxes at all). But instead, Correy moved the money into **his own box**, which only works if Cara *doesn\u2019t* fall for the trick. So... mistake?\n\nBut Cara\u2019s move doesn\u2019t make perfect sense either.\n\nIf she truly thought Correy took the money from her, then logically, he would have put it into **Sam\u2019s box**, she should\u2019ve swapped **Sam\u2019s** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes \u2014 giving Correy the money.  \nInstead, she swapped **her** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes, which happened to be the right move \u2014 but only if she thought Correy had the money in *his* box, not Sam\u2019s.\n\nSo it seems like:\n\n* **Correy made a logic mistake** (he didn\u2019t follow through with his own bluff properly).\n* **Cara may have made a mistake or just guessed right**, which canceled out Correy\u2019s mistake and gave her the win.\n\nMy question is: how did *both* of them mess this up? These are smart people, and I get one of them making a mistake under pressure \u2014 but both? Were they overthinking it? Or was it possibly staged?\n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me, so if I\u2019m missing something or misunderstood their logic, please tell me.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nCorrey tried to trick Cara but didn\u2019t follow through on his own bluff properly. Cara made a move that only worked if Correy made a mistake \u2014 which he did. Somehow both of them made bad moves, but Cara still won. Did they both mess up, or was it staged?",

He would then need Cara to swap Sam and his box  (thinking that they were both empty and she still has the million) for him to win. There is no situation where he would have won after swapping his box with either of them. If he swapped with Sam, Cara would have swapped them back leaving Sam the winner and if he swapped with Cara she would have taken it back. Therefore the odds were very heavily stacked against him and he messed up massively.",

        "content": "\nI just finished the documentary about Piper Rockelle and the ex SQUAD. I feel bad for Piper. She\u2019s such a beautiful, talented little girl. She has so much potential but looking through her socials, it seems like she\u2019s really manipulated by her mother and she believes that everyone who left her is the bad guy. She\u2019s also been really acting inappropriately whilst being a minor. She had so many boyfriends and she doesn\u2019t even delete the contents she made with them (ex bfs)\n\nI think her mom taking advantage of her would similarly lead to her like Sky Bri whose mom is very much supportive on her \u201ccareer\u201d. Piper also hangs out with OF creators like Sophie Rain which looks like foreshadowing of what she will choose to become when she turns legal age.\n\nLooking forward to her response to all the allegations when she turns 18.
