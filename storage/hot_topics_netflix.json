Why didn't anyone say to the father when he gave those lies about Mag's father: Didn't your daughter claim to be friends with Mags? If she had been murdered by Jason, why didn't she know already to be afraid of him? Why did she marry someone who she thought had killed her friend?\n\nThere were SO many opportunities here to catch these people up in her lies and to send them to jail forever, and I am just beyond disgusted that there wasn't a bigger push to expose her for the BPD lying fraud she is, and HE is.",

There is NO WAY you would roll over and go back to sleep in that situation. She would have been awake and 911 called or ready to be called. ",

        "content": "So I signed into my Netflix account on the TV at an Airbnb a few weeks ago. When I left I forgot to sign out of the TV. Back at home now and upon logging into Netflix on my computer I noticed the profile names (5 in total) had been changed to slurs/profanity and the language settings had been changed to Thai. I suspect whoever stayed at the Airbnb after me must have noticed my Netflix account was still logged in and thought it would be funny. Harmless I guess so I change the profile names back to normal and get all the profiles back to the English setting. Then I noticed that none of the profiles matched my viewing history. For instance, I\u2019ve watched breaking bad front to back but each profile showed it as it hadn\u2019t been watched/wasn\u2019t in the \u201ccontinue watching\u201d section. I was in the middle of watching that new Vietnam War documentary and none of the profiles show it as being watched. So where did my profile go with all my viewing history and personalized recommendations? If my assumption is correct and it was the Airbnb guests who were fucking with my account then how could they have done this with just a TV remote? Did they just delete all the profiles and create new ones (no because cause my brothers profile still has his viewing history)? Did they delete just my profile and create a new one? Orrrrrr it has nothing to do with the Airbnb and did I just get straight up hacked in my account and they \u201ctransferred\u201d my profile? I just noticed on my computer that you can transfer profiles. Could that be it? can you do that on a TV? Also why would someone transfer my profile? I have so many questions. \n\nEdit: grammar and rereading this and I sound like a nutcase. ",

That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

        "content": "I\u2019ve owned this console since it was first released and Netflix has been the poorest performing streaming app by far. \n\n1.  While opening Netflix takes a considerably a longer time to boot and load. Prime, YouTube, Hulu, Paramount Plus, Peacock, HBO Max , they all boot up almost instantly. Never Netlfix, and then our next problem: \n\n2. 80% of the time it doesn\u2019t actually boot correctly to the Home Screen, rather you get an error message. \u201cNetflix isn\u2019t working right now\u201d. After 2-6 failed connecting it will finally load with that loud drum sound \u201cdun dunnnnn\u201d\n\n3. This past couple of weeks on the home page the images for the shows and movies don\u2019t load, making it impossible to browse and select, the unloading grey boxes don\u2019t have written titles so selections don\u2019t work. Useless. \n\n4. Same issue while logging into my laptop, no images load. \n\n5. With Netflix prices going up and up and poor quality from the platform it\u2019s getting really tough to justify continuing to pay for a subscription. The app has never stacked up to the speed and quality to YouTube, Prime and virtually every other streaming platform. Choices of shows are great but when the UI interface is buggy and the damn thing doesn\u2019t even load correctly it\u2019s honestly not the top streaming app it once was. \n\n",

        "title": "Problems and plot holes in 1899 (Netflix)",
        "content": "Just finished\u00a0 1899\u00a0and loved the atmosphere, but the more I think about it, the more the plot holes and unresolved mysteries bother me. Here\u2019s my breakdown of the biggest issues\u2014let me know what I missed or if you have theories!\n\n# 1. The Simulation Twist Undermines Everything\n\nThe big reveal that it\u2019s all a simulation (or layers of them) makes emotional moments feel weightless. If nothing\u2019s \"real,\" why should we care about character deaths or trauma? Even worse, the rules of the simulation are never clear\u2014why do the black crystals, memory bugs, or the Prometheus ship behave so inconsistently?\n\n# 2. Character Backstories Go Nowhere\n\n1899\u00a0set up really interesting character stories but then forgot about them. The French couple Clemence and Lucien had a troubled marriage with hints of cheating or maybe an abortion, but none of it went anywhere. The French lady who seemed to be forcing Ling Yi into prostitution just disappeared from the story. Ling Yi and her mom did something horrible - they killed another girl to steal her identity - but the show never explained why this mattered. They also hinted Ling Yi might be pregnant, then dropped it completely.\n\nThe little girl Ada died suddenly for no clear reason. Krester's story about his scar and being gay started strong but went nowhere. Why did so many people jump off the ship? Was the simulation breaking? Miguel, the stowaway, had strange visions and a connection to the boy Elliot, but we never learned his backstory. Angel and Ramiro's secret about Ramiro killing a priest to pretend to be him also didn't lead anywhere.\n\nIt's frustrating because all these stories felt important at first, but in the end, none of them really mattered or got explained. The show made us care about these characters, then left us hanging.\n\n# 3. The Pyramid, the Black Goo, and Elliot\u2019s Role\n\n* The\u00a0black pyramid/archive\u00a0is treated as a big deal, but we never learn what it actually\u00a0*does*.\n* The\u00a0black substance\u00a0spreads like a virus, but is it code? A metaphor? Who knows.\n* Elliot\u00a0exists as a child in the simulation, but why? Is he a glitch, a memory, or a failsafe?\n\n# 4. The Ending Creates More Confusion\n\nMaura wakes up in\u00a02099\u00a0on a spaceship, implying the 1899 simulation was just one layer. But:\n\n* Why is\u00a0Ciaran\u00a0suddenly in control?\n* Are the other passengers real people or AI?\n* If this is \"reality,\" how does it connect to the 1899 simulation?\n\n# 5. Cancellation Left Us Hanging\n\nNetflix axed the show after one season, so we\u2019ll\u00a0*never*\u00a0get answers about Ciaran, the spaceship, or whether any of it mattered. The creators (*Dark*\u00a0fans know this pain) love complex mysteries, but without payoff, it feels like wasted potential.\n\n# Was It All Just a Video Game?\n\nSome theories suggest\u00a0 1899\u00a0is a\u00a0psychological experiment\u00a0or a\u00a0*Matrix*\\-style VR game, but with no S2, we\u2019re left guessing.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014did the plotholes ruin it for you, or was the ride worth it?",

        "content": "I feel like Netflix should enabled the \"data saver\" video quality preset by default for everyone, to combat climate change, reduce energy consumption and energy dependency from abroad, and reduce air pollution.\n\nMost people aren't gonna notice it anyway, and even if they do and complain, they before mentioned stuff is more important than \"eye candy\".\n\nAnd this should be the case for all other video streaming platforms and services as well, in my opinion, with people of course still having the option to change the quality manually if they want. \n\nBut Netflix should be first on doing this, and it would really help them reach their environmental goals.",

I think it\u2019s definitely that kind of show to watch after a long day at work and unwind. But is it worth watching all 7 seasons? I heard the writing gets worse after first few seasons. ",

Then they go to a church, which seems to be on the same side of the city as Tano's house. Then they bypass the wall of cars through a tunnel - and end up back at Tano's house! How is that possible? \n\nAnd then the people from the church set out for Campo de Mayo, but how could they do that if they are back at the \"wrong\" side of the city?\n\nIn the end, what was the goal of cutting through the wall of cars?\n\nAnother thing: the car Juan finds in the wall of cars seems to be on both sides of the wall.\n\nMaybe I got something wrong.",
