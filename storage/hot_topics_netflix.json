You can install it on any other Windows 10/11 device you sign in to with that account \u2014 no need to pay again.\n\n  \nWhy You Need the HEVC Codec for HD/4K Netflix on PC\n\nNetflix uses different video codecs depending on the device, platform, and stream quality. The key reasons for needing HEVC are:\n\n 1. 4K (and sometimes even Full HD) Requires HEVC on PC\n\n HEVC (H.265) is a more efficient codec than AVC (H.264). It compresses video better while keeping quality high.\n\n Netflix streams 4K content (and often HDR) using HEVC, which requires:\n\n   HEVC decoding capability\n\n   Secure content protection (DRM like Widevine L1 in hardware)\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the HEVC codec, Netflix falls back to AVC1, which maxes out at 480p or 720p, even with a 4K plan.\n\n 2. Windows 10/11 Doesn\u2019t Include HEVC by Default\n\n Microsoft used to bundle the HEVC codec for free.\n\n But around 2017, they stopped because:\n\n   HEVC is not free to license. It has royalty fees tied to it (paid to patent holders).\n\n   To reduce Windows licensing costs, Microsoft made it an optional \\\\$0.99 addon in the Store.\n\nThis is why TVs, phones, game consoles still get HEVC support for free \u2014 the manufacturer licenses it for that device. But with PCs (especially custombuilt desktops), you\u2019re responsible for getting the codec.\n\n 3. Why You Didn\u2019t Notice Before\n\n If you only watched Netflix at 720p or lower before, AVC1 was enough.\n\n Or you might\u2019ve been on a device that came with HEVC preinstalled (like a laptop from Dell, HP, etc.).\n\n Now that you're on the Premium plan, Netflix tries to stream 4K \u2014 but it can\u2019t unless your PC supports HEVC with DRM.\n\nWhy Charge \\\\$0.99 at All?\n\nThe \\\\$0.99 price is basically a token fee to offset Microsoft\u2019s licensing cost. The real reason you have to pay:\n\n Microsoft can't legally distribute HEVC for free on Windows unless it's covered by an OEM license (e.g. Dell paid for it for your laptop).\n\n You\u2019re only charged once per Microsoft account, and the codec is yours forever.",

And with *LD&amp;R*, each episode had its own unique style just like Black Mirror.\n\nI know Black Mirror is quite unique but does anyone know a show thats basically dark, weird, surprising, and ideally with different vibes or stories each episode???",
