You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

There's alot I can and want to say about the show but to streamline this Jamie discussion I'll leave it at I loved the show and acting.\n\nAfter finishing I started scrolling through r/Netflix and the amount of threads and comments about how Jamie is a monster, he was a psychopath, etc... was shocking to me. \n\nYes what he did was horrible and the way he did it was clearly very brutal, but like wasn't the entire point of them constantly mentioning incels supposed to be a clear indication that Jamie was not actually a \"bad\" kid, but just a victim of this Andrew Tate anti-women movement? I thought it was so incredibly in your face the entire show that it would be impossible for anyone to not realize what the message of the show was, but like I said I found an astounding number of threads and comments completely ignoring that Jamie was molded into a monster, not born one.\n\nThe 4th episode is just the parents grieving about what they may have done wrong and they even literally talk about how they thought he was safe at home on his computer, how more obvious can the writers / directors make it? Yet somehow people came to the conclusion he was just born a psychopath and all he needed was a trigger?!?!?\n\nTLDR: This show is about how the incel / anti-women movement impacts our young men correct? Not about the next John Wayne Gacey getting caught early before he could do more harm? Its shocking how many people completely missed the purpose of the show and somehow came to the conclusion that Jamie was just a natural born psycho and nothing more.",

        "content": "I just finished Adolescence on Netflix and was pretty blown away by the acting, especially since they shot each episode in one continuous take.  Specifically, in Episode 3, there's a 45+ minute scene in which the young boy (Jamie) is in conversation with the clinical psychiatrist Briony.  \n\nMy question is, how did that young actor (Owen Cooper) pull it off? Did they do a ton of rehearsals? Did he ad-lib any of it?  Did they have his lines posted up on big boards that they hand-held for his use, which they somehow managed to keep out of sight of the (constantly moving) camera?  How many full takes did they do before they determined that they had what they needed? \n\nApparently he's an unknown actor and this was his first role. Even if he's older than 13 in real life, he's pretty darned young to be able to pull off such a performance. \n\nUPDATE - found this article - [Owen Cooper in Adolescence: is this the best child acting debut since Jodie Foster? | The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/tvfilm/boy-adolescence-owen-cooper-b1217411.html)  \\- he was 14 at the time, and the 50+ minute episode took 3 weeks to film; 1 week of rehearsals, 1 week of 'tech' rehearsals, 1 week of final filming with 2 takes a day, roughly.  So maybe they did up to 10 takes and picked the best one? \n\nPretty amazing. ",
