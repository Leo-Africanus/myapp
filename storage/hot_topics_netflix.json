I don't want to imagine the smell or the illnesses people got because of it, but it's not going to last forever.  People have had to put up with worse.\n\nPooping in a bag... It beats pooping on the floor.  It's a logical measure to take when the sewage system stops working.  Poop in bags, it can all be collected, and it can be placed and contained in an appropriate area.  Truck drivers and van lifers poop in bags all the time.  It's no big deal.\n\nThose three women...  So many things about those women...\n\nFirst, the bride-to-be seemed like she was the inspiration for Kristen Wiig's role in The Californians on SNL...she was dripping with an abundance of unnecessary drama.  \"Why isn't the bar open???\"  Then taking the Imodium, doubling down on her fear of pooping without a toilet, and complaining about a soggy lettuce sandwich when there could have been zero food at all.\n\nThen the group talking about peeing in the shower.  It's like they were clueless about the fact they were born as human animals with biologic processes.  They seemed to not have an idea about how they could squat to pee in a shower.  They were disgusted with having to do it, needing a shower after.  Jeez ladies, it's just pee... ever been camping?",

Sometimes users just want to watch something without it affecting their recommendations or appearing in their viewing history. This would be really helpful for people who share accounts, or even just for times when you\u2019re watching something different from your usual preferences\u2014like a kid\u2019s movie, a guilty pleasure show, or a documentary for school.\n\nAdding incognito mode would allow users to explore more content freely, without worrying about Netflix\u2019s algorithm messing up their suggestions. People use incognito mode in web browsers all the time for similar reasons\u2014why not bring that privacy option to streaming too?\n\nAlso, I noticed a small typo in the original idea\u2014\u201cincognito mouse\u201d was probably meant to say \u201cincognito mode.\u201d But hey, imagine a sneaky little mouse sneaking around Netflix too! \ud83d\ude04\n\nOverall, I think this feature could attract a lot more users and keep current ones happier.\n",

Without giving away any plot points, if you appreciate intense, visceral action with a truly brutal edge, you absolutely need to add this to your watchlist. I'm not saying it's the same, but it delivers an unrelenting, high-octane experience that reminded me of the best parts of action thrillers, almost like a John Wick-level intensity but with its own distinct, darker flavor.\nIt's currently climbing the ranks on Netflix, and for good reason. Has anyone else watched it yet, or is it on your radar? Would love to hear your spoiler-free initial reactions or what you're hoping for if you plan to watch!\nCheers,\n\nu/killwish_",

There are so many decent shows and movies buried in there that never get the spotlight.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my quick review:\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe story was actually interesting. It felt like there\u2019s more to the story that we didn\u2019t get to see enough of. I\u2019d love to see it turned into a full series. it definitely has potential to expand.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\nThe animation could\u2019ve used some work. Most of the time, only the characters\u2019 mouths moved no facial expressions or detailed movement. It felt a bit stiff.\n\nA live-action version might be even better, honestly. The concept is strong enough to carry it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIt\u2019s enjoyable. I\u2019d give it a solid 7/10. Worth the watch. ",

I find it insane the cast all agreed this was the best possible ending.\n\nSo many characters wasted and built-up for nothing.\n\nJun-ho? He's a terrible Dora the Explorer. All this searching for the island across 2 seasons, WASTED. He doesn't even TALK to his brother. How in the hell is him just being sent the baby and money a satisfying conclusion for his character?\n\nDae-ho is another example. All this mystery of whether he's a fake marine or lying. It seems like he has an abusive dad, always changing the subject whenever he's brought up. You think we're going to get some story of him being traumatized right? NOPE! He's literally just a fake marine, he goes crazy and then he dies, murdered by Gi-hun.\n\nThe mother and son were an exact copy of the wife and husband. Grandma gives the inspiring speech... and then just kills herself.\n\nThe season is described as \"forgiveness\" by Lee Jung-jae. What forgiveness? I didn't see ANY of that.\n\nAnd MG Coin? This season basically just proved Thanos was right. Throughout the first 5 episodes, he's a genuinely well-written morally gray character... and then the finale throws it ALL out the window in lightning speed. He goes from protecting Gi-hun and the baby to suddenly trying to murder both. Right after asking if the baby is okay.\n\nThe writer/director claims he wasn't supposed to be a one dimensional villain but rather make \"human/realistic decisions\" but NONE of that was it. He just turned cartoonishly evil in the blink of an eye. A worse Sang-woo, at least his turn was gradual.\n\nAnd the ending doesn't even feel like a proper conclusion, just a set-up for the sequel's.

I think it has been a problem for longer, but it never used to be a thing that bothered me as much since I never used Netflix on my phone as much as I do now.\n\nI am currently using a Samsung 23 Ultra, but i am certain I have experienced this issue on previous Android phones I have used.\n\nI've found that every now and then, when I'm watching something on Netflix, the brightness seems to be too low despite me having it all the way up on the app in the overlay settings, and when I try moving the slider up and down, probably around 60%~ of the slider (from the top of the slider towards the bottom) doesn't change anything. When the slider is all the way around the bottom, it's darker, clearly lower brightness, but it only seems to brighten up to 30-40%~, after that, sliding it up higher makes absolutely no difference.\n\nAlso as I said before, confusingly, it seems to be on certain movies/shows, and as of posting this, the only show I can find where that is a problem is Inside Job, though I do remember this being an issue on previous movies/shows I've watched in the past.\n\nI have 3 questions really;\n1 - has anyone else experienced this issue with the brightness clearly not going above a certain point despite the fact that it should, due to sliding the brightness control slider higher\n2 - are there any known reasons for it happening to me, or fixes for it?\n3 - is it an issue more specifically with the individual shows somehow? (I can't tell, as the netflix website doesn't have a brightness slider, but shows that appear too dim on my phone appear brighter and fine on the website on my PC)",

Given its popularity, a spinoff or expansion of the universe feels like a no-brainer.\n\nBack in Season 1, a VIP mentioned that the games in South Korea were the best, which strongly implies that Squid Games are happening in other countries too. And in the final moments of Season 3, we even saw a game of Ddakji taking place in the U.S., hinting at a possible American version of the games.\n\nSo what do you think the future holds?\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d love to see a prequel exploring how In-ho won the game and became the Front Man after that, or even a deeper look into Il-nam and how the Games were originally founded. A version of Squid Game set in a different country could also be interesting, but I\u2019m more intrigued by the origins and inner workings of the existing story.\n\nWhat kind of spinoff or continuation would you want to see, and how high do you see the possibility for these Spinoffs?",

        "content": "No matter what show I watch, the episode will end abruptly a few seconds after the credits start. I find it pretty infuriating. The credits are still part of the episode, considering they'll have music, and animation if it's an animated show, so I wanna be able to watch or at least listen to them. The only thing I've been able to do is go back to the episode, fast forward to the very end, and then start after twenty seconds or so of credits. \n\nIs there any way to get Netflix to play the credits without interruption?",
