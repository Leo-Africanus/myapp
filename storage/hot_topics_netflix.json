        "content": "What\u2019s up r/netflix! I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Everything looked fake, this is a movie that doesn't know how to act like a movie. And that's when Tom Hardy stepped in. An actor that isn't sure how a real human acts. \n\nYes, this movie is stylized and over the top. It's not trying to be realistic, but I think it's supposed to be a video game movie. From the hijacker's neon LED masks to the impossible camera action, this is a video game movie. \n\nBut at the heart is Hardy, whom I'd love to see him play an average Joe, who works as an electrician, but doesn't have a weird accent, a bizarre walk, or looks like he's acting. Because that's all I see now after Capone, Venom, and now Havoc: Tom Hardy is ACTING. But not like real human being. ",

I saw someone write that it asks \"What if we had a horror movie director (Timo Tjahjanto) make a martial arts film?\" \n\nThere is 15 minutes of story buildup before the movie kicks into high-gear. Then on you see limbs broken, bones being used to block bonesaws, intestines flying, glass flying, and waves of enemies get torn limb from limb, followed every so often by a boss battle. One of which is the most epic female battle in the history of cinema. The choreography is insane! The gore is 11/10. The martial arts is high-octane.\n\nIt's the martial arts gore equivalent to what \"Black Summer\" is for the zombie genre.\n\nIt's an open secret that Netflix is going to make more content for the \"Tik-Tok\" generation attention span. I think movies like \"Carter (2022),\" The Night Comes for Us (2018),\" and the series \"Black Summer (2019)\" are great examples of this.\n\n\"Havoc\" just released and given the name you'd expect \"The Night Comes of Us\" on steroids, but it doesn't kick into gear until like an hour in. The movie is fine.\n\nPlease, let Timo Tjahjanto direct more Netflix movies. Tell him \"5 minutes plot buildup\" is all you need, and let him do his thing.\n\n",

        "content": "Heya!\n\nBinged the series last night and was pleasantly surprised with what I've watched. I am not into horse racing, and generally speaking, do not approve of gambling. That being said I approached the first episode with an open mindset and that if the first 10-20 minutes suck, then I'll just turn it off.\n\nIt started off a bit slow on the horses side and pretty fast on the glamour and glitz side, with lots of great personalities larger than life. The dapper jockey, the self-proclaimed race horse investor, the billionaire (there were a few actually) and a colorful and multi-national cast from the stables. Man, the show runners narrative building game was spot on! I felt like I was right there and then despite knowing nothing about horses, like I mentioned already.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much, so I'm gonna stop talking about what happened in the show, but will leave some notes to compare.\n\n- **Biggest surprise of the season**: Kenny McPeek. Whoa. What a man. What a rock. I did not expect to like him as much as I did by the end of the season. The way he was nonchalantly introduced and the part he played later was astonishing. Kudos to the show runners again.\n\n- **Biggest disappointment of the season**: Michael Iavarone and Frankie Dettori, not because they disappointed me, but because I was very disappointed along them as their endeavors didn't exactly go as planned. Michael grew on me, although the dude is all show.\n\n- **Katie Davis** was adorable. Watch her rip her heart out on camera. \n\n- **Umberto Rispoli** had the most normal/sane and lovely family and I just couldn't help but feel happy for them. It's nice to see someone doing it right in these *interesting* times.\n\n- **Michael Repole**... yeah.\n\n- **Dornoch's team** were so so great and genuine. Loved every single person in there, but especially Jayson Werth's crew (that's how I am referring to his family). I honestly didn't expect to see such a healthy and functional unit until I read that he and his wife go way back to highschool, which explains a lot.\n\nAs a conclusion, I think for me, this show is on par with Full Swing in terms of immersion into the sport, and Tiger King in terms of suspense (just don't look up the results for 2024) and character/narrative building. Really loved it and hoping to see season 2!",

        "content": "Just today I was checking my new ISP's first monthly billing and discovered I have racked up 727 GB of internet usage .  I switched to the new service just  last month (March 2025).  \n\n I set up autopay with Netflix for the longest time so I normally didn't pay attention to my Netflix  bill.  But after seeing the huge internet usage from my first bill from the new ISP service,  I checked my Netflix account and found that Netflix charged me $17 a month until  March 2025, when I got billed $24 (Netflix 4K Plan)  after switching to the faster ISP service.\n\n Thinking back I remember  when  I turned on the Netflix app *right after switching to the faster* ***I****SP  service*,  the Netflix TV app sends a pop-up message asking if I want to switch to 4K service.   I selected \"No\".  \n\n\n\n\\------Question 1: \n\n It seems like Netflix  detected that  I have high speed internet thus it prompted me if I wanted to upgrade to 4K service.  Has anyone else notice that as well?  \n\n\\------- Question 2  (internet usage from viewing 4K content):\n\nI am **NOT** a gamer.  I use internet primarily for work, internet,  and streaming.   We have two TVs - an old HDTV and a 6-mo old LG 4K TV.   We watch from the 4K TV for  about 6 hours a day.   Is it possible to rack up 727 GB with our viewing habit? \n\n\\------- Question 3 (those who own 4K TV but subscribe to a non-4K Netflix Plan:\n\nI noticed that the resolution quality  of Prime TV streaming content   is fantastic with the LG  4K TV (we get Prime TV for free from our annual Amazon subscription).   If I decide to downgrade our Netflix subscription from 4K Plan to the $17 Plan, I assume the quality shouldn't suffer from that, right?  \n\n  \nInputs are much appreciated.  \n\n",

        "title": "Comparing SDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision on Xiaomi Pad 6 \u2013 Why Are HDR Versions So Dim and Washed Out?",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI\u2019ve been testing HDR content on my Xiaomi Pad 6, and I\u2019ve noticed some interesting things while comparing SDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. I wanted to share my experience and hear your thoughts on a few issues I\u2019ve encountered. I\u2019ve had similar experiences with HDR on my LG CX OLED as well, so I\u2019m wondering if this is just how HDR is implemented or if it\u2019s something else.\n\nSDR (Standard Dynamic Range):\nSDR has much better brightness compared to HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. It doesn\u2019t look dim at all, and the brightness feels natural and sharp. The colors are balanced, and overall, it provides a more comfortable viewing experience compared to the HDR formats.\n\nHDR10+ and Dolby Vision:\nHDR10+ and Dolby Vision are supposed to enhance brightness, color, and contrast, but on the Xiaomi Pad 6, both of these look surprisingly dim, especially in comparison to SDR.\n\nDolby Vision in particular appears washed out, with colors lacking vibrancy and saturation. I was expecting much richer colors, but it seems flat and dull. Even HDR10+ feels less bright than I imagined.\n\nA Few Questions I Have:\nWhy are HDR10+ and Dolby Vision versions so dim? I thought HDR content was supposed to have better brightness and contrast.\n\nIs Dolby Vision really a useful feature to have? The feature is hyped up as this premium viewing experience, but when compared to SDR I don\u2019t really see the benefit.\n\nStreaming Issues:\nAlso you can\u2019t turn Dolby Vision or HDR10+ off if you don\u2019t like it. This is pretty frustrating, as I\u2019d prefer to stick with SDR in some cases, but the app forces HDR formats regardless of my preference.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nHonestly, I\u2019m struggling to comprehend why HDR has become so popular and why it\u2019s valued so highly as a premium feature. If it\u2019s supposed to make content brighter and more vibrant, why does it often seem like it\u2019s more of a dim, washed-out experience?\n\n\n",
