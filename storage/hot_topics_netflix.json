Meanwhile, Graham dipped right after his wife gave birth so he could drink champagne and eat at Michelin-starred restaurants in Switzerland with his\u00a0\"*dying\"*\u00a0mum. Let\u2019s be real\u2014if she wasn\u2019t rich and he didn\u2019t dream of inheriting millions, would he have been this devoted? Doubt it.\n\nThe audacity of this man to take money out of their\u00a0*joint*\u00a0account without telling his wife\u2014all for his\u00a0*rich*\u00a0mum. And then he had the nerve to go into debt, dragging his wife's finances down with him, just so his mother could continue living this lavish lifestyle (which, let\u2019s be honest, he enjoyed too). I could understand if she was struggling and he was helping with healthcare or basic needs, but no\u2014this was pure greed, and his wife was left alone in a foreign country, raising a newborn with no support.\n\nI get that being abandoned as a kid messed him up, and getting his mum back was a big deal for him. But let\u2019s not pretend her\u00a0*money*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a huge factor in his decisions. And then at the end of the documentary, he had the nerve to say,\u00a0*\u201cMy real family are my mates who stuck by me through my worst times.\u201d*\u00a0(that felt like a direct dig at his wife) Like\u2026 excuse me? The irony is unreal\u2014he\u00a0*didn\u2019t*\u00a0stick by his\u00a0*own wife*\u00a0when she was going through one of the most difficult times in her life. She just had a baby, was alone in a foreign country, and he was too busy chasing inheritance money to be there for her.\n\nJust embarrassing. Instead of taking accountability for how he failed her\u00a0*and*\u00a0their child, he basically just doubled down on his selfishness.",

        "content": "Firstly I don't understand why some people are so fixated on the bullying storyline, when it's a story of all the different forces that create violence in teens. Stephen Graham's explanation that he thought about the phrase \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and therefore we've all failed (in the face of rising teen knife crime in the UK) is so clear.\n\nBut did others think it was clear that Jamie made worse comments to Katie than what we learn?\n\nWhat we know is that Jamie received nude photos of Katie, asked her out, she said \"I'm not that desperate\" (this part rang true and I think was meant to feel that way) and then she left comments on his IG implying he's an incel.\n\nTo me, it felt obvious that when Jamie was talking to the psychologist, he left out part of the conversation. He praises himself for being nice to Katie but admits he thought she was at a weak and vulnerable moment. My interpretation was that when she turned him down, he most likely said something about how no-one else would want her now her nudes had been shared. Especially since we know about his anger outbursts. It was these comments that made her post the emojis on his Insta. I thought it was important that her comments aren't about him being ugly or unpopular - which he sees as his biggest issue - but they specifically call out his attitude to women. And DI Bascombe misses the point a second time when his conclusion is \"So Katie was bullying Jamie?\"\n\nAs a fairly online woman, that was where my mind instantly went. It's such a common pattern: misogynist shows woman positive attention, woman turns him down (politely, kindly or not), misogynist shows his true colours. \n\n",

One time was fine, I just logged myself back in, but now when I do *any* action (and I mean any: typing in the search bar, trying to watch a show, changing profiles, etc.), I get immediately logged out.\n\nI tried one solution that I read where you cleared your cookies (sometimes there's a weird caching issue that Netflix doesn't like, I'm not sure exactly, I don't work in web development), but that didn't fix it. Just in case there was a \"too many logged-in devices\" issue or something, I got rid of all the ones I haven't touched in at least 2 or more weeks as well.\n\nFor some reference, I'm using the Librewolf browser on a Windows 11 system. (Librewolf is just Firefox, if you don't want to look it up.)\n\nAny help with this would be appreciated, if you can! I'm patient. And if you need any more information, I'll answer accordingly :)",

        "content": "When the father is discussing with his wife how he saw some awful manosphere videos online because he was just trying to look up a workout video. \n\nThis was such a hard hitting line for me that could go by unnoticed. It is so easy to fall into that pipeline without any intentions of actually looking up people like Andrew Tate. As someone is constantly in the gym and looking up workout and diet recommendations on YouTube, I will almost always run into those kinds of videos and I just ignore them. \n\nSo many friends or fellow gym bros have shifted their attitude into this alpha male, high quality man, Andrew Tate style aggressiveness from YouTube and social media feeding them these influencers when originally all they were doing was looking up workout videos. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly concerning how easy it is and I feel for anyone trying to get into fitness and having to deal with this. Just understand there are normal fitness influencers out there that are not this way. ",

        "content": "So, for Christmas I received a gift card for Netflix, it ends in a week. Give me some of your favorite shows and movies. I have really enjoyed their Limited Series for the true crime documentaries. I'm trying to finish Supernatural, but I have a lot left on that one. I've really liked Working Moms. I have broad spectrum tastes and watch any genre. Thank you!",

        "content": "I recently noticed over the last few months that whenever I open my home page on Netflix there is a huge mobile ad. Am i wrong to get very mad at this fact? I pay a lot of money for the most expensive plan that specifically lists \"Watch advert-free\".\n\nIn general I'm totally cool with ads if a service is free, but as a regular paying client, a term that's supposed to be very valuable to companies this feels like a major slap in the face, and if this does not change within a month I will cancel my membership within a month.\n\nFIX THIS NOW NETFLIX!",
