I understand the concept of leaving an ending open for interpretation by the audience, and as much as I hated the way The Sopranos ended, it was obvious that they were leaving their options open for sequels or whatever, but to just build, build, build to an ending from every point of view with absolutely zero closure or at the very least, a final decision by the President whether or not to even respond to an imminent nuclear bombing of Chicago???? DISAPPOINTING!!!!\n\nSorry, just finished the movie and screamed at the screen and needed to vent to the masses of Reddit.

This was one of this worst series. First of all, why was the daughter not a suspect for the police as she was the last person who saw him dead? There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

Just last month, Netflix stopped accepting my Visa Credit card payment out of the blue. I\u2019ve called my bank several times to confirm that I have e commerce and international transactions on the card and what do you know? Everything\u2019s on and running smoothly and I have no issues using the card on any other platform. Ive rechecked my details on the card a thousand times and theyre all correct. Ive checked my card\u2019s expiration date blah blah blah and it\u2019s not expired yet. I\u2019ve spoken to at least 10 Netflix agents via Customer support and they keep telling me that it\u2019s a general error and to just try another payment method. The problem is I only use this card and have no other payment options besides Apple Pay, but Netflix has decided to stop accepting Apple Pay payment which leaves me with nothing. I thought canceling my subscription and retrying the card would do the trick but it only left me with the error message of \u201cSorry we can\u2019t accept blah blah try again another time\u201d over and over. What do I do at this point? I can\u2019t use any other accounts since they cracked down on password sharing. ",

The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

I was never a fan of Real Housewives or those types if reality shows, so cringe, but this one I actually enjoyed a bit. Maybe because I live in South FL and could relate to a lot of the scenery.\n\nWigs, tacky dresses, cellulite, fake boobs, saggy skin and bickering aside some of these characters were actually entertaining and funny. \n\nMaria , although annoyingly emotional narcissist, was hilarious. \n\nThe self proclaimed Grande Damme Gale was hilarious too, and I could see that she must\u2019ve been a very beautiful woman when she was young.\n\nRosalyn was also an interesting character, she must\u2019ve worked very hard to be the prim and proper soft spoken princess, but I can see from a mile away she just wanna party and dance on tables ",

However, if you want to hype me up, I won't complain either.",
