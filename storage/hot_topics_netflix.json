Sometimes when I'm bored at my boyfriend's house, I log in to netflix in his computer and watch my favorite series, my boyfriend doesn't even use the account, as he says there is nothing good on netflix. Theres no illegal account sharing, I live at my house. Like, bro, I get it they really needed to save those few bucks they lost from people sharing accounts, but now every time i access netflix, whether at home or not, I have to call my mother to get that stupid confirmation code to confirm I actually live at my house.\nThat's ridiculous, we pay such a high price for a service we supposedly can use at any time, anywhere, but as soon as someone decides to watch netflix away from home they will annoy you into leaving the platform and getting a membership from one of their competitors.

        "content": "You all know that the film is basically centered around Korean directors and Korean artists. In X(Twitter) or Instagram, The artists are explaining what Korean cultural context such as actual places, weapons, and patterns, accessories are appear in the movie, with their concept art.\n\nEven art director even instructed Zoey's Shinkal to \"never look like Kunai or Shuriken\".\n\nSo why do many posts try to project images of Japan or China when analyzing images, motifs, stories, etc. of this movie?\n\nFor example, there are tons of korean traditional demons which is still not used in this series. Jeoseung Saja is not the only ghost in korea. If you can understand English, you can search Jihaguk Daejeok, Imugi, Dueokshini, Dokkaebi, Gumiho, Geuseunsae, Gangcheori, etc in google. But why some of [this subreddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/)think \"[Shuten Doji](https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/comments/1lnz7mk/comment/n0qn3my/?context=3)\" must be seen in next movie? They think japanese Yokai is fit for mugyo movie?  \nFrankly, I don't understand. No one wants Chinese monsters like Jiangshi to come out in \"Kimetsu no Yaiba\" or \"Inuyasha,\" because it's set in a Japanese legend, and there are plenty of monsters that can bring the country's own cultural atmosphere. \u00a0Do you they Korean myths and traditional culture alone can't make a series?\n\nAnd why some think Rumi is Japanese name and her father is japanese demon? If you can read hangul, in the tombstone, Rumi's mother's name is writtern \ub958\ubbf8\uc601(Ryu Mi-Young). Rumi's singer name is from her mother's.\n\nAnd some of them confuses Zoey's Shin-kal as kunai, and Mira's Gokdo as guandao, [they say they are japanese and chinese. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/comments/1llfsup/theory_mira_and_zoey_are_chinese_and_japanese/)\n\nKoreans have hated that in past decades, Korea in Western media depicted as strange Chimera combining chinese music, jinbaori, katana, kung fu, geisha and dragon boat, etc. It is the first foreign film to portray Korean traditional culture and art as which real koreans think about themselves, not lens of Japanese or Chinese orientalism.\n\nSo, why they keep quoting Japanese folklore, Chinese Jiang-shi that do not even exist in Korean consciousness when analyzing the world, story, and meaning of this mugyo-based movie? If you are not familiar with Korean folktales or legends, shouldn't you search for them first?\n\nAlthough Jinu plays Bipa, which is influenced from Chinese Pipa, and they eat Ramyeon influenced from Instant Ramen, it doesn't mean that you can treat All of the cultural elements korean culture as same to china or japan.\n\nIn 2025, is it that hard to Google for 10 seconds to research Korean myths or customs or weapons?",

Sometimes I want to watch something on Netflix while I have her in the background on my phone. But if I were to play Netflix through my computer speakers, she would be able to hear and it would disrupt the call/degrade the audio connection between us.\n\nI'm an engineer and I had the idea of making a Bluetooth device that would make it such that I can connect my headphones to both my phone and my computer at the same time. \n\nThat way, she isn't able to hear the movie in the background and I'm still able to watch my Netflix. Maybe there could even be a feature where the audio from Netflix lowers when she is speaking and returns to normal after she is done speaking (audio dimming)\n\nThis all can sort of be achieved through by buying two sets of ear buds, and wearing one earbud that is connected to the phone and the other connected to the computer, but you don't get the audio dimming feature.\n\nI'm trying to understand if this a decent idea and whether there would be interest. \n\nWhat do y'all think?",

        "content": "The tiger and the magpie were easily my favourite characters in the movie, and if you\u2019re also into art and mythology like I am, here\u2019s a little background on their historical references.\n\nIn traditional Korean art, the white tiger and magpie often appear together in a style called [Jakhodo](https://exhibitions.asianart.org/exhibitions/jakhodo-today/#:~:text=The%20tiger%20and%20magpie%20pairing%20appears%20so%20frequently%20in%20Korean%20art%20that%20it%20comprises%20its%20own%20genre%3A%20jakhodo%2C%20paintings%20depicting%20tigers%20and%20magpies) (*jak* = magpie, *ho* = tiger, *do* = painting). These images were used as talismans to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe tiger was intentionally given those ridiculous, bulging yellow eyes to make it look dumb. That\u2019s why it\u2019s traditionally nicknamed \u201cidiot tiger\u201d (\ubc14\ubcf4\ud638\ub791\uc774), and the paintings are often called *\u201cIdiot Tiger and Scolding Magpie.\u201d* So, in its introduction scene when the magpie looked annoyed and judgmental that was on purpose.\n\nThis art style is part of a genre called [Kkachi Horangi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhwa#:~:text=Kkachi%20horangi%20(%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4)%20is,structure%20of%20Joseon%27s%20feudal%20society), and it\u2019s basically satire. The goofy-looking tiger represents authority (intentionally depicted as silly and clumsy like corrupt officials or clueless aristocrats), and the magpie is the voice of the common people, calling them out.\n\nWhen Jinu mentioned he made the hat for the tiger but the bird kept stealing it, that was a reference to a real J[oseon-era Minhwa painting that shows a tiger smoking a pipe and wearing a top hat](https://korelimited.com/blogs/korelimited/the-korean-tiger-a-hallmark-of-korean-identity#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking%20features%20of%20art%20portraying%20the%20Korean%20tiger%20is%20the%20eyes%3B%20they%20are%20often%20bulging%20and%20painted%20a%20bright%20yellow.%20This%20is%20a%20recurring%20aspect%20of%20most%2C%20if%20not%20all%20art%20with%20the%20tiger%20as%20its%20subject), while a magpie stands nearby.\n\nThe White Tiger (Baekho in Korean) is also one of the Four Holy Beasts in Sino-Korean mythology, symbolising the West and the element of metal. It\u2019s a powerful, protective figure with deep cultural significance.\n\nI actually did a breakdown of the movie and shared some theories about the tiger in a separate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lmhs7a/kpop_demon_hunters_movie_analysis_theories/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) if anyone\u2019s interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8slwt5zaz2af1.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813ed2ffe493193302e9f83b02839916a0229094",
