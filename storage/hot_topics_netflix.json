I wish there was a way that the subs would also include the texts seen on screen even when there is an ongoing dialogue.",

        "content": "I just binge watched Tell Me Lies seasons 1 and 2 over the last two days, and I honestly don\u2019t know how to process what I\u2019m feeling right now.\n\nBy the end of season 2, I felt physically sick. Like genuinely nauseous, sweating, head pounding, stomach turning. I\u2019ve never had a show affect me like this before. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cwow that was intense\u201d, it felt disgusting, suffocating, and overwhelming in a way I can\u2019t even properly describe.\n\nI hate Stephen. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever hated a fictional character this much. He\u2019s manipulative, toxic, emotionally abusive, and watching him operate felt draining and disturbing. But what hurts even more is Lucy. Watching her repeatedly abandon her self respect, excuse his behavior, and spiral deeper just made me angry and sad at the same time. It\u2019s frustrating in a way that feels personal.\n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t even name many \u201cgood\u201d characters in this show. The only one who felt remotely decent to me was Wrigley. He\u2019s messed up too, sure, but compared to everyone else, he didn\u2019t actively destroy people the way the others did.\n\nThe worst part is the show is captivating. The writing, the tension, the way it pulls you in\u2026 it works. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard. I went in planning to watch all three seasons eventually, but after finishing season 2, I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t continue. I don\u2019t care how good the plot is.\n\nMy mental health feels wrecked right now. I\u2019ve got a headache, my chest feels tight, I can\u2019t breathe properly, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to eat for at least a day. I know it\u2019s \u201cjust a show,\u201d but the emotional weight of it hit way harder than I expected.\n\nI just needed to get this out somewhere because this reaction scared me.\nHas anyone else felt this messed up after watching it? Or am I alone in this?",
