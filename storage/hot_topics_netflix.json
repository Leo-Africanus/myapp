        "content": "You\u2019ve probably seen this on your Netflix recommendations\u2014but if not, tune into  ***Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano 3***  live tonight at 8 PM EST, an all-women\u2019s boxing event with international undercards and major titles on the line.\n\nThe event features fighters from the UK, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, the U.S., and Spain, showcasing a global roster of talent. One big name on the card is  *Chantelle Cameron*, who split two fights with Taylor\u2014and never got a third, after Taylor declined the trilogy. That tension still lingers.\n\nIf you watched  ***Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson***  in November 2024, you probably agree that the co-main stole the show. Tonight, that rematch is back\u2014this time at *Madison Square Garden*. Hopefully Netflix\u2019s servers hold up better this time; last time, glitches meant a lot of fans missed key moments.\n\nAs for the main event: Serrano lost the first fight, barely dropped the second by  *unanimous 95\u201394*, and left the ring with a nasty cut. She\u2019ll be coming back for blood. Taylor, meanwhile, is looking to shut the door on the rivalry for good\u2014**this bout is billed as the final chapter of their trilogy**.\n\nFrom top to bottom, this card is loaded. This is surely going to be a night to remember. ",

I was hooked from the first episode, fully invested, and halfway through, I had that creeping realization: \u201cOh no\u2026 this feels canceled.\u201d And of course, I was right!\n\n No official announcement, no goodbye, just radio silence. Honestly, it\u2019s such a bold move to lure viewers in with such great storytelling only to pull the plug without warning. Truly inspiring.\n\nWho needs closure or a satisfying conclusion when you can just leave characters and audiences dangling in a void of unfinished arcs? The way you cancel shows based purely on streaming data instead of giving them time to grow? Absolutely visionary. \n\n\nNothing says \u201cwe value your time\u201d like pulling the rug mid-binge. Really, Netflix, thank you for reminding me not to get emotionally attached to anything on your platform ever again. Great job keeping disappointment fresh and consistent!\n\n",

Fast forward to I was on a 9 hour flight last night and downloaded \"too much\" on Netflix, within the first few mins it felt familiar. And then when I saw Lena Dunham in the second episode It hit me. The main character is Lena Dunham in \"Girls\" and this entire show is \"Girls\" repackaged and set in London. EVEN her love interest looks and acts like exactly Adam!! \n\nThe worst part is in an interview Lena Dunham said this show was meant to resonate with Gen Z. How???!! I am a millennial who works in marketing and even I know Its so out of touch! ",

'My List' should have remained a grid because that makes it easier to find shows in a large list. Now you have to scroll one show at a time. With Netflix shuffling the list, it is really painful to  pick the show you want\n\n3. Glad you put the 'Coming Soon' shows back. Those reminders are a goldmine.\n\n4. Can you add a category for \"Leaving Soon\"?\n\n5. I am seeing a lot of canceled and incomplete shows being promoted. These shows should be tagged as such, it's so we don't have to waste time with shows that go nowhere. I have lost 20 hrs of my life to this, but its more about investing your emotions into a show and then you are left hanging. I do Google but sometimes those results are false. We should not have to constantly research this. Just pull shows that are cancelled or have no ending. I think it makes more sense to have every season be self-contained if you are regularly cancelling shows. I think from observing, a lot of people are really frustrated by this, so it makes sense for you to have content providers fashion their content like this but perhaps give them a handful of episodes to come to a close. Some of the shows i wasted time on could have been wrapped up with 2-3 more episodes.",

        "content": "Hi, didn\u2019t know where else to ask this\n\nI just wanted to ask if people on the premium Netflix plan have the option to see the movie in 4K? Or is HD the highest option available? If the movie is not available in 4k on Netflix, does Sony ever release movies to blu ray later?",

        "content": "I found this documentary on Netflix! \n\nMiss Italia is part of my childhood, I used to watch it with my grandma and it marked the end of the summer and the beginning of the school (I think the final was a couple of days before the school start). \n\nAside from the sweet memories with my nonna, I always thought it was a bleak context and quite toxic. \n\nBut then you have Aurora, who is an absolute gem and has no fear of being unapologetically herself. She even stood up for the winner of one pageant, that her mom was fat-shaming.\n\nAurora, we need more people like you! ",
