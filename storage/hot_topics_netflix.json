It was painful, sure, but the eventual drop was a single, glorious binge-fest. We adapted. We endured the long waits for the return of hits like the final run of *Stranger Things*.\n\nBut now, the streaming overlords have added a new layer of torture: **Volumes**.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that we waited for what we were promised as \"Season 5\" of *Stranger Things*, only to get Volume 1\u2014a cruel, tantalizing fraction of the story. You get four episodes of vital plot, a massive cliffhanger, and then... nothing. Back to the waiting game for Volume 2, which is essentially just the back half of the same season. The same happened with the highly-anticipated return of *The Family Man*, only for fans to have to wait again between parts.\n\n  \nWe signed up for the convenience of binge-watching, the freedom to control our viewing experience. Now, we are being forced back into an anticipated, staggered release schedule, only without the benefit of the traditional weekly TV model that kept the community discourse alive for months. Instead, we get an initial flash of binge-mania followed by a frustrating, momentum-killing pause.\n\n",

        "content": "\n\nSo I just randomly clicked on Ripple after it popped up in my Netflix suggestions. Watched the trailer, thought \u201cthis could either be really lovely or painfully cheesy\u201d, and decided to give episode 1 a go.\n\nI\u2019m actually really into it so far. Feels like the right mix of heartwarming and emotional without going full Hallmark cheese (no offence to any hallmark fans out there)\n\nI also love that there are some familiar faces... Ezra from PLL (Ian Harding) is in it, and Frankie Faison, who I remember from The Wire and Coming to America. \n\nPLL fans will appreciate this: there\u2019s a scene where Ian Harding\u2019s character is chatting with a woman about a musician and her name is Aria. I actually lol\u2019d at that. Someone in the writers\u2019 room knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nAnyone else watching?",

        "content": "How about actually loading your videos before starting to play them instead of ruining any potential suspense or immersion by playing sound while the actual video is still loading? In other words, at least do the bare minimum of your job, because your upcoming deal won't do crap unless people aren't getting fed up watching your janky platform.\n\nEdit: for those who have commented so far and others like them, just because you don't have this issue, that doesn't mean there aren't people who do deal with it. Everyone I know struggles with loading issues or crashing from Netflix. Maybe it's a regional issue. I don't know. But it IS an issue.",

I've tried clearing cache/data on my device, logging me out via the website and clearing my downloaded devices (I have 0/2) and still nothing. The Netflix website is utterly useless in telling me anything but upgrading my plan. Anybody know what I could do about this? Thanks",
