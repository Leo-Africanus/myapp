Or it's video displayed like the broken channels on not-so-legal cable boxes back in the day, you know, rainbow lines, video \"noise\" but not much else. It doesn't happen on every movie or show, but enough of them that it's an annoyance. \n\nAnyone had this happen? Or any suggestions on how to fix it? Netflix is on the Xbox, I've already deleted and reinstalled, I've changed hdmi cable and port, nothing fixes it. Is Netflix just bonked?

I enjoyed the back and forth between the vampire focusing on the telling of the story and the interviewer trying cut out the embellishments and go for the stuff he\u2019s leaving out.  In a way it feels like, yes the vampire wants to look good in his story, but also cares more about HOW it sounds something pretty important for stories that last the rest of time.  Whereas the interviewer focusing on hard hitting facts that are cut and dry is something often focused on tonight news.  Something not know for its longevity.  Like each one wants a story but its style of storytelling reflects their age relatively.  I\u2019m used to Netflix being some quick on and done stuff and it\u2019s nice to see something with a little more art and vision.  Like comparing an album to a mixtape.  Can\u2019t wait for part 2",

        "content": "There's entire rows of this stuff in the way of desired content now, and **no easily visible way to mark it as \"do not recommend\" or anything.**\n\n*Why* there's sketchy mobile games now being advertised through Netflix is a different problem; I just need to know how to mechanically remove it/reject these recommendations/block games from being accessible via our subscription. \n\nFor the Karens who care: The *very first* game advertised is called 'Too Hot to Handle' and it's pretty clearly meant to be sexually titillating; our kids are older teens so they're not limited to 'child' Netflix, but games like this don't really need to be the very first thing they see when opening the app. \n\n#More importantly, it's in the way of desired content.  Is there any way to remove or block certain categories from showing up? Especially 'games'. \n\nThere's also a whole row of live-streaming wrestling matches that can't be thumbs-downed to dissuade the app from trying to suggest similar content. \n\n(Some of the games advertised also have in-app purchases - !!! - and there's no way to block those from going through on the card on record for payment)\n\nThe wrestling content is at least still tv programming; it's just a genre I'd like be to be able to de-prioritize (it should not be at the top, above my list, above continue watching, nor above the category I actually clicked on). \n\nThe games are a cash grab that don't belong, but I know better than to think Netflix will get rid of anything that scrapes them a bit of profit, so I just need to know how to never see 'games' again via my own paid subscription. Especially not as one of the first rows, before I get to the content that I have actively engaged with. \n\n(and of course it's just crap mobile games expy'd, it's not even like we're being offered to demo Echo the Dolphin )\n\nI'm in the USA getting the games spam via Region 1 but I ASSUME they're hawking this to everyone so I also labeled it 'all'.",

If I only wanted to watch them making out, I would watch p0rn instead. So if someone\u2019s got any good recommendations, please be kind enough to share. It\u2019ll be better if it\u2019s a teen story.\nI already know about \u201cHeartstopper\u201d btw.\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s not a bait post. I\u2019m genuinely asking for recommendations.",
