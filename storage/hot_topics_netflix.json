        "content": "I just found out from Reddit that Santa Clarita Diet ended.\n\nNot \u2018ended years ago, we all processed it\u2019 ended.\n\nEnded as in I was living my life under the delusion that Sheila Hammond was still somewhere out there, eating bad people and making suburban chaos look fun.\n\nNetflix said - zombies, but make it domestic.\n\nThen said - cool concept, great cast, cliffhanger? Yeah, no. Buhbye. Nailed the coffin shut.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this show was early to a very specific vibe that\u2019s everywhere now. Dark but cozy, absurd but oddly wholesome. Violent things happening while people argue about mundane nonsense. Basically existential dread with popcorn.\n\nShows like Ghosts are carrying that torch. Dead people. Ridiculous problems. Jokes that are dumb, sharp and self-aware at the same time. The kind of humor that doesn\u2019t try too hard but still sneaks up and punches you in the face. Politely.\n\nI\u2019m convinced this genre works because most of us are tired, mildly unhinged and coping through irony. We don\u2019t want prestige misery. We want chaos that knows it\u2019s chaos. We want death jokes that somehow feel comforting.\n\nAnyway, RIP Santa Clarita Diet. Gone too soon.\n\nTaken from us mid-bite.\n\nNetflix, I forgive a lot, but I will never forgive you for this one. If ever I get bitten, you know who I\u2019m coming for",

The fiance put her hand on the doorframe, showing off her painted nails. The ex wife looked shocked and said \"he lets you paint your nails?\" And that stood out to me. I was on the phone with a client and several trailers past and now its not on mh account anymore. I tried google, chatgpt, phone-a-friend and im starting to feel crazy. In the trailer it was at night in what looked like a suburb. Both women had american accents, i believe the ex wife was brunette and the fiance was a redhead. Thanks in advance!",

Clearly there were some ugly people that didn't want the show to continue and put pressure on Netflix.\n\nNow I could say that Netflix are cowards if that is indeed the case as I assume, however, I don't think that. If anything, Thank you Netflix for having the guts to allow this show to exist. To produce it and to put it on your platform. It truly is a hilarious, wonderful, heartfelt show that shows the struggles of Palestinians. I would say it is a love letter to Palestinians and our beautiful culture.\n\nThe actors were absolutely wonderful, and while some of it was just hard to watch, particularly MOs struggles. The show left me feeling good and hopeful.\n\nParticularly I loved the Thanksgiving get together at the farm. It was just beautiful to see all these people who are different come together because it felt they were all family.\n\nSorry if my post sounds corny, but I really did love this show so much.\n\nAnyway, for those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It's a brilliant, clever and outrageously funny show.\n\nThank you Netflix.",

        "content": "I just finished watching Season 2 of Unlocked: A Jail Experiment on Netflix, and I found it genuinely fascinating, but also far more disturbing than I expected. Compared to Season 1, this season felt much darker, more intense, and emotionally charged. I\u2019m curious how others on this sub experienced that shift.\n\nOne of the biggest things I noticed was how quickly things escalated in Season 2. The power dynamics seemed to form faster and more aggressively than in Season 1, where there was at least some attempt at cooperation early on. Do you think this was due to differences in the group of inmates, the environment, or the way the experiment was structured by the producers?\n\nAnother major difference for me was the overall tone. Season 1 felt more like a social experiment focused on rehabilitation and self-governance, while Season 2 often felt closer to a psychological pressure cooker. Some moments made me question the ethics of continuing the experiment under those conditions. Did anyone else feel that the line between observation and exploitation was crossed more often this season?\n\nI\u2019m also wondering how much the presence of cameras influenced behavior in Season 2 compared to Season 1. It seemed like some participants were more aware of how they were being portrayed.\n\nFinally, do you think there should be a Season 3? If so, what would you want to see done differently, or has the experiment already shown everything it needed to prove?\n\nCurious to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts",

        "title": "His &amp; Hers (Netflix/Book) \u2013 Genuine questions about character choices",
        "content": "Spoilers for His &amp; Hers (Netflix) and the novel\n\nFirst, I want to be very clear up front: this post is NOT victim-blaming, minimizing assault, or being insensitive. The show covers extremely heavy subject matter, and I\u2019m asking these questions in good faith to better understand the characters, their psychology, and the story\u2019s themes.\n\nI just finished His &amp; Hers on Netflix and was genuinely caught off guard by several of the later revelations. I\u2019m still processing some of the character choices and was hoping people who\u2019ve watched the show and/or read the book could help expand on them.\n\nMy main questions:\n\n1. Why did Anna get involved with Jack at all, knowing he was Zoe\u2019s brother?\n\nAnna\u2019s trauma stems from what happened when she was 16; when her friends Zoe, Rachel, and Helen orchestrated the assault, sold photos, and then watched, laughed, and mocked her while it happened.\n\nKnowing this, Anna choosing to be with Jack (Zoe\u2019s brother) was odd?\n\nWas this relationship meant to show:\n\n\t\u2022\ttrauma bonding or unresolved attachment?\n\n\t\u2022\ta way of reclaiming control over her past?\n\n\t\u2022\tself-punishment or denial?\n\n\t\u2022\tor is there more internal context in the book that the show didn\u2019t fully explore?\n\n2. Why is Lexy (Catherine) so fixated on Anna years later?\n\nCatherine/Lexy was also a victim, but she ran away and left Anna behind in the woods. Yet as adults, Lexy seems to direct an intense amount of blame, resentment, and obsession toward Anna.\n\nIs this survivor\u2019s guilt turning into projection? Or does the novel give more insight into her mindset and how she rationalizes this?\n\n3. Did anyone else expect the reveal to be \u201cless extreme\u201d at first?\n\nBefore the woods scene, I honestly assumed the trauma might be centered on bullying or humiliation..not the calculated setup, photos, and assault itself. That escalation completely blindsided me.\n\n4. And bluntly\u2026 how are we meant to interpret Lexy getting her own sister killed? \ud83d\udc80\n\nI understand trauma can seriously distort judgment, but this was downright psychotic. Is Lexy meant to be seen as someone spiraling, or as a cautionary example of unresolved trauma turning destructive?\n\n5. For book readers: what did the show change or leave out?\n\nWere there:\n\n\t\u2022\tinternal monologues or motivations cut from the adaptation?\n\n\t\u2022\tchanges to character dynamics (especially Anna, Jack, Alice or Lexy)?\n\n\t\u2022\tplotlines or reveals that were simplified or altered?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate if novel readers could expand on whether the book gives clearer psychological grounding for these choices, or if the ambiguity is intentional.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in thoughtful discussion from both show-only viewers and readers.",

        "content": "Let me preface this by saying: I love rom-coms. Like, I will defend the genre every time. That said\u2026 this movie was not it.\n\nI haven\u2019t read the book, so don\u2019t come for me- I\u2019m judging purely on the film. From the very beginning, both main characters were insufferable. Poppy leaned too hard into the chaotic, ultra\u2013Type B personality, while Alex was painfully rigid and Type A. We\u2019re told they\u2019re best friends, but the movie never convincingly shows why. I genuinely couldn\u2019t see how they\u2019d tolerate each other for more than 20 minutes, let alone build a long-term friendship.\n\nThe chemistry was nonexistent. On top of that, the emotional cheating while they were both in relationships was uncomfortable - are we just supposed to normalize that now?\n\nThe pacing was off, and the story tried to cram in every rom-com trope imaginable, which made everything feel rushed and forced instead of charming or organic. I kept waiting for it to click\u2026 and it never did.\n\nDisappointing, especially for a genre I usually adore.",
