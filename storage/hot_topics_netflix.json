They knew their kids were filming with her. They saw the content. They heard the complaints. But the views and money were looking too good, so they played along. Now suddenly everyone\u2019s shocked and acting like they were completely blindsided? I get that the kids were young and didn\u2019t deserve the trauma, but let\u2019s not pretend the parents weren\u2019t part of the problem too. They weren\u2019t just bystanders\u2014they were participants.\n",

With the characters, the landscape, the amazing fashion sense of Inuit women, the stories that are unfolding, even the music ...omg I was shazaming everything! Acting is top notch. So natural, something you don't see very often in comedies . I couldn't recommend it more!!!! Eagerly waiting for more seasons!",

I didn't like it, and tried to get out of it, but I was a kid and a lot weaker. While I didn't like it happened, I didn't think that much of it, I just figured my mom was a jerk. \n\nIs this actually a really bad thing to have happened?
