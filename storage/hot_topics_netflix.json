I get that they have their reasons, but it's awful.\n\nIs everyone else less bothered or what? I figure it would have changed by now if everyone dislikes the auto-preview as much as me. Google TV version btw - but I'm pretty sure it's implemented on most Netflix apps..",

The standard plan sounds the best but it\u2019s still quite expensive and Netflix is extremely ambiguous about the quantity of ads in the ads plan and the quality in the standard plans. Does anyone habe suggestions on which plan to pick? Thank you!",

As with the later seasons of Game of Thrones, True Detective, Westworld (well done HBO), Arcane Season 2 seemed to lose its unique identity, taking heavy inspiration from Marvel's Age of Ultron. The once-captivating soundtrack felt generic and unmemorable, a far cry from the enchanting melodies that defined Season 1. Additionally, the plot felt rushed and convoluted, failing to build upon the strong foundation established in the first season. It's as if Netflix tried to replicate the success of Season 1 without understanding the core elements that made it special.\nWhat have you done Netflix? ",
