Even with being a gamer, I have zero experience with LOL. I see this show as a Animated Action Drama and do not care about the lore of the extended universe.\n\nThe Animation: absolutely stunning, and there is nothing like it. This may be the only reason I finish the show.\n\nOh my god.... who do you actually like in this show? Vander is so clearly a means to an end from the first time you see him. He IS the motivation, not a character. It is ridiculous how many overblown tropes are used in this show. Vi is pretty alright, but she is laser driven on one thing always and the plot is whatever is in her way. This show is murphys law in action as anything and everything goes wrong for these characters. Highs and Lows, breaks from tension.... that is what makes a show.\n\nHextech is the most refreshing part of the story because while the unlimited power thing is kind of an overdone trope, its well written. (Good job guys)\n\nYou know exactly what the characters are going to do before they even know it. Jinx is not a character, she is a plot device and magguffin. No.... actually, I really like the parts where Jinx goes nuts and snubs any chance of the story progressing...\n\nThe characters are always talking about the same damn thing throughout the whole season and don't learn a single thing. Maybe we could get the people from the underground actually doing something to help their people for once...\n\nAnd between these boring exchanges..... ACTION SCENE. I am willing to admit that unearned action scenes just simply don't do it for me. Some people do like that stuff, and its the least of my concerns.\n\nI feel like the show is holding me back from enjoying it at all times on purpose. This is a wild comparison, but it makes me feel like I'm watching Yellowstone at times. Lots of immature, irresponsible, and annoying characters.\n\nI don't mean to put people down for liking this show alot, but I just feel like it could be the best if done well.",

        "title": "Season 2 of Arcane is visually stunning, but both the worldbuilding and storytelling are disappointing.",
        "content": "\\*Unpopular opinion warning\\*\n\nCurrently Arcane is the second most popular TV series on both Netflix and IMDB, with a dazzling IMDB score of 9/10, and I'm struggling to find negative reviews on mainstream forums - which really surprises me as Season 2 feels quite underwhelming to me.\n\nThe visual design and animation are still absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Some of them are even more breathtaking than the best frames in Season 1, which is an incredible achievement since Season 1 is already one of the most each-frame-a-paint shows I've ever watched.\n\nHowever, the disparity between the stunning art and the unconvincing worldbuilding, combined with the poor storytelling (especially in respect of Season 2) is equally staggering.\n\nBelow I'd like to elaborate (in a spoiler-free manner) on the major shortcomings preventing me from enjoying the show, despite its incredible visual achievement:\n\n**1. Mediocre worldbuilding**\n\nArcane's world is a mixture of steampunk and magic. However, the rules governing how this world operates - i.e., when magic comes into play and when normal physics prevail - are extremely unclear. The audience struggles to deduce, based on previous events in the show, whether a character will be severely harmed by an explosion or remain completely unscathed.\n\nAlso, the show fails to adequately depict the scale and operations of the various organizations and political entities that significantly impact the plot. The scheming and conflicts between these groups often feel either meaningless or ludicrous because the audience lacks a reliable way to determine each group's advantages, disadvantages, or the true extent of their capabilities.\n\nThis lack of clear underlying rules often obscures the stakes, making the plot or action scenes far less engaging. The audience cannot confidently assess whether legitimate danger or consequences are at hand, which renders character's survival, death or other development undeserved or unearned.\n\nIf this show were intended solely for a younger audience, then a somewhat disorganized fantacy world might be less of an issue. But it's apparent that the show takes itself very seriously, with ambitions to tackle adult themes and nuanced topics. From an adult's perspective, the most critical aspect of convincing worldbuilding is the presence of clear \"stake\", which must be grounded in a set of explicit or implied rules. Without consistent rules, all the consequences and developments become dubious and unengaging.\n\n**2. Horrendous storytelling**\n\nThere are far too many artificial dramas and tensions. Characters frequently argue with one aother for various nonsensical reasons, refusing to listen to even a single word of explanation from their counterparts. Their communication skills are unrealistically underdeveloped, making any tensions derived from such poor communication initially laughable, but later tiring and infuriating.\n\nIf these dramas were merely filler, they might be more tolerable. Unfortunately, these conflicts - whether infuratingly juvenile or jaw-droppingly asinine - often have a significant impact and major consequences on the plot, making any subsequent story and character developments stemming from these events unconvincing and eye-roll-inducing.\n\nAlso, its quite obvious that the director often priortizes creating visually stunning scenes over crafting a plausible story. Many incredibly well-drawn frames are the direct result of unbelievably foolish decisions or physically impossible manuveur. I frequently find myself quesitoning the integrity of Arcane's story and characters, wondering whether such developments make any sense or if they are simply director's attempt to create yet another wallpaper-worth piece of art.\n\n\\---\n\nWithout spoilers, the overall scale of the major conflict escalates significantly in the later episodes, particularly in the second half of Season 2. Sadly, even at the grand finale of Season 2, I found myself completely unable to care about any of the characters' fate. The issue is that, whenever I try to care, I immediately start questioning all the nonsensical decisions these characters have made to reach the current plot point. Eventually I just stopped caring altogether. Without engaging with the story, those beautiful frames feel meaningless and at times even exhausting.\n\nOverall, my score for this season is 5/10, a far cry from the general sentiment currently shared by most viewers, it seems. I would only recommend this show to those who love League of Legend's universe and are genuinely interested in exploring its lore further, or to those who can be entertained by a show solely for its visual design. The writing of Season 2 should be taught as a cautionary lesson in storytelling classes.",

        "content": "Just started episode 1, and only a few minutes into it. But, I have to commend the show for the tasteful sound appeal. A woman's delivery of her baby (one of the most horrid sounds to hear) was simply a few soft spoken words, and when the baby started to cry, soft music faded in over the cries. They made this scene literally music to my ears, instead of an anxiety enducing experience that's hard to listen to or watch. I wish more shows were like this.",
