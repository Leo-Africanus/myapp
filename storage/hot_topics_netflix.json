Shutter Island is powerful on the first watch, but once the twist is revealed, a lot of its impact fades. The film leans heavily on atmosphere and shock.\n\nPrestige, on the other hand, is built for rewatching. Every scene matters. The structure itself is part of the illusion, and the   themes-obsession, sacrifice, rivalry, and identity run far deeper than just a single twist. It doesn\u2019t just surprise you; it plays with you.\n\nShutter Island tells you its truth at the end. Prestige hides it in plain sight from the very beginning. That\u2019s the difference. One is a great experience once; the other is a masterclass that gets better every time you revisit it.",

Doesn\u2019t want to pay attention. Wake Up Deadman she checked out.\n\n-outside of Netflix, she watches mostly reality. She watches Naked and Afraid, Court TV, Survivor, some married at first site, and Alaska homestead rescue regularly.\n\n- so far she\u2019s watched Simon Cowell boy band show and the latest Diddy doc (hated the cursing, but wanted to know court case stuff). \n\nThanks for your help!",

I\u2019ve made it. And you can tell I\u2019ve made it because I talk really slow now, pause a lot, smoke a cigarette on stage, and let the crowd applaud my existence. There were way more stories than jokes. Not sharp stories that build to something clever, just rambling anecdotes that relied on the audience already being on his side. It felt less like he was trying to make people laugh and more like he knew people would cheer no matter what he said. And they did. This felt safe, comfortable and almost lazy. Like he knows the brand is bulletproof, so why bother tightening the material? I get that he\u2019s earned the right to do whatever he wants. He\u2019s one of the greatest to ever do it. But greatness doesn\u2019t mean every mic drop deserves a standing ovation. At some point, slowing your delivery and sounding profound isn\u2019t the same thing as being funny.\n\nIt just feels like we\u2019re watching a legend turn into a motivational speaker with better lighting, and the crowd keeps rewarding it.",

I came to realize Netflix has an absurd strategy to keep customers locked in releasing new series/shows at a steady pace but for the majority, series are almost never finished unless they are really classics or series they have acquired. I am really annoyed but the number of times I locked into one of the series and then have to realize there will not be any ending of the show. It came to the point where I even start to lookup whether or not there is going to be a final season before investing the time to check it out. \n\n  \nSeries which have left a bitter taste to me personally since there is no \"what's next\":\n\n* Marco Polo\n* Away\n* 1899\n* Snowpiercer\n* Barbarians\n* Pulse\n* The recruit\n* Boots\n* Lost in space (it has an ending but there was more imo)\n* ..\n\nI know this post is not going to make any difference and I understand more than anybody else the business, it is money first, customers second but damn me, damn me for watching unfinished series. Especially the science fiction seems to be affected by this problem quite a lot. (or maybe that is because I watch too many of those)\n\nI just hope I am not the only one who has this feeling and who has been disappointed more than once in the past years?",

        "title": "The Flash becomes the most watched superhero show (licensed) on Netflix",
        "content": "During its peak on Netflix U.S., The Flash clearly outperformed other DC television series in total watch time. Reports based on streaming analytics show The Flash accumulating over 300 million hours watched in measured periods, making it the most-watched Arrowverse series on Netflix by a wide margin. By comparison, Arrow generated roughly half that amount of viewing time, while Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, and Black Lightning trailed far behind. The gap was driven by The Flash\u2019s long episode seasons, nine-season run, and strong rewatch behavior. Even compared to other licensed Netflix hits, few superhero shows matched its sustained minutes-watched performance. This dominance confirms that The Flash was not only the most popular DC series on Netflix U.S., but also the platform\u2019s most-watched licensed superhero show overall.",
