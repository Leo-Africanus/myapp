While I know there to be third-party browser extensions and desktop apps for this, these aren't an option for mobile users and receive no official support.\n\nCurrent subtitles may be region-locked or simply not available in the desired language, like what if I'm a wannabe legal subscriber who mostly knows some obscure African language.  It would also sidestep regional copyrights on the subtitles themselves as it is the end user generating them, not Netflix distributing existing copyrighted subtitles.\n\nI suspect there may be some reason Netflix isn't doing this, even if only because it's simply too niche; Netflix clearly trusts first-party subtitles enough to spend resources providing them in the first place.  However a third-party solution would be a nice fallback solution like an iPhone repair shop for those too far from the Genius Bar.",

He was also very educated when it came to law stuff, so every time they wanted to have a protection order against him and things like that, he ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS found a way to flip it on them, to the point where a couple of them would lose their own apartment to him!! Eventually he met his match and a girl had him sent to jail a couple times, his fucking brother bailed him out each time and I never knew why! Next thing you know, he kills his brother !! I think he had some sort of grudge or anger towards his brother, I\u2019m not sure what it is I just know that his older brother became more successful then him. But he gets locked up for his murder, then fucking kills hangs him self before he really even got sentenced in 2017. He put these people through wayyyy too much to to sit there and cop out on life, he was evil as fuck . I usually don\u2019t care too much when people kill themselves while waiting for their sentencing the way he did, but he was the lastttttt person to sit and have the opportunity to cop out on life the way he did.

Or my little pony.\n\nAnd then half of them aren't even COMPLETE. And since these shows never got a DVD release for later seasons... finding and watching those seasons you saw but never finished on TV is hard.\n\nMy little pony and ninja go being the worst preserved. Thankfully mlp has a fanbase that actually tries to preserve any and all mlp media otherwise no one would be able to watch it or show their kids it.\n\nAnd why do companies even put it on Netflix exclusively? They should be aware how much Netflix takes from the cut to host it.which is why hasbro stuff is basically not on there since I noticed hasbro seems to be the ONLY company that notices or cares. Its why they never take down archives of all their shows. since they mainly care about preservation over profit in most cases. Obviously they still care about profit but I noticed they would rather make money by making their stuff easier to watch rather then paying a specific service to watch it. I think to hasbro they see the fanbase as a major point of profit. Basically meaning... by making these shows easier to access... they in turn generate bigger fanbases that are willing to pay for their things.\n\nAnyway... anyone know what is up with that Netflix stuff?",
