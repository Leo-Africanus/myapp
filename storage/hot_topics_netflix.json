Same relationship drama, same misunderstandings, same Emily making questionable decisions but somehow winning anyway. I kept waiting for a moment, a twist, growth, something,  and it never really came.\n\nAlso, does anyone else feel like the characters are kind of stuck? Like five seasons in and we\u2019re still running in circles emotionally? I miss when the show felt light, surprising, and effortlessly charming instead of predictable.\n\nThat said, I didn\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s still an easy, colorful watch.

She is beautiful.\n\nEver since I first saw her next to Madhuri in ***Dairh Ishqiya***, I was enamored by her sensuous charms.\n\nUntil I saw Single Salma.\n\nS ... \\*hit\n\nS ... Show\n\n81 minutes of utter and complete brain rot!\n\nI finished the movie and haven't left my spot since. My grey matter loss is so huge that my capacity for functioning seems compromised. No movie has ever done this to me before.\n\nI can see that at some stage, probably during the ideation phase, Single Salma intended to be an unconventional feminist movie. It had the right elements. But somehow along the way the writers switched their dealer perhaps, and then all those promising elements went up in flames of a dumpster fire. The film ended up losing the plot to a point that the feminist in me was left staring at this Huma Qureshi shaped train wreck moving in slow motion. Agonizing.\n\nYou see, the thing is it's infuriating to watch a supposedly feminist movie that mock the entire concept of feminism this remorselessly. Designed for an predominantly South Asian audience, the film uses infidelity, cheating, undressing in public as vehicles of a feminist narrative. I mean isn't this EXACTLY what \"***babban's***\" (the bleach head villian of the movie) of this world imply and insinuate as the only implication of women empowerment!\n\nThe film opens with a promise of connecting the dots between Salma - Sikandar's beloved from the past - and Sikandar's present day success. And the only triumph they ended up communicating is that Salma left the alter. Sikandar's success was in effect born out of his thankless, cheating bride running away for a modeling gig.\n\nEven if you never paid to watch this movie, it is still super costly because you'll be paying with a fried brain. Learn from my mistake. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nVerdict: Indian Judiciary should consider adding this to the jail time of inmates as their penal labour.",

The poster for the show with the flames in the back and the red coloring looks epic, but none of the scenes in the show actually look like that. It's just realistic scenery and outfits/hairstyles don't represent anything about the characters.\n\nThe show obviously is about the character and their relationships with each other and not about what is the parallel universe and it's mythology, but it's too much to the point where after months of being in New Ham, Kelly mentions the bus driver in the final episode and doesn't even address the fact that there are more of them and they're the ones who dropped them off in New Ham.\n\nIt just makes the characters really stupid.

Then he gets a happy life with a young hottie, and no consequences? Are we just ok with this? Not to mention, the ex wife doesn\u2019t get invited on any of the friend trips and really gets the short end of the stick. I know the ending isn\u2019t as great for him but there still aren\u2019t any real consequences for his choices. It\u2019s like moral of the story is just leave your boring old wife for something younger and you\u2019ll finally get everything you want? ",

A lot of which we didn't know existed. \n\nI was wondering if there would be support for a feature to add something we really liked to a social favorites list. Then when we add one of our friends to our Netflix friends list, we would get to see each others favorite content.  \n\nOf course, this feature would only appear once you activate \"Netflix friends\" or whatever you want to call it. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "title": "My Ideal Scenario if Japan's Biggest Netflix Series \"Alice in Borderland\" Was Not Cancelled (Not a Great Place to End the Show on By the Way)",
        "content": "I don't like a show that ends on a cliffhanger like season 3 did. I don't like shows that leave ends left undone as if on purpose (Ann in the mental institution and Yaba).\n\nI don't like a show ending where the main character is left on the lowest note of their entire narrative (Usagi).\n\nNor do I like the idea that the violent rapist character (Niragi) got better treatment in the end by the show than both Ann and Usagi.\n\nDespite justified criticisms of Season 3's direction (and I agree), a lot of people hoped that it was leading us to a final season and final redemption for these characters. Viewing figures were also still good despite the criticism.\n\nShinsuke Sato the Director was vocal in saying he would love to adapt the final manga connected to the series, \"Alice on Border Road\". This is not Arisu and Usagi's story but that of another character, a schoolgirl that we never met.\n\nHowever, Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya both expressed interest in returning. Tao specificially put forward an idea that the focus of any continuation switches to their daughter who is a bit older. Some kind of protective arc might help to give Usagi the strong character back that we missed from Season 1 and 2.\n\nI mean...they made that baby a player for a reason right? Seemed like it's her destiny to finish the game. Just as Arisu said, he was afraid of naming her because a name dictates your destiny - her name is going to be \"Arisu\" no matter what.\n\nMaybe they could tie Border Road into their story either by meeting this new character or perhaps their daughter could be written as said schoolgirl from Border Road.\n\nAnd with Arisu and Usagi back, it would open the doors to see Ann back (and get her out of that mental institution), and Kuina and Chishiya too (I think those are the key people we need.)\n\nHave Netflix communicate clearly that this would be the final season as ALL the manga material is done after Border Road. Have the cast celebrated and go out on a high.\n\nThen after Alice in Borderland is completely done, have Shinuke Sato adapt Attack on Titan for live action and cast Tao and Kento as the main characters. For years people were saying that project would be perfect for them and it would be a great pivot after AIB.\n\nThey always worked so well together and had great chemistry, plus more action roles for them would satisfy a lot of fans.\n\nI have no idea why Netflix aren't rushing to make an Attack on Titan live action to be honest. Shinsuke Sato was given My Hero Academia to do instead.\n\nSo yeah...I'm very disappointed with the news and how everything is fading into oblivion when there was so much potential all round and with the ending we were left with, taking the plunge and risking one more season is worth it in my book.\n\nConsidering that this is probably Japan's biggest show on the platform, the dismissiveness that Netflix has handled this with is very problematic to me as is the fact they never made much effort to promote it since day 1 (with merch etc. included).\n\nIt just breaks my trust for investing in future shows like My Hero Academia etc.",
