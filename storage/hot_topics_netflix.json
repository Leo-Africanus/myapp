I guess technically she could have done internships or whatever BUT STILL I felt like a big part of the beginning of the book was that it\u2019s her first time studying literature at a higher level and that was how the contrast was created between her studies at Oxford vs. her career in DC. I feel like everything that was good was taken out. Every scene was either changed or replaced entirely by a new scene. A lot of the characters were portrayed different in the movie from how they were written. I never expect an adaptation to be spot on but if they really wanted to change everything then why even call it an adaptation at that point? Just write a different story!",

One thing that annoyed me badly was the tunnels, they were so desperate to find out but yet didn\u2019t go and explore the tunnels better themselves, the answer literally could have been revealed by then. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that when the two ladies invited Nora over, she hears the thuds, left looking terrified, just to never bring that up again. I really wanted to like it and I felt like it could\u2019ve been great if they actually properly worked on the storyline. ",

It also gave a brief history on how the cities originated. I've tried everything, even going back through my viewing history with no luck. I'm beggining to think I've imagined this !

        "content": "Can we talk about how Netflix is being shady af, and releasing one season of a show over a few months, so that people have to pay for multiple months of a subscription? It\u2019s really starting to irritate me. They just did it with Wednesday, and they\u2019re about to do it in a few months with stranger things. They stretch out EIGHT EPISODE SHOWS, over 3 months so that people who would usually watch the show and then cancel their subscription HAVE to sub for more months to get the full season. I wouldn\u2019t even be mad if they released it like one episode a week because that\u2019s how live tv has worked forever, but no, this way 8 episodes would only be 2 months worth of subscriptions and they wouldn\u2019t be milking another month out of you. I\u2019ve literally ALWAYS had my subscription, and don\u2019t cancel it, so I don\u2019t even care about the money aspect, I\u2019m just irritated I have to wait ridiculous amounts of time to finish one season of a show. Because they wanna squeeze people for all they possibly can. Sorry I\u2019m just annoyed and hate cliff hangers. ",
