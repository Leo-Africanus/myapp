Of course it's not perfect, but some of us are loving the show and because of hate posts all series are getting cancelled. I understand that people don't see the logic behind some stuff or that a character ist annoying. But oh my god... do you really think that every human being isn't at some point in their life annonying? It's realistic that Rose can't decide if she wants to stay or to go. Every normal human would act like that. But for some reason you guys always want some perfect series with perfect plot and perfect people. It's just a show. Don't take it so serious. \nYou can criticize it, but come on, they didn't want an oscar for the night agent. \nIn the end of the day, I want to escape my real life, watch a show and forget about my problems. But because some people think they are smarter and better than everyone, my comfort shows are always getting cancelled.",

I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

        "content": "A bit disappointed with the show after seeing the hype it was getting on here. It was definitely enjoyable and worth the watch. The production value was pretty good. The massacre scene was awesome and terrifying. I loved the dialogue. Some of the performances were really excellent, particularly Captain Edmund, Bridger, and Virgil characters I thought were really strong. The conflict between the Mormons, US Govt, Native tribes, and the townsfolk was really interesting and imo should\u2019ve been the focal point of the show. \n\nThe main story following Isaac, Sarah, and the kids was very weak. Their decisions constantly did not make sense. Isaac would\u2019ve got on his horse and said \u201csee ya\u201d the very first time the mom almost got them killed, and certainly 3 or 4 times later. Sarah would not have acted so defiant to Isaac\u2019s instructions, especially considering he is a professional outlaw and she established immediately that she is scared and out of her depth in the wild west. The only strong acting out of that group imo was the boy. Other than that the writing on their whole plot line was messy. When they shoehorned in the love story in the 11th hour I actually rolled my eyes lol. \n\nAll in all it was a good watch that I don\u2019t regret. Just a shame as it was so close to being great. ",
