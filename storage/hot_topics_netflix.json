        "content": "We watch shows, we either like them or hated them, but either way, we are done with the show and don't want to see the show again. This could be done by setting a \"Hide\" flag attached to the entire show, it would apply to all shows in the series. For example, we watched all of \"Monk\", so we could set the \"Hide\" flag and we'd never see \"Monk\" again in any search, except a search for \"Hidden\" shows. The thumbs up and down would indicate why the show was hidden.\n\nThere are other shows that we start watching and do not like, will never like, and don't watch to be bothered with ever again. Usually, these are Hallmark movies, but could be anything for anybody. We would mark these as thumbs down and Hidden. Then we are never bothered again with the show. Again, if we change our minds, we can go to the \"Hidden Shows\" page and unhide anything we want.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Some people seem to misunderstand. First - this is a completely optional feature, if you don't mark something as \"hidden\", you would never know it exists. Second - filtering out \"hidden\" shows is the default, but can be disabled (un-checked) so all shows would appear if you are looking for something that might be hidden.\n\nOn Netflix's side, this is more data to evaluate user preferences. It will also reduce network data by reducing the results of any report, so should be cost savings after implentation.",

I noticed some of the holidays movies/shows I watched last year that I know I rated are missing my ratings. Is this a system error or on purpose? Anyone else have this issue?\n\nI still see them and can rate again so the thumbs themselves aren't missing to clarify.",

        "content": "I've noticed that when I use Safari to watch Netflix, the red \"watched\" bar is not showing after watching episodes of shows. I only see a \"watched\" bar on the first episode of each season, but not on any other episode. \n\nI don't have this problem with Chrome. But I've been trying to get away from using Chrome and am hopeful for a solution to watch Netflix on Safari. \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!",
