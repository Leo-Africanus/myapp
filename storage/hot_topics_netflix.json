There were pencils and old school tech. Not sure where it was filmed but it reminded me of Monterey or N CA. I have tried to find it again many many times but can\u2019t find it. ",

I get writers take artistic liberties for entertainment but what they came up with was just so perverse. Mary Hogan was a former madam in Chicago? Bernice was a desperate old kinky cougar looking for a sugar baby? Was this to make us feel less sorry for them? Like maybe they deserved it bc they weren't \"virtuous\"? There's very little background online about either of the victims, at least nothing I could find, so I cant understand why they made these choices for these women? The only thing I could come up with was Ryan Murphy really doesn't like women.",

His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety in 1957 after authorities discovered that he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned keepsakes from their bones and skin. He also confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957. It is believed Gein's actions were caused by severe psychosis.",

Unlike series like Heartstopper, it\u2019s not overly sweet or romanticized  it has humor and light moments, but it doesn\u2019t sugarcoat everything. The LGBT aspect feels like one part of the characters\u2019 lives rather than the sole focus, and, at least from my perspective, it avoids stereotypes.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think about this approach. Did you notice how the show handles LGBT representation without making it the only focus? Did this affect how you connected to the characters and the story? Personally, I found this more realistic style refreshing compared to more \u201cfeel-good\u201d shows, and I\u2019d love to know if others felt the same. Were there particular moments that felt especially natural or well-balanced to you?\n\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts and hearing how others experienced the series!\n",

        "title": "A Rollercoaster of Emotions with Monster: Ed Gein (I actually liked it \u2014 and here\u2019s why)",
        "content": "After the second episode, I started to doubt how accurate the show would really be (I hadn\u2019t read any spoilers, but I knew a lot about the real case). At first, I was honestly annoyed by the whole Adelaine storyline \u2014his supposed girlfriend and accomplice\u2014 and the murders of victims that were never actually proven to be his. Even the depiction of the *real* victims wasn\u2019t that precise (Bernice\u2019s death scene was\u2026 embarrassing, omg).\n\nBut around episode six or seven, I started to *get it*. It finally clicked that everything we\u2019d seen before was meant to show what it\u2019s like to be **inside Ed Gein\u2019s head**: confusing, hyper-sexualized, disturbing, and suffocating. What\u2019s real? What\u2019s a lie?\n\nThe scenes that directly referenced horror films \u2014like the chainsaw one and the babysitter Evelyn (clearly nodding to *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*)\u2014 added a clever extra layer. They reminded us that we\u2019re not only trapped in Ed\u2019s confusion, but also in **Hollywood\u2019s own distortion** of reality through the \u201ccreativity\u201d of its horror movies inspired by killers like him.\n\nFor me, the turning point \u2014and the reason I ended up really appreciating the show\u2014 was the final stretch. It hits you with a cold dose of reality, showing the heartbreaking truth about mental illness and how it gets minimized and worsened in a violent, repressive family or social environment.\n\nPsychiatric disorders are not only hard for others to understand \u2014they\u2019re also hard for the person living with them. And the way the show portrayed his schizophrenia diagnosis (wow) felt incredibly authentic. The imaginary communication with Ilse and Christine Jorgensen \u2014with them saying things that were actually coming from his doctor and his own mind\u2014 was such a genuine representation of a brain desperately looking for answers but simply not working right. It truly felt like a drowning man reaching for anything to hold on to.\n\nMaybe we all expected it to follow the same style as *Dahmer*, but the fact that this one actually makes you **think** (and even research what was real and what wasn\u2019t, instead of just buying whatever a show tells you) really impressed me. I\u2019d even say it\u2019s more suited for *true crime* and horror fans \u2014the kind of viewers who can catch those deeper layers more easily.",

Demon Slayer, Hajime no Ippo, I think Jujustu Kaisen was on there, pretty sure Frieren was on there but I already watched that on Netflix I'm so sure. Where'd it go???? ",

        "content": "Firstly, I\u2019ve been a customer since the beginning and I have tremendous brand loyalty to Netflix, which will be a topic here.\n\nFor the last two-three years everyone I open the Netflix app on my TV all i feel is disappointment. I can never seem to find anything I want to watch or am interested in. Idk when it started but there was a time when basically every Netflix original I don\u2019t dare to watch because I already know it\u2019s going to let me down (except the Monster series like it ok.)\n\nI got a pretzel in my head due to simultaneously knowing that i should cancel and that i do have an attachment to the brand. Getting all the newest movies in the mail for me and the gang to watch was epic and being able to stream on my Xbox was epic in its own right. Does anybody feel similar?\n\nEdit: there has been some straight fire that I loved like All Quiet on the Western Front, Stranger Things, Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor and others. It\u2019s not all bad and i\u2019m for sure not shitting on netflix",

        "content": "Popped on Adam Sandler's \"The Longest Yard\" on my PC and noticed the dialouge only comes through the right headphone. At first I thought it was my computer or my headphones, but after checking other movies on Netflix I found that the problem was only for The Longest Yard. Music and ambience plays thru the left headphone mainly with some bleed thru on the right headphone but the right headphone is only dialouge. Is this how the movie's audio actually plays? Anyone got a DVD or blu-ray copy to cross reference and could someone with headphones confirm that I'm not crazy in hearing this\ud83e\udd23\n\nFirst time I've ran into something like this with a movie...",
