        "content": "Just a random observation/thought. I'm at Ep 28 of the Chinese Drama 'The Double', right after Wencai dies. I'm gna refer to Jiang li's stepmom as Fu Ren bc i can't recall her name for some reason. But seeing the loving relationship they had, Fu Ren is a victim too in a sense, although she's still horrible. I was just thinking if Fu Ren's father wasn't that way, Wencai and Fu ren wldve lived happily ever after and have a kid of their own. The original Jiang Li wouldn't have been sent to zhenv hall, she would've still been alive and living well. Her mother wouldn't have passed either without fu ren's sabotage. Concubine Hu would still be 'sane' and an actual part of the family and her daughter would still be alive. Tong er would also be alive. So total of 8(?) lives, if we include fu ren's unborn son with Wencai, would've been saved. \n\nAnyways this was just a thought i had and wanted to share, don't take it too seriously because obviously without this, the whole plot line wouldn't have existed. Xue Fangfei probably would've ended up actually dying, her dad would as well and justice wouldn't be served. But idk, pretty sad to think about.",

Since then, reruns have been shown on TVOne and it streamed on HBO Max for a time. In both instances, the show was in its original format. However, Netflix has added a horrible AI smoothing filter to all episodes which has made them completely unbearable to watch. I've seen a few people complain about it online. How can we get rid of it? Should I start a petition and send it to Netflix? This is ridiculous and so unnecessary. Many of us like the 80s/90s graininess because it adds to the charm and nostalgia of the show. No one asked for this attempt at modernizing the look of it. I'm so frustrated about this! ",

And I\u2019m curious for others thoughts on this and can\u2019t see that it\u2019s ever been discussed previously!\n\nWhy does Netflix release documentaries on controversial topics?\n\nHow does Netflix get away with supporting, producing and releasing these films and series?\n\nI will try to explain briefly what I mean by the above, and refer to some examples.\n\nNetflix is a massive corporation, it is the 23rd most visited website in the world, and produces thousands of original films and series. It has 301.6 million subscribers. The only places it is not available are the authoritarian countries of Russia, North Korea, China and Syria, countries with a commitment to abolishing capitalism. Netflix is the prime example of effective capitalism - constant new media, instant access, affordable prices and sold worldwide.\n\nHowever, it has many documentaries that oppose capitalism, or other social norms, and instead promote the opposite. This appears somewhat hypocritical, or ironic, that documentaries such as \u201cBuy More\u201d are produced and released by Netflix - a company that has grown due to consumerism, with a potential environmental detriment.\nOther examples include:\n - \u201cseaspiracy\u201d\n - \u201cthe social dilemma\u201d\n - \u201csaving capitalism\u201d\n - \u201cthe minimalists\u201d\n - \u201ccowspiracy\u201d\n - \u201cblackfish\u201d\n\nWhat insights do you have on this? \n\nHow much do you feel you would be influenced by these documentaries? \n\nDo you think these series would only tailor a certain category of consumer?",

When they again show footage from some time ago they add the distortion so that viewer subconsciously can place the footage in time (\"ah, right, we're having a flashback\").\n\nDid anyone else notice this?
