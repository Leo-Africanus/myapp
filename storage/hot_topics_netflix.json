        "content": "I am just venting here out of frustration with the not so new anymore Netflix user interface. Many of you probably like it or have adjusted to it, as Netflix\u2019s own research would suggest, but I could not. I tried, I really tried. \n\nA discussion on the drawbacks of the interface has been exhausted so I will not get into it. What I would add is that I noticed that I have been recently spending more time on Apple TV and HuLu. Not out of stubbornness or revenge, but it came organically. The interface of all three platforms is now very similar with the Netflix one being mid pack. I can no longer tell the difference so I would watch whatever is good. I think the new Netflix interface is an opportunity for other streaming platforms to catch up with Netflix and get new subscribers. It might also be the beginning of Netflix\u2019s decline or at best plateau.",

Cinematography looks like it was shot by an iphone. It was too bright with no mood tones just on plain vivid filter.\n\nScene 1: \nBooker doesnt need to die! He saw Andy became immortal again, I dont understand why he have to face soldiers alone and die. Its not like he savrificed himself so Andy can go on a time sensitive situation. She just stood there and screamed. Him and Andy could have killed all of them really fast and the end result would still be the same: still trapped on the room until it was opened by Discord in which they can have 2v1\n\nScene 2:\nDiscord fleeing but not really fleeing on helicopter? She could just flee and go on with plan. I dont understand why she came back?\n\nScene 3:\nhow did Niles became proficient with ancient weapons at 6 mos? The dont teach them in the Marines. \"YoUre nAturAl, nILe\"\n\nScene 4:\nNo guns allowed nuclear reactor but explosive booby traps are allowed.\n\nScene 5\nLegend? I thought they were like a secret society? How did they theorize that the last amd the first was able to take and give immortality when last old guard was Nile? It didnt happen yet imorder for them to speculate it.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\n\n",

It was a hit show, it had a following, it wasn\u2019t hidden in the depths of the platform. It could\u2019ve grown even more if Netflix actually supported it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one show. This is about the pattern. They cancel everything good, especially original, weird, dark, or risky stuff, and replace it with endless reality shows or bland reboots.\n\nWhy do they think viewers will keep trusting them with our time and emotional investment if they pull this every time?\n\nIt\u2019s like they only care about new signups, not long-term fans. They greenlight 100 shows and abandon 98 of them. How is that sustainable?\n\nI genuinely wish I could flood their inbox with 40,000 complaints, because clearly they\u2019re not hearing how angry people are. There\u2019s no point in starting new shows anymore if we know there\u2019s no closure. Same with keeping a subscription. What a waste of a company they are. \n\nI hope I can get so many views on this post that Netflix sees this \ud83d\ude2d  \n\nAnyone else feel like this?",

        "content": "Just finished The Old Guard 2, and while I didn\u2019t quit halfway through (so it wasn\u2019t completely unwatchable), I was definitely disappointed by how lazy and inconsistent the lore is. For a story about immortals from completely different parts of the world who are actively hiding from the rest of the world, it\u2019s weirdly convenient that they all seem to find each other across centuries with no real explanation of how or why. Still with that alone I would have been ok after all they all have centuries to run into each other, right?\n\nWhat really broke it for me was the mentioned connection between the first and last immortal (further explained only by a birthmark they both have for some reason) as well as the whole \u201clegend\u201d about the last immortal which would be born with the power to remove or transfer immortality. A legend someone somehow formulated likely thousands of years before the last immortal was even close to existing. How can there be legends about someone completely unique among a group of already special people nobody should even know about in the first place? The writing just didn\u2019t try at all to make the world feel coherent or believable, which is a shame because IMHO the premise definitely had some potential. If only they made the story based on a somewhat plausible lore (written first) rather than creating a garbage lore based on what they needed it to be to accomodate a raise of stakes for the sequel or whatever.\n\nAnyway what are your opinions random redditors?",

But this one? It felt like they were trying to shock us, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The tension just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAlso, character development took a nosedive. Instead of complex personalities making morally grey choices, we got caricatures running through a checklist of betrayals and \u201csurprises\u201d that weren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\nEven the games lacked originality this time. One of them was so absurdly over-the-top that it felt more like a bad parody of Squid Game than the real thing.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Was I expecting too much?

These profile pictures appear on my phone fine. \n\nIs anyone else having this issue? Perhaps it is an issue with Sky or something? \n\nI have no idea why this glitch has suddenly occurred- I was watching Netflix fine a few hours ago. \n\nI\u2019ve tried resetting Netflix and my skybox but so far nothing has worked. As far as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s only my Netflix that has been affected and no other streaming apps.  \n\nUpdate: ok we\u2019ve worked out it is just one profile that is glitched? For some reason mine is broken but all the other accounts (my family) are fine. We are all under the same roof so I don\u2019t see any reason to why this should be happening??",

I'm sure they did their best, bless them.\n\nRecently I subscribed to the Premium tier to watch content in quality 4k HDR format. While shows like Squid Game actually display in 4k HDR and look great, I find that the vast majority of big movies are only offered in 1080p, and a few 4k ones often without HDR. These are movies that have commonly available Blueray 4k HDR releases, so it's not a matter of the content not existing. One example would be 1917, which has been released on Blueray in both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, but only seems to play at 1080p. The television is configured to display 4k HDR content, the Chromecast 4k is as well, and the subscription is the Premium tier. Some content is offered in 4k HDR, so the technology seems to work as intended.\n\nIs something wrong on my end, or is Netflix not offering 4k HDR versions for a lot of movies, even on the Premium tier?\n\nEdit: I just borrowed someone's Disney+ login and all their blockbusters are 4k HDR. In some cases they're the same movie on both platforms, but only in 4k over at Disney.",

How it\u2019s not even being mentioned at all is insane and feels crazy irresponsible by anyone who cares about her. \n\nKatie was interviewed as well and she sounded remarkably more cognizant. ",
