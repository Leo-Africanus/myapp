This was one of this worst series. First of all, why was the daughter not a suspect for the police as she was the last person who saw him dead? There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

        "content": "  Netflix\u2019s *Ripley* is a great thriller that leans hard into mood, restraint, and slow-burn suspense. The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

No PiP window appears. It feels like a bug, but *Netflix support confirmed this is intentional on the ad tier so ads remain full screen*.\n\nThis restriction is not clearly disclosed in the app. If Picture in Picture matters to you on iPhone, the Netflix ad tier is not worth it.",

        "title": "Think Best Guess Live is rigged? You're Wrong.",
        "content": "Let's really put this into perspective since there are so many people online complaining that they think it's rigged.\n\nNetflix is projected to have brought in 45 BILLION dollars in 2025. That is earning a revenue of 123 million dollars day. \n\nBest Guess Live gives out $15,000 every weekday, so 260 days out of the year. That adds up to a little under 4 million dollars. With special giveaways let's just pretend it's actually 5 million dollars over the course of the year. Let's pretend it's 10 million even, that's 0.01% of their annual revenue. **It takes Netflix approximately about 2 hours to generate 10 million dollars.**\n\nWhy would a company that makes 123 million dollars a day risk their reputation to save 10 million dollars? It would be like you or me risking a felony charge to save a nickel we found on the sidewalk.\n\n**Netflix is a 500 billion dollar company, you think they're going to risk catching a federal charge over a $15,000 daily trivia game?????**\n\nThey're literally doing this for retention. If someone was going to cancel their account because they don't like the content being carried, maybe having this keeps them around because they have fun playing it.\n\n\"The clues are impossible!\" There's literally 80,000 people making random guesses. On a puzzle they are trying to make impossible on guess 1 and 2 specifically. They go through the answers after to ensure their thought process and why the clue is fair. Why would anyone be giving away money in a game where there are 5 guesses want to make it easy to be figured out on the 1st and 2nd guess? It makes no sense.\n\n**TL;DR:** Netflix makes the prize pool money in the time it takes you to watch one movie. They have zero incentive to rig it and every legal/financial incentive to keep it fair so you keep opening the app every night and don't cancel your membership if you don't like the tv/film options available.",

        "content": "i have a fancy LG OLED tv, although, it\u2019s a few years old it should do 4k no problem.\n\ni splurged on the premium plan this last time i reactivated my account but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f it looks just as good as any other app on my tv. if anything, it looks way darker than HBO or Prime or Paramount+\n\nanyone else feel the same? did i get duped? i just switched back to the 1080p plan but that wont go into effect until the 22nd so i guess ill know better then\n\nwhile im here tho, adolescence has been my most recent watch. any other recommendations?",

        "content": "Prices go up constantly. Quality get's worse, and I mean the service not the content, even though the content is going bad as well. \n\nTo be honest, Netflix has turned into everything that we hated about all other services. They have gotten a grip on our commodity and laziness and our constant need for something to binge and they are exploiting us. Not for me anymore. These abusive tactics need to stop. And we the paying customers create, with our choices, the companies that we want. If you are ok with 40000 conditions to use a system that we pay for our the wazoo. ",

At least show some demogorgon or something that actually feels threatening.\n\nHow the fuck does a creature that can jump dimensions control minds and terrorise an entire town for years get nerfed this badly in one episode.\n\nThis thing carried the fear and tension of the whole show and suddenly it\u2019s dumb weak and convenient because the writers wanted to wrap shit up fast.\n\nLazy writing.  \nBad execution.  \nToo many plot holes.\n\nFans didn\u2019t want miracles. We just wanted the ending to respect the scale of the monster you spent years hyping.\n\nYou don\u2019t build cosmic horror for almost a decade just to kill it like a side quest boss.\n\nWhat a waste.",
