        "title": "Does anyone else think that the new kid influencing docuseries is disgusting dramatic irony?",
        "content": "Netflix has released a new docuseries, \"Bad Influence\", about a kid who was exploited as a child influencer. Her mom posted her all over the internet as a kid with little / no regard for her safety, and made tons of money off of her.\n\nSo, Netflix are now using this kid's story to - you guessed it - make money off the documentary.\n\nHer full name is in it, her face is in it. I've watched the intro in which someone states \"predators were watching these videos\" AND IT SHOWS, with no censoring, the type of videos that predators would seek out - eg, of her dancing as a minor dressed in not a lot.\n\nThe real kicker is that this kid is STILL A KID. She's still 17. And even if she wasn't, I still feel this is exploitative. This is NOT the way to raise awareness of the dangers of child influencing.\n\nAlso - she's very active on social media and hasn't posted about the documentary, which makes me question whether this was even done with her consent. Imagine the mental toll this kind of thing would take on her. It seems to be an awful privacy violation for a child whose whole life has been a series of awful privacy violations. I hope she gets the help she needs and then sues the shit out of them.\n\nIt feels so disgustingly ironic to me. Gross on Netflix's part.\n\n(EDIT: I did watch an episode to make sure I was along the right lines after I posted this. just want to say I 100% agree with anyone saying that the other kids deserve to tell their stories, especially now they're adults. What an awful, disgusting situation all around. My heart breaks for all these kids. We must have better laws to protect our children from the internet. However, I do believe the publishing of the doc could make things worse for the \"main\" child in question, and I don't believe it was published with her best interests at heart. I'm also uncomfortable with Netflix monetising the situation. Thanks to everyone who's discussed this in the comments.)",

Also per usual, different viewers and critics have very different opinions about which ones soar and which don't.  \n  \nSo I may be an outlier in my particular affection for the first episode, \"Common People.\" I like how its plot takes simultaneous swipes at the gig economy, the insidious omnipresence of advertising and \u2014 a particular fascination of mine \u2014 the relentless micro-tiering of every service in our lives.",

How badly you can want validation, feel so insecure, and talking to someone who is withholding comfort, or not being able to understand what the other thinks of you and sees in you can be so frustrating and devastating in those moments. It actually reminded me of dramatic fights I used to have with my mom as a teenager. If the context of him stabbing a girl wasn't there, I wouldn't find his outbursts as anything psychotic, dangerous, or not understandable at all. I could completely feel how that felt. I wonder how others perceived that conversation.\n\n\nI also wonder what she saw in him and what her recommendations were in the end.",

        "content": "I\u00b4m a middle school / high school teacher, and there was a lot of hype from my colleagues about how this show Adolescence should be shown in schools. I heard that the show explored incel/Andrew Tate culture and how toxic masculinity is prevailing online, so of course I was eager to see this show!\n\n&gt;!But I just finished the show and felt disappointed... yes the show touched upon the prominence of incel culture on social media. However, I felt that more than anything the show painted him as a narcissist/psychopath with clear neurological issues. This is shown clearly through his chilling lack of remorse and his denial of guilt amidst the clear evidence against him. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Don\u00b4t get me wrong I think it\u00b4s an excellent show - the acting and the cinematography are clearly top notch. But the character Jamie says directly that he was not interested in the incel culture, and really the incel references from the Instagram messages come from Katie rather than Jamie. There\u00b4s definitely evidence in the show that Jamie was involved in some level of toxic masculinity on social media - the naked pictures of katie, the commenting on instagram accounts of other models/girls - but I can\u00b4t help but feel the show is more of a portrait of a 13 year old psychopath (that happened to be triggered by some toxic masculine ideas) and his family/community rather than a much needed examination of how toxic masculinity is prevailing online even amidst \"normal\" young boys. For me \"Don\u00b4t Worry Darling\" was more impactful in this sense. !&lt;\n\nJust wondering others thoughts on this! ",

Well.. there's an explanation to that because I'm gay myself and to an extent I have experienced similar situations.\n\nOverall, I liked season 1. Season 2 not so much but it deepened the characters which was necessary but unfortunately it felt like the plot had kinda frozen.\n\nAnd then season 3.. well I didn't enjoy it. It focused too much on Klelia and Orestis but I really don't know why this relationship mattered that much. it felt as if the writer who is also playing Orestis just wanted more screen time for himself. A murder had happened and they didn't seem to care. \n\nAnd most importantly I didn't understand why the two boys went to the police department. I mean what for? It's as if they cancelled all the efforts of seasons 2 and 3. It also never made sense to me why Maria (Spyros' mother) did not give him some good money so he could study along with Antonis but they returned to their broke state. ",

I'm having no issues playing the latest episode of anything but yeah as soon as I try access previous episodes for example I'm getting that error code every time.\n\nI've reinstalled the app and still getting it.
