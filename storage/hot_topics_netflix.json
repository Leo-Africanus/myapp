Truly. Did they even go to school? Or were they homeschooled by drug addled, morally bankrupt grifters spewing toxic masculinity? The mother seems to be from another country so maybe she\u2019s not the best teacher of English but yikes, you know they had enough money to maybe hire a tutor.\nAnd I found it interesting that his dad was depicted as a sweet, veterinarian (which takes an amount of studiousness) and instead of maybe trying to be like that he makes up this extreme version of what a man is that seems polar opposite of his dad. Odd choice. (Just as odd as smoking cigars which seems completely counter to his \u201cnatural\u201d lifestyle.)\nAnd the brother he says he looked up to is never mentioned as far as where he is now. Maybe they left that out bec he was involved in the criminal enterprises mentioned. I don\u2019t care enough about the guy to look it up, I just think it would have been interesting in the doc. It also would have been interesting if they addressed the children\u2019s allergies. Was that all made up too? If not, in what way were they resolved? As someone who has never heard of him but has a masters degree in food science and applied nutrition I was interested and it was so bad I had to increase the speed halfway through just to finish it quickly. It could have easily been nutshelled into a ten minute YouTube video.",

If it's any help he is watching over the PS4 application\n\nSo is anyone else experiencing this issue?",
