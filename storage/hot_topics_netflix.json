I love watching shows that we're done in the 2000's. It'sike a sense of nostalgia. It was greatly done!! The ending is bitter sweet but I think it was a good way to end the show...sad but at least it had an \"ending\" most shows just end and were left hanging. Officer Cooper deserved better! Sammy too!! &amp; Moretta died wayyy too early \ud83e\udd7a Lucero went through so many close calls!!! So sad how Cooper finally told someone his secret and then they go through hell together... they all deserved so much more!!! I'm still in shock! Still feel so connected to them!!

This is about the final episode, also if you didn\u2019t make it that far, you wouldn\u2019t get anything I\u2019m gonna say lol \ud83d\ude1d \n\nIdk if anyone else thought abt this before, but I just wanted to word vomit my thoughts. \ud83d\ude3d (I wrote this in like 10-20 mins so sorry if my grammar\u2019s a bit off \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude4f)\n\nFor all three of my ideas for another \u201cending\u201d for stranger things, The Duffer Brothers could\u2019ve messed with the character, Will.\n\nImagine this: It\u2019s the last 10 minutes of the last episode, Will celebrating with his friends at the end of their D&amp;D convention, but then he feels something on the back of his neck, so subtle it\u2019s almost annoying. He either does A, B, or C\n\nA: He slowly reaches to feel his neck, grazing the goosebumps, first his heavy breathing turns into hyperventilation then feeling a dreadful amount of glee and joy, knowing that he shouldn\u2019t feel like that because of the history. Mikes turns to him, knowing Will\u2019s mind isn\u2019t there. Wills face shoot up to face the ceiling. The lights start flickering, then faster than a second they burst. Mike, Lucas, Max, and Dustin all know what this means. Then the scene cuts to the end credits. With slow music that would cause goosebumps on YOUR neck. And wind whistling along with it. 10-30 seconds later you\u2019ll be able to hear bones cracking/a heart monitor, each increasing it\u2019s speed the closer it is the the end of the credits, OHHH AND THE CLOCK DOING THREE CHIMES EQUALY SPREAD OUT TO THE FIRST HALF OF THE CREDITS, then at the VERY end the final bell chimes \ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\ude3c (no stealing plz \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f)\n\nObviously with this ending to the final episode, the duffer bros would get a lot of crap without at least 2-4 more episodes, so there\u2019d have to be another season (the final episode technically wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cfinal episode,\u201d but it\u2019s the D bros wanted to keep it the final ep, they\u2019d have to pick B or C)\n\nB: suspense is growing within the viewers, just for a few seconds later to break it with Will slapping the back of his neck, revealing his palm for him, friends, and us to see; A mosquito on the palm of this hand. \n\nC: he starts exhibiting the same action and emotions of A (all faking it to joke) to his friends then starts laughing in a joking matter, in a \u201chaha got you\u201d kinda way. And obvi everyone\u2019s like BRO WTFFFF!!! Or THATS NOT FUNNY\n\nIf you read this far: TYYYYYY \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d",

What was Lexy\u2019s plan at the house if she wasn\u2019t the killer? Did she think Anna was the killer? Was she just upset and defending her husband who had been locked out? Fighting Anna because she slept with Richard? There seem to be a variety of motives here, but if Lexy was not the real killer, the whole scene seemed odd \u2013 particularly when Richard had all the tools and materials for kidnappings, etc. laid out on the table.\n2. When Zoe corners Jack in his office, what was she going to say to him about Anna not being what Jack thought she was? Seemed like a loaded and odd thing to say once you see how the 16th birthday secret actually played out. Could be Zoe trying to deflect or misdirect Jack because of her own guilt around that event?\n3. Why/ how would Anna marry the brother of someone who sat by and encouraged her assault? It seems like the trauma of the assault caused her to memory hole the events a bit (she doesn't mention her own assault when recounting the tale to Jack), but it still seems far-fetched.\n\nThere are plenty more questions I have, but these ones \u2013 particularly #1 \u2013 are sticking with me the most.",

I had to yell at my son to close his eyes while scrambling to hit the mute button so it wouldn't ruin the show. I know he's late to the party, but he's just now old enough to watch the show and was so excited to start it.\n\nAiring trailers for future seasons which spoil unwatched seasons is bad enough, but this seems like a new level of disregard.

Instead, viewers will vote with their TV\u2019s remote control, or right within the Netflix app if they watch the show on their phones.\n\nNetflix hopes that this level of simplicity will help to make live programs like\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0a lot more exciting, and offer its audience a chance to experience shared watercooler moments that tend to be missing from today\u2019s world of hyper-personalized streaming. \u201cYou can influence the outcome \\[together with\\] everyone at the same time,\u201d says Netflix member product VP Elmar Nubbemeyer. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the Zeitgeist at that moment.\u201d\n\nTo bring real-time voting to\u00a0*Star Search*, Netflix relied on work it previously did for interactive narrative shows. It also snuck voting tests into David Chang\u2019s Netflix show, and showed focus groups segments from two fake shows it cooked up for testing purposes.\u00a0 The company even built internal tools that will help it to repurpose live voting and polling for other live events and shows in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are planning more of these types of moments,\u201d says Netflix\u00a0product designer\u00a0Navin Iyengar. \u201c*Star Search*\u00a0is really the big unveiling of it.\u201d\n\nWhen\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0debuts Tuesday evening, viewers will have two distinct opportunities to make their voices heard. Once a singer or comedian is done with their performance, a graphic will pop up on screen, encouraging each viewer to give it a rating ranging from one to five stars. \u201cWe knew early on that giving a star rating as an interaction was really important,\u201d says Iyengar. \u201cIt\u2019s core to the\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0IP.\u201d\n\nLater on, they\u2019ll also get the chance to choose their personal champion of the night out of four choices presented next to each other on screen. Each voting graphic will remain on screen for about 60 seconds, and the show\u2019s host\u2014Anthony Anderson, best known for the ABC sitcom\u00a0*Blackish*\u2014will respond to the incoming vote tally in real time.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Netflix has done real-time voting like this, but the company has been experimenting with getting viewers more actively involved for almost a decade. In 2017, the streaming service released its first interactive TV shows, which prompted viewers to choose their own adventure through branched narratives. In one scene of \u201cBandersnatch,\u201d an interactive episode of the dystopian sci-fi show\u00a0*Black Mirror*, the viewer has to decide whether the main character should take his medication by pressing left or right buttons on their remote control, with different choices leading to vastly varying outcomes.\u00a0\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91477533/how-netflix-brought-interactive-voting-to-star-search)",

        "title": "Restore Netflix's Details/More Info page",
        "content": "I've been a loyal Netflix user since nearly the beginning, and throughout these years, I've consistently relied on the platform's Details/More Info page. This feature allowed me to read descriptions, check ratings and captions, confirm runtimes, and select the right episode to watch. However, with Netflix's recent design change, many titles now play automatically when you click on them, without allowing us to view these crucial details first. This shift not only disrupts our viewing experience but also raises several significant concerns.\n\nFirstly, the removal of the Details/More Info page undermines accessibility. Users with hearing or vision impairments, or those who prefer certain languages, have been left without immediate access to critical information such as available captions or language options. This change diminishes the inclusive spirit Netflix formerly championed.\n\nFurthermore, for parents, the inability to preview content poses a risk. Without being able to assess content suitability via ratings, parents may inadvertently expose their children to inappropriate material.\n\nAdditionally, for those on limited data plans, it's essential to preview content details to ensure their data is used wisely. Confirming that a show is appropriate and worth watching before it begins streaming is no longer straightforward, leading to possible unnecessary data consumption.\n\nCan we please ask Netflix to restore the Details/More Info page? At the very least, create a customizable account setting allowing users to choose whether to automatically play content or to view details first would greatly enhance user experience and satisfaction.\n\nThis request aims to improve the service for all users and underscore Netflix's commitment to accessibility, family safety, and user choice. Please feel free to weigh in\u2026 anyone else annoyed?",
