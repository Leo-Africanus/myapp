The counter-strike dilemma was that if the US didn't launch its own nuclear weapons, the missile silos would be destroyed by the incoming attack. In House of Dynamite, that is not an issue. There was only one incoming missile, which might malfunction. The president still had no idea who launched the attack. And even if Chicago got nuked, the president would still have the full arsenal of missiles to launch 15 minutes later, an hour later, or two days later.\n\nIt felt like it was an artificial and unnecessary deadline to create tension, but maybe I missed something that explained it. If this was Independence Day I would just brush it off but Dynamite is (generally) a smart film. Any insights?",

To each their own but the entire time I was DYING to know who sent the missile and what the appropriate response would be. We were given none of this. It\u2019s like eating your veggies expecting a steak will come later and then it never comes. I don\u2019t know about you but a movie like this is essentially pointless if we don\u2019t at least get some sort of simulation as to what would happen next. Not to mention, they never even actually confirmed or denied that the missile made impact! What?!? This movie was all suspense, all buildup and no drop. Disagree all you want, after all it\u2019s just an opinion but this left me dissatisfied and disappointed. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",

It's well-acted, well-shot, good production values, and you get a full story from 6 episodes with a nice pathway for a season 2 at the very end.\n\nHighly recommend it!",

It\u2019s one of the most disturbing cases I\u2019ve seen in a while, not just because of what she did, but because of how quietly it\u2019s being treated.\n\nWhat really gets me is how different the reaction would\u2019ve been if the roles were reversed. If it had been a man (her father) who had been sexting his sons girlfriend, I feel like there would be nonstop coverage, public outrage, and discussions about grooming, power dynamics, and sexual harassment. He probably would\u2019ve faced a much harsher punishment too.\n\nBut because it\u2019s a woman, it feels like people are brushing it off or minimizing it a little bit even though what she did was completely predatory without any question. I get that the main focus right now is on Lauryn, which i 100% understand, but i don\u2019t understand how her mother wasnt convicted for anything else. It\u2019s honestly terrifying how much effort she put into the whole thing and how long it went on.\n\nWhat do you think?",
