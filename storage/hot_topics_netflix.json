I watched it already, and was pretty hyped to see it on the homepage, and now I can watch it with her-- It's japanese dubs with french subs only.  \nFml alright I'll just try Konosuba--  \nYeah guess what. French subs only.\n\nI don't know if you realize this, Netflix, but 60% of Belgians have dutch/flemish as their native language. That's what we call a \\~**majority\\~**.  \n  \nSo why do I get the feeling Netflix is only catering to the francophones? Is it because we Belgians are almost always depicted as french-speakers in American movies and shows?  \nOr is Netflix not able to afford the rights to dutch subtitles? We would even settle for English subtitles ffs.",

But without anything else to watch i said, oh what the heck it won't hurt an episode. I'm not going to lie, the first episode was pretty crappy, but as the second episode started, I started to love this series.I'm now on season 3 in two days, at this rate I'll finish it tomorrow, which I hate to do because then I'll be back to nothing to watch... if anyone has any ideas of what I could watch I'd be happy, i want to hear y'all your favorite shows that might start the flame in my heart too again.",

Seems like apple and fire tv play the best with this.  59.940 will just work and looks great.  Android and windows, not so much.  On android, I have a Lenovo Yoga Tab 13. Windows, I have tried all the browsers and also the windows store app and still get 29.970.  Any other app or video streaming site lets you pick but Netflix doesnt allow you to choose and it makes no sense.  Does anyone understand why or how to make it work?  If someone has proof that it actually works on windows, please show me and what you are using cause it is getting on my nerves, lol. Thanks in advance.",

I have thoughts of who it could have been instead or the kind of motive I'd have preferred, but I won't share that either.\n\nMy only criticism is that the episodes should have been shorter. There were scenes that were longwinded and convoluted due to the length. It could have been 10-12 quick episodes instead of 8 super long ones. A minor nitpick I had is that the piano music they played sometimes was too similar to Only Murders in the Building. The piano music made sense because the characters in OMITB lived in an apartment where they used the elevator. \n\nOn a positive note, I thought the performances were all phenomenal. I absolutely loved Cordelia Cupp as a detective. I do wish the show had been set up for future seasons. She was very compelling as a lead. \n\n**What other murder mystery shows/movies have you seen?** \n\n I've Watched:\n\n* Psych\n* Monk\n* CLUE\n* How To Get Away With Murder\n* Only Murders in the Building\n* Murder Mystery &amp; Murder Mystery 2\n* Knives Out\n* Murder on the Orient Express\n* Sherlock Holmes (the movies and the show) ",

You go through a somewhat emotional journey with flashbacks that ties up everything all together. Deep story, great character development, battle scenes were fantastic as well. This is a worth a watch!\n\nAdding that I usually watch anime in cc. However, I find the voice dubbing of Frieren (the character) so soothing. Monotone, lack emotions or detached in some way and slow to interpret human emotions. Matches her personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s hard to describe this mix of moments from the show, memories from my childhood, memories of my kids, and the ambient worry I have in my head now. My wife doesn\u2019t watch intense shows, but I feel that we need to experience it together and speak about it. I was wondering if we could watch it with our older kid as well. I\u2019ve discussed the premise with him, and he seems interested (hard not to). \n\nI feel that watching/reading things together could be a great conversation starter for some topics. Kids and I still read books together before bed, and we had some great chats while reading \u2019The Body\u2019 and \u2018Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\u2019; and we\u2019re currently watching \u2018Atypical\u2019 together, which they really like and very keen to share their thoughts on.\n\nI\u2019m sure his perspective on Adolescence will be completely different from mine (as mine will be different from my wife\u2019s) and I\u2019m both interested and scared. The show doesn\u2019t give you any answers; it seems that everyone sees different things in it and relates to the characters in a different way. What will a teenage boy see in the story, what will their reaction be like, and what conclusions will he get to? How will he talk about it with his friends? Is it too intense?\n\nI know it very much depends on a kid and their sensitivity but what are your thoughts? Has anyone watched the show with their teenage kids?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished watching The Residence and something's been bugging me about the ending.\n\nAt the very end of the final episode, Cordelia Cupp makes a point of stopping by to visit Nan Cox (played by Jane Curtin) on her way to the airport. I couldn\u2019t help but feel like this moment had some deeper significance, but I\u2019m not sure I fully understood it.\n\nWas there something more to this visit that I missed? Was it meant to be symbolic of something? Would love to hear your take on it!\n\nEdit: [Hollywood Reporter interview](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-residence-finale-killer-revealed-showrunner-interview-1236169599/) with writer and showrunner Paul William Davies.\n\nIn the interview, Davies explains:\n\n&gt;\"In the very end, we see Cordelia make a pit stop to the White House again to speak with Nan Cox (Jane Curtin), who tells Cordelia she knew it was Lilly and that she could\u2019ve just asked her. Did she know all along?  \nI didn\u2019t know I was going to end with that scene, but I loved the two of them together in the first scene they did. I thought it was so dynamic. I really could see how much Cupp respected Nan in a way, like her honesty and how perceptive she was. It was important for Cupp to go back to her and tell her of all people, because she recognized there was an insight and honesty to her that I think she understood and really embraced. The idea that Nan was like, 'Oh, I could see that all the way. That woman was nuts.' That to me was just fun, because it is kind of believable, and I think almost believable to Cupp that she had that insight. The two of them were so delightful together.\"\n\nHonestly, this feels like an unsatisfying answer for why it was chosen as the final note of the show.",

        "content": "After watching Queen of Flow, Netflix shows me an ever rotating cast of telenovelas. Not all of them satisfy my cravings for popcorn television.  \n\nBut 4 episodes into Until You Burn, I am sucked in.  \n\nThe story here is a typical brother is seeking to avenge the death of his brother. It looks like he was murdered by someone a wealthy family or connected to them.  \n\nA few things of note in this telenovela compared to others I have scanned or skipped:\n- class theme are pretty typical, but this one is also layering in race on top of the class\n- since there is a race theme here, there are visible Black people and even supporting characters that get screen time and dialogue \n- I don\u2019t speak Spanish so I am watching with English subtitles. I know some words here and there but so some translations look a little funny\n- this show is set in the beach, at sea - really pretty visuals \n- the sounds track is great and seems to be covering a good selection of Colombian music \n- this doesn\u2019t seem to have any cartel angles which is such a common stereotype of Colombian shows, this seems to be a more basic poor guy gets revenge on rich people story - not unlike the show Revenge which I also really enjoyed. \n\nIf you like revenge dramas where the character is playing the long game to infiltrate, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this one, based on the first few episodes. \n\nIt also seemed to be super popular in Colombia - getting like 35-40% prime time viewers so that bodes well for an engaging 60 episodes. And it just finished its run in February so it made it to Netflix quick. ",
