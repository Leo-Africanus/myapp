Of course not, but how would it be? It's not possible since we know what it's about. Not many possible inventions appart from the few we saw, and yet to be seen that made and can make the show keep being great.\n\nBut was it awesome? Yes it was, I watched it in 7 hours. As many others did as well.\n\nIt starts of very captivating.\n\nThe main participants (some annoying, not in a good way, but do get better) are introduced well.\n\nThe games are not repetitive.\n\nThe story makes you question what the plottwist will be because of taunts. Some of them not forseeable.\n\nAnd overall the ending makes you feel exactly what you (don't) want to feel, which is a good thing if you ask me!\n\nGreat job!",

You don't care about most of them because meh I barely know them. You knew virtually every time when someone would die (and conveniently the old woman and pregnant woman are fine from the night brawl....).\n\nAnd then the sub plots....what a waste of time. Got virtually nothing out of them. After the North Korean girl becomes a worker, every second with her felt so pointless.\n\n\nI'm pretty disappointed. Feel like the show didn't get into the nitty gritty of the interesting questions at all. First episode was good fun if nothing else but I really didn't like the direction it went in at all. Maybe would've been better to just release season 2 and 3 in 1 go but this felt like a lot of filler again.\n\n(Also, the insurrection at the end was dumb as shit. Why would they go along with that? And the whole time Gi Hun is iffy about 001 but never suspects it might be the same as last time? Wtf?)",

My memory on it is hazy but l've used Al, gone through movie archives etc, about everything you can think of. It's a movie about a group of teens I believe 4 and the movie is based in the UK I believe. It was an indie film festival type film on Netflix around 2014-2016, the main characters father was in the police force. The main character took his dad's pistol and met up with his friends. In one scene they were firing it off a bridge and a nearby man chased them down. They spirited to be Marian rappers. Another one of the teens had a girlfriend to which in one scene he climbed through her window and she was using a webcam to stream. In another scene I remember there was a water gun fight and towards the end of the movie they were at a house party where the gun was pulled on a bully. Like I said it's a reach coming on here asking but I hope someone knows thank you :)\nShare",

The fire only lasted one hour and it wasn\u2019t even that warm. During the preview, the fire showed that it was much much bigger.  Very misleading. I tried poking it to feed the flame and it only pressed the television behind the dresser. Of course I ran to grab the water hose to put out the flame as my wife called the fire department. We could hear the fire continue to crackle and see the light behind the dresser. Don\u2019t yall think it\u2019s strange that your fire smelled like cat pee only after the \u201cfireplace\u201d fell? It didn\u2019t even have any aroma before\u2026 we\u2019re hoping the pine smells better. We soaked the flame until the sparks finally put the light out from the flames just as the fire department arrived. The gentleman were so happy we took care of the job that they were laughing with us as they left. I would think yall can update the fire to a safer, more aromatic pine for next year. ",
