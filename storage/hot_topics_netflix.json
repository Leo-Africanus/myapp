They could\u2019ve actually had some dramatic tension of folks figuring it out, trying to escape, an actual uprising. Folks on the outside could\u2019ve figured it all out and it turns into a hostage negotiation without the billionaires knowing they were hostages. Instead other than them actually getting them in to the bunker, I\u2019m in episode 8 and there\u2019s been more action in an hour of my abuela\u2019s daily telenovela. Not to mention dead lesbian syndrome within an hour of her appearing, and some casual antisemitism (come on, the wealthiest most evil billionaire just happens to be Jewish and he\u2019s the only one whose religion or ethnicity is mentioned? \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).

What really struck me was how the show captured the pettiness and cruelty of human nature how people would rather cling to the throne and their power than save actual lives. That layer made the story so much more haunting than just the undead.\n\nAnd the acting? Absolutely top notch. Every performance carried so much weight that I found myself invested in every character\u2019s fate, even the ones I hated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been putting this one off like I did, don\u2019t.

They deftly explore the difficult emotions these characters feel with both humor and genuine honesty. From things like self acceptance (Ben) and fear of dating again (Catherine) to the much more serious undertones of missing a parental figure and wanting to have friends (Ester), and family trauma/relationship dynamics (Nathan and Catherine). The characters feel very truthful, their flaws explored with their good intentions and love for each-other ultimately coming through. \n\nThey touch on these topics while still providing room to develop them, leaving the audience not only excited for more world development but also excited to explore these characters on a deeper level. You can feel the passion from the creators in each episode. \n\nI\u2019m so impressed and excited for this show and really hope Netflix invests in it properly. If they do it could absolutely be a classic! I certainly already have it on my rewatch roster and this season alone is one I know will be watched over and over again :) \n\nThank you to everyone who created and worked on this show for giving us such a gem!

        "content": "It's amazing how there isn't one single decent streaming service left. I just traveled to another continent and Netflix didn't let me watch content there for more than a couple days because my address was incompatible. On the other hand Amazon gives tons of ads and doesn't let me watch even half of their catalogue because everything is locked behind micro-subscriptions. Same applies to Disney.\n\nThe only streaming service that just kinda works is Crunchyroll, which I'll be keeping.",

        "content": "I'm episode 8, the Plank scene at 13:20, instead of executing Vince, Joe Mancuso starts a conversation \"Do you why it was him your mother called that night to clean up your mess? Did you know that we were close?\"\n\nVince infers this to mean that Joe slept with him mom, Sheila. \n\nJoe shook his head negatively with a grin.\n\nWas this a negative reply or an expression of disbelief? \n\nJoe's reply, \"You were always funny. Never took anything seriously. Neither did Junior. You two have a lot in common.\"\n\nWhy the comparison to Junior? What do they have in common? \n\nI have a few of theories, 1 weak, 1 so-so and 1 strong:\n\n1. So-so, Joe is Vince's biological father maybe from an earlier relationship prior to Dick. This would make Vince and Junior half brothers.\n\n2. Weak, Joe and Dick are brothers making Joe Vince's Uncle. \n\n3. Strong, Joe and Sheila are siblings, making Joe Vince's uncle.\n\nSome things that push me towards a family relationship was the hug that Joe gave Sheila in episode 7 during the cleanup. Furthermore, Joe offers advice about keeping everything hush-hush. Additionally, there is never mention of compensation for the cleanup. \n\nAlso, during the Plank scene, at the end of the Joe -Sheila relationship questions, Joe sets his gun down for a moment. Why? Was there going to be some other form of punishment?\n\nLast, at the end of episode 8, Joe is holding a gun to Jake's head and wants to know where Vince is. Upon learning that Vince is dead, he seemed to look sad for a moment, not disappointed that he's didn't avenge his son. \n\nWhat is everyone else's thoughts to these scenes that didn't seem to evolve?",
