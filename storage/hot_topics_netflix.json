Why is Netflix is giving this guy more notoriety and why do we elevate \u2018influencers\u2019 like this??\n\nToxic &amp; cliche grifter promoting an \u2018All Meat Primal\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 lifestyle gets caught using steroids\u2026 a surprise to no one with eyeballs.  He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

It happens for a few days now, reliably.\n\nHere are a few things I noticed / tried.\n\n\\- it happens almost exlusively when there's letters on the screen. It can be something in the video, but subtitels trigger it, too.\n\n\\- it only happens in fullscreen\n\n\\- it only happens on netflix (prime video and youtube works fine), but only when the aspect ratio doesn't match the one of my ultrawide monitor. If there's black bars left and right, the problems occurs. If there aren't any bars, there is no problem (tested it with a newer movie, which worked (no bars) and an old walking dead episode (with bars) which immediatly had the same issue when I enabled subtitles)\n\n\\- I disabled all add-ons\n\n\\- I ran a full virus scan\n\n\\- it happens on different browsers (tested chrome and edge)\n\n  \nAny ideas what could cause, or fix it?",

        "content": "(I'm just four episodes in so NO SPOILERS PLEASE.)\n\nI'll admit I slept in this one too. It only turned up because I looked up _Blood of Zeus_ (stupid, cringey show) and I suppose the name sounds vaguely mythological?\n\nBut it's really well written sci-fi with great voice acting. Just two episodes in and I'm hooked. It's still blowing my mind that I've never heard of it so I think 'heavily underrated' fits here. \n\nEdit: Really hoping the quality doesn't decline but so far so good!\n\n",

        "content": "Hi, i dislike that netflix forbid us to have 2 tabs open with different thing that we want to watch.\n\nI watch different things depending on what i do during the time, and for youtube i can easily let tabs open and go on the one that i want to watch, but netflix block this behavior.\n\n  \nThat's quite stupid, because if i watch one, it's mean i cannot watch the other tab, so i don't see the point of this feature.\n\n  \nAnyway, i'm looking for a tool/technique/extension that would allow me to easily switch between 2 (or more) netflix content that i'm currently interested in. \n\n  \nI have no idea if something like this exist, but if it does, that would be great.\n\n  \ncheers",

        "content": "\ni watched this show as someone who\u2019s only seen a few episodes of kakegurui (both anime and live action, disliked them both, hope I\u2019m still allowed to post this here though) and honestly i think the show is not all that bad. however, it has LOTS of room foe improvement come s2 if we get it, which i hope we do! first i will start with what it does right:\n\nYumeko: easily the best part of the show, both yumekos character and actress. she\u2019s the perfect mix of mysterious yet an open book; she\u2019s very similar to the original but she openly has a soft, sensitive and sweet side. Great acting as well. Also I just wanna say she\u2019s so pretty lol\n\n\nPlot: The plot in this show is VERY different but quite intriguing, definitely not an adaptation of kakeguri, more like a reboot or reimagining. \n\n\nNow for the bad:\n\nCharacter design: woww this is really where the show struggles. firstly, at least 4 characters have names that rhyme: dori, suki, Mary, riri?? I get that their names were directly inspired by the anime counterparts but come on\u2026. was there really NO way to make the names more interesting while still keeping the Japanese influence? also the student council is supposed to be this intimidating (as in they can and will kill you if you mess with them) and powerful group but they literally all look soft. Literally suki comes is a run of the mill stan twitter user, all bark; ZERO bite whatsoever. riri looks like a cosplayer with bug/bugself pronouns straight out of 2020. Dori,, i wont even comment. Kira looks ok, but the blue lipstick just does NOT translate well from an anime character onto a real person, it was extremely distracting in every scene she was in. also doesn\u2019t really match her personality, hard to believe someone as uptight as her is walking around with bright blue lipstick. \n\n\nWorld building: it\u2019s my understanding that in kakegurui the school was specifically a school FOR gambling, but the school in bet is more like a  normal prep school where students just happen to gamble on the side? I wish they would have done more to make it seem like a school and not just a gigantic casino, I mean I don\u2019t even think there was ever even as much as ONE scene where the characters are in class or studying or interacting with a teacher or just doing something non gambling related?\n\n\nActing: you can definitely tell that many of the actors are novices especially in the last episode. The show definitely gets more interesting towards the end but in turn the pacing really suffers the closer it gets to the end as well.\n\n\nOverall, I want to say 6.5/10 with LOTS of potential; If i was to describe this show to someone whos thinking of watching it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s Wednesday meets Fate the winx saga meets Kill Bill meets Kakegurui\n\n\n\n",

When he was on the mole his thirstiness for Hannah basically sent him home (from what I remember or was partially due to it). He's so tall and built that he can pull a lot when he gets home, focus dude. He definitely didn't get Hannah afterwards and he knew Gabby had a bf. He was real competitive early on for that 250k yet forfeighted anyway?",

I might be overthinking things but I found it weird that Mr Beast of all people cameos as the host and commentator of this gladiatorial episode. Thoughts? ",

In situations like this I wish the writers would be kind enough to write up a one to two page paper of a quick finale of what happened to everyone. Anyways fuq cancellations. ",
