Copium, I know, but I wonder if anyone else feels the same way. I'm not sure if David Shore even has the capacity to do something in the near future, since he's working on a new series at the moment... But a man can hope.",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still there, but I remember a bunch of weird and specific things:\n\t\u2022\tThe main character is a kid who lives in a strange world with bizarre creatures.\n\t\u2022\tHe finds a really weird dog that sort of adopts him. The dog is super powerful and can open its face to absorb or eat things.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s one scene I clearly remember: a piece of debris is about to fall on the kid, and the dog opens its face and sucks it in to protect him.\n\t\u2022\tThe dog could transform, possibly into other forms or weapons.\n\t\u2022\tThese creatures (like the dog) were treated by humans as tools or weapons to fight others like them.\n\t\u2022\tI think the kid\u2019s mom dies early in the show.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s also some company or organization trying to capture the dog because it\u2019s too overpowered.\n\t\u2022\tAt some point, it\u2019s mentioned that the dog destroyed or made an entire island disappear, and the kid\u2019s dad was on that island.\n\n Does anyone know what this show is called?
