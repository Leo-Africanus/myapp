        "content": "EDIT : I think posters are vastly missing the point that weekly episodic lasts JUST AS LONG as bi-monthly \"chunking\". The argument that \"chunking\" keeps more viewers couldn't be farther from the truth because 8 weeks is 8 weeks no matter what way you slice it up. Also, I do not advocate for weekly episodic. I am, however, stating the lesser of 2 evils. As you were ...\n\n\n\nJust found out that Stranger Things 5 will be airing 4 episodes in November, 3 in December, and 1 in January for \"viewer retention.\"\n\nWhy don't they just start on Thanksgiving with weekly episodes that go throw 3 core holidays? Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years?\n\nPeople talk about it on social media, share their opinions, sometimes it's on talk shows, Game Of Thrones did this best, I don't know why Netflix doesn't do this. WEDNESDAY was the same.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nObviously, just give me the entire season all at once. The premise is that they \\*DONT\\* do that anymore. And honestly, splitting up the seasons of these shows a few episodes MONTHS apart is so much worse than week-by-week episodes for a few months sraight.\n\nAlso, people tend not to give a @#$% anymore after binge watching half the season and then having to wait another month for the rest. Am I only in this way of thinking?",
