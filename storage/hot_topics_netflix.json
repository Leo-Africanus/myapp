As if he is a victim..\n\nLike - I don't care whether your son was born like this, or became an anti-women terrorist because you allowed him to watch inappropriate online content , or you yourself radicalized him - he doesn't get a right to kill teenage girl and then play the victim card. \nHe needs to be locked away in jail as per whatever law decides. \n\nWe need to perhaps revisit our laws in various countries where underage criminals get away with almost anything. \n\nDo we show the same consideration to religious islamic terrorists and to black youth? Do we say - oh come on, they are just being radicalized online, let's not blame them. \n\nBut if it is a white straight boy, then the sympathy floodgates open up huh. \n\nI also wonder if people's reactions would be different if the victim was another boy- a white straight boy - instead of Katie. Then everyone would have said that Jamie was a criminal and not blamed the victim maybe.\n",

You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

        "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69\\_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40)\n\nin 2018, on social media, Jerry Buting (Avery's defense lawyer in 2007) proclaimed this is the first he ever heard of this audio, and that the state knew they had found human remains in the 2 quarries adjacent to the Avery property.  (One of those properties was owned the Manitowoc County. Bones found on property owned by Manitowoc County not revealed to the defense)\n\n***Some context:***\n\n1. State of Wisconsin found Human remains on top of soil near Avery's trailer. They claimed that its where the bones were burned and cremated before even testing the burn pit soil for such evidence.\n2. State also found 4 locations (and at least some burn sites) in the quarry (piles 1-4 on map below)\n3. State wrote detailed report about the bones by Avery's trailer, and told the media, public, defense, and courts about them all the time.\n4. State didn't write any reports about the human remains in piles 1-4, didn't tell the media, public, defense, nor courts about them at all.\n5. The state forensic anthropologist examined these bones from piles 1-4 nearly a half year later, was told they were from the Avery property, and she included these bones in her summary a month before trial using the evidence numbers only and no description of where they originated from. Thus, Avery's defense team had no idea she included human remains found in the quarry in her final last minute report. Hell, she was unaware either.\n6. In court, the state claimed \"nobody knows what those are\" when referring to the quarry remains. A lie.\n\nIn short, the defense was misled about the human evidence, and they were arguing the quarry was the real crime scene. If the State had told the defense about ALL of the human remains, the defense's case would have been 100x stronger given they would be able to present human remains being found far away from their clients residence. After all, Avery wouldn't burn the body in the quarry then bring back evidence by his house to incriminate himself. No jury would buy that and the state knew that. They HAD to confine the crime scene as a whole to the Avery yard.\n\nThe kicker is the state didn't end up finding any evidence in Avery's burn pit proving a primary burn location, and their own expert testified that in her opinion, if it WASNT the primary burn location ,then she would have found other small, brittle bone fragments from other locations. (They did find exactly that, but she wasn't made aware of that when the evidence was turned over to her for examination).\n\nThose remains stashed in buckets for 6 months and never disclosed to the defense in a manner they could use. Defense claimed that area was crime scene at trial w/out this info.\n\nAnd for visual reference piles 1,2,3,4 are what the phone call is referencing, with piles 2 &amp; 3 being located on the Manitowoc County quarry (same county which was being sued by Avery for framing him in 1985). Just look how far away and huge the crib\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di0ai89pynpe1.png?width=2664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd8429946c0fbc869f6afa2629d14d82c454351c\n\nEnd Result:\n\nThis map was presented by Avery's lawyer to the court in 2018/2019. The court ruled it was barred from being used because Avery once filed his own pro se (on his own, and without a lawyer) motion years before Making a Murderer came out, and the court punished Avery for not bringing this unknown information up earlier (even though the phone call wasn't released via FOIA until 2018.\n\n...This audio and Jerry Buting's admission he was never given it was not filed in court, however. Nor was it shown in Making a Murderer part 2, which was released prior to this phone call being made public.",

Easiest thing to do was to watch a couple of minutes, then stop it and watch on my TV which is using my Chromecast to stream. (which is also connected to our Starlink dish)\n\nI did this but it didn't come up on \"Continue watching\" so I used the voice search asking for \"The Recruit\" and it brought me to a page about the series and then a link to \"Netflix shows like The Recruit\" but not the actual show. So then I said into the voice command \"Watch The Recruit on Netflix\" to which it replied \"The Recruit is not available on Netflix\" WTH??\n\nSo I went back to my tablet, it wasn't listed in my \"Keep watching\" so I did a search (typed in) and found it and started watching it again. I watched about 15 minutes then went back to my TV, it still wasn't listed in my Continue watching list so I did a voice search and again it told me that The Recruit is not available on Netflix. Once more, WTH?\n\nUpon backing out of the menu, lo and behold, now it's in my Continue watching list.  \n\nAnybody else ever had this happen to them?",

Can't be helped, old house means the WiFi is pretty bad (plus we also dont live in a fttp area so we don't have super fast internet, and also live in the sticks in Scotland) so this is currently our best option. I'm really losing patience with it now as I can watch it on my phone on the same network as the Xbox but not on it. I've followed their problem solving guide but no luck. We had it come up before that it's not part of the netflix household and fixed it easily, but now it's just permanently like this. Is there a way around it? If not then I'm likely going to cancel netflix, I just wanna lie in bed and watch stuff but Netflix wants me to jump through a bloody obstacle course worth of hoops before that can happen!

There's alot I can and want to say about the show but to streamline this Jamie discussion I'll leave it at I loved the show and acting.\n\nAfter finishing I started scrolling through r/Netflix and the amount of threads and comments about how Jamie is a monster, he was a psychopath, etc... was shocking to me. \n\nYes what he did was horrible and the way he did it was clearly very brutal, but like wasn't the entire point of them constantly mentioning incels supposed to be a clear indication that Jamie was not actually a \"bad\" kid, but just a victim of this Andrew Tate anti-women movement? I thought it was so incredibly in your face the entire show that it would be impossible for anyone to not realize what the message of the show was, but like I said I found an astounding number of threads and comments completely ignoring that Jamie was molded into a monster, not born one.\n\nThe 4th episode is just the parents grieving about what they may have done wrong and they even literally talk about how they thought he was safe at home on his computer, how more obvious can the writers / directors make it? Yet somehow people came to the conclusion he was just born a psychopath and all he needed was a trigger?!?!?\n\nTLDR: This show is about how the incel / anti-women movement impacts our young men correct? Not about the next John Wayne Gacey getting caught early before he could do more harm? Its shocking how many people completely missed the purpose of the show and somehow came to the conclusion that Jamie was just a natural born psycho and nothing more.",

        "content": "The worst offense in my book was Mac and Eric being completely oblivious, while Kaylee is practically screaming at them to run. They just keep standing there like morons, completely disregarding Kaylee yelling to run. On top of that, they make a stop a bit further on just to watch, while Kaylee is understandably scared, stays in the car.\n\nThen the people in the diner, and the mom, disregarding the son, who is a weather expert, that the tornado is about to kill everyone in sight.\n\nJust a really frustrating movie to watch because of the stupidity. I used to think movies made people intentionally stupid, but no, people are fucking stupid.",

It just tells me that no accout is linked to my email....\nI mean come on netflix!!! \nOn the netflix website they state that this might be linked to older accounts data stored. Bit it does not make any sense. I cleared cache, deleted data uninstalled and reinstalled apps...\nBothing would make it work. \nIs this only me or what??? \nAt this point i think netflix are scammers ! ",
