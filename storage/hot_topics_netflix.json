The only basis of an argument her lawyer can make for the retrial is the fact that Jason had mentioned to a counselor that he was more angry, and the secret voice recordings. But I feel like 1) if someone who doesn\u2019t even have guardianship of your own kids is actively trying to separate you from your kids, you\u2019re going to be very stressed ? Also, the secret voice recordings don\u2019t even show any abuse IMO ? They are arguing, and they both raise their voices, but Jason does NOT seem as aggressive as they are trying to paint him as. And the fact that they called it a threat that he was threatening Molly about taking the kids away\u2026 THEY ARNET EVEN HER KIDS ? Legally or biologically !! She never adopted them !! The other argument was regarding Jason\u2019s first wife. But professionals from Ireland who worked with the autopsy said that it still was not strangulation that caused Mags death. It could\u2019ve been a different medical condition that appeared to be an asthma attack at the time, but that does not warrant that Jason strangled her. Am I on the wrong side? Do people seriously think Mollys innocent ?",

        "content": "This is a solution to a problem I've had for ages and I just want to put it out here in case other people are also stuck on this problem.  \nMy AVR (Harman Kardon AVR 355) doesn't support Dolby Atmos for Home Theater. Netflix says for you to set the spatial sound effect to Dolby Atmos but when I do it, it refuses to play any sound, and even resets it's original configuration from 7.1 to 2.1.\n\n  \nHere's how I fixed it:\n\n1. Go to Windows Sound Settings and set the spatial audio to Dolby Atmos (make sure Netflix is not open during this) (It is completely normal if you don't hear anything from your speakers, we'll fix that later)\n2. Open Netflix. Netflix detects that the sound settings \"supports\" Dolby Atmos since the spatial audio is set to Dolby Atmos and makes all the 5.1 channel sounds available.\n3. Go to Windows Sound Settings, scroll down to \"More Sound Settings\" and press that. (This is from a Windows 11 perspective. On Windows 10, it is the same as going to the Sound setting in Control Panel)\n4. Right click your AVR or amplifier in the Playback tab and press \"Configure Speakers\". Set it back to your current speaker configuration (5.1 or 7.1 etc). Make sure to do this ***TWICE*** as Dolby Atmos disables at the first time, making the configuration back to 2.1.\n\nAfter that, you should be able to watch supported movies and series in 5.1 without needing Dolby Atmos!\n\nHope this helps someone!",

        "title": "Liver king",
        "content": "Hey everyone, starting a new thread because the current one is under joe Rogan and that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. For anyone who watched this doc and thought that something didn\u2019t feel right about these kids and their situation-you\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s what I saw-children who are in, essentially, an isolated cult where they have to think like their parents and abide by some insane rules or they\u2019ll be rejected. They have to eat raw liver, raw testicles, raw innards, and apparently 15 raw eggs a day. Didn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any additional food in the house or in their diet. Sleeping on wood slats, not allowed to wear proper clothing or shoes. When they were pretending to kill a cow (because it had already been shot) the men who weren\u2019t part of the family and out there were in LAYERS-coats and warm clothing while the children were barefoot and in shorts and T shirts. The mom admitted that the son had a compound fracture in one of his legs that didn\u2019t get medical attention for at least 24 hours because \u201cpain won\u2019t kill you\u201d. She framed it\nLike he didn\u2019t ask but that\u2019s a lie. That child was either too afraid to ask for help or she told him \u201cpain won\u2019t kill you\u201d. The whole thing smacks of child abuse-physical and psychological. Clearly CPS has already been involved because he brought it up but then lied and said they got there, saw the kids and said \u201cwhat am I doing here? These kids are fine and left two minutes later\u201d. That\u2019s what a pathological liar would say-he\u2019s making up stories. Kind of like the rest of his entire life-his wife might be even worse as an enabler and someone who supports the lies and admits that she\u2019d never come clean on the lies. Those children seem extremely isolated and forced to live in this insane reality their mentally ill but extremely rich father is enforcing. I called CPS and filed a report. I\nEncourage anyone who shares these concerns to do the same. Yes, it\u2019s wild to file a report based on a Netflix doc but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen child abuse from content creators-far from it. These people think they\u2019re gods and they\u2019re sick. And ultimately the children suffer. Yes, I realize it also could be totally fake. But let CPS determine that. 1-800-252-5400 here\u2019s their phone number, apparently his home address is 13876 longwood drive, Willis, Texas. This is public information already available online. \n",

        "content": "Over the past few years, Netflix has been introducing a ton more foreign shows and films. Some are decent, some are terrible. I watched the preview for this one and thought I'd try watching an episode of it.  \n\nI was instantly hooked!  The show is so well done. It can be slow at times, but for some reason it really fascinates me. I blasted through season 1, and am a couple episodes into season 2.  \n\nWho else is really enjoying this show?  ",
