If they wanted to cut the story line to fit into a movie, they could have done the following instead:\n1. Make it into a limited SERIES, to actually address all the major plots and story lines of the book. Or \n2. Make the movie bloody long?? What\u2019s wrong with that - they did that for Gone Girl, and that movie was just as great as the book.\n\nI can\u2019t get over how bad this movie was.

But the truth is she posted a EBITDA profit of around \u00a32m pounds, but still an operating loss of -\u00a32.9m. This year, she\u2019s had to extend loans of \u00a36.3m to keep it afloat. It\u2019s not successful and hasn\u2019t been, and if you can\u2019t make a company generate a return in 17 years, after that much investment, it\u2019s not going to magically start making a return. And for that \u00a370 million investment to have meant anything, it needs to be able to generate more than that at some point, not just pay it back. Like who in god\u2019s name pumps that much cash into something year after year, as an escalating commitment to failure, and then gets a documentary made about what a big success it is. I\u2019m baffled! I own some of her eyeliners, and now I know David Beckham has partially subsidised them!",

About 20 minutes in, I started picking up on some really weird haziness around the edges of characters moving. As the movie progressed, particles started looking extremely spotty, and I almost immediately clocked that it was AI upscaling. We use my girlfriend\u2019s father\u2019s Netflix and he pays for whatever the highest plan is, and it\u2019s not like we have slow internet; our Apple TV, which we stream from, clocks consistent speeds at 400mbps. This movie should be streaming in at LEAST 1080p, maybe even 4K - and yes, I know, streaming bitrates are different across the board, but it has never looked THIS bad before. This is genuinely just embarrassing that a company as massive as Netflix is charging ~$30 a month for the equivalent of 720p streaming with upscaling so distracting it made the movie, which I adore, nearly unwatchable. This is completely and utterly repulsive. If you haven\u2019t already, use your money elsewhere. Inexcusable.",
