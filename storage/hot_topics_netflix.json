I grew up watching a lot of foreign tv with subtitles and when it comes to Korean, I can both hear and passively read every word. I am baffled by some of the subtitles. it's not just bad, they straight up make up entire sentences that were not said. like someone will say \"hmm\" and the subtitle will say something like \"oh that's terrible\" I understand not translating puns or expressions or culturally specific things. but sometimes they add unnecessary fillers that change the context. sometimes it feels like someone who barely understands Korean is using google translated english and making up fillers here and there.\n\nhow are the English subs are for other languages? I'm mostly asking about variety tv shows, not dramas or movies. ",

And then when I saw Lena Dunham in the second episode It hit me. The main character is Lena Dunham in \"Girls\" and this entire show is \"Girls\" repackaged and set in London.

I've watched through House and The Resident so far, the former being perfect for what I needed (The Resident's romancy side-plots were a bit boring for me). The things that made House perfect was:\n\n- Serious overall show with some comedy/wittiness. (No Sitcoms or pure comedies or whatnot. I like a good plot).\n\n- Each hour episode has its own story. The season has an overall storyline, but each episode itself has its own story that is concluded by the end of the episode. (So, no Audiobooks or Podcasts)\n\n- The mystery element, where the protagonists are spending the episode trying to figure something out, and the something is satisfyingly figured out by the end of the episode.\n\n- Most importantly: The protagonists describe what's going on. In House, the characters would describe down to the detail each symptom they were seeing, the ways the diseases affected the patient, etc. \n\n- Also, I know there's one or two that are basically \"House, but it's about Psychiatry\". None of that. I am in the field of Psychology, I would be too offput by the inaccuracies.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI might try out one of those lawyer detective ones, like Law and Order or whatnot, but I don't know which ones of those would be a good fit. But open to other suggestions as well.\n\nThank you!",

I cannot even AirPlay to the TV or Cast anymore, Netflix blocks it in app or just won't play the episode.\n\nI may have dealt with this until the point where I called customer service on the Netflix app, and after going back and forth with the CSR for a bit, with them trying to tell me I could click the \"I'm away from home\" option (which there was not on the TV), then telling me there was absolutely nothing they can do, no one to escalate to, and that the only thing he could do was \"educate (me) on the way Netflix works now)\".
