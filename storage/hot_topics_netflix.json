In the beginning I felt bad for Jamie thought maybe it was bullying that pushed him to the edge but then I saw the detective\u2019s son who was also bullied but didn\u2019t choose to go to a self destructive path like Jamie. Third episode made me realize that u can\u2019t feel bad for Jamie he has no remorse for what he did and clearly has issues. I feel bad for Jamie\u2019s family the most however especially the dad last episode I almost cried and I am a grown man. I do however think if the dad took more interest in his art and encouraged him and made him feel comfortable about himself he wudnt go down this path same with the mum as well they shudnt had been so hands off. The Detective realized this and started to spend more time with Adam which would help him in the long term.",

        "content": "I am on Episode 4 of Season 1. Please no plot spoilers other than whether it gets better in your opinion or not.\n\n\nI really wanted to like it but I cannot get over how bad the writing is. I think it's a mixture of two things:\n\n\n1) It's very clearly a show for children, written with plenty of those comedic gags that only children find funny. This is in contrast to the way that Stranger Things was technically for children but managed to appeal to adults too, by avoiding really non-adult humour. Example from Wednesday: a character puking all of a sudden in someone's face. I can totally see a 8 year old finding this hilarious. Which is fair, but I thought it was also a show that adults would enjoy.\n\n2) The writers assume the viewer is either really dumb or has no memory, with the amount of repeating main facts/plot points in a very unnatural way. A lot of past plot is spelled out by the characters telling each other what happend (where they clearly know) so they the viewer can know, rather than what would be more natural, to imply it for the viewer to figure out.\n\nExample A (paraphrasing, but basically how it went down): Two characters meet after the years. \nCharacter 1: Remember when we met years ago\nCharacter 2: Yes I hid in the coffin during the funeral but I couldn't get out.\nCharacter 1: I found you and saved you in time.\n\nI mean, nobody talks like that about an event they both participated in.\n\n\nExample B.\n\nThere is this school ball called \"The Raven\" which characters talk about going to, from time to time.\nThen cut to a scene of a big ballroom and the school headmistress welcoming the guests saying \"Welcome to this year's raven!\"\nLike who talks like that?\nImagine showing up to your office Christmas party and the organiser saying \"Welcome to this year's Christmas party!\"\nIt's such a weird thing to say. Firstly, it's OBVIOUSLY \"this year's\" since it's happening now. Secondly everyone knows what party it is, that's why we came here.\n\nAdditionally, the characters *constantly* talk to themselves aloud when alone in rooms, to explain what they are thinking of what they are going to do. \n\nLike ok, sometimes people talk to themselves but in this show every character does it in every scene they are alone. It is sooo weird and unnatural",

Honestly sony animation makes some random films. Went from peak (k pop demon hunters) to this shit. I wanna peep my eyeballs out of their sockets. WHY DO WE GOTTA SHOW HIS BUTTHOLE SO MUCH BROTHER. LIKE OMG. PLZ NEUTER HIM RN. Ok 8 minutes in and there is fucking shit and piss jokes. This is for millenials. And theres another butthole. SOS. So far i assume the film is only gonna go down hill from here. The dogs balls are flapping. Im just gonna go pray to god and stop watching. This movie is horrible and i dont need to watch it all. 4/10. This movie is trying to be as unserious as possible and even then it fails. Im not a movie critic but honestly, id rather watch war of the worlds.",
