It\u2019s just so incredibly good and I had to make sure others know it exists. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read some people that have played the video games and are puritans weren\u2019t all thrilled given that it seems like the plot differed from the games somewhat, but as someone coming into it fresh it\u2019s incredibly entertaining to watch. Can\u2019t remember the last time a Netflix show hooked me like this.  ",

        "content": "I just finished The Great Hack on Netflix and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The way the documentary lays out the Cambridge Analytica scandal feels like a thriller more than a history lesson. They follow people who were directly involved  journalists, former employees, even people who had their data pulled into the whole thing  and it shows how personal information became a weapon during elections.\n\nThe film does a really good job of making you see data as more than just numbers on a screen. They literally call it the most valuable resource in the world now, even more than oil, and watching how easily it was collected and sold was pretty disturbing.\n\nI think the scariest part was how much of it happened quietly. Most people had no idea their Facebook likes or quiz answers were being used to build psychological profiles on them. By the time they realized it, the damage had already been done.  It made me think about how much info we all give away without even noticing and it makes you a little sacred or at least made me a little scared. \n\n  \nWhat did you people think, did you like the premise? And also what are some movies like it that I can watch to feed my paranoia lol",

I honestly feel like it\u2019s so obvious that Cole and Jackie are meant to be together. Their chemistry feels so natural, and they bring out the best in each other, it\u2019s real relationship energy and intimacy.\n\nI really don\u2019t enjoy Jackie and Alex as a couple. It\u2019s frustrating that season 2 ended on basically the same cliffhanger as season 1\u2026 but at least there\u2019s clear growth with Cole this time around. His character feels more grounded and less arrogant, which I loved seeing. Jackie and Cole\u2019s bond also felt a lot stronger this season.\n\nThat said, I have such a love/hate relationship with Jackie, I just want her to finally settle down instead of bouncing between the brothers. Alex might be the \u201cgood boy\u201d type, but it\u2019s obvious Jackie\u2019s heart is with Cole. That\u2019s the relationship I want to see play out in season 3, please let it happen!!!!",

        "content": "Hey y'all. I have a strange problem that I've tried googling and I'm not getting anywhere with it. I have Netflix on my iPhone (both updated to latest software version), I use it to play a show for background noise while I fall asleep. It used to stop playing a few hours after I fell asleep but last month I got a notice from my ISP that I was coming up on my data limit because of streaming video. Well I was thinking about it and realized that my show was usually still playing when my alarm when off in the morning all of a sudden when it never used to do that. \n\nI've tried google but the only results I'm getting are either how to turn it on or off completely, nothing for how to have it automatically stop playing after a few hours. And I've checked the settings on both the app and the desktop site with no success either\n\nHas anyone else had this problem and if so how did you fix it? It's persisting even though I've rebooted and updated my phone multiple times and uninstalled and reinstalled the most recent version of the app a couple time. I don't remember ever going into settings to change it so I don't think it's something I did. \n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nEdit to add: I just confirmed for sure that the \"are you still watching\" popup happens on PC as expected",

I get that from an entertainment standpoint they did this to increase the shock factor when it\u2019s revealed that she was the catfish but I don\u2019t think they did enough to explain other people\u2019s perspectives of her behavior.\n\nOwen says that he felt she gave him extra attention in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. And the examples he gives probably would have been hard for other adults to pick up on as they would likely just seem like Kendra being somewhat maternal towards him.\n\nBut then Khloe\u2019s dad said that he thought early on that it was Kendra and even mentioned it to the sheriff. But then Netflix completely failed to dive into the reasons WHY he would think that. This makes me think that she was probably doing other strange things if other adults suspected her, whether it\u2019s a history of manic behaviors or inappropriate behavior towards minors it would have made sense to touch on that more rather than trying to stick to this story that she was some completely normal mom who just happened to wake up one day and start tormenting and sexually harassing teenagers out of the blue ",

Once when I didn't know who it was and then watched it after to see the texts through the lens of this being her mother.\n\nA few observations:  \n\\-Kendra says \"we've all broken the law at one point and haven't gotten caught\". LADY, no one else has stalked minors and adults with sexual content texts for 22 months as an OOPSIE. Did this make anyone else want to scream at the TV!?\n\n\\-She lies that she started doing this to find out who sent the original texts. She started off aggressive with those texts out of the gate and they escalated. Did anyone else believe her?\n\n\\-She was absolutely obsessed with Owen, and I believe she was hoping to push her daughter, Owen, Khloe or someone to snap and do something.\n\n\\-I think she got off way too easy in this documentary. I am sure they had to make some agreement with her so she'd appear, but man I wish they would've pushed back.\n\n\\-Can anyone answer why she didn't get charged with anything as far as the sexual content to minors went? I mean her texts to Owen and Lauryn were beyond disgusting for 14 year olds. Why was it only stalking and nothing in the substance of the texts? Genuinely asking anyone who knows the law why this would be the case.\n\n\\-I can't imagine all these people living in the small town together after this all went down. I genuinely feel awful for this poor girl Lauryn. You can tell the difference in her after she had gotten some space from her mother's grip and had time to process. Those interviews she was different. She also says \"I hope that my mom gets the help she needs so it doesn't go back to the way it was before.\" I don't think she's just referring to the texts. She's probably been awful on other things.\n\nThose are my thoughts / questions. No one I know has watched it yet and dying to hear people's thoughts!!\n\nUPDATE: I found an article from New York mag from January. It's obvious the author does a TON of research here with stuff not mentioned in the documentary.

        "content": "My husband and I just watched the documentary and I keep wondering how was it even possible to interview these people for millions of us around the world to see them? How will they be able to go back to their normal life after this? All of these teenagers are still so young, I am not even sure that all of them were above 18. I wonder if it needed to be a Netflix show - maybe it would have been better for this to die down as a local news story, to protect everyone involved\u2019s sanity. \n\nOn a bright side, I wonder if the attention to this might lead to more checks so that what all of us noticed - it was a sexual harassment of minors rather than just catfishing - gets properly investigated and hopefully leads to either more jail time or stricter consequences.

But she was a bully just by how her parents are behaving about their daughter being a potential bully and overall how her parents dealt with this matter. Not to mention her friends saying Adriana Owen\u2019s cousin \u201cspread a rumour\u201d about them bullying her in middle school. They were soo quick to blame Adriana and point fingers but her parents were offended that someone would blame their child.",

It\u2019s extremely clear she was in some sort of distorted reality she still considers real. \nWhat really shocked me was her bringing up how she was raped at 17 as if that is any justification for her abuse toward her daughter and other children. \u201cI got scared that would happen to her too\u201d \u2026. so you sent her messages about her body and weird sexual messages about her boyfriend??????\nI\u2019m also shocked that there were no charges placed or even any conversation about her obsession with Owen. \nShe ruined her daughter\u2019s high school experience and this will likely cause a lot more socialization issues into her adult life. \nI need to read her psych evaluation like yesterday.

        "content": "Hi,\n\nSo I\u2019ve been watching more Korean dramas lately on Netflix, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice something: most of them are only dubbed in Korean and Spanish. Honestly, Spanish speakers are super lucky!\n\nMeanwhile, I keep wishing more of these shows were available dubbed in French or Japanese (and okay, maybe English too, but in this case I\u2019d personally prefer Japanese since I\u2019m already used to it from anime).\n\nIt\u2019s not that I hate original audio \u2014 I get why people prefer the authenticity \u2014 but my ear just isn\u2019t trained for series outside of French, Japanese, or English. It makes it harder for me to really get into them and enjoy the experience fully.\n\nI feel like Netflix is missing out on a whole audience here. If they added more French or Japanese dubs, it would definitely make K-dramas more accessible for people like me.\n\nAnyone else frustrated by this, or am I just being picky?",
