        "content": "Okay so the show is predictable at best but there are some strange dead ends that I\u2019m just not understanding if someone could explain please. Okay, so what happened to the female cop\u2019s husband/child\u2019s father? There was some strange back story where he needed her to lie for him, he was stalking her. I felt like there was this big build up that ultimately just was him going to jail with no resolution really. Also, in the beginning when the woman falls off the cliff, the police were back and forth about if she was already dead before she fell or not but we could clearly see she was dead. She also had some animal tear up her knee after she had been shot. When they finally showed the chain of events, it showed her getting shot, but no animals attacking her. It only showed her \u201cjump\u201d off the cliff. So, she wasn\u2019t dead? She committed suicide? Another thing, they made it seem like the man that was showing up to see the girl was this creepy ominous guy who she trusted. The way they showed him opening her bedroom window made it seem like he was going to hurt her. Idk, this show felt like the audience was being lead in different directions with no real \u201cah ha moment\u201d or pay off. oh and, the whole drug ring side plot was incredibly unnecessary in my opinion too.

If it's laggy or my hardware can't handle a specific resolution, then I can turn it down to something else.

Like Arnold\u2019s movies being referenced. Also I think after true lies, this is yet another story of him being the ladies guy. \n\nWhat really makes you want to watch the series are his wife and daughter though. Awesome casting!",
