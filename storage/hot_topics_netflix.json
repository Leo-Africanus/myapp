        "content": "Context: I fell if love with Vietnam  as I travelled across the country last year. Till date, it is one the best experience in visiting a foreign country I've had. Food, Culture, Nature and the People are all fabulous. \n\nDuring my visit to Cu Chi Tunnels, I befriended my tour guide who was super informative. We spoke a lot about the culture and history of Vietnam with more focus on the war. He was from the North and his family were part of the communist party. But he was neutral and explained the whole scenario. One thing I was clear, that there's no good guy or bad guy here. Both the sides had committed war crimes. But then I visited the War Memorial, I felt the US did horrific attrocitices. They equally killed civilians as did the communists. So all in all, I had a belief that all 3 parties, The communists of North, South Vietnamese and The US were all equally guilty of inflicting so much pain to common people and created so much disruption that no one could live happlity during that period in time. \n\nBut after watching this series, I feel the South Vietnamese were the neutral guys who got stuck between the North and the US. Is this a right way of understanding the whole scenario?",

Each actor gets a profile of their character and only the \u201cmurderer\u201d knows they\u2019re the killer and has to lie and fool the others. There are these elaborate sets with different \u201crooms\u201d where the contestants find evidence and debate sections where they each can sway opinion.\n\nThere are a few things in the first 2 episodes I couldn\u2019t culturally follow but that\u2019s to be expected. The stories are really elaborate and it\u2019s a super fun guessing game. High recommendation. ",

        "content": "I know this documentary has been out for a little while, but I just watched it tonight and have been searching thru Reddit. The more I\u2019ve been reading and thinking about, the more I realize there is a chance that the whole family could\u2019ve been in on it. Would explain the strange behavior from everyone, especially in the police interrogation scene. Think about it. Kendra could not hold a job. I have no idea what the father did. They were obviously struggling financially and needed a creative way to make money. Why not stage that your daughter is being stalked and verbally harassed and try to frame it on someone else? She literally did that with Khloe and got close. They could\u2019ve potentially filed a lawsuit and got money from whoever got blamed. The charges wouldn\u2019t be severe enough to serve more than a couple years in prison. The documentary focuses so much on Lauryn, but Kendra texted a LOT of people. How did she get all those numbers? To me, there\u2019s only 2 possible ways. 1) she stole it from Lauryns phone without her knowing or, 2) Lauryn was helping her send the texts. The whole lack of a motive was so confusing to me. If she was literally having a psychotic break and trying to get close to Lauryn and/or Owen, then I feel like it would\u2019ve resorted to something physical a lot sooner based on the texts she was sending. But it just went on for almost 2 years. I think there has to be a more logical motive.",

Hypothetically, if he survived into the current era, I feel like he could walk around in public without much more than a few quick glances from people trying to get a better look at him without looking like they\u2019re starring. Nowadays, people are a lot more conscious of not appearing rude, especially in public, and are generally a lot more accepting of people who look different. Let\u2019s say Jacob Elordi\u2019s creature went walking down the street in somewhere like Town Square. As long as he was dressed relatively normally and had his hair grown out, most people would probably assume he had gigantism and some scars from a really bad plastic surgeon.\n\n",
