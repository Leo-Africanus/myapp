But like I could \u201cfriend\u201d my mom, and when I finish watching a movie I think she would like, I could \u201cshare the recommendation\u201d with her. Same with friends (who tend to be more clued in on movies, why I used my mom as an example). It could even be added as a \u201cfriends recommend\u201d list below the \u201cmy list\u201d. And it would show the movies/shows/etc and then which \u201cfriend\u201d recommended it. You scroll to a show/movie and it gives watch now, add to my list, dismiss, etc. If you watch it and rate it, it lets the person that recommended it know if you liked it. Netflix wants to keep people on the platform, this would help. ",

A good one time watch but they need better writers. What did you think? Also, i recommend watching it in Norwegian and not the dubbed version. If you like it, there is a much better movie named The Wave from 2015. Much better ",

Even though the TV has internet, because the YouTube app still works just fine.\n\nIt shows a error code: NW-4-8 ( if i remember correctly, if not will update you tomorrow). Then I read you should put the power away from the TV and from the Internet router. So I did that for like 1 Minute and put the power back on, but still the same. It's still not working and still same error code.\n\nCan someone help? Anyone has a solution? If you need the excact panasonic model, I can tell you tomorrow.\n\nThanks and merry christmas\n\nHave a nice evening\n\nPS: My mom said she did update the TV, but still didn't help\n\nPS2: On the TV I just turned off the power strip (cause you don't really have access to the cable itself without moving the TV), and on the internet router I unplugged the power cable\n\n  \nUpdate: So she just took a few pictures. But she said she tried to delete the app, but didn't work. But coulnd't test it myself, but i belive her \ud83d\ude05\n\nShe said TV is around 10 years old. Didn't expect it to be that old.. So is the TV really to old now to get Netflix access?\n\n  \nHere the pictures - [https://ibb.co/pKYNnYF](https://ibb.co/pKYNnYF)",
