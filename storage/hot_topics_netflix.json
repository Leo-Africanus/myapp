I'd always have the 4k plan through some deal, I believe the last year I had it through a verizon deal of like $140 bucks for the year with amc+. And I'd get something similar all previous years for the past like 5 years. But there have been zero deals this go around, and I'm now at a point where I'll be cancelling a couple other streaming services that are lacking or cheaper trials ending (i.e. apple 3 month trial). \n\nAnyway, the 4k plan is now $25 which is pretty insane to me. I did get a quality tv and sound system back in 2020 and am used to 4k on every other service. So I'm deciding if I want to do $25 a few months a year, or do $8/mo continuously for 1080p. Since netflix releases all episodes at once, it doesn't really create the weekly discussions the way a show like severance, last of us, white lotus, etc do. So I'm heavily leaning towards just subscribing for a month at $25, immediately cancel it so it ends that month, and rejoin when theres at least a few more new shows/seasons that actually appeal to me. Wondering how many other people just subscribe occassionally throughout the year. ",
