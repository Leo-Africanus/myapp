It took like 2 episodes to get into it but after that, I quite enjoyed it. I liked the setting, the overhead shots of the area, the action was pretty good, son was a realistic character imo, I liked seeing Holt McCallany back in action and the plot was basic in ways but easy to follow and fun to watch. It\u2019s not ozark but it\u2019s only 1 season compared to like 5. I would give it a 7-8 out of 10. Topher grace\u2019s character was pretty fun as well, he\u2019s a good actor. All in all, a pretty fun watch. ",

Watch a movie about airport devastation before my first flight ever \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI saw Jason Bateman's face, and I still can't picture him as a serious role actor. I think of him more from movies like \"Office Christmas Party\" or \"Identity Thief\". Goofy movies. But he did an amazing job acting and I was thoroughly impressed.\n\nI liked the suspense that the movie carried and all the twists it presented.\n\nHave you watched Carry-On? How did you like it?",

        "content": "me and my bf are from germany, currently in denmark, and suddenly none of our devices can log into our netflix account, nor request a login code. he is still logged in with his phone, but when i try with my phone, my ipad or my laptop it won't let me in. we double checked the password, it's correct - i tried logging in on the browser on my phone via mobile data and it worked there, but then i went over to the app as you can't watch netflix on the browser on mobile devices, and the app just refuses to log me in. i cleared all caches, reinstalled the app for the phone and tablet, restarted all devices, used my mobile hotspot from my phone for my laptop and tablet, we waited a day to see if this problem would resolve itself - nothing works. only thing left we have not tried is resetting the password on the one device we're still logged in with, but we're a little wary we will be kicked out of the account on his phone as well. very frustrating as we only subscribed to watch during our vacation. does anyone have any more ideas?
