The all time big question - will it be possible to have 2 devices on one wifi at my house and 2 devices on my sister's wifi in her house. She is married but it is possible for us to bring the 4 devices on the same network at least once a month. Will this work with the netflix household? Please any help is appreciated.",

        "title": "Inside Man - Grieff\u2019s Wife ",
        "content": "I might be a little late on this but after finally watching, here\u2019s my take: \n\nGrieffs wife may have walked in on him cheating. That line, \"If you love someone, don\u2019t come home early,\" feels like a major hint. In a fit of rage, she strangles his mistress. Grieff, out of love or guilt, decides to take the blame. Since he\u2019s a criminal psychology expert, he stages everything to make it look like he killed his wife in a moment of madness. She goes into hiding in the UK. \n\nIt seems like the police simply accepted Grieff\u2019s confession and didnt do any further investigating. All they focused on was finding the missing head - to bury her body whole. Grieff knows that if they were ever to find the head it would show that the woman they buried was not his wife ...\n\nFast forward to when Janice bumps into Beth on the train. Although she'd been the one to publicly stand up for Beth, she is very reluctant to chat further and refused multiple times to be interviewed. She also mentioned not having Facebook. She had a very \"loner\" attitude and didn't want to be in the public eye.  \n\nBeth then received the distress message from Janice and essentially starts the process of finding her \"friend\" with Grieff... after long debate. \n\nAlthough Grieff has insane resources at hand.. he seems to know just that little bit more about Janice as the investigation continues. He knew that she had a Skype call with her sister that she never misses... did he know that because he knew his wife would never abandon her sister... even if she was in hiding ...The matter of how he got that information before getting into her apartment is suspect. \n\nWhile Janice is trapped she is very strategic and understanding of her circumstances. Taking very tactical measures in attempt to escape... leading me to believe she has this knowledge from growing up with a mafia dad or (more likely) from being married to a criminal psychologist... she's not just a regular math tutor. \n\nAs we all know, the Vicars wife is killed and he is arrested. Him and Grieff are shown on a call together. The Vicar argues to Grieff that he is not a murderer and he did not murder anyone. To which Grieff replies.. \"Oh you didn't murder Janice - But if you hadn't have acted the way you did, would your wife still be alive?\" \n\nHe wants the Vicar to understand that it was solely his actions that resulted in someone's death.. just as his had resulted in the same. They're not so different after all. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the scene where Janice visits Grieff on death row. Their interaction feels... familiar, more than a mere acquaintance from the ordeal. \nDillon\u2019s grin when the guards leave the room shows that there is a mischievous atmosphere between them. \n\nWhen Janice says, \"I understand you'll be dead in a week,\" Grieff replies with, \n\"Do you? Personally, I'm having a little trouble with the fact of my execution.\" \nThe way he emphasizes \"fact of my\" feels like he\u2019s mocking her slightly. \n\nJanice explains why she\u2019s meeting with them - her husband's murder. Dillon says \n\"With all due respect, you do know your husband isn\u2019t actually dead.\" \nHis mannerisms seem like he's hinting towards an inside joke. \nJanice\u2019s response, \"No, but he deserves to be,\" obviously still holding on to a bit of cold blood and referring to his betrayal. \n\nShe asks him why he seems surprised at this.. \n\nGrieff then says, \"This is death row, Janice. We're all murderers here,\" and she grins knowingly... as, theoretically, there are 3 murderers in that room. \n\nIt feels like Janice, after being saved by her husband for a second time, and hearing that he will be executed in a week (because he refused to give up the head/real story), had a change of heart and wanted to plan how they could get away with his \"murder\" and ultimately break him out. \n\nAs for Janice\u2019s father, his involvement in shady stuff\u2014maybe CSAM\u2014 that might explain why Janice was so (annoyingly) triggered by what was on the flash drive.\n\nMaybe introducing an impulsive gangster of a father hints towards why she\u2019s a bit of a psychopath herself.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why Beth doesn\u2019t write the story... She knows the truth now and wants to protect her identity.\n\nAny thoughts? \n",

        "content": "Season one is possibly one of my favorite shows of all time. It was so engaging and intriguing and the characters felt authentic and well rounded the world building was interesting, and while I didn\u2019t like how they went to real people at the end, I was so excited for season two. \n\nSeason two, we start out extremely confused. It feels like season one was all for nothing, seeing as they are still in the game for some reason. Time passes, the characters keep doing the video game thing, but somethings off. Anyway, long story short, season two doesn\u2019t have the main characters in it at all. These are clones, perfect copies yes but they aren\u2019t the original MCs. The original characters are in the real world. I figured this out on episode three. Unlike with the original season one, I immediately knew what was going on pretty much from the get go. \n\nIesperately want to know what happened from there? But I guess we will never know seeing as it got canceled. Not surprised how bad that season was. I would\u2019ve loved it if we had gotten a take two almost. They are a team are they not? They would play hollow over and over again. I would\u2019ve loved to see the same three characters in a different  game of hollow. perhaps new sides of their characters and dynamics would show in different environments? Starting from scratch, no memories. Alternatively, I would\u2019ve loved to see how their lives continued in the real world after the game. Their relationships, etc, etc. What we got was so boring and low stakes in comparison.\n\n  \napparently, a lot of people loved it. So happy for you. I am not there, I don\u2019t think I will ever be there. please don\u2019t yell at me for having a different opinion.",

Netlflix thinks one device is permanently showing even though it's off. They're tying each account to a device. F that. Give me one more notification, I'm out. ",

I can't watch anything unless I do it. I don't mind paying \u00a35 extra this month as I have cancelled this membership slot so I won't be charged for the next month. What do I do?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m trying to find a specific song from *Dear Sa-chan* (Sacchan, Boku wa.) Episode 8, which aired in 2024. The track plays around the 11-minute mark, and I\u2019ve tried using Shazam to identify it, but no luck so far. Does anyone happen to know the name of this song or the artist?\n\nIt\u2019s really sticking with me, and I\u2019d love to add it to my playlist. I\u2019ve checked online, but so far, I haven\u2019t been able to find any details. If anyone has an idea or can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
