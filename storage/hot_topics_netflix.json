        "content": "So I\u2019m on vacation in the Caribbean with my girlfriend \u2014 we live together in CO, and like most people these days, we pay for the cheapest version of Netflix (with ads) because streaming\u2019s gotten outta control. Between all the different platforms, we keep it low tier just so we can still have access to most stuff.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re chilling on vacation, decide to throw on a movie, and go straight to Netflix \u2014 our usual go-to. And what do we get? A notification saying:\n\u201cYour subscription tier is not available in this region.\u201d\nSo\u2026 basically, we can\u2019t use Netflix at all.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 get this \u2014 it hits us with:\n\u201cYou can change your subscription [here]\u201d with a link to upgrade.\nLike that\u2019s gonna make me go \u201coh yeah sure, let me give Netflix more money just so I can use it on my vacation.\u201d Bro, be serious.\n\nI\u2019ve been paying for Netflix for years. I\u2019m not asking for a free ride \u2014 just some common sense. Would it really kill them to say:\n\u201cThis tier isn\u2019t available in your current region. You have 7 days of access while traveling \u2014 enjoy your vacation!\u201d\nGive me a little grace period. A little respect. I\u2019m not a new user. I\u2019m just out of town for a minute.\n\nSo what now? Am I supposed to pause or cancel my Netflix sub every time I leave the country? Is it even worth paying anymore if I\u2019m gone for part of the month? It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated.\n\nAnd this is why people are done with streaming services. They nickel-and-dime loyal users, and act surprised when people jump ship. It\u2019s like they want to lose us.\n\nNetflix \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 stop punishing your paying customers for traveling. It\u2019s not a good look. Especially when all we wanted to do was watch a damn movie on vacation.",

        "content": "I have the highest tiered plan, which literally allows 6 devices, shared between my parents on one TV, then myself, then my brother. I live a few cities over and my brother had to move to a different state, and we were able to stream no problem, but recently my brother and I can't watch it because it says we are not part of the household...? What's the point of paying for all these devices if we can't even use them? This isn't an issue on any other streaming service. Not being able to watch on more than 2 screens at one time is one thing that I can understand, I guess, but if you're literally paying for a plan that is laid out well to be shared, it's weird that we cannot actually share it. \n\nI'm also doubtful of \"adding an extra slot\", because while that sounds like it would alleviate the problem (unless it's just...another useless device) I refuse to give more money to Netflix and support the greed. Tbh I was willing to add the extra slot, but putting a tier on that too with ads/no-ads is just too far. \n\n\"Just Unsubscribe\" - I despise Netflix, and no longer use it, but my brother and parents still rely on it for streaming so while this isn't really my problem anymore, we won't be unsubscribing because my family is still enjoying it (regardless of me begging them to transition to another service, which we have already). I only know it does not work on my computer because my bro asked me to check what's up with Netflix rn. This doesn't change the fact that Netflix puts out sub-par cash grab originals (while cancelling/removing actually good content) behind the priciest plans, and it's even more frustrating that so many people are so tethered to Netflix that the company will never have a reason to decrease their prices.

        "content": "I was watching Netflix's *Medici* and was struck by how well they all spoke, especially Cosimo and Lorenzo (Daniel Sharman). They were calm, measured, sharp. They made their arguments so eloquently and effectively, it felt impossible to disagree with them without sounding irrational or malicious.\n\n\u201cWe were common merchants not long ago. What right do we have to withhold that right from others?\u201d Damn. I\u2019m not even a big fan of democracy, but that line? Perfectly put. And then his line to Clarice in season 2: \u201cWe serve God by aiding those in need, but we also serve Him by recognizing the beauty of the world He created.\u201d Hot damn.\n\nIf you haven't watched Medici, I strongly recommend it. The dialogues alone make it worth it.\n\nAnyway, curious as always, I started digging. Turns out they actually studied this stuff. **Rhetoric**. It was a formal subject back then... meant to teach persuasive speaking for oratory, court politics, negotiation, everything.\n\nWent deeper and found the classics. Aristotle\u2019s *Rhetoric*, Cicero\u2019s *The Orator*. Great stuff, but dense and full of references that are outdated by about two thousand years. Still, I\u2019ve been studying it seriously for a few months now and trying to apply it to my life. And it\u2019s already made a big difference, especially in my work where so much depends on influence and how you express ideas.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve been loving it. So I started a newsletter called *The Rhetorician...* just a passion project for now. The goal? To speak as eloquently and persuasively as Lorenzo.\n\nDropping the link in case anyone wants to check it out:  \n[therhetorician.co](https://therhetorician.co)\n\nLet me know what you think.",

        "content": "This movie\u2019s plot became absurd to be when the mom showed up to the daughter\u2019s school and spoke with the principal about getting a phone call.\n\nIf I saw someone 24 hours after their child died, wearing their work clothes, saying I called them when I didn\u2019t, I would be very alarmed and would not let that person leave without contacting a medical office or hospital.  She was clearly not it her right mind and no way a principal would shrug that off.  ",

        "content": "In episode one of the documentary high score on Netflix there\u2019s a song playing in the background at the 22:40 mark right when the narrator starts talking about the success of Pac-Man with the audience of American women. It sounds like an upbeat version of some original pac man intro or beat but I\u2019m blanking on whether it was an original song or something made by the folks in the documentary. Does anyone know where I can find an unedited and original version of this instrumental? Thanks!",
