        "content": "I\u2019ve always been a big\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0fan, so when Netflix announced the\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0series, I was super excited. I didn\u2019t expect it to be exactly like the old\u00a0Addams Family. I knew it would have its own twist, but it just feels\u00a0off.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t like the acting. It looks weird and unnatural, not in the charming, spooky\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0way, but in a \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel believable\u201d way. The makeup doesn\u2019t look good either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere, it makes the characters look kind of awkward.\n\nThe plot also feels too childish, like it\u2019s trying to be edgy but still ends up being a teen drama without much depth. The detective/thriller angle is actually a good idea in theory, but the execution feels\u2026 meh.\n\nIt\u2019s below the quality I usually expect from Netflix\u2019s big series, and it\u2019s disappointing because it\u00a0could\u00a0have been amazing.\n\nIs it just me? Or did anyone else go in with high hopes and come out feeling\u2026 meh?",

But it happened the way it did, so all the time spent planning the robbery ended up going to waste, I guess.\n\nAt the end, Leonardo Notarbartolo still insists that he wasn\u2019t the mastermind of the crime, but just one of the gang. What\u2019s your opinion on this? Was he really just following the gang\u2019s lead, or was he actually the one in charge? I still believe he\u2019s a genius for hiding the fact that he was the mastermind. \n\nWhat happened to Agim, the police officer, in 2015, when he was found in possession of illicit diamonds is truly devastating. I believe he fell in with the wrong crowd and got caught red-handed. I hope he\u2019s living a better life now.\n",

I\u2019m scared to turn Netflix off because I\u2019m afraid this won\u2019t happen again lol. I\u2019m in Alabama and my aunt is in NC but we have shared a Netflix account since as long as I can remember. ",
