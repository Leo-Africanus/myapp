I was aware of the household requirement in place for years, but I will watch shows at work for background noise during my planning/conference period at school using an Apple TV, which I use to share my computer screen to the projector. It now mandates I update my household to this location, which I won't do since it's not my home. It doesn't let me watch anything.\n\nThis is nuts. I get their concern with sharing, but there are better ways to verify identity, maybe using facial recognition or something similar. The concept that you can only ever use one IP address is ridiculous.\n\nAre there any workarounds? No option for a temporary code...\n\nI have done this for 5 years and never had a problem. No other apps have this issue.\n\nJust Netflix.\n\nIt's enough to make me consider cancellation.",

One of the girls changes her name and looks and also becomes an anchorwoman at the same place as the main character? She kills her own sister and turns into some sinister person.. Yawn. Lazy, horrible writing. I can go into much more but it\u2019s truly not worth it. \n\nJon Bernthal is great and gives it his best but even he can\u2019t really escape the again, horrible dialogue and plot. \n\nTessa Thompson is objectively horrible. Prior to this she was fine in other things. Not spectacular, not bad. She also is not given help with an awful plot and dialogue but god she was incredibly bad. So many scenes that were laughable and clearly a set of a show with soap opera type acting. \n\nTessa was not the actress to use in this show and well it shows. Nobody could\u2019ve done the story justice sure but she made it a lot worse. \n\nThe climax.. her mom with \u201cdementia\u201d ends up being the killer.. yawn yawn yawn. That whole final act was such a drag and so lame. So many obvious and dumb red herrings all the way across the series. \n\nI typically won\u2019t comment on something that I think is this bad but I\u2019m seeing so much love that I can\u2019t even wrap my head around. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you enjoyed this series, you are easy to please. ",

        "content": "Note to Netflix: there\u2019s not a series on Netflix I\u2019m looking forward to. I just finished stranger things 5. You cancelled lost in space, locke and key, the society, shadow and bone, Lockwood &amp; co, the OA, and ALL on cliff hangers. I\u2019ve heard about Kaos, but also learned that was also cancelled on a cliffhanger after one season.. so what\u2019s the point? If anyone has other recommendations, I\u2019m open to it. But not looking for another series that ends with no answers \n\nEdit: i forgot lost in space didn\u2019t end in a cliff hanger",
