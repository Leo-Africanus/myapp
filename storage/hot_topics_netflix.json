        "content": "OK, I know Amy Schumer can be a complicated figure, but she has done some decent work lately, including in the Hulu series Life and Beth -- not amazing or anything, but a mix of quiet humor and heartfelt plot lines. And movies like Trainwreck, while not great, still have had some merit. But my GOD -- Kinda Pregnant, which debuted today on Netflix, is fully unwatchable -- it's like a Z-grade Adam Sandler movie (and funnily enough, Adam Sandler's nephew, Tyler Spindel, directs this atrocity!), with a \"wild and wacky\" plot that is completely over the top and characters who are not in any way recognizably human. And Schumer actually co-wrote the script, so she can't blame this on bad writing. It is ATROCIOUS. Watched about 30 minutes and flipped it off, both literally and figuratively. Schumer really seems to be in a very bad place if this garbage is any indication.",
