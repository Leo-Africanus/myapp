Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

You's series finale I'm pretty sure is the worst rated episode of the series. And the switch-up towards Stranger Things? I haven't seen anything like this since Games of Thrones. Maybe the series finale can redeem its reputation but I'll be shocked if just 2 hours is enough for them to give a satisfying conclusion to every plot line (I'll still be watching though).\n\nThe only other show that ended this year and IMO had a satisfying ending was Alice in Borderland. But even then, season 3 wasn't really necessary and we could've ended with season 2 tbh.",

I love these characters, and to see them go through their emotional journeys together is exactly what I wanted.  And the performances are fantastic.  Caleb as Lucas was amazing.  Gaten as Dustin was so good, too.  They both wrecked me.  So excited for #8, got my ticket and am anxiously waiting.",
