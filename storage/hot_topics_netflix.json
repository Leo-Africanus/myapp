Stories that aren\u2019t just entertainment but actually make you think about how messed up the world can be. I know *Dopesick* and *Apple Cider Vinegar* fall into this category, but I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others out there.\n\nIdeally, I\u2019d like something available on Netflix, but if there\u2019s something really good on another platform, I\u2019d still be interested in hearing about it.

        "content": "Hey,\n\nI moved out of my parents' house a while ago, and now I was hit with the \"this device is not part of the household\" message on my TV.\n\nSince I'm the only one no longer living in that household, vs the three remaining members of my family, I was just going to add my own profile as a non-household member with extra payment. The problem is that I'm the account owner, the one who pays for it, and the one whose profile is set as the main profile. Because of this, it won't let me select my own profile to give access to from a different location, only the rest of my family members.\n\nI did some googling, and realized I likely only have the following options, neither of which are satisfying to me:\n\n\\- I make a new account using profile transfer, change email and payment info of the existing account to my parents' -&gt; not great, because then I'll have to pay more for my own account vs just adding the extra cost for one person, PLUS the cheapest option doesn't even come with good quality  \n\\- My family makes a new account for themselves using profile transfer -&gt; same issue where I end up paying more than with the extra member option  \n\\- I make a new profile for myself on the existing account which I add as the non-household member -&gt; I'll lose my viewing history doing this  \n\\- I make a new account, transfer my profile to it, transfer it back to the existing account as a non-household member, cancel the new account -&gt; very convoluted way of doing it, but possibly the best outcome?\n\nSo if anyone can tell me about another option (ideally how to change the main profile, though from my research so far I'm not very hopeful that's actually possible), that would be very much appreciated because I'm already paying half a fortune for this subscription and I'd very much like to actually *use it.*\n\nThanks!",
