I can never seem to find anything I want to watch or am interested in. Idk when it started but there was a time when basically every Netflix original I don\u2019t dare to watch because I already know it\u2019s going to let me down (except the Monster series like it ok.)\n\nI got a pretzel in my head due to simultaneously knowing that i should cancel and that i do have an attachment to the brand. Getting all the newest movies in the mail for me and the gang to watch was epic and being able to stream on my Xbox was epic in its own right. Does anybody feel similar?\n\nEdit: there has been some straight fire that I loved like All Quiet on the Western Front, Stranger Things, Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor and others. It\u2019s not all bad and i\u2019m for sure not shitting on netflix",

If not, im not interested in some murder porn fantasy that isnt made in good faith to the people who actually suffered that freak. ",

If she cared for anyone else portions would\u2019ve gone to the actual victims of her father. The truth of the matter is her dad was actually a pretty good dad to her to the point nobody believed he was a killer.  He was a horrible person, I\u2019m not downplaying that it had to be traumatic in some way. But the entitlement and woe is me is just so irritating every single scene was all herself. The victims barely got any attention. ",

That\u2019s lame.\u201d \n\nThen they show the night Anne was killed and we clearly see there are two different actors depicting that moment. So my next thought was\u2026\u201doh, and none of the passengers notice it\u2019s not the same person??\u201d So I rewound the movie to make sure they didnt cheat by using imposter Anne the whole time, to trick us, and only using two separate actors when they\u2019re depicted in the same room together. They didnt cheat! That\u2019s what was so neat, I didnt notice the swap either. Never crossed my mind. ",

        "content": "!!!Spoilers for both book and movie!!!\n\nI'm a huge fan of the book. If was one of the first that got me into the mystery/thriller genre.\n\nOverall, the movie was pretty good. I think that I would've enjoyed it way more if I hadn't read the book beforehand. The changes to the plot really bugged me\ud83d\ude05\n\n1. Lo's arc is completely different but I find her more likeable in the movie.\n2. I think the movie should've included the home invasion and Lo's inability to cope with it. In the book, Lo gets drunk the evening before witnessing the body being thrown overboard, which is a major reason why people don't believe her. She's implied to be in a mostly sober state in the movie, which makes the gaslighting from Bullmer and the crew much more obvious.\n3. The movie completely changes Carrie's character. The movie makes her very innocent and fragile. In the book, she's a very morally grey character - she's much more in on Bullmer's plan and is harsher with Lo. I liked her character way more in the book and felt like her personality was much more interesting.\n4. However, something that the movie did perfectly was capturing the unsettling, too-flawless, cold vibes of the boat. The scenery was gorgeous. They did a great job with the aesthetics.\n5. Didn't love the ending change. I would've kept the original ending of the book but didn't leave it as open ended.\n6. The evil doctor felt like an unnecessary character.\n7. I did love how the movie really humanized Anne.\n\nAnyways, that's my review :)\n",

        "title": "In defense of Monster: The Ed Gein Story",
        "content": "First some acknowledgements. Yes, art is subjective. No, not everyone needs to like the same things. Yes, you can understand something and still not like it. No, you don\u2019t misunderstand something because you don\u2019t like it. My goal isn\u2019t to convince you to like something you don\u2019t.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to address the low ratings and reviews/threads I\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhen I first saw each of these \u201cMonster\u201d shows I didn\u2019t know much about audience reception. I only tuned in because I knew there was some buzz, not what direction the buzz was in. While I did take some issues with each season, particularly with some indelicate clumsiness in handling some sensitive parts of the source material (the fractured records of real life,) I still thought each season was well crafted and doing something interesting with the stories.\n\nAfter watching Gein, I was surprised to see how disliked it was. Fine, I have enjoyed some low-quality pop garbage in the past, no shame in my game. \n\nBut then I looked at the discourse. I saw how many people were taking the narrative literally, and judging it as if it was attempting to portray itself as a literal face-value story\u2014smearing the people and events of history.\n\nBut the central conceit of this show is that history has already been smeared. Repeatedly, over the many decades since these events took place. It is a show that is about the way our culture has absorbed the wild growth of urban mythology that spawned, echoing far and long, from those deeply disturbing reports (and rumors) coming out of rural Wisconsin in a time that was ripe for macabre sensationalism. Not meant to tell us exactly what really happened there, but what we have made of it since then, and why. \n\nThere is little we know with concrete certainty about this case, largely because of the very unreliable perpetrator with severe disconnection from reality. And a pretty quick skim of the wiki for Gein will give you the broad strokes. But what we see in the show goes beyond what has been confirmed and supported by official channels of justice and government. We see the products of many years of assumption, speculation, rumor, embellishment and yes, artistic license.\n\nWe see this in the way that the show goes out of its way to stylize most of the story that is not part of the confirmed record. It treats these moments as a hybrid of diegetic hallucination (that may be happening to Ed as he fantasizes what he\u2019d like to do in the depths of his schizophrenic throes) and as a window into the assumptions society has made about the blanks in the official story and a raft of coinciding events that happened in the same general setting. \n\nIn much detail we see the reciprocal interplay between art that was made to reckon with, challenge, and exploit the remarkably fervent cultural reaction to this story and the figure that would eventually become a thing of nightmares; mythologized by our collective fears, biases, and morbid fascinations. I particularly enjoyed the anachronistic portrayal of iconic movie moments as a way of saying, \u2018he may or may not have done this thing but this is what *you/we* imagined, or even needed, him to be\u2019 for such and such reasons, depending on which iconography and from which era.\n\nOne could argue that the show, as written with its own artistic license, will lead people to believe falsehoods about history. That is valid, and evidently true. For me, it piqued my interest and got me to look up this pivotal bit of history I didn\u2019t know much about\u2026 \n\nI\u2019ll argue separately that one should never watch any one movie, show, or segment about any real life event and think they have the full picture. Even documentaries or journalism. One work can only contain so much information and perspective, and real life is often infinitely more complex and interconnected than any single story can capture.\n\nThere is also the risk of glorifying or undeservedly sympathizing with a murderer at the expense of real victims. Also valid. And if the show wasn\u2019t so explicitly camp and stylized about the moments that stretch the truth and make commentary on the perception of the character and actions of Gein, I\u2019d feel more wary than I do. (Just as an example; the end sequence that people see as glorification of a painted-as-sympathetic killer\u2014which I\u2019d argue was more a recognition of how this one tragic figure and the horrible things he had done had become this larger than life mythos that inarguably inspired and impacted so much of American culture in so many different ways, from copycat killers, to movies, to cultural discourse in all the years since.)\n\nI\u2019ll also argue that anyone should watch this show understanding that it is not a literal telling of (even explicitly fictionalized) historical events. Rather it is a show that is interested in, and cognizant of, the unique cultural position that the extant stories of this event have in the history of American society. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to enjoy the concept or its execution. But then, tell us the reasons you dislike it for what the show actually is, not what it\u2019s misunderstood to be.",

Like if the person is watching tv in the back, or just on the computer, they put the most ear-piercing static noise on. As if 2003 was seventy thousand years ago. As I write this, the noise still echoes in my ears like I got tinnitus. It\u2019s corny at this point. Just typical netflix corniness. Anyone else hates the overdone static aggression? ",

        "content": "Guys I have the above setup for a while now, the soundbar is connected to HDMI eARC from Q990F to TV\u2019s eARC original cable is used . The audio mode is \u201cAuto\u201d and not PCM, the pass through is grayed out as I have no external HDMI streamers.  I just usually play TV\u2019s native Netflix app and the problem I see, even movies with Dolby Atmos available on it shows up as 5.1 or sometimes spatial audio ( I don\u2019t have any apple device plugged in), and on the Soundbar\u2019s ! Sign it shows \u201c Dolby Multichannel PCM\u201d not Dolby Atmos.  What\u2019s causing this?? If I change the audio source on TV to TV speaker instead of Q990F eARC the same movie immediately shows Dolby Atmos on Netflix!! My friends have TCL and LG TVs where they don\u2019t have this issue, Dolby Atmos playing and visible in the ! LED screen Samsung to Samsung, what\u2019s going wrong with my setup?? Is it the Native Netflix app not able to identify Q990F as a an Atmos supported hardware? I tried a 100 tweaks from wild surfing to no avail:(\n\nHope someone sheds a light!",

        "title": "My thoughts on the show Monsters: Ed Gein",
        "content": "It seems as though people are clowning the show. They dislike it. I did not know who Ed Gein was until I watched the show. I understand it may not be accurate, okay. So I watched Monsters: the menendez brothers and dahmer, those were great, not amazing, but great. And I think when people talk about Ed Gein, they get mad and disappointed that it's not how they expected it to be. \n\nA part of me thinks this is because you have to consider that the director is trying to apply the show to a general mass audience, especially towards people who do not know who ed gein is. I do not know him. But can the negative people at least appreciate the cinematography? The acting? Like sure, ed gein does not sound like that, but do people not realize it's on purpose? Can you at least appreciate the effort that was put into the film? Can you appreciate the music? \n\nWhile it's not an accurate portrayal, one who know ed gein would know that you, as an audience member, can fill in the gaps with what you know to make your own story. That's the power of the imagination. The director needed to add scenes here and there for comedic effect, to make it interesting as well, to show there's texture. If you know already what Ed gein does, wouldn't it be boring to know everything that happened, as you're about to watch it unfold? Pretty boring, right? I would say so myself. \n\nI feel like people have such high expectations. And a lack of understanding and compassion for the director and the film crew. It's like some people find a negative thing and only focus on that while not addressing all of the positives. It's like everyone is a movie critic all of the sudden. \n\nI personally really enjoyed it. If they made one about Ted Bundy by the same director, and it wasn't accurate, I would still thoroughly enjoy it, especially the music and cinematography. I hate some people sometimes. I wish they understand. :/\n\nGreat show regardless! ",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Spoilers ahead. Why did Vince climb on Jake and demand the watch? This action just delayed the robbery, got Wes and Tony and Junior shot and simply made a simple con go wrong. Why was Jake not mad at Vince for doing this and doesnt even bring it up later? When Vince says Why did Wes step in to protect Jake doesnt ask him why he climbed on him and demanded the watch when they had the jewellery.\n\nMy partner said it was to make the robbery look realistic, but I dont think this is what they would have planned. Can someone share insights in to why they think this happened? Also how dysfunctional was their brotherly bond.....like why were they okay with each other despite bringing doom to each other over and over again.\n\nI think Junior and Vince were Mancuso's sons....",
