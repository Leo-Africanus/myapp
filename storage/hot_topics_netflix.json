        "content": "I went into Netflix\u2019s new dating show excited because of the premise, but also because I\u2019d been following Logan for a while on social media. She seemed like an accomplished researcher, author and advisor to companies like Hinge which is so cool. I\u2019ve also heard some of her original sound bites on dating that seemed mostly decent. \n\nHowever I was a bit let down by her appearance on the show. First of all, I felt she had very little personality. She came off as quite meek, and bland, and if anything, the participants facilitated the scenes and kept things energized. \n\nI also felt like her coaching moments were a mixed watch - some were insightful and effective, but others were lacking, and others came off as even a bit abrasive. \nFor example, there were many dates that went relatively well and had good potential, but the participant wrote it off quickly. This isn\u2019t uncommon in modern dating. But as a coach, Logan just agreed with the dater, rather than maybe challenging them to try one more - and I think this caused some people to lose out on connections that could have developed a bit more time. \nOr another example - she tore into the lady with the big glasses - attacking her glasses choice and also telling her that her personality is too big. IMO Logan, as a coach, could have more gently engaged with the lady, rather than potentially making her self-conscious and feel put-down. It also just seemed odd to me to target her fashion choice, when the woman clearly puts in soooo much effort and presents herself thoughtfully. It\u2019s not like on Queer Eye when a makeover is part of the deal.\n\nI think Logan is a smart lady! But I think she might be better suited for research\u2026or for consulting on a show like this - with someone more charismatic in the spotlight (this is national tv after all).\n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts?\n",

Him then being taken to a hotel as if that woman wasn\u2019t also part of it (so obvious). The ending felt rushed. Like the whole thing just got-bizarro. I did however feel like it was creepy because of the fact that AI can morph into this all knowing/controlling thing which I think is very real and we are clearly heading in that direction, if not there already.

But I\u2019ve noticed that the \u2018feel good with the fake obsticals to overcome\u2019 style is irritating me. \n\nFor example a house make over show that pretends there is a storm coming and they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll finish, while in reality there is no storm it\u2019s just editing, that combining with a lot of dramatic and over the top editing and personalities is tiring to me.\n\nI saw a show called Motel Makeover or something that was less of what I described above so I enjoyed that very much, they didn\u2019t pretend to have problems all there problems were pretty real and the brushed over it pretty quickly. Also I didn\u2019t like the final table because it felt rigged at the end and too dramatic. But food related content is also up my alley!\n\nEdit: Love all the suggestions please keep them coming so I have a list!!",

Literally everyone\u2019s characteristics in this series are the same. The character designs are sooo bland. I can\u2019t sit through 9 hours of very slow burn screenplay to get the \u2018AHHHHH\u2019 moment in the 10th episode. I usually like \u2018mind-melting\u2019 series which makes me think more. Idk what\u2019s happening with this one. Should i continue it and give it a shot?",
