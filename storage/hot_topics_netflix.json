Well now that I'm older, and I also have a better relationship with my dad, I've learned that I'm allowed to watch/listen to/read the same things he does and like it and it doesn't have to mean anything. \n\nI'm biting the bullet. I saw a reel the other day on Instagram with some dude from the show, played by Giancarlo Esposito, walking out of a room with HALF HIS FACE GONE??? And I was like DAMN! Apparently he knocks his role out of the park and I do love the guy. \n\nSo, am I in trouble? Is it really a great show? Will I find myself sucked in? Be honest lol I wanna know how bad I'm about to fixate on this shit. I wanna know how dynamic and bingeable it is. ",

It\u2019s got me curious about what actually drives those compensation levels - is it the scale, the technical complexity, the culture, or something else entirely?\n\nI realize complexity probably varies wildly between teams at Netflix, so maybe this is impossible to answer broadly. But I guess what I\u2019m really wondering is: do I have what it takes to work there?\n\nI don\u2019t consider myself anything special - just a solid software engineer who enjoys problem-solving. But when I see those salary numbers, I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s a whole different level of engineering happening that I\u2019m not exposed to in my current role.\n\nHas anyone made a similar transition from traditional enterprise development to a company like Netflix?

        "content": "Seems like that Norwegian Chick got lots upon lost of rap and support, so she along with that fat ass friend (detective) got to script a revenge mediocre plot to earn some money... I am really surprised someone has ever bought into producing that shit...\n\nWant a proof? \"Show me one single copy of an arrest warrant or a Court Order\"... NONE\n\nHere are some notes for the idiot that wrote the script:\n\n\\- When police arrest someone they read him/her their Miranda Rights\n\n\\- They never sit them in the front of the car\n\n\\- They use cuffs, not chains\n\n\\- Any processing across the state line has to be done through the FBI or US Marshals\n\nMen get scammed too, so let's get over the Tinder Swindler which got all those Gold Diggers exposed, it is a well known fact :)",
