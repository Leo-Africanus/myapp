        "content": "Let\u2019s unpack some of the things that are extremely wrong with Lily Bloom\u2019s character and why she not attracts but literally draws out / creates violence for herself. Before you get triggered and mistaken this as victim blaming, note that I am a liberal, passionate feminist, and feel there is zero tolerance for violence. End of the day if a woman is a lying sack of cute cryptic the man can just walk away and avoid violence. But how can we as women be more aware?\n\nHere are flaws with Lily Bloom\u2019s character (that are an excellent example of reality) \n\n1) \u201cNo\u201d doesn\u2019t mean no. \n\nThey show us that early in the relationship she missed the signs because he was violent with the chair as if that was the key red flag. \n\nNo. The seed for their problem dynamic starts when she plays around with \u201cno\u201d in the party. \n\nIt feels like the way her dazzling life and style is glorified romanticizes some of those behaviors like the drama of lying being cryptic and using \u201cno\u201d as a toy. \u2014 We as women are conditioned (even by this movie) to think this mystery pretty girly elusive act is cute say no and tease make him work for it. If you say yes they will use you and dump you but if you say no they will eventually marry you. This plants a toxic dynamic. \n\n- the stairs issue, give the person running away space. This culture of wanting to be followed when you storm out of a room creates broken boundaries. Ideally when someone storms give them space to think and breathe. \n\n2) Lack of honesty, being cryptic, lyung by omisi\u00f3n - lacking transparency \nRoles reversed her behavior would bring the crazy out in any woman. It creates mistrust when there is no full clear explanation. \n\nHealthy correct thing to do:\n- Introduce atlas to Ryle after recognizing him. \nBut it\u2019s understandable if it was a shock and wasn\u2019t ready. \u2014 so then she could have cleared the air and told him after they left. \n\nIt is a duty to our partners to be honest and transparent about this type of thing. Lies take ugly roots. \n\n- when asked about the tattoo. HONESTY should have said it was from first love. Period. It\u2019s not a big deal unless you lie about it. The lying makes monsters of the most normal healthy people.  \n\n- when asked about if she still loved Atlas. HONESTY. If you genuinely don\u2019t know - sit and practice some self awareness so you can know. I\u2019m feeling many feelings right now but let\u2019s get back to this. Then actually do. It is absolutely natural to have a special place for someone for the rest of your life if it was real. \n\n\nI appreciate the ending where she stuck to saying no and sticking to that decision. \n\nBUT it\u2019s so important to also take with us the awareness of ways that lying plays a role. And the lack of a backbone and boundaries. Should have never kept that number in battery. So disrespectful. Make it a contact if you must but the F is this drama behavior. As we waltz around with no self awareness this draws the worst out of people who otherwise maybe wouldn\u2019t have been violent. ",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m trying to track down a Japanese film I watched on Netflix around 2010-2011. I\u2019m sure it was a sex film. Not sexual scenes but scenes with full blast sex. The movie had explicit sex scenes, comedic elements, and was definitely in the adult or niche section of Netflix at the time.\n\nSome details I remember:\n\t\u2022\tThe film featured actual sex scenes (not just sexual content, but actual explicit scenes) of a young woman and an old man where he feels her up on and begins to try and have sex with her, he tries to penetrate her but she keeps blowing him until he finishes to prevent him from wanting to feel like finishing in her or whatever. \n\t\u2022\tIt had a comedic tone, not taking itself seriously.\n\t\u2022\tThere were scenes involving bugs being used in fights or some bizarre concept along those lines.\n\t\u2022\tAt one point, the suns face turned to the face of one Japanese dude in the film and started talking to him.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the word \u201csex\u201d was in the title, but it\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t recall the exact name. Has anyone seen a film with these themes from that era? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "So I tried watching breaking bad on the Netflix app on windows. But the audio just did was just static thumping. I then went to watch it on my browser and it worked perfectly fine. \n\nThe issue only seemed to come up with programs with spatial audio. I am using a DAC with optical input and this issue has not come up before. My other ports seem to also just be working fine. So I'm not sure if the issue was just with the app itself or something else",

        "content": "Netflix 4k, 3 body problem in 4k, dolby vision+atmos. 2Mbps. NOT MBps...\n\nNetflix 4k, kung fu panda in 4k, dolby vision+atmos, 5Mbps\n\nApple tv plus, for all mankind in 4k, dolby vision+atmos, 30mbps \n\nThere was nothing else going on on the network. I paused several times to confirm and the download speed went away (it's only my phone and pc on the network and neither was doing anything). It says outbound because of the interface I selected, but it's download. I started the show (burst of download for the buffer) and then let it stabilize for 2 minutes. \n\nHow can netflix get away with a 6-15 TIMES WORSE bitrate than apple tv? I knew their bitrate is shitty, but this is crazy bad. Apple tv shows look great, on Netflix I can see color banding and lack of detail from 3m away... Such a shitty service - and that's their highest tier too. It sucks so much that such cool looking content is completely destroyed by a shitty low bitrate streaming service. ",

For example, his body\u2019s reaction to being away from snow is textbook withdrawal.\u00a0Would love to know if others noticed this!\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: The title \u201cHot Frosty\u201d is obviously an oxymoron.
