Yeah, no. Buhbye. Nailed the coffin shut.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this show was early to a very specific vibe that\u2019s everywhere now. Dark but cozy, absurd but oddly wholesome. Violent things happening while people argue about mundane nonsense. Basically existential dread with popcorn.\n\nShows like Ghosts are carrying that torch. Dead people. Ridiculous problems. Jokes that are dumb, sharp and self-aware at the same time. The kind of humor that doesn\u2019t try too hard but still sneaks up and punches you in the face. Politely.\n\nI\u2019m convinced this genre works because most of us are tired, mildly unhinged and coping through irony. We don\u2019t want prestige misery. We want chaos that knows it\u2019s chaos. We want death jokes that somehow feel comforting.\n\nAnyway, RIP Santa Clarita Diet. Gone too soon.\n\nTaken from us mid-bite.\n\nNetflix, I forgive a lot, but I will never forgive you for this one. If ever I get bitten, you know who I\u2019m coming for",

I can let things go, but the one that really bothered me was WHY WOULD ANNA BE MARRIED TO THE BROTHER OF A GIRL WHO WATCHED AND LAUGHED WHILE SHE GOT RAPED??\n\nSure, Jack was flawed, but an overall good man who loved Anna and definitely went out of his way to protect her, but still, you\u2019d think she\u2019d stay far away from those girls and anyone related to them, let alone marry a sibling. Those girls were just plain evil. And they didn\u2019t even have any remorse. Helen making a comment about her dead child? Zoe giving her the finger and telling her to stop holding a grudge??\n\nI wish there had been some backstory of how she and Jack got together. Anything that would explain how she could possibly be content with Zoe being his sister-in-law. I thought maybe she fell in love with Jack before she knew Zoe was his sister? Or maybe she started dating Jack so she could keep Zoe close and somehow get revenge \u2026 but then accidentally fell for him?? Idk. At least some kind of explanation. \n\nAnyway, that is all. ",

        "title": "The Rip was Underwhelming",
        "content": "Right out of the gate, this movie boasts an all star cast. Honestly, it\u2019s almost shocking how stacked it is. And then there\u2019s Kyle Chandler, who was wildly underutilized. He\u2019s a phenomenal actor, yet he\u2019s given what feels like a blink and you miss it role. He easily could\u2019ve carried the entire film, so that choice is baffling. And let\u2019s talk about Steven Yeun. Half the reason I didn\u2019t turn this movie off was just to see what this man is doing with his life. Without his presence, I probably would\u2019ve shut it off entirely.\n\nThe sets were another letdown. For a production with this level of talent and budget, the locations felt lazy and uninspired. Spending the majority of the film in what looks like a random old house just doesn\u2019t cut it. When everyone involved is this famous, surely there were better, more imaginative options available. Please film somewhere that actually looks REAL! Make me believe! I just hate a movie that cannot be at-least somewhat realistic.\n\nOverall, it feels like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck need to seriously reevaluate who they\u2019re collaborating with. Everyone around them can\u2019t possibly be worth a fortune if this is the end result. There have to be smarter, more creative writers and set designers and location scouts out there. This was especially disappointing coming from two absolute legends of the industry. At this point, it almost feels like a full reset might be the best move.",

It doesn\u2019t seem like that was a commuter friendly town as everyone else drove except her and her timing for being everywhere was impeccable.

The point is: I hear the books are actually great and get butchered by adaptations. I just want to ask: is that true? I mean, are the books better? And if so, how?\n\nSpecifically, these are the adaptations I've watched so far and my opinions on them\n\n\\-You fool me once, british show. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, there were some stretches in logic, a couple plot holes and a few storylines that ended up not leading anywhere, but overall, it was pretty good and engaging\n\n\\-Caught, spanish show. I was pretty mixed on this one. Even more unresolved storylines, the mystery was not nearly as engaging, plus I think the main character is one of the most annoying main characters ever and I was actually rooting for the villain to kill her in the final episode.\n\n\\-The woods, polish show. This one I did not like. Pretty much all the characters are boring, pretty much all the storylines are pointless, the mystery is not that interesting and the answers we get aren't really worth the wait.\n\n  \nSo, if you have read the books those shows are based on, are they better?And what do they do that makes them better? Honestly, my main issue with all three shows is the overblown amount of characters and storylines, which results in most of them being underdeveloped. Is that problem present in the books or is it done better?\n\nIf you know, please tell me. Thank you for your time.",

They could've found 30 million, stolen 10 million, and said they found 20,650,480 and delivered that. There isn't anyone else who was there, the money was transported by them with no oversight, there is literally zero reason to believe them!\n\nIn fact if a bunch of people in a high stress situation under gunfire count as accurately as machines, thats a major red flag !!\n\nI think in reality they did get away with stealing a ton of money! what they did was simple \n\n- take the pile of marked cash which is trivial to total up\n- set aside say half of it, and remove the labels\n- keep all the unmarked money and the other half for themselves\n- then add $650,480 by hand to make it not look like a nice round figure\n- the girls stop off at their house, unload their share and deliver the rest.\n\nalso, there is no way the govt ever gives anything to Desi. She'd be thrown in jail as accessory or at best cheated out of her share. This whole 'look how honest they are' is complete bs.",

        "content": "I was working, not paying much attention but a trailer popped up on netflix about an ex wife going to the new fiances home. She said she just needed 5 minutes of her time. The fiance put her hand on the doorframe, showing off her painted nails. The ex wife looked shocked and said \"he lets you paint your nails?\" And that stood out to me. I was on the phone with a client and several trailers past and now its not on mh account anymore. I tried google, chatgpt, phone-a-friend and im starting to feel crazy. In the trailer it was at night in what looked like a suburb. Both women had american accents, i believe the ex wife was brunette and the fiance was a redhead. Thanks in advance!",
