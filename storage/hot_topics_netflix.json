        "content": "My main 3 streaming services are HBO, Hulu and Netflix(and YouTube premium, but that's a whole different beast), but I've used others before. I'm not talking about the content on these services or how any company manages their original content, etc. This is specifically about the UI and user experience\n\nWhen I boot up Netflix, it's always snappy, it's always easy to find what shows I've been watching and continue, the app lets me go to a series page BEFORE loading an episode, it's the best about knowing I want to restart a movie/show when the progress bar is near the end, the \"are you still watching?\" prompt is actually consistent. Nearly all of this stuff is either worse or non-existent on the other streaming services I use. Hulu makes me jump through hoops to get to a series page. HBO Max will throw up huge show banner ads I have to scroll through before I can start looking at my library\n\nMaybe there's other streaming services that compete with Netflix more in this regard, but it's something that's really been bothering me lately. If I'm bored and don't know what to watch, I'll boot up Netflix 95% of the time because browsing it feels good compared to my other options.\n\nDoes anyone else here share this opinion? I've tried googling it, but all the Reddit posts are complaining about what shows are available or just complaining about streaming in general",

Guillermo del Toro once again has proven he\u2019s the best director for the dark fantasy genre of our generation. Highly recommend this film. Loved the acting of Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz and Jacob Elordi. excellent casting as well. I can see this even getting some Oscar nominations. 5/5 for me. ",

I think they really were driving her crazy. I\u2019m empathetic to her because When I was pregnant and postpartum, I lived in an apartment that had really bad noise insulation and I literally lost my mind. Because I had different noises from every direction and kids were screaming outside all the time right outside my window. It was crazy and I had intrusive thoughts about shooting up to my neighbor. Postpartum is a really odd time so just know you could never understand it if you haven\u2019t been through it. I never had any plan to do it, it was an intrusive thought that would come into my brain that I didn\u2019t want there. But I really lost my mind from lack of sleep from the noise and lack of peace. Does anyone else feel for her? Maybe something else happens later on that I haven\u2019t seen yet that will change my mind.",

I hate watching episodes like this because it always makes me think the writers are sexual predators. Like this is not a real story, some poor professor is super innocent and all these young girls keep throwing themselves at him and his life gets ruined because someone takes revenge. This is the myth that predators hide behind.\n\nThis is the exact plot of Promising Young Woman in reverse, that also came out in 2020. When I was watching it, I thought Soulmates was recent so I was shocked. But knowing it\u2019s from 2020 too makes more sense, I don\u2019t think it would have been produced in a post-Promising Young Woman world. ",

It goes deep into Henry\u2019s backstory, his disappearance after the Season 4 events, and how his connection to the Upside Down is tied to Hawkins in ways we never imagined.\n\nThe craziest twist? Karen Wheeler (Mike\u2019s mom) is revealed to be Henry Creel\u2019s cousin on his mother\u2019s side. That small family link suddenly explains why the Wheelers have always been subtly connected to everything weird in Hawkins \u2014 and this season, the focus really shifts to them. It\u2019s practically a Wheeler family arc from here on out.\n\nMike and Nancy both uncover the truth about their family\u2019s connection to the Upside Down, and for the first time, Mr. Wheeler actually steps up. You\u2019ll finally see him in action \u2014 not just sitting in his chair, but actively involved in the fight. Apparently, he has one of the most surprising character moments in the whole show.\n\nNow for the heavy part \u2014 there are some huge deaths this season:\n\nErica, Max, and Will don\u2019t make it through. Each of their deaths plays a key emotional and story-driven role, pushing Eleven and the others toward their final confrontation.\n\nVecna is destroyed by Eleven, in a massive showdown that\u2019s described as one of the most cinematic moments the show\u2019s ever done.\n\nBut right after Vecna\u2019s defeat, the Mind Flayer reawakens, pulls everyone back into its shadow world, and then goes back into a kind of deep sleep \u2014 leaving Hawkins completely changed.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not revealing everything. There\u2019s one major detail I\u2019ve intentionally left out \u2014 something BIG happens at the end.\n\nJust wait till the end of this month you\u2019ll see what I mean.",

What really stuck with me wasn\u2019t just the story, but how real the underlying themes felt. The hacking, the data breaches, the constant sense that someone\u2019s always watching it all got under my skin. I ended up going down a massive rabbit hole learning about cybersecurity, privacy tools, and how vulnerable most people really are online.\n\nNow I actually use different VPNs depending on what I\u2019m doing, run privacy tools to wipe old data, and even started monitoring data leaks with cloaked just to see how often our information ends up exposed.

        "content": "My internet connection is normally rock solid. 100/10 Mbps. I have no issues with YouTube, Peacock, or any other service. But Netflix, the OG of movie streaming, has to constantly have loading/buffering issues. Surely I'm not the only one? And no, my ISP does not throttle. \n\nI just want to watch my KPop Demon Hunters. \ud83d\ude2d",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been having ongoing issues with Netflix showing the message: \u201cThis device isn\u2019t part of your household.\u201d\nMy household and I are the only ones using our devices, but this message keeps coming up. I have several Apple TVs, and some are on different internet providers (for example, at a cabin or secondary location). On Apple TV, it doesn\u2019t even give me the option to send a code \u2014 it only lets me \u201cswitch households\u201d or \u201cupdate the household,\u201d depending on the language.\nHas anyone else run into this or found a fix? I\u2019m starting to think something\u2019s messed up with how Netflix is detecting my devices. Any troubleshooting tips or settings I can try before I give up and cancel would be appreciated.\n",
