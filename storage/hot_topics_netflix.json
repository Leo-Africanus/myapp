        "content": "I just finished the last episode, and I believe the show was intended to be more of a social commentary, almost borderline satire. I didn\u2019t hate it but didn\u2019t love it either. At first I was getting annoyed by the clear inaccuracies, or embellishments and what seemed like lazy writing. It feels more like the show was designed to critique modern fascination with blood lust, and the twisting of stories by the media, authors, writers, movies, etc. for entertainment. The girlfriend seemed more like a schizophrenic hallucination or possibly a symbol of a textbook female lover in a horror story. She didnt feel like a real character. Her dialogue was off, she was inconsistent, and unrealistic. I think that was the point. They didn\u2019t want to spell the underlying message out for the viewers. \n\nNow with all that said, I wish they didn\u2019t go about it this way. This show had real potential to be great. It was shot well, the music was good, good actors, interesting dialogue at times, the real story was crazy enough. But there were many scenes that were forced in there with no significance. Pulling you out of the story and into one of Ryan Murphy\u2019s strange fantasies. Also the title is misleading, the title \u201cThe Ed Gein Story\u201d gives the impression this is a somewhat accurate representation of the actual Ed Gein Story. It is far from that. While i finished the show, i lost interest halfway through episode 6. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Watch Mindhunter or American Primeval instead lol. \n",

        "title": "Halo on Netflix",
        "content": "First, I\u2019d like to say there have been far too many shows canceled\u2014not because they were bad, but because they were either poorly marketed or not well produced. And trust me, I\u2019ve watched plenty of discontinued shows in my life that deserved a second chance.\n\nWe often talk about books\u2014some people read them, others don\u2019t. But think about Game of Thrones and the impact it had once it became a TV series. Now, we\u2019re seeing something similar with Halo.\n\nUnlike Game of Thrones, Halo began as a video game\u2014one with a rich, well-written story, deep characters, and an expansive universe. It\u2019s unfortunate that the show was discontinued, but with the right creative vision and marketing\u2014especially now that it\u2019s on Netflix\u2014it has the potential to be reimagined into something incredible.\n\nSo, to get things moving toward a potential Season 3, the first two seasons need to attract strong viewership numbers. That\u2019s the key factor studios will look at before making any decisions. Ultimately, it all comes down to marketing\u2014not just the fact that it\u2019s now on Netflix, but how it\u2019s promoted and presented to draw in both longtime fans and new audiences.\n\nThe real test lies in how future seasons are produced and promoted. That\u2019s what will either bring Halo back to life or cause it to fade away. The story itself is already solid; it all depends on how the storyteller chooses to tell it.\n\nHalo has one of the most cinematic and emotionally layered storylines in gaming\u2014packed with lore, complex characters, and massive world-building potential. The original TV adaptation didn\u2019t fail because of the source material; it struggled due to uneven pacing, inconsistent tone, and marketing that didn\u2019t capture what made the games special.\n\nNow that it\u2019s on Netflix, the opportunity is huge. Netflix knows how to build global hype and reach audiences at scale. If they focus on storytelling first\u2014treat Halo with the same level of seriousness as Game of Thrones or The Last of Us\u2014and back it with smart, emotional marketing, Halo could easily become a breakout hit.\n\nIn short:\nThe story\u2019s there.\nThe fan base is there.\nThe potential is there.\nIt just needs the right storyteller and direction to bring it to life.\n\nThe humanity of the story is there. The Halo universe is massive enough to keep viewers fully immersed. The visuals already capture grounded realism. What\u2019s needed now is a simplified plot, stronger character focus, and refined storytelling that stays true to the heart of the game\u2019s lore.\n\nIf Netflix follows those steps\u2014focusing on storytelling, authenticity, and emotional depth\u2014Halo could genuinely become the next Game of Thrones for sci-fi fans.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Current Situation\n\t\u2022\tHalo has completed two seasons.\n\t\u2022\tThe series was canceled by Paramount+ in mid-2024.\n\t\u2022\tNetflix has picked up Seasons 1 &amp; 2 for streaming, giving it a much wider audience.\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s renewed fan interest and a growing buzz now that it\u2019s on Netflix.\n\t\u2022\tHowever, there\u2019s still no official confirmation that Season 3 will be greenlit.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2699\ufe0f What Needs to Happen for Season 3 to Take Off\n\t1.\tData &amp; Viewership: Netflix will monitor performance metrics like viewership, watch time, and retention. Strong numbers will strengthen the case for renewal.\n\t2.\tRights &amp; Deals: Since the show originated from Paramount+, negotiations over rights, funding, and cast contracts would need to be resolved.\n\t3.\tBudget &amp; Cost Control: Sci-fi is expensive. Season 3 must balance spectacle with storytelling efficiency.\n\t4.\tCreative Direction: A unified vision is essential. Addressing past criticisms\u2014like pacing and lore accuracy\u2014will help regain fan trust.\n\t5.\tMarketing &amp; Messaging: A fresh campaign should highlight the emotional and epic scale of the story, while promising resolution to lingering threads like The Flood and Installation 04.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udded Story Directions for Season 3\n\nIf Season 3 moves forward, it should build on what\u2019s been established while setting up the long-term arc of the Halo universe.\n\nMajor story threads to carry forward:\n\t\u2022\tThe Flood has been introduced\u2014this should become the central threat.\n\t\u2022\tThe Halo ring (Installation 04) must now take center stage, with its mysteries and dangers explored.\n\t\u2022\tThe moral and emotional journey of John-117 and his bond with Cortana should remain at the heart of the story.\n\t\u2022\tGrowing tension within the UNSC and ONI, with political and ethical dilemmas that challenge every character.\n\t\u2022\tThe Covenant\u2019s internal conflicts, adding new layers of intrigue and perspective.\n\nWith the right production, storytelling focus, and creative leadership, Halo has the potential to span 8\u201310 successful seasons\u2014a true sci-fi epic that could redefine video game adaptations for television.",

        "content": "Alice in Borderland has some... pretty crazy plot armor. ESPECIALLY in season 2 episode 7, where we had Heiya straight up take a full mag of a machine gun and survive HOURS later (while funnily enough, Ann \"died\" from two shots).\n\nNiragi was by far the craziest example. Dude got lit on fire, fell off the building into the pool, tackled into a burning building, was coughing up blood all of seaosn 2 and then took a shotgun blast, ALL of which he survived.\n\nWhat I love so much is that the show ACTUALLY has an explination for such insane plot armor; the will to live. The Borderland's are a test of how much each character wants to survive (the games). The stronger your will, the more likely you are to live. That's why someone like Heiya can take so much punishment, because she's made it clear she does NOT intend to die\n\nIt makes moments when you're on rewatch hit different, like when Usagi tells Arisu in episode 2 \"I know I'll do anything to stay alive\".",

        "content": "First off, all of these girls are much more talented than 99% of people in the world. They are the most talented of the talented, and would completely blow average joe or sue out of the water in terms of musical ability. So when I am criticizing these girls, i'm criticizing them relative to other girls on the show.\n\n**Brooklyn:**\u00a0Brooklyn always seemed out of place compared to the other girls. She was like a cross country runner in a room full of sprinters, she just seemed like she didn't belong. That doesn't mean she was untalented, it just meant that she didn't fit the overall vibe compared to other girls. I think that's a big reason why she was eliminated so early.\n\n**Iliya**: She was similar to Brooklyn in that she seemed like a cross country runner trying to be a sprinter, meaning she seemed out of place compared to the other girls. There's no doubt that Iliya is a talented singer, but she doesn't fit the k-pop vibe. I feel like she'd have been a more successful solo artist instead.\n\n**Emily:**\u00a0Emily has a very distinctive look about her. Her face is distinctive looking but not in an unappealing sort of way. No doubt, she is a very talented dancer and was easily the best out of the entire group. I could see her becoming a very good backup dancer somewhere.\n\n**Karlee:**\u00a0I think she was eliminated simply because she's a step or two lower compared to other girls. She didn't stand out as being attractive, didn't stand out as being a really good dancer, or stand out as being a really good singer. There were girls who were simply better looking and more talented compared to her across all aspects. Her chances of making the final squad were going to be low.\n\n**Lexi:**\u00a0Lexi had such a cute and innocent looking face and demeanor about her. Her face is quite cute and neotenous and when combined with her soft spoken personality, this made her stand out in terms of charisma and star power. While not a top singer or top dancer, she was good enough to not look completely out of place. If she'd have never left, she probably would have made the team.\n\n**Hinari:**\u00a0I didn't see anything wrong with Hinari but I think she was a little bit too young. If she'd have been a couple years older, she may have had a better chance of making it.\n\nThat's everyone who stood out to me.\n\n",

        "title": "Catch Me If You Can, would a Frank Abagnale style con work today or would tech stop it?",
        "content": "Just finished rewatching Catch Me If You Can and I keep getting stuck on how much of Abagnale\u2019s success relied on people trusting a confident story and paper records. He forges checks, pretends to be pilots and doctors, and basically wins on smooth talk, timing, and exploiting gaps in how institutions verified things back then. Looking at 2025, there are two clear directions. Modern banks, airlines, and employers have more automation, KYC checks, instant database lookups, and cross-referenced ID services that can flag fakes in seconds. A fake resume or a paper letter seems much harder to use to fool those systems. Digital trails and audit logs make it easier to trace and stop suspicious activity.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a huge amount of real personal data out there from breaches and data brokers, and that can be stitched together to build very believable identities ( I myself try and remove and monitor these with privacy apps like Cloaked). Deepfakes and AI can clone voices or make convincing video snippets. Human trust is still a major vulnerability: social engineering works because people rush, want to help, or assume an authority figure is legitimate. A modern operator could combine old-school charm with new tech  build an online persona first, then use carefully timed phone or in-person moves to close the deal. Some targets would be harder today and others are still shockingly soft. Big finance, enterprise HR, and major airlines are much tighter. Small hospitals, local businesses, and customer-support teams at smaller services often rely on phone calls and quick checks, which feels like low-hanging fruit. Logistics and delivery systems can also be manipulated if you know the right touchpoints.\n\nMy mental image of a 2025 Abagnale is someone who layers things: scraped data to bootstrap a backstory, polished social media and LinkedIn history, AI-generated voice clips for cold calls, and then a confident in-person moment where people fill in the blanks. Or it could be less theatrical and more distributed: exploit gaps in onboarding flows, trick CS systems, and collect many small wins across dozens of targets instead of one big caper.  \nWould a charismatic impersonator still pull it off today, or has tech made that kind of con obsolete? If someone tried something like this now, where would you expect them to succeed first and where would modern verification stop them quickly? Any examples of modern scams that felt like a Catch Me If You Can remake but for the internet age?",

How did he convince Usagi to go back to the Borderland? The show never explains. We\u2019re told he promised she\u2019d see her father again, but she already had that chance and didn\u2019t see him. Why believe him this time? The scene where she \u201csees\u201d her father was just a dream, not real. Usagi went from being strong and smart to acting without logic.\n\nAlice\u2019s return makes no sense either. A citizen supposedly planned it all, but how does killing Alice\u2019s pregnant wife make him want to stay? It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nThe new characters are useless. None of them have depth or backstory. The only one who seemed interesting, the yakuza, dies in a weak way, and we never learn his past. Meanwhile, Usagi keeps playing random games without any real reason or goal.\n\nThe pacing is terrible. There are too few episodes, so everything feels rushed. The final game is especially bad. The characters make dumb choices, and logic disappears. Alice literally saw a vision where the man in the wheelchair killed his wife, yet he still trusted him. The old characters show up for a few seconds, just for fan service, and then vanish again.\n\nTo fix it, the story should have started with the earthquake idea. That could have naturally brought Alice and the others back. They could even show the earthquake causing a massive tsunami that hits Los Angeles, setting up a new storyline.\n\nUsagi could have met her father in a game where he\u2019s revealed to be one of the citizens. That would make sense and give her real emotional depth instead of turning her into a confused and irrational character.\n\nAnd most importantly, don\u2019t rush it. Make two seasons instead of one. Give time for the story, the characters, and the emotions to grow. That\u2019s how Alice in Borderland could have stayed great.",

        "content": "I don't currently have a Netflix sub. I heard about Wayward and went to watch it with a friend at their house over three nights. Am glad I did as we both loved the show! \n\nThe  late 80s/early 90s setting feels so right for the show and what it's about (a school for wayward kids).\n\nYes it's light entertainment, and just so entertaining all the way through. So impressed that Mae Martin conceived the story, wrote it, produced it, directed it, was a co-show runner AND starred in Wayward. Incredible.\n\nI have rarely seen teenage girls depicted the coming-of-age way they are in Wayward. It's almost always boys who are given those kinds of roles, while the girls play the sensible roles and act as \"prizes\" for the boys once the boys either \"win\" or learn to tame themselves.\n\nAnd wonderful to have Mae playing the part of a trans man in a relationship with a woman, and it's just accepted without question in the show. I loved her in this. And then you have all the strong female roles in the show. Toni Collette is amazing (as always) as the one who runs the school.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "I'm So Mad About Monsters: Ed Gein",
        "content": "I was skeptical after seeing the promotional photos and the fact that they seemed to depict Ed Gein in some sort of romantic scenario because I didn't ever remember that being part of the story, but man, was I way more disappointed than I had anticipated. Ryan Murphy has a tendency to bring a lot of camp to his work and jump the shark often, so in general I don't expect much from him. That being said, the Dahmer series was incredible. They told a 95% accurate story and it felt like they introduced creative liberties only when necessary (i.e. the glorious Niecy Nash) and they even found creative ways to show a different narrative, like the POV of Tony Hughes. I don't know why they didn't do that for the Ed Gein. I get that they wanted the audience to know how much of an impact his crimes had on the horror genre, but the whole thing was completely ham-fisted. Not to mention the mixture of fact (which allotted to about 5% of the show) and fiction adds confusion to what his influence actually was. Plus all of the jumping around was just confusing. My boyfriend doesn't even care about true crime and he hated it. \n\nI know some people liked it for the creative take on the story and that part of it reflected his mental state as he was doing these things, fine, but in my opinion it was TOO creative a take. The true story of Ed Gein is fascinating and horrifying enough without all of the liberties they took (damn you, Ian Brennan), and to me it was just a wasted opportunity to tell a good story. It definitely makes me hesitant to watch further Monsters.   \n  \nThat being said, Charlie did an amazing job. Yes, at times he sounded like the Abominable Snow-Rabbit from Looney Tunes, but overall he really stepped into the role. I just wish he had been able to showcase his talent with something more worthwhile. ",

        "content": "Typically on Netflix during October there is a Netflix &amp; Chills category or they will boost horror films and have sub sections recommending different scary movies. I just scrolled down the entire Home Screen and not one single section had a horror movie category or even recommended a single scary movie, aside from the Ed Gein story. The last 3-4 movies I\u2019ve watched have been horror films (I had to search the individual title to find them) so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an algorithm thing. But idk. Has Netflix said they aren\u2019t supporting the spooky season this year? Did I miss something and Halloween stuff is out? The new UI is a bit annoying for me to navigate so maybe I\u2019m just old. Anyone else notice the lack of holiday spirit this year on Netflix?",
