And they always trigger my memories of how the city smelled (I lived in Brooklyn) the days following 9/11. Anyway, I\u2019m no history bluff and I\u2019m sure people will debate on the accuracy of the events that unfolded but from my standpoint, I thought the documentary was well-made and yes, I wish it was a little longer.",

        "content": "This is a brilliant AD for ancestral supplements. Here's how they did it.\n\n1. Paint liver king as a broken, troubled, but \"just trying to get a good message out\" guy who takes all the blame and is the only bad person in this story. Heck, he was a major fraudster it makes sense he would lie, right?\n\n2. Portray the nine ancestral tenets and liver as positively as possible... People saying it changed their life, his kids are healed with no other details given, Brian started the company when he figured out liver was good.  All this can be true as whole foods and better lifestyle choices are good.  No one on the marketing team or ancestral supplements knew about the steroids, he told them he didn't use so they had no idea remember? \n\n3. Separate the brilliant but evil marketing plan that made ALL his supplement companies exorbitant amounts of money from the scam that grew his companies immensely. \n\n4. A mutant physique going viral by taking $12,000 worth of GH per month, eating raw testicles for shock value and denying steroid use to generate more chatter.  He did this to grow his company.  Sure, spreading the word of better living is good, but the main goal is to grow the company.  And they did just that.  Now just make LK the sole evil person and make everyone feel for LK.  \n\n3. Did anyone else notice the beautiful shelf of ancestral supplements the camera panned to right at the end? How convenient, I mean we know liver king lied but he wanted to help and it saved both kids.  Organs and carnivore diets are the key to great health.  Don't want to eat raw organs, let us show you this lovely display of products from ancestral supplements, they are good people who were not in on the scam just profited immensely what a coincidence. Don't buy from ancestral he owns multiple supplement companies. They only told you about one, think that was a mistake? \n\n4. HE LITERALLY TELLS EVERYONE HE'S A FRAUDSTER RIGHT TO YOUR FACE. HE LIED TO EVERYONE.  YOU THINK HE STOPPED BEING FRAUDULENT? C'MON PEOPLE! THE GUY WAS PRINTING MONEY AND DOING FRAUDULENT RECIEPTS.  LITERALLY DOING IMMORAL ASS SHIT TO MAKE MORE MONEY AS HES DOING WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY.\n\nSeriously if anyone thinks this is anything but an advertisement I feel bad for you.  He's duping you AGAIN\n",

        "content": "Within the first couple minutes his teenage son says \u201ctooken days off\u201d instead of \u201ctaken\u201d and I knew it was bad news bears. \nI feel SO sorry for those boys. Truly. Did they even go to school? Or were they homeschooled by drug addled, morally bankrupt grifters spewing toxic masculinity? The mother seems to be from another country so maybe she\u2019s not the best teacher of English but yikes, you know they had enough money to maybe hire a tutor.\nAnd I found it interesting that his dad was depicted as a sweet, veterinarian (which takes an amount of studiousness) and instead of maybe trying to be like that he makes up this extreme version of what a man is that seems polar opposite of his dad. Odd choice. (Just as odd as smoking cigars which seems completely counter to his \u201cnatural\u201d lifestyle.)\nAnd the brother he says he looked up to is never mentioned as far as where he is now. Maybe they left that out bec he was involved in the criminal enterprises mentioned. I don\u2019t care enough about the guy to look it up, I just think it would have been interesting in the doc. It also would have been interesting if they addressed the children\u2019s allergies. Was that all made up too? If not, in what way were they resolved? As someone who has never heard of him but has a masters degree in food science and applied nutrition I was interested and it was so bad I had to increase the speed halfway through just to finish it quickly. It could have easily been nutshelled into a ten minute YouTube video.",
