        "content": "I started watching Stranger Things Season 1 Episode 1 with my son who had never seen the show before and in the first few minutes, a Verizon ad airs with Stranger Things spoilers! In the ad, characters literally explain key scenes to each other, spoiling the show we're ACTIVELY watching!?\n\nWhat a terrible decision by Netflix to not prevent this type of thing. I had to yell at my son to close his eyes while scrambling to hit the mute button so it wouldn't ruin the show. I know he's late to the party, but he's just now old enough to watch the show and was so excited to start it.\n\nAiring trailers for future seasons which spoil unwatched seasons is bad enough, but this seems like a new level of disregard. If nothing else, can't they put it some type of setting to disable these types of things?",

        "content": "TW: lots of spoilers. This was actually the most aggravating show I\u2019ve watched. I saw someone talk about it along his &amp; hers (I loved this show) so I figured I\u2019d watch. The first time Adele and Rob astroproject together I saw the colors of their projections so the show was spoiled for me in that moment. \n\nBinged it this weekend but the last episode pissed me off. I thought Louise was smart when she clocked Adele after Adam caught her Astro projecting. But I lost it when she proceeded to call Adele after David told her not to speak to her. FURTHER, tells her about what she knows about Rob and says he\u2019s going to the police\ud83e\udd28. After her failed judgement you\u2019d think she\u2019d actually listen to David this time. \n\nOnly character I liked in this show was her friend. She\u2019d clock Louis all the damn time and rightfully so but Louis shut her off after. That\u2019s the most level headed person Louis had in her life. Idc how much pity she felt for Adele, all those interactions were just gross for character development. How can you claim to pity someone and sleep with their husband repeatedly\ud83d\ude42?? Her judgement throughout the show was so excruciatingly painful.\n\nAs if she didn\u2019t already act stupid enough. She could\u2019ve called 911 to stop the fire. BUT SHE ASTROPROJECTS???? Wtf was she planning to do in the moment. Like it was so foolish it pissed me off. I knew what was coming next when she decides to astroproject and we see Robs projection in the room as well. I was so livid I turned it off when Louise is confronted by Adele and climbs on her.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen so much stupidity in a plot I was aggravated I didn\u2019t want to watch the rest. Like I\u2019ve never seen a worse ending. The fact that Rob wins and David is still sentenced to hell is just sick. I need to wash this show out of my system and forget I ever watched it ",

        "content": "*Posted this on letterboxd but I also wanna see a discussion on this here*\n\nWhile watching this I REALLY had to rationalize so so much. I was in an endless rollercoaster of *\u201coh this is bad\u201d \u201cokay yeah no I get it\u201d \u201cno what the fuck\u201d \u201cyeah that\u2019s understandable\u201d \u201cwhat the hell\u201d* and just ended with that.\n\nI am all for messy plots but this was probably just not for me. It deserves this rating *(2/5 stars)* for its execution and filmography at least. What made this movie feel good was how well romanticized it was. Tom Blyth and Emily Bader did incredibly well. For a second, they really make you tolerate emotional cheating, lol. But I also feel like it was so overdone in this movie that in the end, there was just no more rationalizing it.\n\nSo many of the reviews from the ones that have read the book are complaining about parts that were not added and as I\u2019m reading through it all, it makes me thankful they weren\u2019t. What do you mean he was supposed to get a vasectomy after the pregnancy scare even though he wasn\u2019t the hypothetical father? That makes it so much worse.\n\nEverything also felt a bit too romanticized. Kissing in the rain, in the middle of a pedestrian, and during the challengers wind that makes you cheat (iykyk). It felt like they tried to make the kiss scenes feel more immersive, but it just ended up feeling overdone.\n\nAnother thing, Sarah could have said a bit more during that encounter with Poppy at the airport. I understand her implication that \u201cPoppy wasn\u2019t the problem\u201d even though they did end because of her, but it was still a bit vague. It\u2019s probably because she was in a rush and all, but she really could have said a bit more.\n\nAlso, probably the most controversial part of this review\u2014not a fan of the soundtrack. It is so typical and they could have done so much better with some of the song choices. Taylor Swift and CAS, really? But this one\u2019s highly subjective because I think both are a bit overrated. Sorry to anyone who\u2019s a fan of both reading this.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be realistic. What kind of girl who just put on her gloss would make out with someone.",

He\u2019d already decided to let Kennedy die at the end; who cares what that old man had to say? That old man was trying to prevent a DEATH from occurring. HE was just trying to date a girl. Who\u2019s to say she would die? \n\nMy first thought was \u201cbring her into 2016!. Let JFK die.\u201d He lived in the past for years and the ONLY time the past tried to push back was when he actively tried stopping a HUGELY historical event. Who\u2019s to say the timeline would even give a damn about some harmless, small time relationship? It\u2019s at LEAST worth a second chance. If it doesnt work out AGAIN (due to some random, uncommon freak accident) reset, consider it irrefutable proof that they can\u2019t be together and go about your day.

That\u2019s going to haunt him forever. It would haunt me. Either, bring her to the present (no more risky to her life than his life being at risk when he lived in the past for years), or live in the 60s, bring some of the coolest, coldest tech that would work then, and a print out of every major sports event worth betting on. And one more thing. Since, at the very least, we know his cell phone can play already downloaded memes (when he distracted the mobster with the phone on his bed), I\u2019d grab 2 laptops, a charger, download as many movies, sports, ect from our (future) timeline, and blow Sadie\u2019s MIND with Thanos whooping each Avenger without even trying, Quentin\u2019s best, and Marty\u2019s classics. \n\nHe really REALLY dropped the ball.

        "content": "My roommate and i started watching Lost in Space (season 1, ep 9), and even though it\u2019s pretty entertaining im losing my patience with how the plot barely progresses. literally every time they try to do anything, something goes wrong. i know conflict is necessary but when it happens every single time it just feels repetitive annoying and predictable. I haven\u2019t seen anyone complain about this so that\u2019s just my rant. have a good day. ",

        "content": "I had a feeling she was the one who was assaulted after what Zoe said at the police station. \n\nAlso, I totally saw the mom had something to do with it once they mentioned she kept getting lost but only at night. \n\nThey had me fooled for like 2 minutes that it was only Catherine but then I thought about how she may have killed her sister but the killing for the attack thing\u2026eh. \n\nThinking MEDIA wise, it would\u2019ve made \u201cmore sense/more drama\u201d to go after the men who did it AND the women. \n\nSo anyways, enjoyed my binge but it wasn\u2019t great.

I recently watched the series *Gr\u00e2ce et Frankie*, which was just awesome (I cried at the end, and I was really sad not to watch this series anymore when I got back from school), then I watched *Dead to Me*, which I also loved, even though the last episode left me hanging. Then I got really hooked on the series *Workin Mom*, which is really extremely funny and real. What should I watch now in the funny, girlpower style with a good story and really good vibes that mixes friendship and humor to watch without overthinking it?",
