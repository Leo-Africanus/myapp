The storytelling, the intensity, the family dynamics\u2014everything just pulls you in deeper and deeper. It was addictive from the first episode to the last.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Smurf. Hands down, she has to be one of the WORST mothers in TV history\u2014manipulative, calculating, and chillingly cold. And then there\u2019s Pope\u2026 what a complex, tragic character. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a mix of empathy and unease toward someone onscreen.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be watching it again, no question. Massive thanks to Netflix for having this gem available.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for similar shows\u2014crime, dysfunctional families, intense drama\u2014please drop them below! I\u2019m officially on the hunt.",

I just watched *Extraction* on Netflix because someone recommended it to me. I mostly enjoyed the movie but the audio was so bad. Like there was an emotional scene between two characters but I couldn't understand a single word that one of them was saying. But then the explosions and gun shots are way louder. Sure, to a degree this can be used as a stylistic choice to make the violence more intimdating and such. However it can not be in the interest of the filmmakers that I, as a viewer, end up moving the volume up and down constantly depending if there are people talking or if there is fighting going on. Constantly.\n\nWhen are TV &amp; movie producers going to adress this problem? People have made videos about this on YouTube for years yet nothing is being done about it; what's up with that?",

I realized like 5 minutes ago that the thing separating the higher rated shows was their inclusion of LGBT characters. Ive noticed this with shows like NHIE or Arcane, both of witch were rated lower (14+ and 16+ respectively), are now 18+ and they also include LGBT characters.
