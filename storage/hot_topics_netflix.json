And then he had the nerve to go into debt, dragging his wife's finances down with him, just so his mother could continue living this lavish lifestyle (which, let\u2019s be honest, he enjoyed too).

But let\u2019s not pretend her\u00a0*money*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a huge factor in his decisions.

        "content": "Firstly I don't understand why some people are so fixated on the bullying storyline, when it's a story of all the different forces that create violence in teens. Stephen Graham's explanation that he thought about the phrase \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and therefore we've all failed (in the face of rising teen knife crime in the UK) is so clear.\n\nBut did others think it was clear that Jamie made worse comments to Katie than what we learn?\n\nWhat we know is that Jamie received nude photos of Katie, asked her out, she said \"I'm not that desperate\" (this part rang true and I think was meant to feel that way) and then she left comments on his IG implying he's an incel.\n\nTo me, it felt obvious that when Jamie was talking to the psychologist, he left out part of the conversation. He praises himself for being nice to Katie but admits he thought she was at a weak and vulnerable moment. My interpretation was that when she turned him down, he most likely said something about how no-one else would want her now her nudes had been shared. Especially since we know about his anger outbursts. It was these comments that made her post the emojis on his Insta. I thought it was important that her comments aren't about him being ugly or unpopular - which he sees as his biggest issue - but they specifically call out his attitude to women. And DI Bascombe misses the point a second time when his conclusion is \"So Katie was bullying Jamie?\"\n\nAs a fairly online woman, that was where my mind instantly went. It's such a common pattern: misogynist shows woman positive attention, woman turns him down (politely, kindly or not), misogynist shows his true colours. \n\n",

        "content": "**TL;DR:**\nSquid Game is not a good vs evil story. It\u2019s about people losing their way in a dehumanizing system. The real danger isn\u2019t choosing the wrong side \u2014 it\u2019s thinking there are only two sides to begin with.\n\u2014\u2014\n\n**I think one of the big themes in Season 3 will be the dangers of black-and-white thinking \u2014 and how dehumanising people, even \u201cvillains,\u201d leads to destruction.**\n\nIn a recent post, I talked about how fans often miss the point of Squid Game by trying to label characters as either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d \u2014 Gi-hun as the hero, In-ho as the villain. But the show seems to be building toward a much deeper critique: the real danger is in *thinking that way at all.*\n\n\u2e3b\n\n**1. The Problem with the \u201cHero\u201d Box \u2013 Gi-hun**\n\nGi-hun is flawed from the start \u2014 an addict, a liar, a bad father. Yet we excuse his actions because we *want* him to be good. We see him as the \u201chero,\u201d so we overlook how:\n\t\u2022\tHe started dehumanising others (like hoping for more O deaths in S2).\n\t\u2022\tHe sacrifices innocent people without their knowledge or consent.\n\t\u2022\tHe begins to resemble the VIPs \u2014 gambling with human lives, just with different intentions.\n\nJust like with &gt;!Daenerys in Game of Thrones!&lt;, people don\u2019t notice when \u201cheroes\u201d start crossing moral lines \u2014 because our boundaries shift along with them. That\u2019s dangerous. When we idolize someone, we stop holding them accountable \u2014 and sometimes follow them too far down a dark path.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n**2. The Danger of the \u201cVillain\u201d Box \u2013 In-ho and Beyond**\n\nOn the flip side, calling someone a villain or a monster (like In-ho) erases their humanity. And that has real-world consequences:\n\t\u2022\tWe stop trying to understand *why* they became who they are \u2014 missing opportunities to prevent others from following the same path.\n\t\u2022\tWe start justifying harm or cruelty toward them, feeling morally superior the entire time.\n\nDehumanizing someone can start with wishing something minor (\u201cI hope they stub their toe\u201d) \u2014 but it escalates. If your moral compass shifts enough, you might find yourself condoning violence, even death. That\u2019s how hate radicalizes. And ironically, that\u2019s exactly what In-ho does to the players.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Season 3 Might Be Warning Us About Both Extremes\n\nI don\u2019t think Season 3 will tell us whose worldview is *right* \u2014 Gi-hun or In-ho. Instead, I think it\u2019s showing us how **both extremes can lead to darkness**:\n\t\u2022\tSeeing yourself as the hero = You stop questioning your own actions.\n\t\u2022\tSeeing others as villains = You become the thing you claim to hate.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to pick a side. It\u2019s to **stay human** in a system designed to strip that away.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhat do you think? Are we already watching Gi-hun slide down the path he\u2019s fighting against?\n",

        "content": "I've seen a lot of men on different subs arguing about how the new show Adolescence with Owen Cooper is anti-male. However, I think this is very false. \n\nJamie (played by Owen Cooper) does not become evil overnight; he became this way due to loneliness, suppressing emotions, and exposure to harmful online communities. There are many times in the show where I sympathized with Jamie, given that he is just a 13-year-old boy. I think that societal expectations regarding men showing their emotions led Jamie to struggle with emotional repression, which caused him to lash out when he was rejected. And before you say \"he was bullied\", I don't think he was. Jamie asked Katie out when he knew she would be vulnerable, and then she just called him out on it. As someone who was bullied as a kid, bullying is more repetitive. from the show, It just seemed like she had \"bullied\" him this one time. The show more urges people to create better support systems for young men so they learn how to manage their emotions rather than just saying men are bad. \n\nBasically, the moral of the story is to make sure that you are teaching your boys how to show their emotions in a healthy way, ask for help, and learn how to handle rejection. I think this show did an excellent job examining how online spaces can radicalize young boys and how its important to understand the challenges they face like internalizing emotions.",

        "content": "Recommendation from culture writer Meredith Blake at [The Contrarian](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/contrarian-culture-club-recommendations-2da), a Substack news site with a weekly \"Culture Club\" column:\n\n&gt;I realize that a show about murder and incompetence at the White House might not sound like the most appealing thing right now, but would still urge anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit and loves going behind the scenes of hallowed institutions to fire up\u00a0*The Residence.*  \nFrom executive producer Shonda Rhimes and creator Paul William Davies, this witty, upstairs-downstairs murder mystery is set at the White House during a tense state dinner with Australia. In the midst of the lavish event\u2014featuring a performance by a sparkly Kylie Minogue\u2014chief usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito, of\u00a0*Breaking Bad*\u00a0and\u00a0*Better Call Saul*\u00a0fame) is found dead in the third-floor game room.\n\n&gt;Enter Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba,\u00a0*Orange Is the New Black),*\u00a0a consulting detective for the Metropolitan Police and eccentric bird enthusiast (is there any other kind?) tasked with investigating the murder. Turns out there are plenty of people in the household staff with violent grudges against Wynter, from free-spirited butler Sheila (Edwina Findley) to aggrieved pastry chef Didier (Bronson Pinchot). Al Franken also has a supporting role as a senator leading the hearing inquiry into the murder. (A real stretch for him, to be sure.)  \nI like to imagine the elevator pitch for this was something like \u201c*Clue*\u00a0meets\u00a0*The West Wing,*\u00a0with a side of\u00a0*Downton Abbey.\u201d*\u00a0The eight-episode series is very loosely inspired by\u00a0*The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House,*\u00a0by\u00a0Kate Anderson Brower (who also happens to be a\u00a0[*Contrarian*\u00a0](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/flipping-the-script-how-americas)[contributor](https://contrarian.substack.com/p/flipping-the-script-how-americas)).  \nAnd while it clearly deviates from the source material and is consciously over-the-top in a very Rhimesian way,\u00a0*The Residence*\u00a0does manage to paint a fascinating portrait of life inside the White House, complete with elaborate sets and detailed production. It also humorously explores the tensions that can emerge between the residence staff, many of whom have worked at the White House for decades, though the administrations change every few years (may it remain that way).\n\n[Photo by Jessica Brooks of Netflix](https://preview.redd.it/hrrc0unaobre1.jpg?width=3600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eadf08a4716363cbdf7117c1d44106c014480da8)",

The supporters of this show have become SO hateful online it's ridiculous!\n\nPeople are saying \"It's a masterpiece\", \"This will be studied in Media classes\", \"This show was eye-opening and life-changing\" and that's FINE! You know why? Because everybody is entitled to an opinion!\n\nTikTok, X, Facebook, Reddit, everywhere I leave my opinion saying \"I thought it was alright, pretty good, I probably wouldn't watch again though\" I get people saying...\n\n\"You obviously didn't get it \ud83d\ude44 \"\n\"You must have a low IQ, this is only for deep thinkers to watch\"\n\"Sorry that TikTok has rotted you're brain and you can't go more than 5 mins without getting bored\"\n\"You're part of the problem with society\"\n\"We found the Andrew Tate supporter who hates women!!!\" (I'm gay lol)\n\nMy point is that it's OK to not be a big fan of a fictional TV show lol Everybody has an opinion. But it just seems like fans of this show are actively going out of their way to be rude and aggressive towards those who weren't big fans of the show.\n\nI can understand the obvious hate towards those who are wearing tin foil hats or who are actual Andrew Tate supporters, but what is the deal with getting angry with a random person who just didn't like it? Lol\n\nI know it explores sensitive topics but people really need to chill out over this show. One of the key messages was how we behave online and some of the fans are completely contradicting that message imho. They're being SO hateful towards people who have a different opinion. \n\nRant over, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. ",

        "content": "Hi everyone, just finished watching Adolescence (loved it) but there is something about the 3 episode that didn't sit right and I wanna discuss why, while also reading your opinions.\n\nThe reason I think the therapist raises some negative reactions during the episode (me included) is because what she does is cold as fuck. And yes, it's her job, there is dead girl, all of that makes sense. I'm not passing moral judgement.\n\nBut just watching it...a trained professional went after a 13 year old kid, brought all his trauma and insecurities to the surface with no intention to help him go throught it (which wasn't her job, I know), and when Jaime was finally opening up (saying horrible things, yes, but still opening up) she pulled the rug, switched to a express-less face and left him forever with all that mess of emotions in his hands.\n\nA 13 year old kid certainly won't understand the difference between \"I like you\" and \"I'm being nice because I have a job to do\" as an adult would. Even if you rationally explain it. At least in my case. How do you recover from that? If Jaime had any self esteem left, it was destroyed. Vanished. The thought of procedures like that taking place in real life really disturbed me. Because, if it happened to Jaime who wasn't found even guilty yet, it might as well happen to a wrongly accused boy that doesn't have his parents calling him regularly like Jaime did.\n\nIt's not the therapist to blame, because that would be killing the messenger. But I think that's why she generates that type of reactions. At least from me.\n\nTL;DR: therapist was not wrong but watching her do her job was harsh.\n\nHas anyone had the same feeling?",
