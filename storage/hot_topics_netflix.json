        "content": "I\u2019ve just finished Pluto after stumbling upon it by chance on Netflix. I was actually just looking for something to have playing in the background, without the intention of actively watching it. Ever since Vinland Saga and AoT, I had pretty much given up on finding something genuinely good in that space \u2014 especially on Netflix.\n\nFirst of all: did anyone else notice how many hints and references there were to Monster?\n\n1. Tenma being a scientist/doctor.\n2. And what I found even crazier: they basically adapted Julius Reichwein 100% as Ban-Kouchou. He looks exactly like Julius Reichwein. Like, 1:1. \n\nI also really loved the many Evangelion references (e.g. \u201cpierced Braun 1589 \u2192 Adam pierced by the Lance\u201d). Those are just the ones I personally noticed.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m left with a few questions:\n\n1. How was Braun 1589 able to kill a human? And how was Gesicht able to kill a human as well, when they technically shouldn\u2019t be capable of that? As far as I understand, only Pluto \u2014 and Abdulla \u2014 should have been able to do so, since they were equipped with unpleasant emotions. Braun and Gesicht were created as \u201cnormal\u201d AIs.\n2. Why was Atom able to lie to Helena at the end?\n3. Who is the teddy bear, and why did Braun decide to kill him?\n\nI get that, especially in sci-fi, you can\u2019t avoid a few plot holes \u2014 but there were quite a few things that ultimately made me settle on an 8.5/10.\n\nThe lack of fight scenes didn\u2019t bother me at all \u2014 quite the opposite. There were so many incredibly beautiful and symbolic images: Pluto crying together with Atom, Epsilon slowly shattering to light etc. It all felt almost like a dream. I think it was a very smart decision by the creators to prioritize these atmospheric visuals over action scenes.\n\nI might have liked to see at least one female member among the seven robots, though.\n\nLastly, I really wonder why this anime is so relatively unknown. And: do you have any other anime recommendations? I had basically given up on the whole medium, but Pluto has given me hope that there\u2019s still something truly great out there.",

This is a personal betrayal.\n\n**Retention Rep:** I\u2019m sorry\u2026 when you say your boys and a baby, are you referring to a profile issue or parental controls?\n\n**Fan:** No. Supernatural. Sam. Dean. The Impala. The fact that I have to explain this is already painful.\n\n**Retention Rep:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. That series did leave our catalog due to licensing changes.\n\n**Fan:** Fifteen seasons. Blood, ghosts, demons, bad choices, classic rock. You don\u2019t just rip that out of a woman\u2019s comfort rotation and expect her to be okay.\n\n**Retention Rep:** I understand it can be frustrating when a favorite show leaves the service.\n\n**Fan:** Frustrating is when your coffee\u2019s cold. This is emotional damage.\n\n**Retention Rep:** We do still offer a wide selection of other long-running shows.\n\n**Fan:** Don\u2019t. Do not.

A discount is not going to fix that.\n\n**Retention Rep:** Is there anything we could do that would change your mind today?\n\n**Fan:** Unless you can resurrect fifteen seasons with duct tape, classic rock, and pure spite, no. I\u2019ve got demons to kill, hellhounds to banish, and a subscription to cancel.\n\n**Retention Rep:** You\u2019re clearly very attached to this series.\n\n**Fan:** Family don\u2019t end in blood. But apparently streaming contracts do, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\n\n**Retention Rep:** Alright. I can process the cancellation for you.\n\n**Fan:** Thank you. No chick flick moments. Just make it quick.\n\n**Retention Rep:** Your service will remain active until the end of your billing cycle.\n\n**Fan:** Fine. I\u2019ll sit in silence, eat junk food, and glare at the TV.\n\n**Retention Rep:** Everything is set. Thank you for being a member.\n\n**Fan:** One last thing. If Baby ever comes back, I\u2019m back too.\n\n**Retention Rep:** I\u2019ll make a note of that.\n\n**Fan:** Please don\u2019t. You\u2019ll spell it wrong.",

        "content": "OKAAAY! This is gonna blow all your minds. As Benoit Blanc would say \"Here's my checkmate show\".I just finished watching Knives out-WUDM, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But as in any whodunnit we as viewers play the role of detectives itself, as if the mystery is ours to unfold.HAHAHAHA.... Call it coincidence but the last show I watched was \"Midnight mass\", also a brilliant mindfuck horror with heavy religious commentory.While I was watching it, I cannot unsee that both of these stories share very similar plots, characters, mythology and overall setting. Now when I am writing this post, I can conclude KNIVES OYT WUDM is just whoddunit version of Midnight Mass. Let me show you what I am talking out-\n\n1)Both the stories have the basic theme of faith, christanity and power of religion. The central plot in both of theme is of reserruction, literally and metaphorically. There are actual angel statues hanging from walls in WUDM for gods sake.\n\n2)Both of the stories are set in a Christian conservative american small town and main plot revolved around regulars at the church.\n\n3) There is a Monsignor in both of the stories. He dies in both of them and is reserrected (literally in MM and fakely in WUDM). A more suprising bit is the vessel of death- which is POISONED COMMUNION WINE in comon in both of them.I swear if Josh Brolin would have actually reserrected from the tomb, it would actually turn into a horror story.\n\n4) Both the monsignors have fathered an illegetimate child, which is the driving force behind their evil plans.\n\n5) The events of death and reserruction occur within the same week in both the stories-EASTER WEEK.\n\n6) The protagonist in Midnight mass (Rylie) is a guilt driven murderer who has lost his faith in christ. The protagonist in WUDM(Jud) is also a murderer who has accepted faith due to his guilt.\n\n6) Apart from Riley and Jud, other characters also share a lot of similar traits. Like a disabled girl in a wheelchair visiting church daily in hope of a miracle. I laughed out so hard in WUDM when she stands up and Martha (caretaker) proclaims it as miracle. Exactly similar outcome in MM when Leeza walks out of wheelchair and whole town takes it as a miracle.\n\n7) The main culprit in both the shows turns out is not Monsignor but the church caretakar lady (Bev in MM and Martha in WUDM) who would go any lenghts to protect the church and maintain its beliefs among the townkeepers.",
