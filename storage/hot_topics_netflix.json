        "content": "Okay, I really hope I'm not the only one who has noticed and is disturbed by how apps from the Microsoft Store now work. Specifically, Netflix, Crunchyroll, YouTube Music, Facebook Messenger, and who knows how many others (probably plenty more).\n\nThe way these applications now function is by essentially using the Microsoft Edge browser. Instead of opening an app, you're basically just opening a browser tab. These \"apps\" rely on Edge's settings and even redirect links to Edge when it's not your default browser. In other words, you no longer get any of the functionality you'd expect from a standalone app. It's literally the same experience as opening the webpage in Edge. How does that even qualify as an application?!\n\nWhat's worse is that if anyone somehow manages to uninstall or delete Edge from their computer, or if a buggy update breaks it, I bet all these so-called \"apps\" will stop working entirely.\n\nI really hope nobody tries to defend this practice because it's indefensible.\n\nRight now, I'm furious about the disappearance of the Netflix app. The app used to let me directly connect to my home theatre receiver and send high-quality audio with surround sound support. That\u2019s gone now\u2014thanks a lot.   \nOn top of that, I'm facing a huge issue with Netflix lowering the resolution when playing via the browser (or the \"app\") for absolutely no good reason. I can see how it quickly buffers about 4 minutes of video, but after playing for just a few seconds, it drops the quality, it stutters, rewinds a second, and starts redownloading another 4 minutes of video. This cycle repeats, and the quality keeps dropping until it hits the lowest resolution, which in my case watching on a big screen makes it unbearable. \n\nAnd yes, before anyone asks:\n\n* My profile is set to high-quality playback.\n* I have a fast, stable internet connection (110 Mbps is more than enough).\n* I'm using a solid gaming build, so there are no hardware issues.\n\nI even tried installing an old Chrome extension called *Netflix 1080p* made by Truedread, because this problem has existed for years. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked yet, I will play around with settings and source code further in attempts to resolve this.\n\nI am new to posting on reddit so if I have not done something right please let me know ( I know you want to).\n\n",

        "content": "I just finished watching the animated comedy-not-so-comic Captain Fall and found myself so angry when, hunting down every possible hint of a second season in the making, i found out that not only it will never be renewed for such, but that it's been cancelled mid first season. What the fuck, why all the good shows get cancelled and never get a decent, decorous end? It might be one of my new favorite cartoons and realizing that i will never get to know what happens to Jonathan or how to the things that happened in the last episode that has aired will be sorted out. That's horrible ",
