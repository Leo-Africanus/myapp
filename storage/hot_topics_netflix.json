I have rarely had to touch the language settings after that. \nRecently, I began watching a new show and found that it would be dubbed automatically no matter how many times I change it. The next episode plays and it's back to dub. Is there something that I can do to ensure that the sub will be the default option on every show? I watch all shows in all languages with subtitles as I have trouble understanding just audio, even in languages that I speak, and it's quite annoying if this is something I'm going to have to constantly do for every episode.

Joy: Possible Borderline Personality, but I find it more likely that he has Avoidant Personality and was pushed to the end of his rope by socioeconomic status. His temper is something we might attribute to Intermittent Explosive Disorder, making it a complicated stress response, but he is otherwise quite enigmatic without more background info.\n\nYoussef Khater: Narcissistic Personality. It seems clear that most of his crimes were committed in order to uphold his superiority, and he had one hell of a victim complex. He may have antisocial traits, but it\u2019s hard to be sure without more background information.\n\nJamison Bachman: Narcissistic Personality, and possible C-PTSD after having witnessed the murder of his friend. It was a very sad case to me all around.\n\nJanie Lynn Ridd: Avoidant Personality - the only thing that seems amiss about her was the apparent delusion that she was the rightful mother of Ryder, however this may be a manifestation of pathological envy in Avoidant Personality\n\nScott Pettigrew: Paranoid Personality - in my opinion, he could have qualified for the insanity defence if it had been considered. Most likely, Anita also had some dementia because of her gullibility leading up to the murder.\n\nTammy Fritz: Antisocial Personality - without a doubt, Tammy Fritz is the only one on this list to meet the designation of psychopath in the forensics world. Unlikely that her accomplices were ill - just chronic substance abuse.\n\nMichael Dudley: Schizotypal Personality - everything he did seemed to come from paranoid ideation, and he also could have stood a good chance of using the insanity defence if he had tried.\n\nBenjamin Foster: Borderline Personality - possibly the worst case of it I\u2019ve ever seen in a documentary, and because of the things I\u2019ve seen myself in group DBT, it makes me feel sad.\n\nJerry Ramrattan: Narcissistic Personality - again, his primary concern was for his image. His three accomplices were just regular people swayed by money.\n\nRosa Hill and Mei Li: Narcissistic Personality - some may argue that Rosa managed to manipulate Mei into being her accomplice, but I\u2019d argue that Mei had passed those traits on to Rosa and that Mei herself didn\u2019t put people off as much because she had more time to learn how to mask her symptoms.\n\nKevin Lewis: Borderline and Narcissistic Personality, given especially by his vindictiveness and overconfidence. Jerradon Phelps may not be mentally ill at all, but Alexis Hale does undoubtedly have Antisocial and Histrionic Personality, the latter of which led to them being caught.\n\nLet me know what you think.

        "content": "Kastenjenmanden was not bad at all until I got to the last episode, the plot armor was crazy and unrealistic.\\\nRosa and the other guy were in the basement **drenched** in gasoline and were still able to survive, the fire spread soooo slow, one of them should have died there.\\\nAnother scene that didn't make sense was Thulin making the car crash, why didn't the murderer just shot her after she ALREADY tried to choke him.\nKristin, however, had biggest plot armor. Why on earth would him and Astrid keep her alive for that long? Why would Astrid say she was dead already? \nThe episode looked like a sad attempt at a good ending, that doesn't fit one bit the context of the situation, bad endings are \"good\" too.",

I started watching and couldn\u2019t stop.  \nIt\u2019s a truly wonderful story with excellent direction and fantastic character development. The plot revolves around a person seeking revenge for her mother\u2019s murder.\n\n  \nIt kind of reminds me of\u00a0*The Lord of the Rings*\u00a0in the sense that the entire story focuses on someone on a journey to defeat the villain.\n\n  \nAnyway, definitely check it out!\n\n\n\n[https://www.netflix.com/title/81144203](https://www.netflix.com/title/81144203)  \n\n\n",
