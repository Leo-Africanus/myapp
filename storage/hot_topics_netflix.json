Now at the end of the second episode, I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ll be removing this show from my list. Suddenly the whole thing became a televangelist prime time, which, when we\u2019ve literally mentioned several times already that this show is live for the whole world to see, to me became very tone deaf. I don\u2019t care what kind of religion you practice, as long as you don\u2019t shove it in my face and especially if you\u2019re gonna try to convert me I\u2019m hella out.

I\u2019m all for diversity, but at what point does it stop being about \"organic storytelling\" and start being a corporate checklist?\n\nA few interesting things I found:\n\n\u2022 The Numbers: According to a 2024/2025 GLAAD report, Netflix continues to have the highest number of LGBTQ+ characters in streaming\u2014nearly half (47%) of all LGBTQ+ characters across all platforms are on Netflix alone.\n\n\u2022 The \"Niche\" Strategy: Some industry analysts argue that Netflix uses its hyper-specific algorithm to \"micro-target\" different demographics. By including these characters, they ensure the show pops up in more \"Recommended\" categories for different groups, even if the role is minor.\n\n\u2022 Creative Equity Fund: Netflix actually launched a $100 million \"Fund for Creative Equity\" specifically to fast-track stories from underrepresented groups. While this is great for new creators, does it lead to a \"quantity over quality\" issue where characters are added just to meet funding criteria?\n\nMy question to the sub: Do you think this \"over-representation\" (compared to actual population stats) helps normalize different identities, or is it reaching a point of \"tokenism\" that actually makes the writing feel less authentic?\n\nCurious to hear if others feel the same or if you think I'm just over-analyzing the algorithm.",

        "content": "\nTbh, the show started really well. I loved the characters and the storyline during the first few seasons. Then it completely lost the plot. The characters lost their personalities and became very poorly written.\n\nNow the entire show just revolves around  dumb ahh characters making the worst decisions imaginable. None of them can keep it in their pants. They bang, regret it, get back together, break up again, then immediately start dating someone new. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the way they run this marketing firm. It's crazyy. All they do is make reckless decisions, ignore basic logic and somehow every campaign is a massive success anyway. No planning, no strategy, no consequences. Just Emily \"girlbossing\" her way through it. I know it\u2019s all fictional, but come on \ud83d\ude2d a little bit of logic would be nice. ",
