        "content": "It\u2019s new &amp; I had never heard of this guy so I watched it last night. Why is Netflix is giving this guy more notoriety and why do we elevate \u2018influencers\u2019 like this??\n\nToxic &amp; cliche grifter promoting an \u2018All Meat Primal\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 lifestyle gets caught using steroids\u2026 a surprise to no one with eyeballs.  He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

        "content": "At some point in the past five years; perhaps between the eighth season of Love Is Blind and the 437th rebranding of The Bachelor; televised dating quietly stopped being about dating. Instead, it became a parade of bronzed narcissists dry-humping on bean bags for the chance to sell flat tummy tea and boner pills to strangers on Instagram. Into this rich tradition steps Netflix\u2019s latest entry, Sneaky Links: Dating After Dark, a show that dares to ask: What if your ex-booty call was also your soulmate? (And what if you were filmed trying to figure that out while shirtless, emotionally stunted, and surrounded by Ikea furniture?)\n\nIf you, like me, are 43 years old and unaware that \u201csneaky link\u201d is Gen Alpha for \u201cbooty call,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. Apparently, the term \u201cbooty call\u201d was too on-the-nose for a streaming platform that also produces prestige dramas about Elizabethan corsets and talking bears. Instead, we get \u201cSneaky Links,\u201d a phrase that sounds like a sketchy URL you click by accident while searching for airfare.",

Half way through the show I thought this was sci-fi and then it got weirder and weirder. I skipped through most of the family scenes  to save some time and I was mostly curious where they're going with this. Then came people dying mysteriously, cartoon villians from the government performing medical experiments on people searching for \"the Holy Grail\", \"The Major\" who's way up the ranks to conduct large operations that even the NSA is not aware of. The scientist who's there to explain shit to people with psychic powers called \"the calling\", things disappearing, symbols, egyptian mythology, dead people coming back to life, Noah's Ark, and other \"mysterious\" phenomenon.\n\nI got even more excited when I realized there's 4 seasons of this. I don't know how it was even possible to stretch this for that many seasons and this got my curiosity even more. Most of the time I'm just skipping through the episodes until I get to see Michaela's pretty face but everything's all connected. Wow.\n\nTwenty years from now, this is gonna be a cult classic. Calling it now.",

        "content": "I enjoyed the calm, peaceful vibe, but the awkward abundance of self-congratulation was distracting. The lack of chemistry with guests was noticeable. Plus, sprinkling the dried flowers without consideration for the palate, 'the sweetness of the fruit is a real thing', detailed documentation of cooking process without recipes, etc \ud83e\uddd0\n\nI'd love to consume this genre done better - with an articulate and engaging host, where the guests radiate genuine fun.\n\nCulinary theme is appreciated, but not necessary.",
