The series is not exactly Carl Sagan, but that it is not what the intention is. If you want light background entertainment, give With Love Meghan a chance.",

The cast was excellent especially rhe always reliable Betty Gilpin and Taylor Kitsch who is good in most things despite some of the hate he gets from critics. Shea Whigham is impressive as always and must be one of the best character actors working today. Also nice performance from Dane Dehaan who always delivers a memorable performance and really should be a bigger name in Hollywood. A quality show that stands out amongst all the rubbish on Netflix.",

Like 40% of 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is spent watching basketball/at the basketball game, where the colors are similar to those in 'Running Point'. Second, the 'Game 7' importance. I'm not a basketball nerd, so that term has no importance to me, but it was a key piece in both movie and show. \n\nI had 2 more points that I forgot, so I'll edit it later when I remember, but if anyone has found more similarities, please tell. They were written by different people, so that can't be why. I was wondering if 'Running Point' was supposed to be this homage to 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.'",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I need to vent about something wild that just happened. I went to fire up Netflix on my TV last night, only to see my account was signed out. Weird, right? I figured it was a glitch, so I tried logging back in\u2014bam, denied. Okay, no biggie, I\u2019ll reset my password. Except when I tried, Netflix hit me with \u201cno account exists\u201d for my email. This is an account I\u2019ve had for over five years.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh great, I\u2019ve been hacked.\u201d So I call Netflix support to sort it out. I\u2019m assuming five years of payment history tied to my card, watch history, all that jazz would make it obvious I\u2019m the real owner. The rep I talked to was nice enough\u2014she even admitted she could see the new email on the account looked fraudulent (some random string of letters and numbers). But then she drops the bomb: there\u2019s nothing she can do. Apparently, because the email got changed, I\u2019m locked out for good unless I want the whole account wiped. Years of watchlists, recommendations, and profiles? Gone.\n\nLuckily, my Netflix password was unique, so this won\u2019t spiral into other accounts getting compromised. Still, it stings to lose it like that. I\u2019m just baffled they couldn\u2019t verify me with all the data they have\u2014payment records, IP addresses, something! The only option they gave was to nuke the account and start fresh. I get that security protocols exist for a reason, but this feels like punishing the victim instead of the hacker.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did I miss some secret way to reclaim it? Or am I just stuck rebuilding my Netflix life from scratch?",

        "content": "In a time where people struggle to figure out what the heck to cook and how to view food, Meghan pulled out very real, healthy, and delicious meal ideas. Being American, I appreciated the different ethnic recipes she brought to her show instead of sticking to one specific type of cuisine. This was relatable!!! I cook Mediterranean, Korean, Turkish, French and Mexican cuisine. I alternate and have been on my own food journey as well.\n\nLike Megan, I\u2019m comfortable in the kitchen so I could tell by little things she would do or say, she too is quite comfortable in the kitchen. I believe with all my heart she is genuine when she says she loves cooking for her kids as much as she can and hosting. I love the fact that she mentions her humble beginnings like eating Jack in the Box when she was younger and that she truly is blessed to have a garden of her own. \n\nIt was a lot more relatable than I would imagine for someone who isn\u2019t rich like her. It\u2019s easy to go to the local grocery store and cook her meals on a budget. She gave amazing tips for helping your kids see food in a healthy and appetizing light. My husband was so into the show as well he stopped what he was doing and couldn\u2019t help but pay attention and engaging with the show. \n\nI BAWLED when I found out Guy passed away. RIP Guy \u2665\ufe0f he was the cutest thing ever. \n\nI hope to see more series. I was so tempted to rewatch it. I probably will again. It gave me so many ideas and I appreciate Megan\u2019s way of leveling down certain things so that everyone in a lower tax bracket can participate and take so much away from what she was sharing. So beautiful \ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6",
