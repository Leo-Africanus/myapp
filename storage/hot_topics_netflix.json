        "content": "There\u2019s a part of the fandom that\u2019s using the argument that Stranger Things is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi, with fun cast and emotions, but this does not sit right with me at all. \n\nThe show not only has taken so long to finish, but has also been (I think?) Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

        "content": "*Peaky Blinders* (2022) Season 6, supposedly final season. Film sequel, *The Immortal Man*,  coming in March 2026.\n\nGods, this is good - the fascist movement, Mosley, etc. in England, the connections with it, gangster and political in the US.\u00a0\n\nRe-watching for the first time since it came out, season 6 of *Peaky Blinders* (2022). I'm being deeply impressed with it, I think, more so, than first time around. In other words, this series is aging very well, becoming every more relevant to our own time than even when it released initially. Which is both good, for viewing, and bad, for we *living* in this time.\n\nDiana Mitford is a prominent character due to her intimate relationship with Mosley, the proud Brit fascist/racist would-be prime minister, and her fan girl relationship with Hitler. Watching this in the same year UKTV-Britbox put out another period drama series on the Mitford sisters (*Outrageous,* adapted from a book by Mary Lovell), is disturbing in exactly the way the history of that bundle of sisters always is. How could a family produce both a fascist racist like Diana and a progressive like Jessica?\n\nI am guessing many of those who found season 6 an inferior season, \"not like what it used to be\", is because the season dramatized so specifically how capitalism, class, crime and politics are history's quartet, connected in time's womb. Along with Mosley, a Boston Irish crime boss, Jack Nelson, is Tommy Shelby's antagonist. Nelson is another fascist opportunist-sympathizer, playing both sides against his middle, wired into D.C. political hierarchy at the highest levels, including having easy access to the POTUS. He's a fictional Joe Kennedy.\n\nWhat I like best about this period drama, and so far, particularly, this season, is the range of strong female characters -- and there are many! Again, it seems many viewers couldn't move on without Polly. They loved her strong character -- it had been there from the beginning. These newer women having so much influence on the Shelby family's growth moving into WWII era, seemed not to be to the liking of many viewers either.\n\nIt's so interesting too, seeing other characters hewing in their individual cases back to their cultural roots in many ways, as the world they'd been navigating successfully as crime bosses is changing again, and they look in their own ways to survival and success in their future, particularly Tommy with his Romany imagination, and Alfie Solomons. Sure and they'd be in alliance now and again, both always forever outsiders to Britain's ruling class, no matter how useful, how necessary, they are to it..",

Henry\u2019s cave memory in Season 5, where he\u2019s clearly interacting with / absorbing Mind Flayer-like particles. In the show, this is presented as something mysterious and significant\u2026 but never really followed up on in a satisfying way. Apparently the play adds context, but the series itself doesn\u2019t.\n\n2. The Oklahoma poster in Max\u2019s hand during one of Henry\u2019s memories strongly suggests Joyce, Hopper, and Henry all went to school together. That\u2019s a huge implication; yet across four seasons, Joyce and Hop never say a single word about knowing Henry Creel? Not even a hint?\n\n3. Henry\u2019s early connection to the Upside Down, Brenner\u2019s involvement, and the timeline of how everything starts are apparently much clearer in the play but on screen, it still feels incomplete or oddly rushed.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t expanded lore. It\u2019s that the main TV series feels like it\u2019s missing chapters unless you\u2019ve seen a West End/ Broadway show that:\n\nA. isn\u2019t accessible worldwide,\n\nB. isn\u2019t cheap,\n\nC. and won\u2019t be seen by the vast majority of viewers.\n\nAt this point, it feels like they should\u2019ve done a limited prequel season or special between Season 4 and 5 to properly set this up. Relying on a stage production to carry essential canon just makes Season 4 feel retroactively unfinished.\n\nWith only one episode left, I\u2019m worried the finale will have too much ground to cover, and that casual viewers will never even realize why certain things don\u2019t quite add up.\n\nEnd rant. Curious if this bugs anyone else or if I\u2019m just overthinking it. \n\n\nEdit: No, I\u2019m not saying anyone should fly to New York or London to see the play. Yes, the play exists, and the creators have stated it\u2019s important for understanding the show\u2019s ending. Yes, it might be addressed in the finale, and yes, I\u2019m waiting for the last episode. No, discussing a TV series on a TV subreddit isn\u2019t a \u201clife crisis\u201d or proof that I have nothing better to do; it\u2019s simply something I wanted to talk about.\n",

I've seen a few of them but most are new to me. I'll check them out.",
