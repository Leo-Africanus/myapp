        "title": "Another Post about the new Horrible UI change ... with suggestions",
        "content": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!!\u00a0**That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

I love horror, but I don't watch it that much anymore so some horror suggestions would be nice, but more so on the serial killer type of vibe rather than supernatural. I also have started to enjoy romance, especially when it is kind of forbidden or unique, like the film 'The Tearsmith' I thought that was amazing. Maybe drop some of your favourite movies and series and let me know why you liked it!  I'll list some stuff that I have watched and enjoyed. \n\n\\- Vampire Diaries\n\n\\- Stranger Things \n\n\\- Heartstopper\n\n\\- Lost \n\n\\- I enjoy Harlan Coben's limited series\n\n\\- All of us are dead\n\n\\- Alice in borderland\n\n\\- Young royals\n\n\\- You\n\n\\- The summer I turnt pretty\n\n\\- Big fan of the Texas Chainsaw massacre franchise\n\nThanks in advance! :) ",

        "title": "Greyed out UK series",
        "content": "As I muse upon my viewing habits whilst performing my daily constitutional, within the hulk of a service that playfully calls itself Streamberry, a grey cloud haunts my brain, such as the grey cloud that haunts almost every UK series I\u2019ve watched in the few months, The Terror and Dept. Q. This may not be a new phenomenon, but today felt more overcast than a thick London fog. \n\nAt first, I considered that I was the problem, knowing full well that my mental and physical health dwindle at an ever increasing pace, due to age, economics and the travesty we call politics. My therapist confirmed that my self diagnosed early onset dementia was not producing visual impairment and my optometrist reviewed the test results and ruled out glaucoma or macular degeneration. I consulted with Seth Rogan who\u2019s depth of the industries inner workings is beyond measure, reassured me that it\u2019s not a common issue, and is likely due to a poor understanding of post production processes. Lastly, the geopolitical storm I\u2019m told does not affect or is an effect on image quality, the oligarchs and despots are too occupied with 4-D chess than to meddle in a $100B industry; it\u2019s a battle that no one wins. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve concluded, after much debating with the factions in my brain, and just before I blot my nethers dry post a thorough washlet blasting, that I refuse to watch another visually depressed, smoke filled, grainy darkness while clearly filmed in broad daylight travesty. No matter the depth and nuanced interpretation of a Pulitzer novel or a gripping horror where tension is built with the lack of knowing what\u2019s around the corner or behind the billowing curtain, I cannot, no, will not be bothered with the crap eye strain that comes from this channel that tags itself as Moody or Dark. \n\nRaise your arms in protest, nay raise your finger the next time one of these disappointments catch your attention. Do not give to the promises of rich storytelling and star studded casts. \n\n/s, so much /s that Monty Python would cringe. \n",

I would like a lot if Netflix could ever get the rights to publish it, maybe even dubbing it.",
