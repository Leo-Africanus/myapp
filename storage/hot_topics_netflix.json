These young talents are adorable and I think something special will come from this journey they are on but what in the heck am I watching when it comes to Simon\u2019s relationship with his wife?!\n\nThe way Simon Cowell\u2019s relationship is showcased felt awkward, immature, and at times honestly uncomfortable to watch. There were moments where the dynamic came off as childish yet oddly overbearing, like a push-and-pull that never quite lands as playful or loving. Instead of feeling warm or endearing, it often felt tense and unsettling.\n\nWhat made it more jarring was the contrast, this is someone known for control, precision, and authority, yet the relationship on screen felt emotionally clumsy and strangely unbalanced. It didn\u2019t read as healthy banter or confident love, but more like two people stuck in a loop of immaturity masked as affection.\n\nOf course, editing plays a role, and we never see the full picture. But what was shown felt surprisingly raw in a way that raised eyebrows, not because it was honest, but because it seemed normalized despite how uncomfortable it came across.\n\nCurious if anyone else felt the same watching it.",

When did it get removed or where did it go? \n\nI\u2019m looking for films that are less Hallmark-ish. I can only stomach so much of the fluffy, cutesy low budget Christmas films so like to mix in drama, tearjerkers, horror, etc but Netflix isn\u2019t delivering much so I will likely be doing some hopping around platforms\u2026\n\nAny recommendations?",

Shutter Island is powerful on the first watch, but once the twist is revealed, a lot of its impact fades. The film leans heavily on atmosphere and shock.\n\nPrestige, on the other hand, is built for rewatching. Every scene matters. The structure itself is part of the illusion, and the   themes-obsession, sacrifice, rivalry, and identity run far deeper than just a single twist. It doesn\u2019t just surprise you; it plays with you.\n\nShutter Island tells you its truth at the end. Prestige hides it in plain sight from the very beginning. That\u2019s the difference. One is a great experience once; the other is a masterclass that gets better every time you revisit it.",
