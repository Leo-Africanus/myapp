This year especially, Netflix have been spam-removing movies and shows and I don't have the time to watch the stuff I WANT to see, because I'm too busy watching all the stuff that's being removed from Netflix.\n\n2. New Netflix shows just keep getting cancelled, leaving us fans frustrated when a show ends with a brutal cliffhanger and then Netflix decides to end the show after that cliffhanger.\n\n3. The price: Netflix is the most expensive streaming service there is, especially if you want to watch in 4K. The price for viewing in 4K in Sweden is $20/month.\n\nAll these together makes we just want to unsubscribe from Netflix.\nThe only reason to stay on Netflix (for now) is because of old shows like Stranger Things for example. But I'm getting so tired of Netflix cancelling shows and spam-removing movies that once they wrap up all the old shows, I'm out. ",

Reason? the mastercard attached with my netflix account since 2023 had a problem because of which it stopped working.\n\nI didn't knew at the time so i tried adding it 2 or 3 times manually but it kept giving \"there is something wrong with payment method please try a different method\". but when i switched to a different payment method (this one was Visa card), the error now has changed to \"we cannot complete the action at the moment please try later\". \n\nSince then i have tried multiple things with 4 different payment methods from different banks (1 mastercard and 3 visa debit cards).\n\n1. I have deleted my account, tried to signup with same email again.  \n2. used a different gmail to signup.  \n3. used multiple payment methods, and FYI i have tried these payment cards on different other services like spotify, crunchyroll, EA play even and they are working. even the mastercard that started this whole drama.  \n4. Used different device, used incognito. no solution.  \n5. i've even waited more than 48 hours.\n\n  \nive contacted neflix support team and they say all of my payment methods are not eligible which is why its failing, despite the error stating \"we cannot complete the action at the moment please try later\". I've contacted the banks of all 4 cards, and they say that:  \n1. They have not received any transaction request from Netflix.  \n2. All banks are saying that they allow their customers to pay for their netflix subscription through their payment methods.  \n3. The cards have allowed online transactions.\n\nThe payment methods i've used:  \n1. HBL conventional account mastercard (debit).  \n2. Bank Alfalah Visa (debit).  \n3. Nayapay virtual debit Cards visa both.  \n\n\nwhat am i supposed to do here?\n\nThe banks are claiming no issues on their end and that all their customers are able to and eligible to pay for netflix subscriptions. The netflix support team is keep on insisting to use different payment methods all are giving:\n\n\"We cannot complete the action at the moment please try later\".",

        "content": "My main 3 streaming services are HBO, Hulu and Netflix(and YouTube premium, but that's a whole different beast), but I've used others before. I'm not talking about the content on these services or how any company manages their original content, etc. This is specifically about the UI and user experience\n\nWhen I boot up Netflix, it's always snappy, it's always easy to find what shows I've been watching and continue, the app lets me go to a series page BEFORE loading an episode, it's the best about knowing I want to restart a movie/show when the progress bar is near the end, the \"are you still watching?\" prompt is actually consistent. Nearly all of this stuff is either worse or non-existent on the other streaming services I use. Hulu makes me jump through hoops to get to a series page. HBO Max will throw up huge show banner ads I have to scroll through before I can start looking at my library\n\nMaybe there's other streaming services that compete with Netflix more in this regard, but it's something that's really been bothering me lately. If I'm bored and don't know what to watch, I'll boot up Netflix 95% of the time because browsing it feels good compared to my other options.\n\nDoes anyone else here share this opinion? I've tried googling it, but all the Reddit posts are complaining about what shows are available or just complaining about streaming in general",

Just before creating this particular post, I searched to see if there was already a GLOW discussion, and I saw some from discussions from...over 7 years ago??  Is it possible the series is that old?  And if so, maybe it means that Netflix periodically re-releases or puts certain shows (like GLOW) back in the queue for re-watching?  I say this because...I'd never heard of this show until recently, and likely it's because when I signed into Netflix one day...a few months ago...that GLOW appeared at the top of my feed, and so I naturally assumed it was new.\n\nAnyway, for those not familiar, while a show about female wrestling sounds tacky, they've really done a great job with the show...the cast (particularly the female leads, as well as Marc Maron - who is fantastic in his role) is great.  The show is clever...well-executed.\n\nFor those who've already seen the show, I'm curious if, like me, you had assumed that Season 2, Episode 7 was going to be the series finale?  (That was the episode that included a...er...broken ankle - I don't want to give too much away ...any spoilers.... )  Considering that episode, and the way that episode closed out, I actually think it would have been a perfect way to end the series.  So imagine my surprise when I saw 'Next Episode' loading up on my screen.\n\nEither way, if you've not yet watched GLOW, I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso....Hot Spot (with Japanese subtitles) and Pernille (Norwegian subtitles).",

Do you all think that is at all possible at this point?  One year out?  So often it takes series to become successful after 1 - 2 years into it\u2026 such an incredible shame to not have faith in this series, we need it now more than ever.\n\nI guess I just wish I understood the industry more than I do.  In my ignorant mind, I would think an old school, heavy clout, heavily connected actor like Jeff Goldblum, or any of the other high tier actors on the show, could call up Amblin Entertainment and the like and get it produced somewhere else if Netflix insisted on canceling it.

        "content": "This is the first time I've noticed. In A Different World season 2 Ep. 22 there is an entirely ai generated transition sequence about a fourth of the way through the episode. I'm not sure if its anywhere else throughout the episodes and seasons, but this instance was so obvious and really quite bad. It almost made me want to just stop watching the show altogether though its one of my favorites. I understand AI is kind of a new wave and of course big companies want to jump on the bandwagon but it's really disappointing to see it so lazily and terribly implemented especially when it was completely unnecessary. It also makes me worry a bit for what to expect from the upcoming A Different World spinoff.",
