Like a trashy beach read. A mystery, sex, lies, and twists. It\u2019s a super fun romp. \n\nAlso: I see some comments stating that Brad and Jamie are underage, thus making some scenes uncomfortable. Idk about the book, but they are 18 years of age on the show. Still taboo because he is a student, but I did want to mention that. Malin did an interview on it recently. \n\nAll in all, if you want a quick and breezy watch with some bonkers moments, take a watch. ",

Also a platform making $$$ off of selling bikini pics of 12-year-old girls is wild. Would be pretty explosive as Alec Celestin recruited and partnered with Lucy Guo who is now the \"youngest self-made female billionaire\".\n\n  \nAny other ideas for a second season?",

This is consistent across all devices: iPhone, iPad Pro, and a LG OLED tv. Very strange. I hope I get my shows back eventually \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOriginal text:\nI was watching Scandal through again as a passive watch while doing chores and such, and after this last episode (I was somewhere in season three) it didn\u2019t play the next episode and it just\u2026went away completely off of Netflix. Off my continue watching list, and I can\u2019t find it searching either. I googled it and there was a Netflix link announcement from last month, that it was coming back, and that link took me to a \u201cremind me\u201d page for the show on Netflix, essentially saying they will remind me when it\u2019s available. I also noticed (though I don\u2019t watch it) that Grey\u2019s Anatomy is gone too. \n",

        "content": "I\u2019m really enjoying the show but sad to see very less chatter about it here on Reddit. What do you guys think about the episodes, judges, and Chef Leong so far? \nOne thing that i really wanted to get off my chest was that I adore and love Chef Pam for being so calm but I truly felt the wasted opportunity of her having the most amount of talented individual cooks in her team but failing when it came to strategies and executions. Also agree with the other two chefs that she\u2019s played the safest so far and hardly experimented or pushed her cooks beyond their comfort zone unlike the other two teams where I can visibly see growth of some contestants. It\u2019s sad that she\u2019s down to three members now as all 3 of them are much more deserving than most others in the competition right now.\n \nChef Ton is my fav so far. He\u2019s been getting the most challenging ingredients but does well. Also, no specific standout individual cook in his green team esp after the dessert guy left and yet they\u2019re acing most of the challenges under his brilliant guidance. Regarding Chef Art, even tho I\u2019m not a fan of his constant yelling, I\u2019ll still credit him for pushing his team beyond their comfort zones. Off used to annoy me but his and Aomsin\u2019s growth in the show is undeniable. As of now, I\u2019m rooting for Nokky \ud83d\udcaa \n\nOn Chef Leong - maybe it\u2019s just me but he rubs me off the wrong way sometimes. Find him unnecessarily rude soemtimes and esp hated the way he was so tone deaf with Dear\u2019s appeal of leaving the competition. \n\nThis was my personal take on the show so far. Please share yours as well!",

I watched Season 1 when it came out and while it was kinda bingeable, it felt super formulaic at times. Jackie moving in with a house full of brothers after a tragedy? That\u2019s solid teen drama setup, but I personally don\u2019t think they did enough with it.\n\nThe whole Cole vs. Alex triangle got tiring. Like, I get the appeal of the two-opposites dynamic, but Jackie\u2019s character development felt kind of all over the place. And some of the Walter boys basically existed just to fill background chaos. I didn\u2019t feel that emotionally connected by the end it felt more like a CW drama dressed up with a Netflix budget.\n\nThe characters just didn't do much tbh and the story looked little floppy to me as it went on.\nThat said, I\u2019m still curious about Season 2. Jackie\u2019s heading back to Silver Falls,(what a move after wrecking up) and they\u2019re bringing in new characters like a \u201cmysterious rodeo rider\u201d and some new senior guy who\u2019s supposed to shake things up. Could be good if they give more attention to the side cast and let the characters actually grow instead of just bounce between emotional decisions.\n Kinda wild they\u2019ve already greenlit Season 3, like, really? Was this series that famous?After one season that got mixed reviews? Netflix seems way more confident in this show than I am. I\u2019ll probably give the new season a shot, but it needs to step up with stronger writing and less trope-heavy drama. Just feels like a show still figuring out its tone.\n\nPS: I posted this on the og sub with spoiler tag and still good removed, idk wtf is wrong.",

        "content": "Not necessarily Netflix related, but I just watched Untamed and just found out this lead actor Eric Bana is actually from Australia. I'm from the Netherlands and I don't notice the accent, but I was just wondering... isn't it annoying for Americans that they can hear the accent and can tell he's not from the US? Or is it so well done that it's hard to notice?   \nIn the Netherlands actors shouldn't try to do a Flemish accent or even another accent within the Netherlands, 'cause you can immediately tell they are not from that area.

        "title": "Squid Game kinda lost its original theme in season 2 and season 3.",
        "content": "**A bit of context first:** I was one of those people who watched *Squid Game* as soon as it dropped back in October 2021. I was genuinely thrilled that the show was getting the attention it deserved, and I was really hyped for the upcoming seasons.\n\nThat said, I have to admit\u2014I\u2019m disappointed with how *Season 2* and *Season 3* turned out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re outright bad, but they lost the original theme and depth that made *Season 1* so impactful. The first season was a sharp commentary on Korean society, particularly capitalism. It portrayed a world where the lives of the poor were reduced to entertainment for the ultra-rich\u2014a brutal but honest reflection of societal inequality.\n\nIf Netflix plans to create a U.S. spinoff\u2014or one based in any other country\u2014I hope they do more than just swap Korean actors for American ones. They need to research and present social commentary that fits that country\u2019s context. Otherwise, it\u2019ll just feel hollow.\n\n*Season 1* worked because it explored the darker side of capitalism and the widening gap between rich and poor. Even the twist with Player 001 being the mastermind added a layer of complexity that elevated the story. *Season 2* tried to pivot toward themes like democracy and how easily the masses can be manipulated when money is involved, which had potential, but the execution fell flat. By *Season 3*, the games didn\u2019t feel as engaging, and the characters were far less memorable. It felt like people were dying left and right without much emotional weight.\n\nEven the subplot involving the soldier with PTSD, which initially added a sense of mystery, ended up being disappointing\u2014especially when it turned out he was lying the whole time. The police officer, who had so much intrigue in the first season, felt completely useless across the next two. And Gi-hun\u2019s death, all for the sake of the baby\u2014only for him to never meet his daughter\u2014felt like a bitter conclusion that didn\u2019t land emotionally.\n\nNow there\u2019s talk of a *Squid Game USA* and even a whole cinematic universe. Honestly, I think that\u2019s a bad idea, especially considering how the quality dipped in *Season 2* and *3*. I don\u2019t want this to turn into a franchise where the core idea becomes nothing more than \u201crich people watch poor people suffer,\u201d stripped of any real message or nuance.\n\nI can talk about this more",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI'm having a persistent issue with the Netflix app on my LG CX and was wondering if anyone has seen this before or found a fix.\nWhen I go into a show with multiple seasons (like \"One Piece\" in the video), I can't [properly scroll through them](https://youtu.be/s0LjJvWXvp8?si=RhuVeYrJjWhkoMIr). I can move up and down the season list on the left, but the episode list on the right doesn't update to match the selected season. It's just stuck on the episodes from the first season I clicked on.\nI recorded a short video demonstrating the problem: Https://youtu.be/s0LjJvWXvp8?si=RQeNgfSwKKHNd84e\nSo far, I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps:\n * Closing and relaunching the Netflix app\n * Restarting the TV\n * Checking for updates for both the app and the TV's firmware\nHas anyone else with an LG CX or another WebOS TV run into this? Any known workarounds would be greatly appreciated!",
