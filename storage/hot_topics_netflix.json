        "title": "Adolescence (groyper, incel)",
        "content": "Okay, I have a few things to say. So, first of all this was a super weird coincidence that I watched this today because I\u2019ve been learning about the alt-right incel groyper pipeline on TikTok literally all week after the you-know-who assassination because I was totally ignorant to all of that, and I watched Adolescence today literally not knowing AT ALL that\u2019s what it is about. I started watching it because that kid was the youngest to ever when an Emmy, and I was like oh must be good. Well it was good, and it was objectively the best time I could\u2019ve watched it and deeply understood it. I need to lie down. \n\nSecond, media literacy is literally dead methinks. I was on a different subreddit and this girl said she didn\u2019t like how the show propped up the killer and diminished the victim and other female characters, but that was LITERALLY the entire point. It even pointed out that the killers are always remembered and the victims are forgotten. Again, maybe if you\u2019re not super familiar with the alt-right incel groyper stuff which I also wasn\u2019t aware of until this week, I can see where you wouldn\u2019t totally fill in all the gaps, but the entire point was to show this normal kid who you could chalk his actions up to bullying when in reality, even if he was bullied (2 things can be true at once) he clearly displayed woman-hating, aggressive, and isolated tendencies that the girls in his class could recognize via his Instagram posts and behavior. Why would a girl want to hang out with someone like that? She also could see right through his little \u201cclever\u201d scheme of asking her out when she was at her weakest when it wasn\u2019t clever, he just thinks women are stupid and sub-humans that are just a means to a sexual end. To incels, they always look outward, never inward. This was also highlighted by the fact this was clearly a cute, not ugly at all little boy saying \u201cI\u2019m ugly\u201d over and over, so his scapegoat was his looks when that wasn\u2019t the problem at all. A lot of these incels who claim they are unattractive are actually attractive on the outside but behave in such a way that their physical appearance doesn\u2019t matter at all which is really the reason they can\u2019t get girls. It has nothing to do with looks at all, but the online chat forums and the rejection by girls reinforces their untrue ideas.\n\nThird, which pretty much I\u2019ve already covered more or less is that there was no twist which ended up actually being the twist because this is simply reality. It\u2019s these kids who are by all means normal at first but then fall into this echo chamber they can\u2019t get out of because their behavior reinforces their perception, and the parents are not sitting down with them and having important conversations about women and sex and simultaneously letting them stay on the computer all the time. The truth is right in front of us, which in this case is a double truth (1. we can clearly see him committing the crime on camera, so there is no plausible deniability at any point even though we want to believe there will be some big twist. 2. we know why young men are growing violent and discontent i.e. groyper chat rooms and unchecked internet use), but we don\u2019t want to see the truth. We the audience and we society. This was covered in the end with the parents pretty well. Tell me your thoughts. ",

I have my \u201csafe shows\u201d I always end up going back to but I want something new and I\u2019m struggling to find something. Most of the shows I watch are fantasy, horror, comedy, and drama. My biggest struggle is something I can watch for a while. For example I\u2019ve watched supernatural (15 seasons) or vampire diaries (8 seasons) but all I can find that looks remotely interesting is only between 1-3 seasons with episodes that are like 20 minutes each. I prefer episodes anywhere from 40min to an hour. \n\nSide note: game of thrones is not really for me. I don\u2019t think I could get past the first season but I might give it another shot. If anyone has any recommendations I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nI also enjoyed shows like bojack, Rick and Morty, and inside job so I\u2019m no stranger to more of the cartoony stuff but a lot of the recent stuff I\u2019ve seen just kind of seems boring or stupid.

By the time any new season of anything comes out, I've forgotten what's already happened. I think they just straight up don't give a shit about their customer base. ",

Might as well be a hobbyist. The show goes to great lengths to say how great she is, but nobody tries harder to say how great they are than our protagonist.\n\nIt doesn't feel earned. She's snarky and unhelpful to everyone except one particular employee, who... is obviously involved in this, but there's not really much of a reason for why only the newly appointed first in command of housing gets a pass when nobody else does, even when they're trying to be helpful.\n\nThey compare her to other fictional detectives, including Benoit Blank from Knives Out, but Benoit Blank feels different than this- he makes no effort to promote himself, and is kind and civil on the outset, only really dropping the mask and giving his actual opinions on people towards the end of each case. I think there are better choices for this mystery than Cordelia explicitly because of how horrible she is at dealing with people.\n\nAlso the actress talks in a dry monotone without much body movement while everyone else is putting their heart and soul into this.\n\nIt's a bit rough to watch but I love this kind of thing- does it improve?",

It's got that classic *Silence of the Lambs* vibe, and I was completely on board.\n\nBut the execution is just painfully slow. It feels more like a boring soap opera than a thriller, with characters just talking endlessly while nothing happens. The plot is full of holes you could drive a truck through\u2014the copycat's motivation makes zero sense, and there are entire subplots with red herring characters that are completely pointless and could be erased from the show entirely.\n\nI was so baffled by the writing that I wrote up a full, no-holds-barred review on my blog, **Freddy's Cine IT**. If you're interested in my full takedown, you can check it out.\n\nAlso, if you've seen it and were as confused as I was, the post has a **complete episode-by-episode explanation** to try and make sense of the convoluted plot.

        "content": "Hello!\n\nI have had my current account for several years and never experienced any issues at all. I am going sesh for business for a few days, and am looking to download a few episodes of NH favourite show. \n\nBut Netflix tells me I have too many downloads on my devices, even though I just checked all of them, and there are literally nothing. Wife and kids each have their own profile, and they don't have anything on them. \n\nWhen I address this to netflix, I get an automated reply saying I need to check my downloads, yeah right, or get another subscription.\n\nAny tips?",

        "content": "My brother and his family are currently living with my mother and i for the time being. He has three kids so we let them use our Netflix. It wouldn't be an issue, of his middle child would stop deleting my profile. She has autism so I don't blame her, I blame her parents for not watching her. I've told them multiple times and they say they'll stop it, but it keeps happening \n\nIs there ANYWAY to keep my profile from being deleted? I don't want to take the Netflix away but this is like the fifth time and it's very annoying ",

        "content": "So I'm experiencing the opposite of what I've been able to gather about recommended specs from Netflix. I have a G81SF (gen 4 QD-OLED panel), and everything is compliant down the whole chain from my GPU, cable, to the monitor and drivers. Edge reports HDCP 2.2 is good, PlayReady flag set. However, Netflix streams 1920x1080 and no HDR to Edge and the Netflix App on my Windows 10 PC. \n\n  \nThat said, oddly Chrome works verifiably in 4k HDR. \n\n  \nI spoke to a tier 2 tech and they had no idea and wanted me to video record my screen, which I didn't end up doing because it was late. Really odd experience, took me over an hour testing everything to get it to work.",
