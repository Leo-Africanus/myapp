I have some issues with some of the animation and the plot has a few inconsistencies, but one thing [I have no problems with is the music itself.](https://www.thepopverse.com/movies-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-perfect-k-pop-introduction-huntrix-bts-twice/) Every song is solid and represents a trope or genre within KPop. The first song feels like it could be on a Blackpink record. The Saja Boys song was inspired by BTS. The big confrontational song is sung by members of Twice during the credits. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that KPop Demon Hunters is very good and has a great soundtrack. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting a gateway drug to KPop.",

        "content": "This is somewhat tricky because the algorithm of Netflix suggesting new titles to you is a black box. But should you, for best results, rate based on the quality (meaning objective rating - acting, camera work, writing, cinematography etc.) or on the content (the genre, topic, setting, story etc.)?\n\nFor example if you had two movies  \nA) A sci-fi action comedy movie that has amazing camera work, acting and writing.   \nB) A medieval murder mystery thriller that has miscast actors, useless subplots stapled on with horrible acting and amateur cinematography.\n\nNow if you really really like a medieval setting, thrillers and especially murder mysteries are 100% you jam and you really don't care for action, sci-fi or comedy, how should you rate the movies? \n\n* If you go for the objective rating of A+ B- will you now see more sci-fi action stuff that you don't really care for? Or will you be treated to highly rated cinematic masterpieces of every kind? \n* On the other hand if you try and curate your stuff and go for the subjective rating of A- B+, will you get more of the themes you are looking for or will you be flooded with borderline unwatchable straight to DVD crap?\n\nThe \"I love this\" option made it a bit easier so if it's something that is both objectively and subjectively great for you, you know how to vote, but if I don't like something for the quality but not the setting or other way around, I often don't dare \"dislike\" it, because of how it might misunderstand *what* I disliked.",

        "content": "Why can't there be a way to select editing of movies as a form of parental control?  For example if you could select \"remove nudity/violence levels/sexuality/language\", a parent could control which portions of a movie are edited as if for general TV.\n\nThere are so many movies I watched growing up that were really good for kids, but one certain scene makes it R or MA, etc.  I didn't know this until I watched some classics on streaming and found out it was edited for TV.  I might recommend something as safe without even knowing if it really was.\n\nAs an adult I hate censorship, but for certain ages it has a place.",
