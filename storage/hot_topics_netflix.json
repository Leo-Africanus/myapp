        "content": "I read an old post when searching for this subject but my situation is different from most of the replies and the post itself. I\u2019ve contacted Netflix support twice today and a few other times in the past about this dumb household limitations. You can only request a vacation code in advance and only a few times a year. I travel for work often and Netflix ALWAYS force closes every minute in all  hotels. At first I thought it was Marriott hotels all having shitty TVs but finally caught onto the pattern that it is a NETFLIX issue. Prime and Max work perfectly fine in all my hotels. But I cannot use Netflix in my hotel rooms while my husband uses it at home. (I pay for more than 1 screen btw.) even if my husband is not at home and I log out of every single device and only log into my mobile phone and the hotel tv, Netflix still force closes every minute on the tv. There\u2019s no option to update household on the TV Netflix. It just doesn\u2019t exist. Does ANYONE have anything they\u2019ve done that has helped with this or advice? Do I just cancel Netflix atp?\n\nTL;DR Netflix \u201cset household\u201d isn\u2019t an option on my hotel tv, I cannot stream Netflix while I travel for work, and I travel often. Any tips/advice?",

Like, we get it, dude. I swear, it seems like his material hasn't been interesting since he got the divorce and Frankie moved out, and I think plenty of people probably feel the same way also. And the crowd got annoying at times during the special too. Like almost ever word he said evoked an applause from the audience, and I think he got more cheers than laughs that night there were so many!",

With Lucy traveling back from 2024 to 2003 to stop a serial killer, Zendaya's role would have been pivotal! Her star power and resemblance to Madison Baily (who plays Lucy) would have made them the perfect on-screen sister duo. It\u2019s like they were meant to play siblings or even twins. Think of the hype and increased viewership this would generate! But with her salary being around $2 million for big roles like \"Dune 2,\" would it be worth the investment for Netflix? How do you think this casting choice could have shaped the film's popularity and viewer experience?\n\n Let's dive into this casting \"what if\" and its potential impact on views, buzz, and the movie itself.

        "content": "Does anyone remember a cheesy coming of age movie about a boy who\u2019s in his senior year? He starts a trend online or it has something to do with the internet. It starts a huge movement. He has the news at his house. He was being pressured to get into good colleges by his parents. He meets a blonde girl and they go to the beach with her friends. It\u2019s based in california. She wants to be a model. The movie ends with him following her to europe as she\u2019s trying to become a model. It was on netflix maybe a few years ago. I feel like the front cover of the movie was of him with like a bright aqua light blue background. It was super underground but i\u2019ve been looking for it everywhere and want to make sure i\u2019m not crazy.",
