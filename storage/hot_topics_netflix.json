        "content": "After a quick search I see this documentary has been talked about quite a bit here, but the one thing I haven\u2019t seen mentioned is the fact the documentary is almost entirely filmed on police body cam.\n\nI personally found this fascinating as someone who enjoys seeing live clips, police interviews, especially when tied into a documentary.  (For me it adds an extra layer of \u201crealness\u201d to the documentary.)\n\nI wonder if we will see more true crime documentaries filmed this way with the advancements of technology and body cam footage etc. I think the documentary was beautiful put together and even with majority of the documentary being on body cam footage, it still told a very clear story.\n\nCurious to know anyone\u2019s thoughts on this? Did you think the body cam footage made things \u201ctoo real\u201d? Invasion of privacy? Would you like to see more true crime documentaries that include police body cam footage etc?\n\nTIA! \ud83d\udc8b",

I had thought I'd seen most key pieces by now and had moved on to other things when this video popped up in my suggestions. It begins with Bodycam footage not included in the movie or the trial. It shows the neighborhood and police discussions in the immediate aftermath, as well as other footage from that night woven throughout that I haven't seen elsewhere. I thought some of you may find it interesting.  https://youtu.be/lYXD9SMCa-w?si=k3Zi0efuzmhFAxjh\n\nFor those just starting down the rabbit hole: \n\nRecent interview from prison \n\nhttps://youtu.be/V5-DIGPi_dU?si=DPZbUg5M2dhTuD7w\nHere are the full interrogation videos post shooting \n\nInterview 1 \nhttps://youtu.be/puQmH_d8yVw?si=YxWmWv-fCoGlTBax\n\nInterview 2\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lZ74O5qxI0w?si=3IurVUXKQjU0f2vr\n\nFor those who haven't seen the trial, I will post those links as well. There was some pretty important evidence that I wish had been included in trial. She is actually am even bigger monster than what we saw in the movie.

A bit of fighting aspects are also additional points too (kinda like Bloodhounds or Weak Hero)\n\n\nI'm looking for people with the same interests and give me some recommendations with films that sorta have the same background since I don't know much films with the same vibes lol.\n\nThank you so much!",
