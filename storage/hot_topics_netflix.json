        "title": "Million Dollar Secret Winner",
        "content": "This is one of the best reality game shows in Netflix. I was hooked from the beginning.\n\nThere were plenty of times I wanted to scream at the contestants, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell them this\u2026\u201d to convince them you\u2019re not the millionaire, but they end up getting emotional, defensive and raising voices. I learnt that getting defensive like your \u201clife\u201d is on the line can be a truth / honestly signal instead of a signal for deceit. It happened every time in the game (eg Chris, Jaimi) \n\nFor example, Jaimi was twice a suspect. One for voting Lydia and telling the truth. (Sam and Sydnee lied so they wouldn\u2019t be targets) No one believed Jaimi. To me, if I was the millionaire (or not), I would lie about voting Lydia because it instantly puts a target on my back because that was the clue. Jaimi admitted to voting Lydia. So it was obvious she was telling the truth! If you were worried of being caught, you would lie.\n\nStill, no one believed Jaimi. When they found out from the clue that she wasn\u2019t the millionaire, Jaimi could have used that as proof to the group for the next time they suspect her.\n\nAgain, when she was the suspected millionaire, everyone thought it\u2019s her because she told Sam to having two sisters (clue) and everyone refused to believe that another person would conceal it or lie about it. They would always target truth tellers (eg Jaimi or Corey in this case) When Jaimi was in the chopping block, again, she just screamed and cried to defend herself which we already know does not change people\u2019s minds.She could have used the last time she was suspected as proof that she was telling the truth (eg Last time you didnt believe me, and you found out I was telling the truth. This is a game of deception, someone is lying. Anyone who has been honest has been an easy target and has been pinned as the millionaire)\n\n Next, I feel terribly bad for Corey in a way. I don\u2019t think he would ever be able to trust anyone after this show. Lol but in a way, he was naive and his intuition was off throughout the show. He always suspected easy targets instead of thinking deeper (if I was the millionaire, how would I act?) this was missing from him throughout so in a way he was easily manipulated by Cara.\n\nFinally, I feel conflicted about Cara winning because she wasn\u2019t that exciting to watch. But by the end of episode 6, I had a feeling she would win or at least play big in the finale. Why? Because she flew under the radar, everyone trusted her, and she actively kept information about herself hidden. She chose not to share. Her intuition was correct almost all of the time too (Sam was asking info about her sisters because she knew she had the clue, Corey and Sam would vote Sydnee out, Sydnee had immunity, Corey took her box etc) She played the game so very well because of her intuition but I so wanted the winners to either be Sydnee or Sam. They just actively played the game and revealed just enough, but because they were threats that put them in everyone\u2019s radars to be voted off either way! \n\nSam was correct most of time but her emotions got in the way in which she trusted Cara. She kept saying she didn\u2019t have it in her to think Cara would even ever be the millionaire because she wouldn\u2019t let herself go there - that Cara is capable of deceit. This was Sam\u2019s downfall and toxic trait lol Had she kept people at bay and not let her emotions cloud her I believe she would have won. Corey was the same but Corey was off throughout lol \n\nI wonder how they are and what they think about how they were all duped as Sydnee would put it.\n\n\n",

        "content": "okay, in the beginning, i totally loved Brad. I thought he was such a cutie young lawyer who was sincerely interested in Alex's case and helping her with her inheritance. He seemed like a trusted person who he valued her moms wishes for her. HOWEVER.\n\nNina, his girlfriend, was so wonderful and sweet. And the whole time Brad had to play BFF'S with Alex and get WAY too close to her for no reason. I didn't understand why he was so bent on entertaining Alex so much and becoming too friendly with her. She was his client. And he had a great girlfriend (who he seemed like he loved).\n\nAlso the fact that Alex showed no respect for Nina. And how she showed very little remorse for being the reason that Brad could have cheated. \n\nSo no, I was never rooting for Alex and Brad. Though I get why Alex would like him -- he's wonderful, cute, successful, kind, and somehow intertwined with her mom's passing.\n\n\n\nI really saw potential for this plot and film. I thought everything her mother said about Alex was true when the film started. That Alex was not truly living her fullest life for some reason. And I think bringing out 'The List' was a wonderful idea. It was poignant, touching, and sweet everything that her mom articulated about what her daughter may not able to see for herself, or ignoring.\n\nHowever, I think that having it become a thing, of now Alex has to go out and achieve every single goal in order to receive her inheritance and videos of her mom pretty strange, and rigid.\n\nPointing out 'The List' was a great thing to do. But not to make Alex go out and do them for a goal. She has to find it in herself, in her time, to do those things. Not for someone else, like a little checklist. But yes, to give a nice acknowledgement and nudge to Alex- I like. I feel like acknowledging 'The List'  was supposed to be about giving a general outline of things that may bring meaning to Alex's life, who seems lost at the time.\n\n  \nI know this was based off a book, and to be fair it was a cute book idea. But seeing it visually made me realize, that some of these things would not be great in real life. just my thoughts. what are your thoughts on the movie?",
