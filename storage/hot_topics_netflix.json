You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

        "title": "Adolescence - Episode 3, rehearsals and acting question",
        "content": "I just finished Adolescence on Netflix and was pretty blown away by the acting, especially since they shot each episode in one continuous take.  Specifically, in Episode 3, there's a 45+ minute scene in which the young boy (Jamie) is in conversation with the clinical psychiatrist Briony.  \n\nMy question is, how did that young actor (Owen Cooper) pull it off? Did they do a ton of rehearsals? Did he ad-lib any of it?  Did they have his lines posted up on big boards that they hand-held for his use, which they somehow managed to keep out of sight of the (constantly moving) camera?  How many full takes did they do before they determined that they had what they needed? \n\nApparently he's an unknown actor and this was his first role. Even if he's older than 13 in real life, he's pretty darned young to be able to pull off such a performance. \n\nUPDATE - found this article - [Owen Cooper in Adolescence: is this the best child acting debut since Jodie Foster? | The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/tvfilm/boy-adolescence-owen-cooper-b1217411.html)  \\- he was 14 at the time, and the 50+ minute episode took 3 weeks to film; 1 week of rehearsals, 1 week of 'tech' rehearsals, 1 week of final filming with 2 takes a day, roughly.  So maybe they did up to 10 takes and picked the best one? \n\nPretty amazing. ",

There have been a series of of young boys who were killing young girls with knives, and it was really upsetting,\u201d director Philip Barantini\u00a0[told TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/adolescence-netflix-cast-creators-behind-the-scenes/)\u00a0this month. \u201cThat was the seed that we wanted to explore, and send a bit of a message and maybe spark a bit of a conversation.\u201d",

There's alot I can and want to say about the show but to streamline this Jamie discussion I'll leave it at I loved the show and acting.\n\nAfter finishing I started scrolling through r/Netflix and the amount of threads and comments about how Jamie is a monster, he was a psychopath, etc... was shocking to me. \n\nYes what he did was horrible and the way he did it was clearly very brutal, but like wasn't the entire point of them constantly mentioning incels supposed to be a clear indication that Jamie was not actually a \"bad\" kid, but just a victim of this Andrew Tate anti-women movement? I thought it was so incredibly in your face the entire show that it would be impossible for anyone to not realize what the message of the show was, but like I said I found an astounding number of threads and comments completely ignoring that Jamie was molded into a monster, not born one.\n\nThe 4th episode is just the parents grieving about what they may have done wrong and they even literally talk about how they thought he was safe at home on his computer, how more obvious can the writers / directors make it? Yet somehow people came to the conclusion he was just born a psychopath and all he needed was a trigger?!?!?\n\nTLDR: This show is about how the incel / anti-women movement impacts our young men correct? Not about the next John Wayne Gacey getting caught early before he could do more harm? Its shocking how many people completely missed the purpose of the show and somehow came to the conclusion that Jamie was just a natural born psycho and nothing more.",

I did find her escapades during her stint with the royal family and after trying. \nBut the vitriol directed towards her in this show is excessive, inaccurate and unfair. \nThe show itself is charming. For those who say it\u2019s \u201cun-relatable\u201d she never claimed to try to be. She\u2019s doing her, and surprise, surprise she\u2019s rich. Shocker. I don\u2019t know how people are so offended by her choice of cookware, the fact that she has a large garden, time on her hands to harvest berries, and elaborate utensils when that\u2019s literally her life. If you can\u2019t relate have you considered that you\u2019re not the target audience? I think it would be worlds more offensive if she tried showing people how to bargain hunt or use coupons to seem relatable when clearly that\u2019s not her life. \n\nMeghan comes off as warm and genuine and you can tell the people in her life who she invites on genuinely care about her. The show is used to discuss their friendships and their lives and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s scripted to hype her up. The conversation goes both ways and it\u2019s a show about connecting with people. \n\nShe clearly knows her food. It might not be to everyone\u2019s taste but you can tell she derives genuine enjoyment out of food and preparing it. \nFolks mad that her recipes are not groundbreaking, guess what? None are. Even Pinterest regurgitates recipes that have been around for eons. She is just sharing what she likes. \n\nI think in the first episode she mentions that the kitchen she\u2019s in is not hers, but there\u2019s another main kitchen she cooks from for the majority of the show and that\u2019s in her house, no? \n\nAnyway as much as I\u2019ve never really liked the lady, the amount of vitriol she\u2019s receiving for this show is unwarranted and unnecessary.

        "content": "Soo I\u2019ve randomly been signed out of my Netflix account,the phone number on the account had changed,my email was unverified and the profiles are in another language. The new profiles that have appeared have a watch history from months ago which doesn\u2019t make sense as It\u2019s only happened to my account recently,I\u2019ve changed my password and signed everyone out but that hasn\u2019t helped it kinda looks like my usual account was deleted and my email is being used for a random account but I\u2019m still being charged for my usual account although it seems to be deleted,can anyone help me out?? I hope this makes sense lol",

        "content": "I recently opened my android app to find a message saying 'Your device isn't part of the Netflix household for this account', even though it has worked for the past few years and I am on the same WiFi as the rest of my household. About 2 months ago I used my account in a hotel abroad, but that was via the hotel TV, which I verified via my phone - might that have something to do with it? The hack with turning airplane mode on and off seemed to work, but is there any long term solutions?",

Its not very often i get emotional over a TV show but this is one of the best series I've seen. Now if only Netflix would fix their new horrible interface then i'd be happy.\n\n# ",
