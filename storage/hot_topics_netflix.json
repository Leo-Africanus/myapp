        "content": "Greetings all, I just received my Philips 65OLED809 and I have a weird issues concerning a sort of framedrop/slowdown in some scene when using Netflix in HDR/Dolbyvision on the TV App. \n\nI'm very sensitive to motion and for me the issue is really apparent when using motion smoothing \"Standard\" or \"Smooth\". By exemple in \"Wednesday\" in the first episode at 6m36s there is a slowdown when the guy is speaking with his head closer to the windows, or for a second exemple in \"Squid Game\" in the first episode between19m18s and 19m28s there is a quick lag when we see the main character. This is subtle and not really easy to notice at first but once seen \u2026 \n\nI have not this issue on SDR, when I desactivate HDR on the Netflix app everything is smooth.\n\nI have not this issue either on my old 65OLED854 in the Netflix TV app or when using my Shield on this older TV model.\n\nI tried to plug my Shield (2017) on my new 809 (I tried the 4 HDMI) to see if the same issue occurs in Netflix and again I got the same lag/slowdown. \n\nI switched the Shield to 4k 23,97fps from 4k 59,94fps and no more issues ! \n\nSo it seems to be an issue with the TV not able to keep the motion well if the refresh rate is not the same than the video played when HDR/DolbyVision is enabled. And since there is no way to change the refresh rate in GoogleTV, I can't see how to solve the issue. ",

        "content": "Minor spoilers ahead!! \n\nI'm pissed at the reaction to thos show; it feels like a lot of people hate on it because they think it's piggybacking off of Squid Game, and I really don't feel that way. Squid Game was cool but it didn't really have substance to me, it felt like a game for the most part, it felt like that's what the showrunners treated it as. \n\nBut The 8 Show, *I* believe, has such a fucking fantastic message that ot portrays so beautifully. I think the cruelty of 8th Floor and 6th actually shows you what it's like being in the shoes of someone poor going up against someone rich. I think 4th floor and 5th floor being 'slaves' to the upper floors, and, somewhat by choice, not helping the lower floors is also fucking spot on. The lower floors stick together -- except one of them really needs the money, and will do *anything* to get it, including hurting the people around them. \n\nI was bothered by some plot holes, but i can explain things like 2nd locking them all up by... Well, they didn't want more time, but now that they have it... And 5th being naive and delusional makes sense, too, to me at least. Lots of whacky shit, but it's so raw and intense that I think it did its job well. \n\nAnd with the ending, I think it tied things up well. I did NOT like the games, I did NOT like the brutality, as a matter of fact I was so disturbed i cried at some parts and the only reason i didn't skip things was cuz i didn't wanna miss story, or miss the emotions that came from things like 3 fucking HOME RUNNING 1'S HEAD. \n\nChills.\n\nIt's not for everyone. But I've been poor all my life, and i have had a lot of friends and family in different places. All the different systems of hierarchy and power that are put in place is what gets people killed. As an anarchist and anti-capitalist, the message resonated with me, not manhy shows or movies I've seen capture just how genuinely brutal and uncaring the *systems* are while somehow making sure to keep every character somewhat empathetic or understandable. Except 8. Fuck 8. \n\nGreat show, the hate is undeserved, i don't think it's really about the story so much as what it's trying to tell you. ",
