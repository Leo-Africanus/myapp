Down to the snippet of needing someone from Dublin in the band because without it, the band would be incomplete. Instead of following an algorithm or method to create a band it seems like he\u2019s taking the individual characteristics of the One Direction members and searching for them in these young talents i.e. the Irish one, the big brother figure, etc..\n\nThoughts?",

She was shot during his attempt to rescue JFK. The timeline\u2019s one final, resounding, (petty) \u201cNO!\u201d To him. He\u2019d already decided to let Kennedy die at the end; who cares what that old man had to say? That old man was trying to prevent a DEATH from occurring. HE was just trying to date a girl. Who\u2019s to say she would die? \n\nMy first thought was \u201cbring her into 2016!. Let JFK die.\u201d He lived in the past for years and the ONLY time the past tried to push back was when he actively tried stopping a HUGELY historical event. Who\u2019s to say the timeline would even give a damn about some harmless, small time relationship? It\u2019s at LEAST worth a second chance. If it doesnt work out AGAIN (due to some random, uncommon freak accident) reset, consider it irrefutable proof that they can\u2019t be together and go about your day. But for me, I would\u2019ve given it a second chance.\n\nReal love is hard to find, also, and this is just my shallow side speaking, there\u2019s absolutely ZERO chance in hell I\u2019m giving up on a woman that looks like HER without giving it all I\u2019ve got at least one more chance. That\u2019s going to haunt him forever. It would haunt me. Either, bring her to the present (no more risky to her life than his life being at risk when he lived in the past for years), or live in the 60s, bring some of the coolest, coldest tech that would work then, and a print out of every major sports event worth betting on. And one more thing. Since, at the very least, we know his cell phone can play already downloaded memes (when he distracted the mobster with the phone on his bed), I\u2019d grab 2 laptops, a charger, download as many movies, sports, ect from our (future) timeline, and blow Sadie\u2019s MIND with Thanos whooping each Avenger without even trying, Quentin\u2019s best, and Marty\u2019s classics. \n\nHe really REALLY dropped the ball.
