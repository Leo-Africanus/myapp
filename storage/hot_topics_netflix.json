He must have one hell of an agent - he is the star in half the movies on Netflix. \n\nAlso, Chris Pratt is not a good voice actor. I wanted to watch the new Garfield movie but can't tolerate his voice acting. \n\nBoth Wahlberg and Pratt are better off in ensemble casts - they're not interesting enough on their own.  ",

Either have a rule that all first seasons have a closed story arc or give shows time to build viewership.\n\nGood example - dead boy detectives = I'm devastated there's no season 2, but it was a closed arc, all major ploy points resolved and I don't feel that netflix stole 8 hours of my life.\n\nBad example - the midnight club, or a whole bunch of others that I had on a watch list and then removed when I found out they were cancelled but left on a cliff hanger. I have no incentive to watch them now. \n\nAt least where there is a closed arc, I may still go and watch a cancelled show.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

As well as the excellent new show Territory was only 6 eps. I was also looking ahead and 2 shows I'm insanely excited for Black Doves and American Primevil are also going to be only 6 eps. It's insane that every few years it feels like they push the ep count lower. Which is extra crazy because they count shows on minutes watched which basically sets new shows up to fail and is the reason we have no new shows.",
