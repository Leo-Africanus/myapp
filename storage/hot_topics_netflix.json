        "content": "I\u2019ve just finished Pluto after stumbling upon it by chance on Netflix. I was actually just looking for something to have playing in the background, without the intention of actively watching it. Ever since Vinland Saga and AoT, I had pretty much given up on finding something genuinely good in that space \u2014 especially on Netflix.\n\nFirst of all: did anyone else notice how many hints and references there were to Monster?\n\n1. Tenma being a scientist/doctor.\n2. And what I found even crazier: they basically adapted Julius Reichwein 100% as Ban-Kouchou. He looks exactly like Julius Reichwein. Like, 1:1. \n\nI also really loved the many Evangelion references (e.g. \u201cpierced Braun 1589 \u2192 Adam pierced by the Lance\u201d). Those are just the ones I personally noticed.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m left with a few questions:\n\n1. How was Braun 1589 able to kill a human? And how was Gesicht able to kill a human as well, when they technically shouldn\u2019t be capable of that? As far as I understand, only Pluto \u2014 and Abdulla \u2014 should have been able to do so, since they were equipped with unpleasant emotions. Braun and Gesicht were created as \u201cnormal\u201d AIs.\n2. Why was Atom able to lie to Helena at the end?\n3. Who is the teddy bear, and why did Braun decide to kill him?\n\nI get that, especially in sci-fi, you can\u2019t avoid a few plot holes \u2014 but there were quite a few things that ultimately made me settle on an 8.5/10.\n\nThe lack of fight scenes didn\u2019t bother me at all \u2014 quite the opposite. There were so many incredibly beautiful and symbolic images: Pluto crying together with Atom, Epsilon slowly shattering to light etc. It all felt almost like a dream. I think it was a very smart decision by the creators to prioritize these atmospheric visuals over action scenes.\n\nI might have liked to see at least one female member among the seven robots, though.\n\nLastly, I really wonder why this anime is so relatively unknown. And: do you have any other anime recommendations? I had basically given up on the whole medium, but Pluto has given me hope that there\u2019s still something truly great out there.",

I think this will be the moment where Henry notices that Holly is no longer under his control. I think this is when he will visit her in the wheeler house by going into her mind similar to how he did when he was \"Mr Whatsit\". Its maybe a bit out of the blue and not possible at all but its just a fun theory lmk what you think or want to add on!!!",

        "content": "OKAAAY! This is gonna blow all your minds. As Benoit Blanc would say \"Here's my checkmate show\".I just finished watching Knives out-WUDM, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But as in any whodunnit we as viewers play the role of detectives itself, as if the mystery is ours to unfold.HAHAHAHA.... Call it coincidence but the last show I watched was \"Midnight mass\", also a brilliant mindfuck horror with heavy religious commentory.While I was watching it, I cannot unsee that both of these stories share very similar plots, characters, mythology and overall setting. Now when I am writing this post, I can conclude KNIVES OYT WUDM is just whoddunit version of Midnight Mass. Let me show you what I am talking out-\n\n1)Both the stories have the basic theme of faith, christanity and power of religion. The central plot in both of theme is of reserruction, literally and metaphorically. There are actual angel statues hanging from walls in WUDM for gods sake.\n\n2)Both of the stories are set in a Christian conservative american small town and main plot revolved around regulars at the church.\n\n3) There is a Monsignor in both of the stories. He dies in both of them and is reserrected (literally in MM and fakely in WUDM). A more suprising bit is the vessel of death- which is POISONED COMMUNION WINE in comon in both of them.I swear if Josh Brolin would have actually reserrected from the tomb, it would actually turn into a horror story.\n\n4) Both the monsignors have fathered an illegetimate child, which is the driving force behind their evil plans.\n\n5) The events of death and reserruction occur within the same week in both the stories-EASTER WEEK.\n\n6) The protagonist in Midnight mass (Rylie) is a guilt driven murderer who has lost his faith in christ. The protagonist in WUDM(Jud) is also a murderer who has accepted faith due to his guilt.\n\n6) Apart from Riley and Jud, other characters also share a lot of similar traits. Like a disabled girl in a wheelchair visiting church daily in hope of a miracle. I laughed out so hard in WUDM when she stands up and Martha (caretaker) proclaims it as miracle. Exactly similar outcome in MM when Leeza walks out of wheelchair and whole town takes it as a miracle.\n\n7) The main culprit in both the shows turns out is not Monsignor but the church caretakar lady (Bev in MM and Martha in WUDM) who would go any lenghts to protect the church and maintain its beliefs among the townkeepers.",

        "content": "It's official, they cancelled Boots after 1 season. They keep doing this with shows, pushing them out just to cancel them after 1 season. They keep doing this over and over, and the shows tend to be LGBT shows or shows about minority groups.I really enjoyed Boots and even had a watching group from work. They don't look at viewership because when they did release data to Nelson about viewership, we saw that even high viewership of one-season shows was getting cancelled.",

        "content": "So recently, I watched the Flanagan series with my mom. She loved every one, though at times, Fall of The House of Usher was a bit much with the gore and sex. Her absolute favorite was Bly Manor. We also watched Wednesday, she loves this show. In the end, she also liked Beef, but thought it was a bit too crass at times.\n\nNot Netflix but she also liked 9 Perfect Strangers on Hulu.\n\nBasically I'm looking for quirky shows that are sort of sentimental and ultimately wholesome, maybe bittersweet dramas with real meaning to them, but aren't too sexual, violent, or vulgar? and very much character-focused.\n\nShe doesn't mind anything related to relationships or kissing or LGBT content or anything like that, romance is fine, just when anything sexually explicit is shown on a regular basis.",
