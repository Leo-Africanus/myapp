        "content": "As a Palestinian, I was upset with Netflix that MO was only 2 seasons. It seems to obviously be rushed, so I don't think it was the original idea to only have it as 2 seasons. Clearly there were some ugly people that didn't want the show to continue and put pressure on Netflix.\n\nNow I could say that Netflix are cowards if that is indeed the case as I assume, however, I don't think that. If anything, Thank you Netflix for having the guts to allow this show to exist. To produce it and to put it on your platform. It truly is a hilarious, wonderful, heartfelt show that shows the struggles of Palestinians. I would say it is a love letter to Palestinians and our beautiful culture.\n\nThe actors were absolutely wonderful, and while some of it was just hard to watch, particularly MOs struggles. The show left me feeling good and hopeful.\n\nParticularly I loved the Thanksgiving get together at the farm. It was just beautiful to see all these people who are different come together because it felt they were all family.\n\nSorry if my post sounds corny, but I really did love this show so much.\n\nAnyway, for those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It's a brilliant, clever and outrageously funny show.\n\nThank you Netflix.",

That said\u2026 this movie was not it.\n\nI haven\u2019t read the book, so don\u2019t come for me- I\u2019m judging purely on the film. From the very beginning, both main characters were insufferable. Poppy leaned too hard into the chaotic, ultra\u2013Type B personality, while Alex was painfully rigid and Type A. We\u2019re told they\u2019re best friends, but the movie never convincingly shows why. I genuinely couldn\u2019t see how they\u2019d tolerate each other for more than 20 minutes, let alone build a long-term friendship.\n\nThe chemistry was nonexistent. On top of that, the emotional cheating while they were both in relationships was uncomfortable - are we just supposed to normalize that now?\n\nThe pacing was off, and the story tried to cram in every rom-com trope imaginable, which made everything feel rushed and forced instead of charming or organic. I kept waiting for it to click\u2026 and it never did.\n\nDisappointing, especially for a genre I usually adore.",

He was kept out of every important family thing for years. He must have been feeling as an outsider. I think after all these reveals I couldn\u2019t have lived with this family any longer. This could have saved it for me. But instead now he has the secret. Mayor dislike. ",

If they just got in this physical fight I don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve appeared all happy walking out of his truck? \n\nAnd what kind of teenage girls pay men to rape another teenager and just watch, what do they get out of that? It shows Rachel getting paid but is she not rich herself why does she need the money? Also, these men are so despicable to do something like this then what\u2019s to stop them from not paying and raping all of them for free? \n\nAnd why is Lexi mad at Anna when Anna saved Lexi from getting raped at her own expense? And does she know her husband is sleeping with Anna? If yes, why is she ok with it and what were they planning on doing at the lake house?\n\nWhy did Zoe tell Jack Anna isn\u2019t who you think she is based on the 20yr old rape?

The insider from the cult that kills Dee Dee mentions that she will make another off shoot of the cult and makes it seem like there are more out there that weren\u2019t caught in the raid. When Paige explains what led her to go back to rehab she specifically says she \u201cfound her truth\u201d wich is exactly what Dee Dee says when she joined the cult.

        "content": "GyeongSeong Creature is another incredibly cool and exciting series from Korea. When you watch Korean series, all American series start to feel like soap operas with the same plot but lots of spectacular action to cover up the fact that they have nothing to offer. I've been seriously thinking about canceling my Netflix subscription and switching to KOCOWA+ instead, because it seems like I only watch Korean series these days.",
