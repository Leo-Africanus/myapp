The young cast were also very reliable and it had some great recurring characters especially Paul Walter Hauser as Stingray. The fight scenes were well choreographed and it was nice to see so many of the cast from the older movies return. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spinoff too considering how popular it was.",
