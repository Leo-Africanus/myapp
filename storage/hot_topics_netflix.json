Truthfully, if they'd tried to do a modern adaptation of it then ending up with freddie should've felt right\n\nQuite frankly, they should've switched brayden and freddie, give brayden (as freddie's role) more screen time so it adds up to the persuasion plot. If they wanted this show to be a second chances trope it clearly backfired super hard  \nMoreover, i'm pretty sure by the public outrage s2 endgame is most likely going to be braydriana. Riley and Brayden will not work out and neither will freddie and adriana. I hope Adriana and Freddie get the closure they deserve tho\n\nI'm a huge fan of this whole figure skating romance trope. I really liked spinning out and i was super bummed when it was discontinued, i was hoping for this to be bettter\n\nPS- is there anyone who's a fan of adriana and freddie ??? bc as soon as i finished the show and opened insta- all i could see was just insane braydriana love, like yeah their chemistry was off the charts but i couldn't help but feel for the whole freddie and adriana trope too. The moments they had were more emotional and intimate otherwise. ",

I just find it really predictable and corny? Like take episode two for example. The two plot lines of the adult and child aliens play out the same, there's something they want to fix, it seems to be working for a while but the flaws that were obvious from the beginning turn into problems. These are resolved in typical fashion and with the children especially, it's emphasized how they were never in any real danger to begin with. This scene establishes further that these aliens are seemingly untouchable and that every mistake they make is reversible. This is something that already bothered me in the later seasons of Rick and Morty.  \n\nDid they assume the audience has no assessment skills whatsoever? Why is every joke so in your face?? Terry screams at Korvo to find out why he is so stressed (Get it, it's funny because HE is the one stressing him out and doesn't notice) Im so so sick of watching slop like this",

        "content": "Is it just me, or did Season 2 of Sandman feel a little rushed? I still enjoyed it overall and I\u2019m not saying it was bad (nein, not at all), but something about the pacing felt off compared to Season 1. In the first season, everything had time to breathe like characters, motivations, even silence mattered. Season 2 felt more like \u201cokay, next plot point, next scene\u201d without letting things fully settle.\n\nLucifer especially stood out to me. After how intense and meaningful the finale of Season 1 was, I expected that arc to have more weight or long-term impact. Instead, it felt kind of disconnected, like der buildup didn\u2019t fully pay off. Not bad, just\u2026 lighter than expected.\n\nI\u2019m not a hardcore Sandman fan or comic reader, so maybe that\u2019s part of it. Still, as a casual viewer, the shift was noticeable. The ideas were cool, the visuals were great, but the emotional glue wasn\u2019t always there. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it (ja, possible), but I\u2019m curious if others felt the same or if this is just how the story goes.",

        "content": "Wow, so many rules.  \nI can't even mention certain terms without them being removed by a bot.  Well then, how about my take on this show?\n\nOkay, so firstly I commend the effort to have a very quirky and different type of story telling. I am unfamiliar with this universe, so I had an open mind. Quickly I noticed that the acting, while over the top at times, was actually pretty good, but there are things in it that make me wonder about the writers.  \nSecondly but also possible spoiler if you read this first but holy carp a DINO EGG?! Come on. Not a fireball, not a rematerialization, no not at all instead a rather round huge egg way far off from where the group was...very interesting direction leaving it open to possibly another chapter however strange of a twist, which I am not gonna lie, I would watch it too.\n\nThis feels more like a anime with less over the top action than a real motion show...it is strange and satirical at times and I am not sure it was meant to be...\n\nI really love that farm hand in the one scene was Hammish from Viva La Dirt League over on youtube. Honestly some of the VLDL crew are wonderful actors and so fun.\n\nI guess if I was giving it a rating I would probably rate this as a solid 8 out of 10, but add a bonus point for the naivety of the entire thing. Normally something like this would not hit but somehow works with this series. SO deal with a 9 out of 10. If you want that last single digit point you are gonna have to make another season!\n\nSecond time posting this, hope it does not get auto removed this time.\n\nThanks.",

        "content": "Watched all 3 eps of this yesterday.\n\nI have only a passing interest in BritPop, but I recognised a lot of the songs that the Band did. They sounded so familiar. The entire series is voiced by Gary Barlow (He's more or less the main character here), Robbie Williams and the rest of Take That.\n\nA fairly standard tale of how they peaked and (with the exception of Robbie Williams) dropped to obscurity when they broke up. It was cool seeing how their reunion tour revitalised their careers again. I wasn't aware the band has been active for the past 10 years.\n\nDidn't Robbie Williams have a biopic movie last year? I remember it flopping because nobody knows who he is in the States. ",
