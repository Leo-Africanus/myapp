Most movies don't have that many dubs and subs anyways, it can't be that hard to display ~20 languages.

I get their concern with sharing, but there are better ways to verify identity, maybe using facial recognition or something similar. The concept that you can only ever use one IP address is ridiculous.\n\nAre there any workarounds? No option for a temporary code...\n\nI have done this for 5 years and never had a problem. No other apps have this issue.\n\nJust Netflix.\n\nIt's enough to make me consider cancellation.",

Lazy, horrible writing. I can go into much more but it\u2019s truly not worth it. \n\nJon Bernthal is great and gives it his best but even he can\u2019t really escape the again, horrible dialogue and plot. \n\nTessa Thompson is objectively horrible. Prior to this she was fine in other things. Not spectacular, not bad. She also is not given help with an awful plot and dialogue but god she was incredibly bad. So many scenes that were laughable and clearly a set of a show with soap opera type acting. \n\nTessa was not the actress to use in this show and well it shows. Nobody could\u2019ve done the story justice sure but she made it a lot worse. \n\nThe climax.. her mom with \u201cdementia\u201d ends up being the killer.. yawn yawn yawn. That whole final act was such a drag and so lame. So many obvious and dumb red herrings all the way across the series. \n\nI typically won\u2019t comment on something that I think is this bad but I\u2019m seeing so much love that I can\u2019t even wrap my head around. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you enjoyed this series, you are easy to please. ",

I'm watching it in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and the Audio Descriptions cannot be turned off.\n\nNothing I did could change this.\u00a0**&lt;wind whistles&gt; &lt;soft music swells&gt;**\u00a0and such interrupted the dialogue nonstop.\n\nWas on the phone with Netflix for 40 minutes doing everything from switching profiles to rebooting my entire system before the poor fellow I've been talking to puts me on hold to talk to his supervisor.\n\nHe returns to tell me that the Audio Descriptions cannot be turned off for Frieren.  And it looks like this is true for at least some other subtitled shows as well.\n\nCan this be true?  Seems straight up unacceptable.",
