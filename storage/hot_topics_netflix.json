Fortunately, today I took myself to go and watch it. Glad I did.\n\nWhen watching, I genuinely thought that it'll overwhelm it's viewers with chess technicalities but thankfully no. It blends the thrill of playing with personal drama and so all. Chef's kiss, the best way they could've done it.\n\nThe realities of child prodigies and the 'curses' it comes with it was beautiful portrayed as well.\n\nTruly a masterpiece.",

Now they can appear as very realistic AI avatars. Is this a good thing or a bad thing?",

It makes some content basically unwatchable.\n\nYes, I've made them semi-transparent and tried different colours, but this is a sub-optimal fudge.\n\nWhat is stopping netflix configuring the brightness properly (or at least letting us do so)?",

        "content": "What in the \u201cHallmark made a mystery movie\u201d is this nonsense?\n\nI\u2019ve had a tough time recalling worse acting in a series, foreign language subtitles come to mind, and still make this look bad.  How in the Howie Mandel doing handstands on a handkerchief did this limited series trend at #1? I\u2019m genuinely shocked at how bad this acting, writing, and over all production turned out to be. It\u2019s so bad I stopped at the start of episode something or other to write this Reddit and I\u2019m already having exceptionally more fun with my limited time on a work night. This series is like someone farted in a closed room with no ventilation after eating at Joes dinner sub 4:00 am. I believe watching the history of how man made Velcro shoes in the 1980s would have been a substantially more valid use of my evening. Who in the wide world of sports memorabilia watched this and gave it a thumbs up? Walking down 22nd street at 3:00 am hitchhiking a ride to New Port Richey would be a more productive use of thumbs or ups. I paused the TV with an \u201cI\u2019m not mad I\u2019m just disappointed\u201d expression and pondered my viewing choices or wondered if I should donate my TV to help educate underprivileged tribes in Papua New Guinea. I think the parents and entire community of people that raised the individuals responsible for making this \u201climited series\u201d monstrosity should be forced to pay a tax and plead guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. I\u2019m beyond words for how incredibly underwhelmed I am at the thought of this dumpster fire to continue. When in the Men are from Mars women are from Venus did Netflix decide \u201clet\u2019s go with this one.\u201d? I would rather go back to the recent Gasparilla parade wearing a thong while eating Icecream than watch this nonsense any longer. Please just say no to drugs and this series, it\u2019s honestly that bad. I may delete my subscription to all streaming platforms and go pray in the Himalayan mountains for a solid year after this waste of hours, minutes and seconds with no purpose. The only redeeming quality is this is a \u201climited\u201d series.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA concerned viewer",
