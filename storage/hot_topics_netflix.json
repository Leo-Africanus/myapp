        "content": "I\u2019m currently on Season 1, Episode 7, and I\u2019m still trying to understand the hype. The writing is slightly engaging\u2014it knows how to keep you hooked with well-paced cliffhangers. But the acting? Yikes. It feels wooden, overly staged, and completely devoid of nuance, like a table read that somehow made it to the final cut. Some scenes are so stiff it\u2019s almost impressive.\n\nI\u2019m pushing through because I want to see if there\u2019s a real payoff, but so far, it feels like a show that succeeds despite its cast rather than because of it. \n\nDoes it get better, or is this just what I signed up for?",

How do you find new random stuff to watch?

The homepage shows the same shows/movies in 6 different categories, and pretty much after 2 hours of browsing I just end up putting on a documentary I half-watch while browsing reddit.\n\nTLDR: Any tips on how to navigate Netflix and find new stuff? It really seems designed layout-wise to advertise a small selection of shows Netflix wants you to watch instead of letting me discover something truly new to watch.",

        "title": "Netflix has seriously harmed it's reputation with how often it is now cancelling shows",
        "content": "Netflix has seriously harmed it's reputation with how often it is now cancelling shows. What used to be seen as the go-to service for saving cancelled shows, has now become the very thing it swore to destroy {Hello There Obi-Wan Kenobi reference). Netflix likes to repeat it's standard line that they have never cancelled a successful show, but they conveniently never tell us how they measure success, because this doesn't ring true with their shows like Lockwood &amp; Co and Shadow &amp; Bone, that got to both Number 1 and Number 2 respectively in Netflix's own published streaming charts, and that still wasn't enough to save those shows from cancellation. Also Netflix clearly has favourites in terms of marketing, for example I enjoyed the show Everything Now, but you've probably never heard of it, and I searched Facebook - Netflix did one post about it when they dropped the trailer 3 weeks before it's worldwide release, and that was it; but other shows like Bridgerton, you can't fail to know it's there because they post daily about it on their socials for weeks up to and including release and for weeks after too. You even have actors in a new show saying they have to search their show to find it so they can watch and it's not even advertised on Netflix's own home screen, let alone anywhere else, so no wonder these shows get cancelled as they are never given a fair shot to succeed.\n\nIt seems unless you go viral or break Netflix's own streaming records, like Stranger Things or Wednesday, then even getting the number one or number two spot is not good enough to save a program from cancellation. Netflix needs to remember that not all releases are an overwhelming overnight success - even some of the best and most popular shows took a while to find their audience, like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The West Wing, The Sopranos, but then when they did find their audience they became what everyone was talking about, and people who had never seen the show, still knew about them from it's impact on the cultural audience. Somebody else said, and I truly believe it, that if Netflix had made Breaking Bad today, they would have cancelled it after two seasons, and then think what great storytelling we would have missed out on, all because the show wasn't a record hit in it's opening week.\n\nAnd now Netflix finds itself in a self-fullfilling loop where they have now trained their audience to not try new shows and get attached as they'll likely be cancelled. Think about it, how many new shows can you think of on Netflix that got renewed last year. It only seems to be people will tune in for shows like Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Outer Banks, as they have had time to grow with the characters, so now Netflix has got themselves in to a model where customers don't try a new show, like KAOS or Everything Now, and they'll wait and see if it's renewed, and when after only a month since it's release, it does indeed get cancelled, the consumer hasn't wasted time getting invested in a show &amp; characters that get cut short, especially nowadays when there is so much to watch across traditional TV and now streaming services too, that just because the audience doesn't come running to watch as soon as it drops, doesn't mean it's not there or interested.\n\n2025 see's the return of some of Netflix's biggest shows like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things, but 2 out of those 3 also end this year too and then what shows will be left that are associated with the Netflix brand - they had Stranger Things, House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black when Netflix first got going, it'll be hard to say by the end of this year what big shows Netflix will have left to draw customers in\n\nUnless Netflix, and the wider industry, change their perception to not only see massive, viral numbers as success and that shows with strong-moderate success are allowed to grow and widen their audience, then there will eventually reach a tipping point where they will cancel one show too many that either customers leave their service, or creatives will decide that Netflix isn't a good partner to work with where you put years of work in writing, filming, producing, editing a project just for it to be cancelled a month after it's release, so if you have a story that needs more than one film or a one and done series to tell it in, then Netflix probably isn't your best bet any longer.\n",

Reason is recently started watching Dahmer and it was boring as hell, I have picked it up because I guess Netflix not sure kept on suggesting me this show but turns out to be awfully bad and boring I mean maybe the cast and the story is all good but the pace for me is really slow or not my type I like though slow burn as well, hence not sure what to watch next. Recently I watched Squid Games S2 liked it right now watching Kota Factory, BB Money Heist and Narcos have watched long back and Peaky also I have liked a lot. Trying to avoid long shows already with more than 2 season to start with and will take long time. There are lot of recommendations online but I want something good like you know Breaking Bad and all. S\\*x Ed is in watchlist maybe for later. I hope you all got it what I want? ",

        "content": "After years we decided to come back. Since day 1 the Netflix app on our TV and phones was giving us trouble. This is waaaaay worse than it ever was. Somehow we managed to start watching what we wanted. By the way we chose the cheapest option, ads and all. Midway through our watch the tv app didn\u2019t work anymore. It kept saying there\u2019s a storage issue when there isn\u2019t. I can\u2019t even cast the content from my computer to the tv. \n\nI can\u2019t download the app on my iPhone because it needs to be at least version whatever the fuck. My wife can\u2019t cast the shows from her top of the line android phone to the tv. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?????????? What is this business model???? They really do want to push users away? We still have 20 days left in our subscription. Obviously after all the trouble we had today I cancelled it. \n\nWe still have until 22 of February and we can\u2019t watch shit if not on a phone or computer. What is the point of this??????",

What other great shows can be found in netflix? In desperate need of something to watch",

        "content": "I watch Netflix through my Sony Bravia TV. Does anyone notice that the Netflix user homepage seems to have slightly changed.\n\nUsually, they put the pic of new and popular movies/show up large in front. But now they put our \"List\" and \"Still Watching\" in front instead. Which is convenient i guess, but i thought the old format was more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAre the rest of you seeing the same thing?",
