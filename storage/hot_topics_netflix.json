These people lived in different areas of the US. It seems it was very widespread but Netflix is completely ignoring it and gaslighting us with how successful it was to not upset investors.  I guess they are not wanting to engage and hope it fizzles out while they correct internal issues before next stream, essentially making us beta testers.  \n\nI had friends over and spent an hour fucking with my home network thinking it was on my end until I saw others reporting issues.  It was beyond frustrating... then when it did work it looked like dog shit... I pay for 4k/HDR.  This is 2024, the scaling technology is there, yet they cut corners somewhere at the expense of its customers.  Oh well... cancelled just on principle. Ive been with them since early DVD delivery era.  Sorry, just ranting... tired of greedy corporations bending us over.  ",

        "content": "Hi.  I was recently browsing through the Netflix options, and found in my profile a new option \"TV Animation effects\".  Tried to Google how to enable or disable but just found people with the same question as me.  In Youtube and a couple of websites, it says that to \"reduce animation effects when navigating on tv\" to put a check mark in the empty box. That seems pretty straight forward.  But in my account, under my profile, it says \"TV animation effects\" and under \"Reduce motion transitions\"  At the right side there is no box for a check mark, but a toggle, that is either gray with a minus \"-\" sign or if clicked again, it turns blue with a check mark sign.   Does the check mark still means that transitions are reduced, or since is blue with the checkmark that transitions are actually enabled and can be seen?",

        "content": "I've paid for Netflix for my immediate family (Parents, brother) since sometime in 2018.  I've lived alone, they still all live at the house where I grew up.   2 houses, 4 profiles.  So yes, that was bad and I was part of the problem.  Bad TitanSerenity.  Bad.  Moving on.  When they announced they were cracking down on sharing, I was like \"Fine, whatever, we'll pay for the extra household or whatever thing.\"\n\nFast forward to last night, my brother tried to log in and finally got caught, and got the popup about households.  I \\*thought\\* that I'd made the right adjustments to my account when the notice came out back in spring, but apparently not.  \n\nSo I crated a member account, which he activated, and we transferred his profile.  All went well.  \n\nThen we go to transfer Mom and Dad's profiles to that member account, becuase they're the same 'household'/would be coming from the same public IP.   Only to then find out that Member Accounts can't have more than one profile.  \n\nSo this is really stupid, because if you're restricting it to IP/Geo, what's it matter?  After talking to support, it turns out it would've been perfectly viable to make myself the member (since I live alone and only have one profile), and leave them on the 'main' account so they can have multiple profiles at THAT location.  \n\nBut support tells me that once the profile is moved off the main account, it can't be moved back.    \nWTF is that?  There's zero technical reason for that.  None.  So I can't undo what we did and fix it. \n\nSo now, basically I'm going to have to jump through a bunch of hoops to create accounts, move profiles, etc etc, only to end up at the same place they won't let me go.  I'm going to end up within the rules, at one household with 3 profiles on it, and a member account with one profile on it.  Why are you going to make me do all the gymnastics to do the thing I can just go do anyway?  Completely assinine.  \n\nI already have the technical infrastructure in place to do the thing that I can't say I can do on this sub.  I'm half tempted to do it now just out of spite. \n\nDid I miss something? Is there an easier way to do this?  ",

Bought the regular $7 version if that matters into the recommendations. I\u2019ve already started watching Outer Banks started and finished the first season of it last night/early morning. TIA for the recommendation of other shows/movies to watch ",
