        "title": "Had fun at Netflix House Philly",
        "content": "Had a fun time at the Netflix house. Here are my opinions:\n\nAs soon as you walked in, the host invited you to a movie screening and it was completely free. Not sure if that was only because we went on a Saturday. Their theater is a gorgeous Netflix red color and the fabric seats are very comfortable with plenty of room. The seats do not recline. \n\nThe host will also give you a rundown of everything available &amp; answer any questions you have. There was definitely no shortage of staff wherever you went and everyone was so pleasant. They also had security guards on duty in high traffic areas. \n\nTons of selfie/picture opportunities available in the general admission areas. You\u2019ll find yourself dodging photobombing people left &amp; right during the busy times.  My favorite section was definitely the Bridgerton display; was gorgeous! \n\nThe gift shop was also in the general area &amp; extensive! They had so many unique things available for purchase, so if unique Netflix related swag is your thing, you\u2019ll like their shop. \n\nI didn\u2019t try their restaurant in the general area, but a full restaurant is available to purchase sit down meals. \n\nPaid features:\n\nMini golf - we didn\u2019t do the Netflix show-themed mini golf so I can\u2019t give my opinion on this experience. \n\nPuzzle experience - the Philly location currently has The One Piece puzzle. It was so much fun. I recommend it for teens &amp; older fans as you have to figure out clues to proceed in the game. You also have to participate in slightly physical games and you have to work together as a team. You do not have to be a fan of One Piece to enjoy the game, but fans appreciated all the detail even more than the average attendee. They estimate a 45minute completion of the game, but my team only took 30 minutes; I guess we\u2019re a smart bunch. That leads me to say, if you\u2019re anti-social, avoid at all costs. Each game needs 12 players for very specific reasons. Unless you bring 11 people with you, you WILL be grouped with people you do not know. Please don\u2019t be that person that ruins the fun for everyone. \n\nArcade experience - The Philly location has Wednesday as its gaming adventure. I assumed Wednesday would be a puzzle just like One Piece as it was the same price, but it was not a puzzle experience. This adventure is for sure for all ages but younger kids &amp; teens that are fans of Wednesday Adam\u2019s will have the best time. The main area is an arcade themed around the Adam\u2019s family. The rest are gorgeous photo opportunities. If you are not a fan of Wednesday, I wouldn\u2019t suggest this experience. This area\u2019s attention to detail was far beyond my expectation and it was amazing being able to take photos in live scenes from the show. There is a small puzzle aspect to this area, if you can find it ;). Definitely keep your eye out for posters telling you about the puzzle. I\u2019m still a bit confused why this experience is timed. You basically enter &amp; can do whatever you want. My only thought is that it\u2019s to keep it from getting too crowded at one time. I did enjoy this experience but did not feel it was worth the hefty price tag. \n\nVR experience - The VR game was by far my favorite part of the Netflix house and well worth the money. We did the 45 minute Stranger Things VR and maaan, that thing was tons of fun. It\u2019s a physical experience &amp; lots of movement is involved. You\u2019ll be grouped as 6 people per experience &amp; the hosts give you a thorough walk through on how to setup your gear. When purchasing, you can choose 25 minutes of 45 minutes. Afterwards you\u2019ll be able to sit and watch snippets from your experience that the team records and edits. You\u2019ll also be given access to your recorded session afterwards. You can either wait for them to email you a copy of the video, or you can scan the host\u2019s QR code &amp; download it immediately. \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience. The biggest stand out was the staff. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re feeding those people in the cafeteria but everyone \u201cdrank the koolaid\u201d and was 100% dedicated to their characters. \n\nEven if you just want to stop by and check out only the free stuff, as a fan of the bigger Netflix shows, you\u2019ll find something for you to enjoy. If you pay for anything, do the VR. It is the best bang for your buck as it\u2019s a lower price than One Piece &amp; Wednesday. ",

        "content": "So I saw online a lot of people bashing fate and saying it doesnt compare to winx and how it's not even similar, but the literal show isnt even called winx its called \"Fate\" a winx saga, which i heard people complaining about the name being misinterpreted and how it's a complete different show than what winx club is. Anyway, my views on the show are netrual to good but I think with better writing the potential is very high for succession. When I first watched it, I had watched winx clube a few years prior and while it was alright it had things that I didnt like same as with the Fate saga. But when I first watched fate a few years ago I was very excited to hear about a second season, I do agree with the fact that some of the characters are bad and the storyline could be improved aswell and how the removed flora and replaced her just to bring her back, like wtf. But overall when I went into watching the show I had very little remembrance of the winx club and when watching fate saga I didnt have anything to compare it to, so my raw feedback is that its an entertaining show and the little spin on making it gory and adding more modern stuff really makes the show lore or less watchable. I dont really think nits underrated its just over HATED, plus winx club went to crap after they turned into those believer fairies or whatever and compared to that fate the winx saga is good.",
