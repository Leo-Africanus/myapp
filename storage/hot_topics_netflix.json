        "content": "Jack Reacher, Jack Ryan, James Bond, Jason Bourne, whatever. The trope of the hyper competent spy action thriller that's geared specifically towards the male demographic. There are so many of these already, and apparently we needed another one?\n\nIMO what set the first season of The Night Agent apart was the male/female duo dynamic which tapped into both demographics and a wider audience. And while the writing occasionally went on the corny side, I appreciated the realistic aspect of physical limitations, i.e. the fighting was often clumsy, Rose was the computer wiz and not suddenly defeating men twice her size in hand-to-hand combat, and Peter wasn't this unrealistic prodigy agent who was somehow equally talented at technology and combat - they both needed the other in a believable partnership.\n\nSeason 2 felt like they were diverging away from the formula in order to turn it into another long-running spy thriller franchise, which the show runners pretty much confirmed in an interview. Also, the decision to make her suffer from PTSD and anxiety, and be in therapy twice a week felt entirely out of place considering Peter is somehow completely mentally unaffected? And how has no government organization recruited Rose yet to be a cyber intelligence officer? Instead this season wrapped up with her effectively becoming his Bond girl, with the writers saying it's undecided if Rose will even be back next season. Peter being willing to trade his whole life to save her and Rose in turn being like \"this gives me anxiety, I just wanna go back to Silicon Valley and be a normal girl :(\"\n\nAll of this made complete sense btw when I found out S1 is based on a book, and S2 was the show runners writing without any source material. For me the season was a letdown, and I'm honestly just uninterested in the direction they're taking this show",

I love history and after doing a deep dive on the story, I found out that, while dramatized and a handful of fictional characters sprinkled in for the sake of good storytelling, it was in fact very accurate. I really love Kerry Washington's portrayal of Major Charity Adams, especially the scene where she tells Dean Norris, \"over my dead body, sir!\" Especially since this scene actually happened in real life. She was a woman, being sick of mistreated for so long, that she wasn't going to let anyone stand in her way of what she wanted. ",

I know the show is not meant to be centered around romance but I mean come on if your going to have it even as a sub genre I would hope the actors are somewhat romantically compatible. The only time I ever saw any affection was on the boat in s1 but otherwise nothing. I felt Rose did love Peter but it felt circumstantial and she was just so shitty in s2. I was quite literally shipping them with everyone else, I mean Peter had more chemistry with Noor and Alice then Rose atp and I think their relationship should\u2019ve ended in s1. I watched interviews of Gabe and Luciane and the actors seem to have some chemistry but it just didn't translate on screen for some reason.\n\n",

I understand that people don't see the logic behind some stuff or that a character ist annoying. But oh my god... do you really think that every human being isn't at some point in their life annonying? It's realistic that Rose can't decide if she wants to stay or to go. Every normal human would act like that. But for some reason you guys always want some perfect series with perfect plot and perfect people. It's just a show. Don't take it so serious. \nYou can criticize it, but come on, they didn't want an oscar for the night agent. \nIn the end of the day, I want to escape my real life, watch a show and forget about my problems.

        "content": "The most common glitch i have with my Netflix is that when I finish a title, I have to desperately guess where the right time it is to stop it (Usually when they give recommendations).\n\nNormally, the title should rewind to the beginning. But these days, it doesn't do that. I have to press \"Play from beginning\" for it to disappear from my \"Still Watching\" list.\n\nRefreshing the App doesn't help. Any common glitches you all face?   \n",
