And as a result, I\u2019ve wanted to watch it again so I could at least explain to them why it wasn\u2019t as great as they say.  \n\nIt just became available on Netflix in the US, not sure about other regionals.  I just finished watching it, and my god am I blown away.  I recommend anybody who has not seen it to give it a look.  The subject matter is VERY relevant to what\u2019s going on in the world right now and Tarantino\u2019s nasty and violent style makes it work even better in the year 2025.  That must\u2019ve been some great weed back in 2009 cuz I didn\u2019t remember a lot of it.  Woof, terrific movie. \n\nGive it a shot y\u2019all.  You won\u2019t regret it.  Cheers. \u270c\ufe0f",

        "content": "I really liked it. It's a great crime thriller with a ton of climax and tense atmosphere all around. The whole vibe is perfect, super dark, gloomy Scandinavia and I love the role the little chestnut mans play in it. The main detectives, Thulin and Hess, have that classic clashing-partners dynamic that totally work. The story may not make a lot of sense until you know the chain but it does well to ask you to just go with it. Also, a heads-up, it is quite graphic. Even with its flaws, it\u2019s an awesome watch if you're looking for a dark, fast-paced thriller with some good twists and turns that'll keep you hooked, go for it!\n\nI'd give it a 7.8/10\n\nFlaws: some may feel its a bit predictable (I didn't feel that way) at the end and you have to suspend your beliefs about the killer's abilities lol.",
