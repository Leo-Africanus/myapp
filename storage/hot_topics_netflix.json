First and foremost - having a degree in literature doesn\u2019t qualify her to be a financial analyst? I guess technically she could have done internships or whatever BUT STILL I felt like a big part of the beginning of the book was that it\u2019s her first time studying literature at a higher level and that was how the contrast was created between her studies at Oxford vs. her career in DC. I feel like everything that was good was taken out. Every scene was either changed or replaced entirely by a new scene. A lot of the characters were portrayed different in the movie from how they were written. I never expect an adaptation to be spot on but if they really wanted to change everything then why even call it an adaptation at that point? Just write a different story!",

I saw a lot of people being annoyed that the watcher wasn\u2019t revealed but i felt like it was pretty obvious that it was the neighbours, especially when you consider them being in the tunnel, their group about conserving the houses, everyone getting letters once they have a bad interaction with them, and the fact that the man is a librarian and they mentioned theres a typewriter. One thing that annoyed me badly was the tunnels, they were so desperate to find out but yet didn\u2019t go and explore the tunnels better themselves, the answer literally could have been revealed by then. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that when the two ladies invited Nora over, she hears the thuds, left looking terrified, just to never bring that up again. I really wanted to like it and I felt like it could\u2019ve been great if they actually properly worked on the storyline. ",

It was a series about food and why certain food became famous in certain places. For example the first 2 episodes consisted of NY and how the water became integral to the rise in falafels (i think) and the next episode was how a girl rescued the original sourdough mix during the san Francisco fire. It also gave a brief history on how the cities originated. I've tried everything, even going back through my viewing history with no luck. I'm beggining to think I've imagined this !

I wouldn\u2019t even be mad if they released it like one episode a week because that\u2019s how live tv has worked forever, but no, this way 8 episodes would only be 2 months worth of subscriptions and they wouldn\u2019t be milking another month out of you. I\u2019ve literally ALWAYS had my subscription, and don\u2019t cancel it, so I don\u2019t even care about the money aspect, I\u2019m just irritated I have to wait ridiculous amounts of time to finish one season of a show.

        "content": "happy Gilmore 2 got a bunch of views on Netflix, and everyone said that this was proof that it was a good deal for both of them, but doesn't that prove the opposite?\n\nSandler could've released the film in theaters and made way more money than the $2 million at most that Netflix pays him per film, he would also have more creative control.\n\nNetflix could just let him release the films in theaters and then buy the streaming rights to them for far less, without having to spend nearly as much money, they could license the film for $10 million instead of spending 80 million making it, and if it flops, they don't take any of the risk, they just don't buy the rights to the film.\n\nhow Is this a good deal for either side when both of them could make more money releasing the movies the regular way?",

        "title": "The Residence: the blink and the note SOLVED",
        "content": "MAJOR SPOILERS for the end of The Residence!\n\nI think I figured out the issue with Lilly's blink and the note! I looked a bit to see if anyone else has already explained this but didn't see anyone so if I'm just super unobservant I apologize.\n\nThe problem we all have is that Cupp claimed that knowing about the note in the jacket pocket identified the killer, because only the killer could have known it was there prior to the discovery/investigation. Lilly claimed to have seen Bruce put the note in Wynter's jacket, which Cupp would find later.\n\nThe problem is that anyone could have told her the note was found in his jacket, and in her version of events she \"knew\" it was there because she \"saw\" Bruce put it there. Lilly could absolutely know the location of the note in her version of events, making the fact that she had the location of it not a gotcha at all.\n\nSo what was Cupp getting at when she said that detail identified her as the killer?\n\nIn order to understand this, we have to do what Cupp taught us to do earlier in the season - establish context.\n\nThe Lilly reveal and the investigative hearing are intercut with one another. What is happening in the hearing is giving us context for Cupp's frame of mind during the reveal.\n\nThe biggest thing she emphasized to the committee was all about context and possibility. She had to entertain the idea that Elsyie and Bruce and Doumbe were ALL innocent. That there was a fourth person.  She needed to consider this option, and she did.\n\nBefore Lilly's \"blink\" Cupp jumped up on the table and announced that the existence of the door meant that anyone in the room could have done the crime. THIS was her flashing her wings.\n\nShe then made a point of saying \"If I'm wrong (about none of the most likely guilty three being involved), one [points to Bruce] of [points to Elsyie] you [points to Doumbe] definitely did it.\" This is her establishing that she was operating under the assumption that the three of them were NOT involved. She was entertaining the possibility that the three were already ruled out.\n\nIf she was wrong about ruling them out and flashing her wings and no one blinked, it was safe to put the three back in the running as the killer. But if she was right and the flash revealed someone else...\n\nSo if Bruce, Elsyie, and Doumbe were not involved at all, HOW did the note get in the jacket?\n\nLilly admitted to being in possession of the note right up to Wynter's death. The note needed to go from her possession into Wynter's jacket. Either Wynter put it there himself or the murderer put it there, but no other person was in possession of the note between Lilly tearing it out and it being placed in Wynter's jacket.\n\nKnowing, not WHERE the note was, but the sheer fact that the note DID return to Wynter, was what gave her away, because only the killer could have known (not WHERE it was, but) HOW he got the note back after Lilly tore it out.\n\nIn Lilly's story, the note goes from her to Wynter via Bruce, making Bruce the last known possessor of the note. Without Bruce - and again, this was the CONTEXT Cupp was operating under at the time - there is no one in possession of the note between Lilly tearing it out when he was alive, and it being discovered in his jacket when he was dead. Lilly's own admissions give us no reason to believe otherwise.\n\nSo if the three - and Bruce in particular - weren't there for the murder, the only way the note gets from Lilly to Wynter is if she gave it to him at the time of the crime. If she had given him the note earlier and not been connected to that period of time, she would have had no reason whatsoever not to share that fact, as it distanced her from the crime. But she herself admits having it up until his death. This is how, if Bruce, Elsyie and Doumbe were not there, Lilly's the only possible suspect.\n\nAnd here's a huge piece of the puzzle: WHY did Lilly tear a page out of Wynter's journal? What possible scenario could allow this detail to happen? Why would Wynter's journal be in her presence, much less the target of her anger?\n\nI think it's because of Wynter's records. I believe that Wynter showed her the journal when he threatened to expose her, and Lilly, realizing that the journal was his record of her crimes, tried to take it from him, but he wrestled it away from her and she only tore out a scrap.\n\nIf Lilly had just said nothing about the note, she could have gotten away with it. If she'd not given such a specific detail, she could claim that, for example, she left it at his desk, or lost it, or even not tell anyone she tore it out in the first place.\n\nTelling Cupp she had the note up until his death was one detail too many, and in the CONTEXT of the other three NOT being in the room, identified her as the only possible killer.\n\nSo when Lilly was the only one to \"blink\" at the flash of Cupp's wings, in conjunction with the fact that she alone had the note she herself tore out of Wynter's journal, along with her overwhelming motive, she made any other culprit impossible.",

        "content": "So I started watching the new Season after watching the first one bc yes I never watched it before. It gives me an immediate comparison and after watching Ep 1 of the new season so far I\u2019m not getting into it at all. Honestly the fact that Xavier is not in it is a huge loss for the show, I googled why he\u2019s not in it and it\u2019s just ridiculous. Nothing has been said officially! I read he has been seeing working the door at some bar \u2026not sure if it\u2019s true. But whatever happened to him getting cancelled so easy. It\u2019s just weird. To me he was a huge part of the series and the storyline between him and Wednesdays in my opinion was the most interesting one! I\u2019ll obviously continue watching just to see if it gets better but I\u2019m actually upset he\u2019s not in it. He was to me the most interesting character, artistically, of all besides Wednesday of course! What do y\u2019all think? ",
