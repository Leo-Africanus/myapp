The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much.

Love on the Spectrum comes up saying a new season will be released April 2, so I planned to binge the season while I had access that day since it was my day off. When I checked Netflix this morning, it said the new season was being released April 3, so I figured I got my dates wrong. I decided to renew my subscription since there's a new season of Black Mirror coming out in a couple of weeks, and as soon as I did that, I suddenly have access to the newest season of Love on the Spectrum.

If a super creepy guy asks you out, turn him down clearly but nicely. Don't use words like \"I am not desperate\" even when the guy is full-on creep festival. Don't anger it. Say something like your parents are conservative and want you to focus on your studies for now etc. \n\n3. Even when the creep is a Certified Baby Incel, don't call it by that name. Even when you go on his Instagram and see that he has left aggressive comments below pictures of models, that doesn't mean you are entitled to comment on him. His bullying is justified. Your bullying will justify your murder. So just leave him alone. Reduce your own social media use. \n\n4. Don't roam around lonely places alone at night. You want to hang out, do that in a bustling park or food market where many grown-ups and and families are around. So if the freak tries to stab you, there is at least a possibility that you will get help. \n\n5. If you are an older woman with a aggressive husband (like the mom in the show), don't procreate. If you cannot stand up for yourself and are just going to passively live life like a doormat, at least don't propogate this toxic behavior by having his kids.\n\nAnything else? ",
