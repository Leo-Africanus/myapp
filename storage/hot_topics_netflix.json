I was hooked from the first episode, fully invested, and halfway through, I had that creeping realization: \u201cOh no\u2026 this feels canceled.\u201d And of course, I was right!\n\n No official announcement, no goodbye, just radio silence. Honestly, it\u2019s such a bold move to lure viewers in with such great storytelling only to pull the plug without warning. Truly inspiring.\n\nWho needs closure or a satisfying conclusion when you can just leave characters and audiences dangling in a void of unfinished arcs? The way you cancel shows based purely on streaming data instead of giving them time to grow? Absolutely visionary. \n\n\nNothing says \u201cwe value your time\u201d like pulling the rug mid-binge. Really, Netflix, thank you for reminding me not to get emotionally attached to anything on your platform ever again. Great job keeping disappointment fresh and consistent!\n\n",

        "content": "This show still to this day in 2025 has such a loyal fan base, of which I, a subscriber, am apart of and have been since the first season. Not only does it still have fans who have been left on an unsatisfying cliff hanger but so much of the cast is still willing and wanting to be part of it and give this masterpiece of a show a deserving ending. Treat the cast right, they are the backbone and the faces we know that contribute to our love and adoration of G.L.O.W, and we fans of this series hold them dear in our hearts for that. In giving us one last season, movie, or even a mini season to truly end this story with the intention we know the incredibly talented and creative writers and directors had wanted to make would give Netflix subscribers not only hope in the platform we continue to choose to spend our money on month after month but would make, for sure this long time subscriber, feel as though Netflix gained their integrity back as a streaming platform that was above all the rest like you were through the 2010\u2019s decade. I doubt anyone with decision-making power with this company will see this, let alone read it in it\u2019s entirety, but this is my plea to give a show that has gotten me through so much by letting me escape into the decade I have always loved most, a proper ending that it has always deserved",

        "content": "Changing them in the Netflix app does not work, and Chromecast 2.0 doesn't have any options in the Home app to change subtitle size.  What am I doing wrong? The standard subtitle size is so hard to read, especially because the border is so grey it makes the font almost appear white when the background is light. A year or so back or worked fine to change the subtitles in the app",
