Look at how interesting the romance felt in heated rivalry compared to people we meet on vacation, heck even Emily in Paris romance arks are better though people are tired of them now.\n\nThis movie while watchable was just not it, there just wasn't really a reason as to why they did not get together earlier . I feel like friends to lovers works only in tv shows, like that is why so many people were shipping Harry and Hermione ( well that is a series of films/books but you get the point ).\n\nThe only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex.\n\nI don't get why Alex was pissed at Poppy for not I guess being more forward with her feelings when um he has a girlfriend and even got engaged to her after they had an emotional moment the previous night ? Like isn't that him running away and not wanting to acknowledge he feelings for Poppy and he is accusing her of running away?\n\nThe ending where Poppy was like \" home is where you re with your person \" was soo juvenile .\n\n  \nEdit : I know I said the \" only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex but really it was for Alex to have those boundaries , he was the one engaged to Sarah after all , why is it Poppy the one to apologise.

In my country, Stranger Things, My Hero Academia (Anime), etc is given a TV 14 (Early Teens) or TV MA (Late teens) rating sometimes.\n\nI know that TV MA is a rating warning that it contains more extreme violence than TV 14 like stronger nudity scenes, stronger gore, the usage of the F word is used more etc\n\nI watched shows like Weak Hero (KDrama) and it felt TV 14 despite the TV MA rating it got cuz lack of gore and sexual content. The amount of swearing it has makes sense why it got that rating, but other shows with a TV 14 rating even had swearing and more brutal scenes to watch imo. Even some Anime with a rating of TV MA has milder swearing or minimal swearing than other TV 14 shows lol (maybe Anime does have more like others, but it's just mistranslation)",

        "content": "I literally wrapped this show up 20 minutes ago and WOW. I have some strong emotions on this one.\n\nSide note: I am by no means a critic. I just wanted to share my thoughts in case you were on the edge.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast from your typical detective show, mixing in lust, hatred, romance, and love into a twisted story. It was refreshing! Throughout the show I drew sharp comparisons between titles like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, with a distinct splash of the traditional detective themed Hollywood blockbuster. However, even then it was entirely different. \n\nThere is definitely something to be said about the predictability throughout this show. With modern day crime films, I often feel I have a solid grasp of when or how an event is going to take place or come forth, but not with this. This was entirely fresh and entirely unpredictable. The director does a fantastic job of steering the viewers mind; Pushing us to a prejudice and bias that even the most experienced crime thriller fanatics try to avoid. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and its many twists and turns.\n\nI say all this with some slight criticism. In order to accomplish such a rollercoaster of a plot line, I did feel there was a certain loss of realism. The general structure of the plot is gripping, but the actual substance of it can be slightly off putting. I felt as if some of the reasonings were a slight bit of a reach for my tastes, but could be well within the palettes of most viewers.\n\nFrom a cinematographic point of view, the show was well made. The scenery, the mood, and the pacing, was attractive to your typical crime thriller junkie. I have little to complain about aside from the pacing in the last episode. I felt as if there could have been a slight bit more to explore concerning the main protagonist and his trauma, but it was brushed off for the jaw dropping peak of the show (absolutely 100% unexpected). So yes, I will say the cinematography was well done. It\u2019s no Lord of the Rings or Interstellar, but it has more than enough to make the viewing experience pleasurable. \n\nAlso, there were so many morals and lessons put into this story. Maybe it\u2019s just me being impressionable, but I definitely felt there was some moving moments throughout. \n\nI strongly recommend this series and look forward to more similar work in the future. \n\n\n TLDR: Great series. It was a nail biter that had me constantly questioning my theories. There\u2019s some minor misgivings but they are made up for by other plot twists and so on. 8.2/10. Strongly recommend!\n",

        "content": "So I have the KTC-M27P6 4K Mini-LED + Dell 24\u201d 1080p monitor and I bought the HVEC extension from Microsoft store thinking it would allow me to watch 4k content. I tried everything to get it to work only to find out it was because I had dual monitors. After unplugging my 1080p monitor i was finally able to watch 4k content. \n\nI tested this both on app and on edge and as long as I have both monitors plugged in I\u2019m stuck at 1080p content is there a way to fix this?

It feels like it takes forever to get new shows and we go months without content to watch. Any recommendations? Below are the ones we watched and liked.
