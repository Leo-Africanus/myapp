        "content": "The Jade character who was Katie\u2019s best friend seems really off and probably not how a real person would act. I mean If your best friend just died I understand the anger but than crashing out on everyone especially the officers saying \u201cyour supposed to be police yeah\u201d implying somehow they did something wrong when they clearly didn\u2019t. What did she want the police to do? Catch the dude the moment the murder happened , they even told her they have a suspect. There was no reason for her to deny helping her best friends case and the writers wrote her as some weirdly non chalant character who\u2019s fuck the system. Can\u2019t put a pin on it. Back to watching peace ",
