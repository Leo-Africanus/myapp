Hwang is producing the series, which has been described as a 'high-stakes casino crime drama,' but there is at least one element in the description that sets this new series apart from Hwang\u2019s most well-known work.\n\nIn The Dealer, Geonhwa is a casino dealer who has to return to the shadowy world of illegal gambling after she falls victim to a scam and has to put her wedding plans on hold. However, to give her an edge at the tables, she 'is compelled to tap long-suppressed supernatural abilities,' which sounds like such a fun spin on the Squid Game formula of high-stakes tension and uneasy alliances with huge sums of money on the line.\" -full article [here](https://www.thepopverse.com/tv-squid-game-netflix-creator-next-project-the-dealer-supernatural-twist)",

        "content": "I've been watching a lot of Korean Netflix lately, and something started bugging me (and yes, I used some AI to concise the information to explain my concern). The more I dug into it, the more I realized there's a pattern here that's either the craziest coincidence ever or something deliberate.\n\n# The Pattern\n\nNetflix Korea's two biggest unscripted hits both had Season 2 in 2024-2025. In BOTH seasons, the winner followed the exact same arc:\n\n1. Eliminated from the competition\n2. Brought back through a NEW \"second chance\" mechanic that didn't exist in Season 1\n3. Won the entire season against opponents who had never been eliminated\n\nThis happened in Physical: 100 Season 2 and Culinary Class Wars Season 2. Two different shows. Two different production companies. Same exact pattern.\n\n# Physical: 100 Season 2 \u2013 Amotti\n\nPhysical: 100 is basically Squid Game meets CrossFit. 100 people, brutal physical challenges, last one standing wins \u20a9300 million (\\~$230K USD).\n\nWinner: Amotti (Kim Jae-hong)\n\nQuick background: 33-year-old former CrossFit athlete from Daegu. Ranked 6th in the 2019 CrossFit Open, 2nd at the Asia Championship. In January 2021, a car door crushed his ankle while he was riding his scooter. 10-hour surgery. Doctors said he might never walk again. He rebuilt himself as a fitness YouTuber (300K+ subscribers) and became a Lululemon ambassador.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting:\n\n* Amotti was nearly selected for Season 1 but didn't make the final cast. (This is on his Wikipedia page.) Production knew him. Knew his story. Said no.\n* Season 2: He gets in, competes, and gets eliminated in Quest 2 (Maze Race). Pretty early.\n* But wait: Season 2 introduced \"Quest 2.5: Pillar Challenge\"\u2014a NEW mechanic that let eliminated contestants return. Olympic gold medalist Jung Ji-hyun picked Amotti for her \"Avengers\" team.\n* Result: Amotti wins the finale against Hong Beom-seok, who was never eliminated the entire season.\n\nSo: Rejected from S1 \u2192 Accepted to S2 \u2192 Eliminated early \u2192 Brought back via NEW mechanic \u2192 Wins everything.\n\nAlmost too perfect.\n\n# The Season 1 Controversy (Context)\n\nThe S1 finale had its own issues. Runner-up Jung Hae-min claimed the final rope-pulling match was filmed multiple times:\n\n\"There was a huge gap in performance... Woo Jin-yong raised his hand and stopped the match, claiming equipment issues.\"\n\nAccording to Jung:\n\n* First attempt: Jung winning big. Woo stopped it. Production lubricated machines and \"lowered the difficulty.\"\n* Second attempt: Jung won. Production stopped it for \"audio issues.\"\n* Third attempt: \\~5 staff members convinced exhausted Jung to continue. He lost.\n\nNetflix denied manipulation but never released the full unedited footage. Wikipedia still notes: \"While the production team stated there was no rematch, Jung Hae-min claimed the final game was filmed twice.\"\n\n# Culinary Class Wars Season 2 \u2013 Choi Kang-rok\n\n100 chefs compete: \"White Spoons\" (celebrity chefs) vs. \"Black Spoons\" (anonymous talents). Same prize: \u20a9300 million. This was the first Korean unscripted series to top Netflix's Global Top 10 (Non-English) for three consecutive weeks.\n\nWinner: Choi Kang-rok\n\nBackground: 47 years old. Originally wanted to be a drummer. Failed restaurants twice. Lived in a Japanese Buddhist temple while learning the language. Trained at Tsuji Culinary Institute. Won MasterChef Korea Season 2 in 2013.\n\nThe key facts:\n\n* Season 1: Competed as a White Spoon. Eliminated in Round 3.\n* Season 2: Production introduced \"Hidden White Spoon\"\u2014a NEW mechanic allowing S1 eliminated chefs to return (but needing unanimous judge approval instead of just one).\n* Result: Choi wins the finale against \"Culinary Monster\" (Lee Ha-sung)\u2014former head chef at NYC's 2-Michelin-star Atomix, ex-sous chef at The French Laundry\u2014who was never eliminated all season.\n\n# The Quote That Got Me\n\nWhen asked about the Hidden White Spoon mechanic, producers said:\"They were invited because viewers really wanted to see them again.\"\n\nBut S2 was announced in October 2024, right after S1 ended. The mechanic was designed before filming. Casting decisions were made before filming.\n\nHow did they \"know\" viewers wanted Choi Kang-rok back before S2 even aired?\n\n# The Netflix Connection\n\nBoth shows are overseen by Yoo Ki-hwan, Netflix Korea's Director of Content.\n\n||Physical: 100 S2|Culinary Class Wars S2|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Winner|Amotti|Choi Kang-rok|\n|Eliminated|Quest 2|Season 1, Round 3|\n|Return mechanic|\"Pillar Challenge\" (NEW)|\"Hidden White Spoon\" (NEW)|\n|Final opponent|Hong Beom-seok (never eliminated)|Lee Ha-sung (never eliminated)|\n|Production|Galaxy Corporation|Studio Slam|\n|Netflix exec|Yoo Ki-hwan|Yoo Ki-hwan|\n\nTwo production companies. Same executive. Same pattern. Same outcome.\n\n# What I'm NOT Saying\n\nI'm not saying Amotti or Choi Kang-rok don't deserve their wins. Amotti overcame a career-ending injury. Choi already won MasterChef Korea. They're genuinely talented.\n\nWhat I AM questioning:\n\n* The deliberate creation of mechanics that enable specific narrative outcomes\n* The statistical improbability of identical patterns in two shows, same year\n* The lack of transparency about production decisions\n* Whether we're watching authentic competition or manufactured storytelling\n\n# The Business Logic\n\nRedemption arcs make sense from a content strategy perspective:\n\n* Emotional investment: People love comebacks\n* Rewatch value: Go back to see the original elimination\n* Social engagement: Unexpected wins generate debate\n* Watch time: Netflix's key metric\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nMaybe this is all coincidence. Maybe Netflix Korea just got incredibly lucky that both second-chance mechanics produced perfect redemption stories.\n\nOr maybe there's a formula being replicated because it works.\n\nI don't have proof of rigging. I have a pattern, a suspicious, statistically improbable pattern happening under the same executive oversight.\n\nThe question: Is Netflix Korea creating conditions for organic competition, or engineering narratives and calling it reality? What do you think?\n\n",

        "content": "So, I just had to get on here and rant for a minute. (Not to argue, not to fight, just to get it off my chest) First of all, I\u2019d just like to say, yes, what happened at the end with El was absolutely sad. Yes, there might be a few plot holes left, the only big one I see is nothing happened with Kay, and there were no monsters in the upside down. Everything else? Eh. I just want you all to step back and think.\n\nEveryone is ragging on the finale, emotional outbursts everywhere. Coming up with theories of a ninth episode, refusing to believe it\u2019s over. You think that means the finale was bad? We got attached to the story, to the characters, and to be this emotionally upset, in denial about the ending? My opinion (and I say mine because everyone can have their own without turning it into a war-zone) is that they made history. They literally got you so attached to something, it devastated you. It devastated me. I almost didn\u2019t want to even watch the finale because I knew I\u2019d be sad it was gone after. They literally did what the best writers in history have done. They made you live in the stranger things universe, for ten years. Kept you hooked, kept you crying and laughing and then you insult them? Because the ending wasn\u2019t what you wanted? It was their ending, this world was theirs and we were lucky enough for it to temporarily draw us out of our boring mundane lives.\n\nYour mad? Your upset? Did you actually cry over someone that wasn\u2019t real? Good. THEY DID THEIR JOB. If you were unfazed it wouldn\u2019t have been worth anything. I\u2019m not saying everything about it was perfect, and yeah Mike and eleven not having a happy ending was sad. But everyone else had a decent ending. Their characters MADE IT. I would like to believe El made it out, but honestly even if she didn\u2019t? She made one final decision. She was brave. She put an end to it. And without her, none of the other characters would have had any progress. She changed them. She saved them. She made an impact on their lives. She went from a scared little girl, to becoming someone brave enough to risk herself for everything. With her choice.\n\nAnd another note, yeah one of the writers was actively going through a divorce. AND HE STILL STOOD AND WORKED ON THE ENDING FOR US. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going through, how he feels. He could be emotionally wrecked and everyone\u2019s pointing their finger at him. He might not have the motivation to do anything right now, but he was still here, still writing, still creating and that takes a lot. That MEANS a lot. And I\u2019m not sitting here saying I know everything, or the details of his divorce, but chill out. These two sat down and gave us ten years of their life with an amazing world, and amazing characters. Not everything goes how you want it to go. There\u2019s no need to act two years old over it. Be grateful you experienced something that made you feel. Even if it was anger, sadness at the end.\n\nMike becoming a writer at the end, and making the story? The story of all of them? That part was absolutely beautiful from a writers point of view, from mine anyway. I\u2019m not here to argue, to fight, I just wanted to state my opinion somewhere. If you wanna be rude about it, go self regulate. Have a nice day, and I hope more things come into your life and give you a whirlwind of emotions. It makes life less dull.",
