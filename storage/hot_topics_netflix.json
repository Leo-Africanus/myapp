        "content": "Oh my gosh. Before we got to the big reveal (those who watched it know what I\u2019m talking about), the movie was a hard watch. \n\nEvery single scene she had the same exact facial expression and you know when you\u2019re watching a movie and you can clearly see that a person is acting? That\u2019s exactly what she felt like. \n\nEvery single moment her facial expression was seductive and flirty, literally every second she talked. There\u2019s a scene where she\u2019s asking how someone died and her face looks exactly the same as when she was flirting with the love interest. Like what. It\u2019s like she\u2019s always trying to keep herself pretty, if that makes sense. But this is not an ad or a beauty campaign. A good movie doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re watching a movie, but this was the exact opposite whenever Sofia was on screen. \n\nAlso she made zero effort to have any sort of chemistry with Corey. You could see in his eyes, the passion and the longing, but nothing from her. \n\nThe movie is honestly pretty good but Sofia Carson\u2019s acting really ruined it for me. ",

        "content": "When i was a kid i watched an animated movie on netflix that ive tried to find everyhwere but no matter what i search i cant find it so i thought id ask here. From what i remember the premise was something like 3 kids were the \"chose ones\" and sent to go through time or soething like that, and accompanying each of them was a little mythical creature that helped them in their journey, and i remember that the evil person that was trying to stop them also had 3 kids that had little magical beasts, and near the end the plot twist was that the 3 \"evil\" kids were actually the chosen ones and they actually were the ones who had to save the day so they all teamed up and beat the villain. I know its not alot to go off of but thats pretty much all i can remember, if someone knows what im talking about please let me know ive been searching for years!",
