        "content": "Okay, hear me out. I might be spiraling a little here but I SWEAR I\u2019m not alone. I just started watching The Hunting Wives, and the second Malin \u00c5kerman stepped on screen I had to pause and rewatch her entrance like three times because I genuinely thought Lana Del Rey had gone full method actress and snuck into a limited series for fun.\n\nLike seriously, THE VIBE IS UNCANNY.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the bone structure (though, let\u2019s talk about that flawless symmetry and those cheekbones that could slice glass). It\u2019s the whole ethereal, vintage glamor-meets-smoldering-siren aesthetic. Malin is channeling ultra soft-focus noir queen energy, and that\u2019s LDR\u2019s entire brand. The pouty lips? Check. The dreamy bedroom eyes that look like they\u2019ve seen a thousand tragedies and three failed love affairs? Double check. That effortless blend of elegance and danger? Like\u2026 are you kidding me.\n\nEven the styling in The Hunting Wives is doing some heavy lifting in this comparison. The hair is big, brushed out, and retro glam. The wardrobe? Draped in silk and southern charm, with that \u201cI may look like I bake pies but I\u2019ve definitely buried secrets in the backyard\u201d energy. It\u2019s basically Born to Die era Lana meets Chemtrails Over the Country Club if it were a thriller.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the voice. Malin\u2019s got that low, honey-dipped register that feels like it should be narrating an Old Hollywood murder ballad. Tell me she couldn\u2019t say \u201cmy baby\u2019s in the bar with his dandelion wine\u201d and make it sound like a threat and a lullaby.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is brilliant casting, a weird timeline crossover, or my brain just doing somersaults\u2014but I\u2019m not letting this one go. Malin \u00c5kerman = future Lana Del Rey. You heard it here first. Someone cast them as mother and daughter in a twisted psychological thriller IMMEDIATELY.\n\nAnyone else see it or am I losing it?",

The storyline expectations and what they'd do with all the characters though, was much higher. \n\nThe Maxi Golf concept was really good and current with Liv Golf but the execution was so damn bad.\n\nAll it needed to be was Shooter and Gilmore teaming up with 2-3 of the cameo golfers (probably Scheffler and fuck if it could've been Tiger, or even Daly!) and having playoff with other actual golfers, or actors who seemed like golfers, in a more grounded maxi/standard golf playoff. The first half being Gilmore actually getting good at golf again and being courted along with Tiger and Shooter to bring back fan favourites.\n\nAlso, this might be a stretch, but Stiller could've quietly brought back White Goodman from Dodgeball and been the man behind Maxi golf. Vanessa didn't need to be dead, the motivation to \"save golf\" was enough.\n\nI expected that as it was a sequel to something which is one of the most quoted comedies of all time to be bigger in scale but it overall looked really cheap, and the scale actually felt smaller than the first movie.\n\nAlso - it's one of the most quoted and rewatched movie of all time, why did they have to literally replay the old jokes?",

They canceled it, apparently because they couldn\u2019t afford it, even though the show brought in huge viewership numbers. Make it make sense. So many unresolved storylines, it felt like they just walked off set mid-scene. I genuinely hope now that Netflix has picked it up, a 4th season is in the works. It deserves one. We deserve one. I\u2019m honestly kind of mad about it.\n\nNow maybe this is a dumb question, but it\u2019s been bugging me: why did the show seem more focused on who killed Jorge  than on Frankie himself\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, was a full-blown murderer? He\u2019s out of prison again and somehow they still couldn\u2019t charge him with anything? That was beyond frustrating. I get that the writers probably wanted to push Ray to kill him in the end, but still\u2014it felt like everyone was just shrugging off Frankie\u2019s entire rap sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a great show, but man, that ending left me with more questions than closure.",

But today, we're both experiencing the weirdest thing. I tried to create a session, but the link is noticeably shorter than usual and doesn't include the show title in it. I thought that would be fine, but when she opened the link, it just played on its own and refuses to sync. Then she tried to create the session, but the same thing happened to her too.\n\nIt's so weird because it shows in the chat log whenever one of us joins or pauses/plays and whatnot, but it's playing two separate instances. If I play, it's still paused for her, and vice versa. It's refusing to sync, and this has never happened before until today. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a possible fix, or maybe it'll just randomly fix itself after a time? Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people in the replies experiencing the same thing, so hopefully they fix it soon.",

        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging.   \n  \nEdit: Surprised it got Emmy nomination.",

        "content": "I\u2019m pretty nostalgic for the first one. I wasn\u2019t born when it came out but it still used to be one of my favourite movies. This one started out strong, the first 30-45 minutes were pretty good, and happy is still a really funny character, but then it completely fell off. For some reason they decided to bring back every single side character from the original and redo every single joke and gag. Some parts of it feel like a remake and I really didn\u2019t like how they kept playing clips from the original. On top of that the villains and the ending were really stupid. I\u2019d probably rate this movie a 5/10, but that\u2019s just my opinion I guess.",
