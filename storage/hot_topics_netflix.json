        "content": "Watched Coded Bias recently and it raised some serious concerns. The documentary dives into how facial recognition and AI systems aren\u2019t actually neutral at all. Because they\u2019re trained on flawed datasets, they end up making mistakes that disproportionately affect women and people of color.\n\nThe unsettling part is how widely this technology is already being deployed in policing, workplaces, schools, even housing, often without the public really knowing or having much of a say. If these systems are already showing bias, what happens when they become a permanent part of everyday life? AI is often framed as being smarter and more objective than humans, but if it\u2019s just reinforcing the same prejudices at scale, is it really progress? At what point do we step back and question whether some decisions, especially around law enforcement and surveillance, should even be left to algorithms at all?\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s seen it or works with AI, do you think these are just early flaws that can be fixed with better design and regulation, or are we headed toward a future where algorithms quietly shape more of our lives than we realize?",

They could\u2019ve actually had some dramatic tension of folks figuring it out, trying to escape, an actual uprising. Folks on the outside could\u2019ve figured it all out and it turns into a hostage negotiation without the billionaires knowing they were hostages. Instead other than them actually getting them in to the bunker, I\u2019m in episode 8 and there\u2019s been more action in an hour of my abuela\u2019s daily telenovela. Not to mention dead lesbian syndrome within an hour of her appearing, and some casual antisemitism (come on, the wealthiest most evil billionaire just happens to be Jewish and he\u2019s the only one whose religion or ethnicity is mentioned? \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).

Since Vince was masked, no one knew who the second gunman was. Later, Vince kills Junior to save his brother Jake, which obviously puts him on a collision course with Junior\u2019s father.\n\nHere\u2019s my confusion: why on earth does Vince go to the *same fence* that Junior was planning to use? By doing that, he exposes his identity. Junior\u2019s father learns exactly who he is, and it puts everyone in danger.\n\nIf Vince had just stayed away, no one would have ever been able to confirm for sure that he was the other shooter. Going to the fence with the jewels was basically like announcing, \u201cYes, I was the second robber.\u201d\n\nAm I missing something here? Was there a reason he *had* to go to that fence, or is this just a plot hole?",

        "content": "I am in the Asia region. I was watching the jdrama Unnatural yesterday, but checked netflix today and it was just gone? Gone from my recents, gone from the search panel, I even searched it up on google and went in from there, yet it just showed loading screen that would not load. Usually when I load a show from google when it\u2019s been taken down, it shows the show information, but doesn\u2019t allow me to play it. I also checked to see if anything was taken down recently and Unnatural was not one of it. Anyone knows why?",
