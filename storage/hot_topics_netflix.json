Wondering if anyone else thought of this too.\n\nSo Molly lied to the maid of honor and said she had been friends with Mags, the wife who died of an asthma attack. Why didn't anyone say to the father when he gave those lies about Mag's father: Didn't your daughter claim to be friends with Mags? If she had been murdered by Jason, why didn't she know already to be afraid of him? Why did she marry someone who she thought had killed her friend?\n\nThere were SO many opportunities here to catch these people up in her lies and to send them to jail forever, and I am just beyond disgusted that there wasn't a bigger push to expose her for the BPD lying fraud she is, and HE is.",

There is NO WAY you would roll over and go back to sleep in that situation. She would have been awake and 911 called or ready to be called. ",

That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

        "content": "The Lost Bullet trilogy, a French action-thriller series, follows Lino (Alban Lenoir), a skilled mechanic and ex-convict turned police asset, navigating a world of corrupt cops and high-stakes car chases.

        "title": "Problems and plot holes in 1899 (Netflix)",
        "content": "Just finished\u00a0 1899\u00a0and loved the atmosphere, but the more I think about it, the more the plot holes and unresolved mysteries bother me. Here\u2019s my breakdown of the biggest issues\u2014let me know what I missed or if you have theories!\n\n# 1. The Simulation Twist Undermines Everything\n\nThe big reveal that it\u2019s all a simulation (or layers of them) makes emotional moments feel weightless. If nothing\u2019s \"real,\" why should we care about character deaths or trauma? Even worse, the rules of the simulation are never clear\u2014why do the black crystals, memory bugs, or the Prometheus ship behave so inconsistently?\n\n# 2. Character Backstories Go Nowhere\n\n1899\u00a0set up really interesting character stories but then forgot about them. The French couple Clemence and Lucien had a troubled marriage with hints of cheating or maybe an abortion, but none of it went anywhere. The French lady who seemed to be forcing Ling Yi into prostitution just disappeared from the story. Ling Yi and her mom did something horrible - they killed another girl to steal her identity - but the show never explained why this mattered. They also hinted Ling Yi might be pregnant, then dropped it completely.\n\nThe little girl Ada died suddenly for no clear reason. Krester's story about his scar and being gay started strong but went nowhere. Why did so many people jump off the ship? Was the simulation breaking? Miguel, the stowaway, had strange visions and a connection to the boy Elliot, but we never learned his backstory. Angel and Ramiro's secret about Ramiro killing a priest to pretend to be him also didn't lead anywhere.\n\nIt's frustrating because all these stories felt important at first, but in the end, none of them really mattered or got explained. The show made us care about these characters, then left us hanging.\n\n# 3. The Pyramid, the Black Goo, and Elliot\u2019s Role\n\n* The\u00a0black pyramid/archive\u00a0is treated as a big deal, but we never learn what it actually\u00a0*does*.\n* The\u00a0black substance\u00a0spreads like a virus, but is it code? A metaphor? Who knows.\n* Elliot\u00a0exists as a child in the simulation, but why? Is he a glitch, a memory, or a failsafe?\n\n# 4. The Ending Creates More Confusion\n\nMaura wakes up in\u00a02099\u00a0on a spaceship, implying the 1899 simulation was just one layer. But:\n\n* Why is\u00a0Ciaran\u00a0suddenly in control?\n* Are the other passengers real people or AI?\n* If this is \"reality,\" how does it connect to the 1899 simulation?\n\n# 5. Cancellation Left Us Hanging\n\nNetflix axed the show after one season, so we\u2019ll\u00a0*never*\u00a0get answers about Ciaran, the spaceship, or whether any of it mattered. The creators (*Dark*\u00a0fans know this pain) love complex mysteries, but without payoff, it feels like wasted potential.\n\n# Was It All Just a Video Game?\n\nSome theories suggest\u00a0 1899\u00a0is a\u00a0psychological experiment\u00a0or a\u00a0*Matrix*\\-style VR game, but with no S2, we\u2019re left guessing.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014did the plotholes ruin it for you, or was the ride worth it?",

        "content": "There seems to be a very confusing plot element in the series. Juan and Tano go out to find Clara, but reach a wall of cars. Then they go to a church, which seems to be on the same side of the city as Tano's house. Then they bypass the wall of cars through a tunnel - and end up back at Tano's house! How is that possible? \n\nAnd then the people from the church set out for Campo de Mayo, but how could they do that if they are back at the \"wrong\" side of the city?\n\nIn the end, what was the goal of cutting through the wall of cars?\n\nAnother thing: the car Juan finds in the wall of cars seems to be on both sides of the wall.\n\nMaybe I got something wrong.",
