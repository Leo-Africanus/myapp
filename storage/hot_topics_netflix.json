Half way through the show I thought this was sci-fi and then it got weirder and weirder. I skipped through most of the family scenes  to save some time and I was mostly curious where they're going with this. Then came people dying mysteriously, cartoon villians from the government performing medical experiments on people searching for \"the Holy Grail\", \"The Major\" who's way up the ranks to conduct large operations that even the NSA is not aware of. The scientist who's there to explain shit to people with psychic powers called \"the calling\".\n\nI got even more excited when I realized there's 4 seasons of this. I don't know how it was even possible to stretch this for that many seasons and this got my curiosity even more. Most of the time I'm just skipping through the episodes until I get to see Michaela's pretty face but everything's all connected. Wow.\n\nTwenty years from now, this is gonna be a cult classic. Calling it now.",

I do not share my account outside my household. Last night it happened again but only on my PC.\n\nI do not have location hidden. I am using a wired connection through the same Wi-Fi box it wants me to sign into. I have a high-end PC and use Ethernet because it gives the best connection. I have Comcast for internet and cable. Netflix is part of my plan and I pay extra for an upgraded version through Comcast.\n\nThis only happens on my PC. It does not happen on the TV, Fire Stick, or Comcast box. My PC is in a different room and I like to play shows while I work.\n\nWhat made it more frustrating is that Netflix sends a code by email that expires in 15 minutes. Each time the email took around 20 minutes to arrive. After five failed tries it made me wait 24 hours before I could try again.\n\nI checked and the only devices connected are inside the house. Does anyone else have to deal with this nonsense.   ",

Enough is enough. I downgraded from the $18.99 plan to the $7.99 ad-supported version, expecting a seamless transition. Everything seemed fine\u2014until I tried to cast to my TV via Chromecast, only to discover that I couldn\u2019t.\n\nNowhere in your advertising did you warn about this restriction. Why would I even suspect it, when casting worked perfectly with the standard plan?\n\nMy frustration was only amplified by the **sassy** response from your help desk, which sealed my decision to cancel. Other platforms manage to stream with ads via Chromecast\u2014so why can\u2019t Netflix? Seriously??\n\nToo bad\u2014I\u2019m voting with my feet. No more Meghan and Harry nonsense. No more disappointing rollouts. I might have tolerated ads, but now I\u2019ll never know. You\u2019ve lost out on revenue, and I feel liberated.\n\n**Ciao, arrivederci, aloha, Netflix.** I'm out.",
