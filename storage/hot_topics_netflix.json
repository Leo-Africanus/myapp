        "content": "I literally wrapped this show up 20 minutes ago and WOW. I have some strong emotions on this one.\n\nSide note: I am by no means a critic. I just wanted to share my thoughts in case you were on the edge.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast from your typical detective show, mixing in lust, hatred, romance, and love into a twisted story. It was refreshing! Throughout the show I drew sharp comparisons between titles like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, with a distinct splash of the traditional detective themed Hollywood blockbuster. However, even then it was entirely different. \n\nThere is definitely something to be said about the predictability throughout this show. With modern day crime films, I often feel I have a solid grasp of when or how an event is going to take place or come forth, but not with this. This was entirely fresh and entirely unpredictable. The director does a fantastic job of steering the viewers mind; Pushing us to a prejudice and bias that even the most experienced crime thriller fanatics try to avoid. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and its many twists and turns.\n\nI say all this with some slight criticism. In order to accomplish such a rollercoaster of a plot line, I did feel there was a certain loss of realism. The general structure of the plot is gripping, but the actual substance of it can be slightly off putting. I felt as if some of the reasonings were a slight bit of a reach for my tastes, but could be well within the palettes of most viewers.\n\nFrom a cinematographic point of view, the show was well made. The scenery, the mood, and the pacing, was attractive to your typical crime thriller junkie. I have little to complain about aside from the pacing in the last episode. I felt as if there could have been a slight bit more to explore concerning the main protagonist and his trauma, but it was brushed off for the jaw dropping peak of the show (absolutely 100% unexpected). So yes, I will say the cinematography was well done. It\u2019s no Lord of the Rings or Interstellar, but it has more than enough to make the viewing experience pleasurable. \n\nAlso, there were so many morals and lessons put into this story. Maybe it\u2019s just me being impressionable, but I definitely felt there was some moving moments throughout. \n\nI strongly recommend this series and look forward to more similar work in the future. \n\n\n TLDR: Great series. It was a nail biter that had me constantly questioning my theories. There\u2019s some minor misgivings but they are made up for by other plot twists and so on. 8.2/10. Strongly recommend!\n",

And her think she thought she was lucky that he wanted her was ludicrous, he is the one that was lucky to have her. I don't understand how you can do that to someone who loved you that much even when you were being a piece of shit that you are and she still wanted to spend her life with him.\n\nSorry, I have to vent.

This was one of this worst series. First of all, why was the daughter not a suspect for the police as she was the last person who saw him dead? There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

        "content": "So, so far, I've seen the first 5 episodes of Dark (eg. first half of S1), so please no spoilers outside of that. Or at the very least put the spoiler tags.\n\nThat being said, I so far think this it's better than ST at it's best (eg. S1) and maybe one of the best shows I've seen. I realize I need more to see but it's that good.   \n  \nHowever, I don't get the comparison. Outside of being sci-fi shows on Netflix, they're not the same thing. One is an arthouse-like TV show that's not meant to be appeal to wide audience. The other isn't, well at, least past S1. To me, it's like comparing a Tarkovsky movie to a  MCU movie!\n\nDoes anyone else feel that way?",
