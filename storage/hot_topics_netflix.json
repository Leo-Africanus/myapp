        "content": "I started rewatching Mr. Robot on Netflix and it hits so differently now compared to when it first came out. The way the show builds Elliot\u2019s world is wild, the loneliness, the paranoia, but also the almost surgical precision he has when it comes to tech. What blows me away is how grounded the hacking feels. It\u2019s not just flashy movie effects, it\u2019s real exploits, social engineering, digging through code, finding weak spots, and using them in ways that could actually happen. Even the little things, like using encrypted communication and throwaway identities, make it clear the writers wanted it to feel authentic. (saw some interviews on youtube about that aswell)  \n  \nThe whole vibe of the show also makes you think about bigger questions like surveillance, data collection, and how much of ourselves we\u2019ve basically handed over without even realizing it. Watching Elliot manipulate those cracks in the system really drives home how vulnerable our digital lives can be. All of this has me seriously curious. How does someone actually reach that level of skill in real life, it really is crazy. Either way 10/10 show, especially the ones like the PDF file one (idk if it gets censored if I post the word). I'm actually considering making into a career.  \n",

        "content": "So is monsters, Ed Gein, really about Ed Gein?\n\nOkay, so I'm only two episodes in, so I may have missed the mark. But two episodes in, monsters Ed Gein, is monsters Alfred Hitchcock, psycho, featuring Ed Gein. I get that the making of psycho would make for a very interesting story. I just didn't expect a series about Ed Gein, being about that. Or mostly that. When I watched monsters Jeffrey Dahmer, or the Menendez brothers. I didn't watch a series about a movie based on them. And some hard hitting issues involved with that. Again, would make an excellent series. Not the one I thought I was watching though. Is this a me thing?\nEdit\n\nI made it to episode 4. To all of you who hinted it was going to also be about the Texas chainsaw massacre, this and silence of the lambs, well done. But honestly ffs. If they didn't know enough of Ed Gein to make a series out of it, than don't. No need to make stuff up. Or connect him to movies. Or I half part get that part. But make that it's own series, movies inspired by Ed Gein. Usually monsters takes some creative licence. Here, they took all the licence. Most of this is made up. When it didn't have to be. What he did was plenty to base a series on. What they did was make up shit surrounding this case, give the lead an awful voice the real Ed didn't. And than show,  hey, remember this movie? Wasn't that guy weird. Oooh that and making the lead in the Hitchcock movie gay. And him going, ugh, gay, that is so shit. My life is so shit. *I heard the real actor went through conversion therapy* All of this I hated. Im not watching episode 5. To those who stuck with it, let me know if I got it wrong. Im just done. The acting is fine. It's not them. The series is just so all over the place bad",

He had a car like that. The whole scene where ditches Lelie is on point. Sketchy guys were never far behind. But she does make it across the border. That\u2019s some guts without back up. \n\nI kept watching because that griped me. I was a fucked up Canadian teenager. I\u2019d be terrified in the states.

They he/she wrote an award winning show called \u2018Feel Good\u2019 for Netflix a few years back. It\u2019s all about how hard it is be different and hurting inside. I think it was very good and taught me a lot about Trans people. I was glad to see Netflix give them another show. \n\n\n\n",

        "title": "I liked Wayward and I don't understand the criticism",
        "content": "The series premiered exactly a week ago, I watched it, and I enjoyed it. I didn't once think the actors were bad, a criticism I've seen a couple of times in reddit discussions. I was also very surprised by how they managed to make the dialogue between Leila and Abbie sound realistic and natural compared to how they've made teenagers speak in other Netflix shows, and I appreciated that.\n\nI definitely have no experience in entertainment criticism or analysis; the only way I judge whether the acting was good or bad is how much I believe the actors, and therefore how much I can focus on the plot. This is, of course, very subjective, but the only time I felt a little disconnected from the plot was with Abbie's father. I didn't fully believe his character's outburst or his overall persona, but I don't think he had more than 15 minutes of screen time, and I don't consider it \"bad\" acting\u2014just less compelling. I truly don\u2019t think this show had \"bad actors\".\u00a0\n\nI think most of the criticism I\u2019ve read comes from people that aren\u2019t the show's target audience, which, from my perspective, seems to stem from their personal biases against queer people or from not connecting with or relating to the show's theme, which is intergenerational trauma and how it can cause children, teens, and eventually adults to feel the weight of their parents' unresolved grief or trauma, resulting in deep guilt and a sense of being \"bad kids\", even before they\u2019ve developed a moral compass or an integral sense of self.\u00a0\n\nAs for the protagonist, I can\u2019t thank Mae Martin enough for the representation they gave the trans community in this series. I\u2019ll save that aspect of this review for another subreddit though, as I have read very ignorant and rude comments regarding Mae Martin\u2019s character, Alex, and I hope to minimize that aspect of the discussion in this post.\u00a0\n\nI think the show does an incredible job of showing that there are no \"bad kids,\" but rather they are a direct result of their environment and the extremes parents or families go to in order to \"cope\" with their children, rather than working on themselves or simply trying to connect with them from a place of love, understanding, and empathy. I think all parents should go to therapy at least a few times, which I recognize is a statement that stems from and leads to something much deeper from a historical, sociopolitical, and evolutionary perspective. But, I think many parents should have gone to therapy before having children, and the series does a great job of taking that feeling and amplifying it to a psychological thriller level, while also depicting the dangers of retreats, programs, and poorly researched and unethical therapeutic methods for minors.\n\nOne of Sydney Topliffe's (Abbie) lines from Episode 1, \"When you had kids, what the f\\*\\*\\* did you imagine it would be like?\" that she says to her dad in an outburst, really struck me. I think it captures the incomprehension and frustration that so many children and teenagers feel: \"Why did my parents even have kids?\" Meaning, \"Why did this person or these people bring me into the world only to make me feel every day that they wish they hadn't?\" or \u201cDid they create an idea or expectation of children and family, if any, in their heads that I'm not living up to, or do they simply not like me as a person?\u201d Even though it could never be the kid\u2019s fault truly, they are made to feel as though it is. Another line that captures this sentiment is Toni Collete's (Evelyn) line in Episode 7: \"Birth is... nonconsensual.\"\u00a0\n\nI've also seen criticism that there are plot holes. I finished the series today, and I can't say with complete certainty that I found any plot holes per se, but I did feel that some things were left \u201cup in the air\u201d. For example, I think some character's subplots felt a bit rushed; it would have been interesting to know more about many of them (e.g., Riley and Maurice), but I also understand that it's a miniseries and covers topics that could give much more screen time in order for them to thrive.\n\nAs for the toads (I think cane toads), I do think they're simply symbolic. They're an invasive species that has taken over the town, and in one way or another, they're everywhere, just like Evelyn. Depending on the culture, they also represent different things, such as fertility and abundance, transformation and rebirth, healing and purification, among others (Logan, 2024). All of the articles I found about toad and frog symbolism can be closely associated with the series, including those that presented a negative and evil interpretation of frogs and toads, as most of the characters have different or opposite perspectives of Evelyn, many having both throughout the series and their character's development. Also, I'm sure the show implies that the toads have a role in the making of the drug used on the graduates, which isn't so far fetched in a science-y fiction way as there are psychedelic amphybians. The fact that the phase is called \"The Leap\", is probably also a play on the fact that frogs jump or \"leap\" from one place to another. I also think it could symbolize the term \"leapfrog\", which according to Cambridge Dictionary, can also be used as a verb to describe: \"to improve your position by going past other people quickly or by missing out some stages\". Maybe this could be interpreted as wanting to heal and become your new self with Evelyn's drug quickly, without going through a much longer process of healing and learning to live with your trauma, by facing your past, yourself and others, but that could just be a personal interpretation.\n\nI also read some reviews that said the series dragged on too long, something I personally disagree with. I think almost every aspect of the series contributed to the plot and deserves analysis from an entertainment perspective, but also from a psychological one. If anything, I sometimes felt it was fast paced and I hope they decide to renew for a second season.\n\nIn the future, I would love to rewatch this series with even more attention to detail, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it has incredible potential, I hope Mae Martin takes up more production and acting roles as well.",
