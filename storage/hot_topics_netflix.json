        "content": "I just finished Secret Mall Apartment and I honestly don't know where I stand on it. The story is a total 2000s fever dream. It\u2019s about eight artists building a hidden 750sq-ft flat inside a Rhode Island mall and living there for years. The lo-fi footage they captured back in 2003 is incredible, but the doc raises some massive questions that I haven't stopped thinking about.\n\nOn one hand, you have Michael Townsend and his crew, who frame this as a \"living art\" protest against corporate gentrification. You can\u2019t help but be impressed by the pure audacity it took to smuggle cinder blocks and furniture past security for four years. For the \"art is life\" crowd, it\u2019s an inspiring story about reclaiming space from billionaires.\n\nOn the other hand, the film itself acknowledges a huge elephant in the room: white privilege. The artists admit they likely only got away with this because of how they looked, and some of the \"magical\" reenactments (like using a diverse cast of actors for a mostly white project) feel like they're trying to rebrand a very specific, privileged experience into something more universal. It also touches on the heavy personal cost, showing how Townsend\u2019s singular obsession with the project eventually led to the end of his marriage.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see what everyone else thinks!!\n\nIs this a brilliant act of resistance that proves art can happen anywhere?\n\nOr is it just a case study in how \"mischief\" is only called \"art\" when the people doing it have a certain level of privilege?",

They repeat several times that they are not even sure it\u2019s a real missile that will explode, and they don\u2019t know who launched it. So it makes for a compelling \u201clet\u2019s try to fix things when we know nothing about what needs fixing\u201d plot, but how overly dramatic everyone is just feels dumb when you get to the end and there is no resolution.\n\nTrained soldiers are crying, a high level official kills himself, people advise the president to nuke random countries to show they\u2019re not weak, and it\u2019s not even presented as an insane recommendation.\n\nAgain, they say THEMSELVES they don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s really a functional nuclear missile and they have no clue who sent it\u2026 why would they commit suicide or start a nuclear war with Russia or North Korea out of the blue with that little information? This is completely crazy and an insanely stupid outcome. It\u2019s only been 2 hours and nothing has happened yet, why being so extreme so fast? Right now, the problem is to see whether it hits Chicago or not, if you can mitigate the loss or life and where the threat comes from. These are the things you need to take action on, not pressure the president to pull the trigger on someone at random.\n\nAlso everyone seems to do the bare minimum: oh too bad our attempts to stop it failed twice, well let\u2019s nuke Russia instead of using our other counter missiles when we don\u2019t even know if this is a real threat. Oh Chicago may be destroyed in 1 hour well let\u2019s not everyone try to evacuate or warn people to find a shelter that could reduce the damage, it will probably just save a few anyway.\n\nAnd the NSA guy just discussing classified stuff in the street and the hallways?\n\nThe ending just made me feel the movie thought it was smart and asking tough question, showing a Shakespearian dilemma\u2026 And I could get the dumb responses when you\u2019re under pressure and have no information. But honestly, the fact it ends there just feels like a dumb plot while it could have looked much smarter with either different options presented to the president or someone showing the president say \u201clol no this is insane, if we can\u2019t prevent it anyway, let\u2019s take time to gather intel and I\u2019ll decide to nuke someone or not later\u201d. It could still be unresolved without looking that unrealistic!",

Thank you!",

        "content": "Now I'm really fed up!\n\nI've had a Netflix account for about 10 years, and in the past, all of a sudden, when I logged into the app, my profile disappeared. I recreated it after a lot of cursing because I'd lost all the content I'd watched, the likes, and the algorithm. Today, my profile was deleted again!!! Holy shit, how annoying! There's no logical reason why this would happen!\n\nThe password is 100% secure, and no one has access to the account except us in the family. I mainly use Netflix, and the profiles are my mother's and (before we were deleted again) mine. I'm sure it wasn't deleted by mistake.",

        "content": "This is one annoyance I have with watching Netflix on my TV. The timestamp is greyish/partially transparent which works if it's against a black or dark background, but if it's against a brighter or white background, you can't see the timestamps which makes it annoying and hard if you're trying to read the numbers on it, especially if you're skipping ahead or going back and have no idea what time you're at.\n\nWhen it comes to closed captions/subtitles you're allowed to choose the size and drop shadow of it, so why can't the time stamps follow suit?",
