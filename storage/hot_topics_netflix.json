The mix of tech, paranoia, social commentary, and all the weird psychological stuff hits different compared to most series out right now.  \n  \nI checked Netflix but their recommendations felt kind of random and not really in the same vibe. Before I start scrolling for an hour, is there anything on Netflix with a similar feel? Something with hacking, underground groups, heavy atmosphere, or that same kind of tension where you never fully know who to trust.  \nI am not expecting a perfect match since Mr. Robot is pretty unique, but anything close in tone or theme would be solid. Would appreciate any suggestions from people who watch the same kind of shows.",

        "content": "Obviously there are spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie then stop reading.\n\nI just finished watching the 2025 Frankenstein, and the first thing that occurs to me is that it sets the Creature up perfectly to be the origin story for Santa Claus. Here are some of the reasons:\n\n* The movie ends with the Creature walking towards the north pole, which is always thought of as the remote home of Santa Claus.the Creature\n* The Creature has a good heart and just wants to help people (he cares for the family, helps the old man, and frees the ship from the ice at the end)\n* The Creature is immortal, just like Santa.\n* Furthermore, his immortality implies some sort of magic being involved (surviving an exploding stick of dynamite goes beyond scientific explanation), which could explain some of the magical aspects of Santa.\n* The Creature begins to look like Santa at the end of the movie (with a long heavy coat like Santa's). Since he doesn't want to scare people, a big hat and beard would also make sense.\n* One of the first scenes after he escapes the lab is him befriending reindeer, foreshadowing his future as Santa.\n* After that, the Creature hid during the day and only came out at night, where he would leave seemingly magical gifts for people (much like Santa leaves gifts while everyone is sleeping). The family would also leave food or other things for him (like leaving cookies for Santa).\n* Elizabeth, who shares a mutual love with the Creature, looks shockingly similar to Jessica from the 1970 movie Santa Clause is Coming to Town (both are pale with long red hair parted in the middle). This movie is a Santa Claus origin story, so it would be a clear Mrs. Claus Easter Egg if Guillermo Del Toro intentionally styled Elizabeth like Jessica.\n* Furthermore, all the Creature ever wants is someone like him to live with. Assuming he is able to eventually create such a person (maybe using the notes he found outside the lab), then this person would also be immortal and would fit perfectly as Mrs. Claus (it would also make sense that he might make this person look like his love Elizabeth).\n* Perhaps the elves are also immortal, good creatures created by the Creature (but since he always says he wants just one other person like him, maybe he made them better suited to creating toys as craftsmen).\n* The movie takes place in 1857, which is still before Santa Claus becomes a mainstream part of Christmas.\n\nEdit: changed Frankenstein to the Creature, and changed Santa Clause to Santa Claus",

        "content": "This movie is super creepy. It made me think about how women in the early 1900s used to be treated. It made me think that this is probably  how the first women who started to see through their social conditioning felt. Or any women that went agaisnt  their husbands.   It was common for women to be labeled mentally unwell, and recieve lobotomies if they did things like show anger, go agaisnt  their husbands  wishes, or step out of line with the social norms. Much like in this movie.  In the movie when the women step out of line they are labeled mentally ill, and then their brains are \"restarted\".  Women were expected to be exactly as the women in this movie are. \n\nImagine the first women in the 1940s that started to question  \"why are we house wives, why do we all dress the same, why are we servants to men, why cant we have jobs, why cant we drive , why cant we vote what is going on,  why are we given lobotomies if we show emotion or disobey our husbands\"? And then she slowly started to realize women were  being brainwashed and that women are fully capable of doing things outside of their house duties. I imagine it was much like this movie, like seeing through the simulation like social conditioning, and then being condemned by society for speaking out, and sometimes being forced to have lobotomies to make women  fall back in line with the social norms.
