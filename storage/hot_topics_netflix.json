Did you like it?\n\n\\- Do you think it is useful to watch English dubbed movies to learn English (if you are not a native English speaker)?\n\nPlease also let me know, if possible, where you're from (or, at least, if you are a native English speaker or not). Your input would be invaluable to my research, and I\u2019m truly grateful for any insights you can share.
