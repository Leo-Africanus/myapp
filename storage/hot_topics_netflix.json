Then, they described the recording devices she had set up. \n\nThe fact that the worst example of his 'abuse' that they shared from the recordings was that argument over the dinner sealed the deal for me. That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

His kids love to watch it and sometimes my GF and I like to watch a few shows.

At this point I decided to give in and pay the extra 10-18 dollars since I technically have gotten netflix for free the last few years. I saw I had to update to standard for an extra 11 dollars and then add a member for an extra 8 dollars or so. I dont mind. \n\nBut to my surprise Netflix doesnt allow extra member slots if you use a 3rd party to pay for part of the bill. Now im at a loss. I put back the ad version but now am at an empass. I dont want to pay netflix 30+ bucks a month just to have my brother and me have to use the account. \n\nIs there a way to somewhat share the account with my brother without this household BS?",

The key reasons for needing HEVC are:\n\n 1. 4K (and sometimes even Full HD) Requires HEVC on PC\n\n HEVC (H.265) is a more efficient codec than AVC (H.264). It compresses video better while keeping quality high.\n\n Netflix streams 4K content (and often HDR) using HEVC, which requires:\n\n   HEVC decoding capability\n\n   Secure content protection (DRM like Widevine L1 in hardware)\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the HEVC codec, Netflix falls back to AVC1, which maxes out at 480p or 720p, even with a 4K plan.\n\n 2. Windows 10/11 Doesn\u2019t Include HEVC by Default\n\n Microsoft used to bundle the HEVC codec for free.\n\n But around 2017, they stopped because:\n\n   HEVC is not free to license. It has royalty fees tied to it (paid to patent holders).\n\n   To reduce Windows licensing costs, Microsoft made it an optional \\\\$0.99 addon in the Store.\n\nThis is why TVs, phones, game consoles still get HEVC support for free \u2014 the manufacturer licenses it for that device. But with PCs (especially custombuilt desktops), you\u2019re responsible for getting the codec.\n\n 3. Why You Didn\u2019t Notice Before\n\n If you only watched Netflix at 720p or lower before, AVC1 was enough.\n\n Or you might\u2019ve been on a device that came with HEVC preinstalled (like a laptop from Dell, HP, etc.).\n\n Now that you're on the Premium plan, Netflix tries to stream 4K \u2014 but it can\u2019t unless your PC supports HEVC with DRM.\n\nWhy Charge \\\\$0.99 at All?\n\nThe \\\\$0.99 price is basically a token fee to offset Microsoft\u2019s licensing cost. The real reason you have to pay:\n\n Microsoft can't legally distribute HEVC for free on Windows unless it's covered by an OEM license (e.g. Dell paid for it for your laptop).\n\n You\u2019re only charged once per Microsoft account, and the codec is yours forever.",

        "content": "So, I love Tom Hardy. For the most part I will always support anything he\u2019s in. Hes one of the most \u201cnormal guys\u201d in the action world of Hollywood. Yes, all his American accents are circa 1945 Brooklyn, but whatcha gonna do. \n\nAll that being said I REALLY wanted to like Havoc. If you turn your brain COMPLETELY off, it\u2019s kind of possible. \n\nIt\u2019s the cabin scene though that they completely lost me. All three standing in the wide open while a dozen guys open up on them in full auto from about 100 feet away. Not only do they have time to duck inside and \u201ccover\u201d but nary a bullet hits a one of them. The walls are essentially cardboard and somehow they are not only not getting hit, but returning fire and getting kills instead themselves. Ludicrous doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. \n\nThis movie so desperately wanted to be an updated Max Payne kinda vibe, but instead it was more Uwe Boll Max Payne. Do better. ",
