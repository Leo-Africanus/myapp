        "content": "\nIt\u2019s become clear to me that Brian\u2019s parents were extremely smart about this tenuous situation, and they did everything they could to protect themselves. And lo and behold, they still have their freedom to this day:\n\n- Retained \u201cplausible deniability\u201d by not further prodding Brian for answers as to what happened to Gabby when he called them the night of the murder. \n\n- Sensed Brian\u2019s urgency and panic on the phone, so they retained their lawyer when Brian said he needed one, even at the cost of $25,000. \n\n- Followed the lawyer\u2019s advice not to speak to anyone regarding Gabby or Brian. Do not speak to anyone, law enforcement, neighbors, friends, Gabby\u2019s family. Most likely would incriminate themselves if they did speak. \n\n- Sheltered Brian from prying eyes when he got home and didn\u2019t prod him for further answers. They left Gabby\u2019s van in the driveway for anyone to see because they didn\u2019t know she was dead until the body was found.\n\n- Forced law enforcement to go through proper legal procedures at every junction, including if they wanted to speak to Brian directly. \n\n- Never let emotion cloud their judgement, so they wouldn\u2019t be prone to mistakes. \n\n- Followed proper law enforcement procedure and reported Brian missing when he didn\u2019t return home for 3-4 days. Possibly regretted the decision to let him leave, but he may have also left without their knowledge or they thought some time alone to clear his head would do him good. \n\n- Picked up the abandoned Mustang and brought it home when it was discovered. \n\n- Waited to go into the park until the reserve was open to the public after the flooding. \n\n- Cooperated with law enforcement during the search for Brian on the ground. \n\n- Located Brian\u2019s remains based on their knowledge of the park and previous visits with Brian. \n\nOf course this unemotional response may have left them seeming callous or heartless in the eyes of the public / neighbors / family, but I think the media did their fair share to portray them like that as well. \n\nI don\u2019t think they expected Brian to kill himself or I believe they would\u2019ve proactively sought treatment for his depression / suicidal thoughts. \n\nMost likely they also became victims of Brian\u2019s false narrative about what really happened to Gabby. Brian couldn\u2019t even admit it to himself with the suicide note. ",

If they had of spoken to police or FBI I believe he would have been taken in for questioning and possibly arrested or at least monitored very closely. Therefore not escaping so he could end his own life rather than face the consequences of his actions. \n\nSecondly - they lost their daughter. She has not communicated with them since Brian passed away. They never- according to her and her husband- confided in them. \n\nThirdly - their reputations in the community. People are angry at them. Blaming them for not assisting parents desperately trying to find their daughter. \n\nAnd finally financially - they had to pay Gabby\u2019s parents a significant sum - not disclosed - from the settlement of the civil lawsuit. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m wondering - was it in fact sound legal advice?\nWhat are your thoughts?
