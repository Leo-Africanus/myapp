By the time we agreed on something, I was like, \u201cDude, we basically wasted an entire evening doing nothing.\u201d It was ridiculous.\n\nIn a fit of frustration, I threw together this weird little site: cineswipe[dot]com Think of it like swiping on Tinder, but instead of deciding if you like Becky or Brad, you\u2019re deciding if you\u2019d watch Jaws or some random French indie flick. You swipe left or right on whatever comes up, and hopefully land on something you both can actually get behind before your popcorn goes cold.\n\nI\u2019m not selling anything, it\u2019s just a random idea I had to fix a personal annoyance. Not saying it\u2019s perfect\u2014there\u2019s probably some bizarre movies in there\u2014but it might help break that cycle of \u201cwhat do you wanna watch?\u201d \u201cI dunno, what do YOU wanna watch?\u201d and so on, until the heat death of the universe.\n\nIf anyone tries it and has thoughts, I\u2019m all ears. If not, that\u2019s cool too. Just figured I\u2019d share because it\u2019s 100% better than staring blankly at endless streaming menus. Enjoy or ignore\u2014no biggie.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm a bit baffled by a situation that is happening. I've had Netflix for over a decade with the same e-mail address. \n\nA few days ago I noticed I couldn't get into an the old e-mail that was tied to the netflix account due to too many attempts at logging in with the wrong password. I did a reset on the e-mail and moved on. Later I tried watching Netflix and I couldn't log in because of a wrong password, again I reset my Netflix password and logged in. Someone probably got that old email and attempted to log in most popular platforms. \n\nHowever when logging in it forces me to pay before I can access any of my account information, payment history, etc. I can't edit my profiles or anything. They took a payment 4 days ago on the same day they normally do so I don't want to re-enter my credit card info just yet. \n\nHere's the part that makes no sense to me, I went on the Netflix support site. (help.netflix.com) and the certificate appears valid. However when I connect with an agent they ask me for my name and e-mail (I'm already logged in but ok weird) and then they send be a form, directly on the chat that asks me to enter my credit card number and it even says on there that the agent will not be able to see what I type.....\n\nAm I going insane or is that like the most common type of scam ever? Obviously I did not enter anything and ended the chat, I mean, I can't believe that a company would ever identify  their customers through their credit card numbers but everything on the site appears to be valid otherwise I'm completely lost. \n\n",

        "content": "We watch shows, we either like them or hated them, but either way, we are done with the show and don't want to see the show again. This could be done by setting a \"Hide\" flag attached to the entire show, it would apply to all shows in the series. For example, we watched all of \"Monk\", so we could set the \"Hide\" flag and we'd never see \"Monk\" again in any search, except a search for \"Hidden\" shows. The thumbs up and down would indicate why the show was hidden.\n\nThere are other shows that we start watching and do not like, will never like, and don't watch to be bothered with ever again. Usually, these are Hallmark movies, but could be anything for anybody. We would mark these as thumbs down and Hidden. Then we are never bothered again with the show. Again, if we change our minds, we can go to the \"Hidden Shows\" page and unhide anything we want.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Some people seem to misunderstand. First - this is a completely optional feature, if you don't mark something as \"hidden\", you would never know the feature exists. Second - filtering out \"hidden\" shows is the default, but can be disabled (un-checked) so all shows would appear if you are looking for something that might be hidden.\n\nOn Netflix's side, this is more data to evaluate user preferences. It will also reduce network data by reducing the results of any report, so should be cost savings after implentation.",

        "content": "So about 10 years ago now, i remembered watching this show on Netflix. it was animated, but was more like a slide show of drawings. Not smooth movements. Had to do with a man who traveled away only for the rapture to start. He now must find a way back home after a majority of the population is gone. Thats all i remember, but i can't find it anywhere. Anyone know what i'm trying to find? Thanks.\n\n",
