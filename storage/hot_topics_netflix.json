I used to religiously wait for a new episode every week but now everything is available. Lucky you. That's all. I'm gonna do a rewatch XD",

I\u2019ve made it. And you can tell I\u2019ve made it because I talk really slow now, pause a lot, smoke a cigarette on stage, and let the crowd applaud my existence. There were way more stories than jokes. Not sharp stories that build to something clever, just rambling anecdotes that relied on the audience already being on his side. It felt less like he was trying to make people laugh and more like he knew people would cheer no matter what he said. And they did. This felt safe, comfortable and almost lazy. Like he knows the brand is bulletproof, so why bother tightening the material? I get that he\u2019s earned the right to do whatever he wants. He\u2019s one of the greatest to ever do it. But greatness doesn\u2019t mean every mic drop deserves a standing ovation. At some point, slowing your delivery and sounding profound isn\u2019t the same thing as being funny.\n\nIt just feels like we\u2019re watching a legend turn into a motivational speaker with better lighting, and the crowd keeps rewarding it.",

At least I think so. I love the characters too, it\u2019s actually hard for me to even pick a favorite lol. I\u2019m wondering where this show stands with other people, I assume it never got popular if it got cancelled after two seasons",

I came to realize Netflix has an absurd strategy to keep customers locked in releasing new series/shows at a steady pace but for the majority, series are almost never finished unless they are really classics or series they have acquired. I am really annoyed but the number of times I locked into one of the series and then have to realize there will not be any ending of the show. It came to the point where I even start to lookup whether or not there is going to be a final season before investing the time to check it out. \n\n  \nSeries which have left a bitter taste to me personally since there is no \"what's next\":\n\n* Marco Polo\n* Away\n* 1899\n* Snowpiercer\n* Barbarians\n* Pulse\n* The recruit\n* Boots\n* Lost in space (it has an ending but there was more imo)\n* ..\n\nI know this post is not going to make any difference and I understand more than anybody else the business, it is money first, customers second but damn me, damn me for watching unfinished series. Especially the science fiction seems to be affected by this problem quite a lot. (or maybe that is because I watch too many of those)\n\nI just hope I am not the only one who has this feeling and who has been disappointed more than once in the past years?",

By comparison, Arrow generated roughly half that amount of viewing time, while Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, and Black Lightning trailed far behind. The gap was driven by The Flash\u2019s long episode seasons, nine-season run, and strong rewatch behavior. Even compared to other licensed Netflix hits, few superhero shows matched its sustained minutes-watched performance. This dominance confirms that The Flash was not only the most popular DC series on Netflix U.S., but also the platform\u2019s most-watched licensed superhero show overall.",

I haven\u2019t had a TV attached to Netflix in years. I watch either through my Apple TV or on iPad. Totally confused as to how to fix this. Also, this is so stupid and Netflix sucks",
