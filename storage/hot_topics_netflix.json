This series dominated the genre of serial killers.\n\nAnd the character Dexter Morgan has been played so well by Micheal C Hall, truly amazing. It's just simply lovely.\n\nThe progression of season and new serial killers introduced in each season keep you hooked with the series.\n\nI am currently on the final season of Dexter and I must say it did not miss any aspect whatsoever.\n\nI am sure most of you have already seen it but, of you haven't, then I must say it's a must watch.",

I just feel like he\u2019s being being over the top about it. I get that obviously you don\u2019t want to lose listings and commission, however, at the end of the day how is he pissed off at Ryan for being taken off of the listing? If the fucking developer is not happy because nothing has sold that\u2019s on you it\u2019s not on Ryan. \n\nyes you\u2019re doing the best you can in a tough market, but the developer is looking for a pat on the back good job. They want the money. They want their return. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen any eps past this (s2 ep3), so maybe he gets over it. But this episode annoyed me \ud83d\ude05",
