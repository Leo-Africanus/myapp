        "content": "Surprisingly, I'm actually really liking Building the Band because it's a little more authentic than I expected, with the ability for the kids to pick their own groups (minus the fact that they only have 6 groups so timing matters....hope they change that in the future and then cut off how ever many that they need to with the first round of group performances. )\n\nIf 3Quency does not stay together, I'll be ticked because their voices blend so well in harmony. Their only other job is to get along, which they appear to be doing so far.\n\nWhatever group Alison is in, I think we all feel like the other two girls joined because it was Band #6 and there weren't other choices. She can sing but she's pretty much insufferable. \n\nSZN4 - not a huge fan of the band name but they are my faves for sure! That unique mixture of people....the beatiful strong voices of all of them (especially Cam but they all sound great,) Donzel's positive energy...so many more things that I can say about these kids but I love it.\n\nThe only other band that I really like (after SZN4 and 3Quency) is Soulidified. They have more work to do but all of them are so precious and so far have won my heart. \ud83e\udd0e\n\nIn the chaotic boy band (Million Miles to Wherever the Heck They are Going) I really like the mop haired Aussie. His personality is so cool and they can all sing. I do agree with people who have said that the tatted guy and his narcissistic Alison mean girl fling might be actors. Hope not but they are capturing some horrific moments so maybe it's for film.\n\nLastly, now I realize why Nicole left The Masked Singer. Smart move, girl. I've heard Netflix pays well and if this turns out to be a hit, you will be the superstar of the show and the money will keep on multiplying. Same with Queen Kelly leaving The Voice AUS. Wish I had their managers lol",

I get why people might enjoy that, but it's just not my type of show especially if it's mostly the same as season 1 and they just have different games. \nSo I guess I just wanted to ask if season 3 is similar to season 2 in that it mostly keeps focusing on the games itself?

His responses are unnatural and scripted, and none of the cast ever say \u201chi AJ!\u201d. The conversations don\u2019t flow and the editing is peculiar lol. I think AJ is staring straight into a teleprompter and the screen they appear on is CGI. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
