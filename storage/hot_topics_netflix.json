        "content": "I loved the first season and did not expect much from it, which might have been key. \n\nI was hoping for more of the same understated approach with brief bursts of action and situational resolution. \n\nThis was not that. This was a convulsed mess of overly complicated ideas and plot lines, with random characters that are just an inch deep on development. I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

Although it was never clear, because they dragged her into the cabin(?).  \n\nYep \u2014 dead I guess?  She never appeared again, so.  But the brother (Adam) tells Jana nothing.  The dad asks for a cup of coffee.  Then a bit later he crawls out to the shore and appears to have some sort of strange seizure.  The son (Adam) puts on his headphones.  Is the dad dead now too?\n\n\"We'll see mom and dad soon,\" the son tells his sister.  Ehm . . . okay, is that a look back to when they were alone in the boat, before it capsized (mentioned in the beginning)?  Nope, they seem to be on the island still, so it's the present.  \n\nAnd then too much psychological randomness to handle.  Pictures flashing by, views into different places without context.  All kids in a school being bombed (seemingly on the island too?).  And Yara, which I thought was Jana's late sister, wearing that shoe.  \n\nSuddenly the island is covered with water, rising and rising, and from the lighthouse a blow-up boat suddenly unfolds \u2014 which had previously been underneath the sand on the shore. \n\nThat's right after they managed to communicate their location on the radio and saw help pass by, upon which Adam thought he could swin out to the boat with a short rope for safety. \n\nWhat am I missing?  \nWhy was it so incomprehensible to me?",

I recently realized it's also on Netflix and since we already have Netflix and have nothing else to watch on Hulu currently, we're canceling Hulu. But when we switched to watching it on Netflix the 30-second \"previously on This Is Us\" recap no longer plays. It always played on Hulu. When we didn't feel like watching it, it was very easy to skip by pressing the \"forward 10 seconds\" button a couple times, but I found it nice to watch if we took a break from the show or when they brought back characters/storylines from several episodes or seasons back. \n\nI've clicked through the settings and can't find a way to get it to play. I also searched on this sub. In one post from 3 years ago someone said \"it's in trailers and more at the bottom of the episode list.\" I scrolled to the bottom of the episode list and there is nothing that says trailers and more. In another post from a year ago, someone said to toggle the \"watch from the beginning\" setting. I couldn't find that setting, and furthermore, when I googled how to find it, I found several other posts about it that said the actual function of that setting is (was?) to reset your watch history on a show so that it starts from the first episode of the first season again. That's not what I want to do.\n\nIf there is a setting that works in 2025 to cause the recap to play at the beginning of each episode let me know",

After we visit hongkong and macau, my wife noticed that some content are not showing up like the Apothecary Diaries after we visit those places. However, for my profile, the series is shown and i can watch it. Btw, she used esim while i used a physical sim for internet. How to troubleshoot this issue on my wife's profile? thanks",
