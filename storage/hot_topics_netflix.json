Incredible work by the camera crew as well to get each episode in a single shot. Also I\u2019m a social worker, and I cannot get over the scene with Jamie and the psychologist. It felt like a masterclass in appropriate/effective methods in evaluation and talk therapy. I am blown away by this show. I hope it gets many accolades come the next awards season.",

It seems to me that they found out about grahams story online somehow. And just found ppl that were scammed at the same time as he was. I just felt they could have done more work to show us who this horrible lady really was.

        "content": "I recently received an email notification saying by next preview club is available, and it is appearing on my Netflix Home Screen. However, I haven\u2019t received an email with my PIN that I am required to input before I can watch the movie. I haven\u2019t had this problem with past preview club programs and nothing has changed with my account (same email, etc.). The Netflix FAQ doesn\u2019t cover this.  I haven\u2019t the email with the survey link also, but without my PIN I can\u2019t watch it. Anyone have any suggestions on how I can resolve this issue? Thanks in advance. ",
