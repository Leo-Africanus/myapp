Do you actually enjoy how Netflix handles its series these days?\n\nThey drop a handful of episodes\u2014fewer and fewer \u2014and then split the season in half, making us wait\u00a0*years*\u00a0to get the rest. It\u2019s honestly driving me crazy.\n\nPersonally, I much prefer Disney+'s strategy of releasing one episode a week. It builds hype, whereas Netflix's approach kills it.\n\nLike... do they really think people still care about a show after all that time?\u00a0I can barely remember what I had for lunch, let alone a series I watched ages ago.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think.

This however was just not it. The acting was off. Why would you have American people with heavy American accents act as Russian boys? What is the deal with the female side character? Her acting was so rigid I cringed whenever she was on screen. The LINES good lord who wrote the script? There were so many unnecessary scenes- the flash back wasn\u2019t even a proper flashback. Like why did they tell us SO MANY times that the brother was the child of a mistress as if we couldn\u2019t grasp it the first time??? Like the male lead- I can tell he\u2019s a decent actor but his cringy lines make his acting seem lacklustre. Everything was predictable. This felt like a waste of time, money and effort (that is if we can find the effort in question) so nope I did not like this one marvel. -1/10",

I could probably watch the rest and figure it out, but I can't follow the storyline at all and so I don't think that's the course of action for me.

Something not precisely correct according to Mira, Zoey and Celine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it could be, or how, I\u2019m terrible at making theories and all that stuff, but yknow what I mean.\n\nI just think that if they had made her a villain, the story would\u2019ve been SO interesting, and something completely different from all the other animated PG movies. We could easily see that in adults movies/shows, but I don\u2019t recall ever seeing the main character become a villain in a kids movie, correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be out of nowhere, she had all the reasons to be one.\n\n- Rumi feeling like no one would accept her and truly love her because of her patterns, since that\u2019s what Celine made her believe her whole life, just in a more roundabout way.\n\n- Her feeling like she could never be a worthy demon hunter until her patterns were gone\n\n- The fact that she worked so hard to get rid of all demons, and her own patterns, but her friends still raised their weapons against her\n\nIt\u2019s like even with all her efforts, nothing she ever did was enough for the people that surrounded her, and even for herself.\n\nIf you have something more deep to add that I probably didn\u2019t have in mind, I would love to read it, and please tell me I\u2019m not the only one!

I find it insane the cast all agreed this was the best possible ending.\n\nSo many characters wasted and built-up for nothing.\n\nJun-ho? He's a terrible Dora the Explorer. All this searching for the island across 2 seasons, WASTED. He doesn't even TALK to his brother. How in the hell is him just being sent the baby and money a satisfying conclusion for his character?\n\nDae-ho is another example. All this mystery of whether he's a fake marine or lying. It seems like he has an abusive dad, always changing the subject whenever he's brought up. You think we're going to get some story of him being traumatized right? NOPE! He's literally just a fake marine, he goes crazy and then he dies, murdered by Gi-hun.\n\nThe mother and son were an exact copy of the wife and husband. Grandma gives the inspiring speech... and then just kills herself.\n\nThe season is described as \"forgiveness\" by Lee Jung-jae. What forgiveness? I didn't see ANY of that.\n\nAnd MG Coin? This season basically just proved Thanos was right. Throughout the first 5 episodes, he's a genuinely well-written morally gray character... and then the finale throws it ALL out the window in lightning speed. He goes from protecting Gi-hun and the baby to suddenly trying to murder both. Right after asking if the baby is okay.\n\nThe writer/director claims he wasn't supposed to be a one dimensional villain but rather make \"human/realistic decisions\" but NONE of that was it. He just turned cartoonishly evil in the blink of an eye. A worse Sang-woo, at least his turn was gradual.\n\nAnd the ending doesn't even feel like a proper conclusion, just a set-up for the sequel's. I don't even need to get into the VIP's.",

I ask cuz I took the security measures needed so that no unwanted future payments go through (changing my PayPal password, adding 2FA, unlinking Netflix from my subscriptions/automatic payment page).",

It beats pooping on the floor.  It's a logical measure to take when the sewage system stops working.  Poop in bags, it can all be collected, and it can be placed and contained in an appropriate area.  Truck drivers and van lifers poop in bags all the time.  It's no big deal.\n\nThose three women...

It's like they were clueless about the fact they were born as human animals with biologic processes.  They seemed to not have an idea about how they could squat to pee in a shower.

Ironically, I think these are exactly what made the ending exceptional. It didn't appeal to hopes or expectations, and instead, we were given a bleak conclusion, which aligns with the main theme of the show\u2014oppression. No matter how righteous your intentions are, like Gi-hun, you cannot defeat a powerful entity with bare fists. He was *extremely* lucky, but he had no chance of defeating The Frontman. In the end, the powerful entity wins.\n\nMost did not like how certain characters were killed off early and the shifts in their behavior. But that's the point. The entire game was a matter of life or death, and it shouldn't be any wonder why people change from it. Hyun-ju and Jun-jee were likeable characters\u2014we rooted for them. But oppression makes no exceptions.\n\nGeum-ja's suicide was no doubt a shock\u2014many criticized it for being an act she would never do. But is that really the case? We witnessed her kill her own son. In season 2, she once said that if her son died, she would lose any reason for living. Sure, she had Jun-hee and her baby to care for, but try to think of her headspace. Her son was a loser. She witnessed him grow up wallowing in self-hatred after continuously being trampled on by everyone in his vicinity, to the point that he nearly killed himself. Now, how could a mother continue living after bearing that kind of burden? It's through oppression and self-preservation that her son was forced into trying to kill Jun-hee, and it was also its influence that made Geum-ja kill her son. Once again, oppression took victory.\n\nAnother thing that fans criticized was Dae-ho's transformation into an antagonist\u2014many said that it did not fit his character. However, it makes sense. Dae-ho may have appeared enthusiastic, prideful, or \"tough,\" but in reality he was a coward, and oppression only worsened his state. An oppressive entity destroys a person's determination. Resilience is something you cannot easily obtain\u2014this is especially true in the case of Dae-ho. Witnessing hundreds of people die and knowing that you *may* be next won't always be enough to make you stand up courageously. A coward like Dae-ho had no heart to be a hero, so in the end, he failed to assist them in their revolt and dropped all the blame on Gi-hun.\n\nSomething I found jarring this season is the lack of dialogue, especially on Gi-hun's part, but I think that's intentional. Last season, we anticipated him to be the hero to save the day. When his plans failed, that's when everything sunk in. Oppression to such a large degree as this fails to empower. Not only does it make a person physically unable to stand up and fight but also fail to speak up. His silence was a sign of defeat.\n\n*\"We are not horses. We are humans. And humans are...\"*\n\nHe did not get to finish his sentence. Most of us might have expected a powerful speech filled with emotion. But even before he jumped off to meet his demise, his feelings were already killed. There was nothing else to say. It was pointless.\n\nThe players saw the cruel aspects of humanity. No-eul, a soldier, saw its compassionate side. She was a North Korean refugee\u2014she had lived through cruelty, and being a soldier in these games, she witnessed humanity at its worst. However, a part of her still had an inch of mercy and made the effort to save Gyeong-seok, the father of Na-yeon, a young cancer patient. After successfully fulfilling her plans and discovering that her daughter had \"died,\" she was about to shoot herself. But seeing Gi-hun sacrifice his life to save the baby changed her decision. When she met the father months later, she discovered that people donated for his daughter's treatment, showing humanity's empathetic side. Later on, the broker she spoke to last season eventually helped her track down her daughter. As grim as the themes are about society, you can't disregard its strengths, and the series showed that side in these instances\u2014ironically from the perspective of one of the guards.\n\nFinally, everyone expected one big fight between Jun-ho and his brother. But that never came, and when he did meet his brother, he barely did anything. His lack of action is due to the fact that he was an outsider. Gi-hun returned because he experienced the oppression, and it inspired in him a sense of justice\u2014that's why he planned the revolt. Jun-ho never knew its entirety. The main motive why he put so much effort into finding the island in the first place was to see his brother and know why he joined. When he finally got the chance to see him, he begged desperately. I think at this point he realized the futility in what he was doing\u2014his brother was in too deep. There was also no use fighting him\u2014that's not what he was there for.\n\nThis final season had its flaws, but it tied everything together surprisingly well\u2014in a way that didn't give in to clich\u00e9s. It was unpredictable and painfully bleak, which complemented the message. Most of us might have the optimistic notion of oppression as a requisite to justice\u2014too often, media portrays oppression as a force that can be toppled through righteousness. But in reality, there will be instances when it's the complete opposite.",

        "content": "I\u2019m disappointed to say the least. The ending was so meh. I had such high expectations from this season considering it was gonna be the last but it seemed as though the creators wanted to quickly finish it. They couldn\u2019t have chosen worst actors to play the Vips because the dialogue delivery was so terrible especially the woman vips\u2019. I get that gi hun\u2019s spirit was crushed and he didn\u2019t have anything to say but they could have added some more dialogues. He seemed disinterested which I get but it was boring because he\u2019s my fav character. Also Hwang not believing woo that captain park was playing them was so annoying, woo was his teammate and him choosing to believe the captain was just\ud83d\ude16. The ending they gave to the mother son duo too was quite anticlimactic. So many characters died very quickly in the hide and seek game, I couldn\u2019t understand who died and how (player 44 seon and dae ho) I wish they added something more to Dae ho\u2019s storyline instead of killing him right away. In the end, I kinda expected gi hun to kill himself but the way he fought player 333 and protected the baby I wish he died once he was out of the game. I was also at some point hoping he\u2019d give the baby to that North Korean guard with a daughter in china. Seeing Cate Blanchett in the end was unexpected and it felt like an advertisement. When gi hun meets the front man and he takes off his mask I was kinda hoping they\u2019d share a passionate kiss even tho gi hun was fuming with anger and was astonished. The kiss would have made up for the plot they tried to sell and made my 6hrs worth it. I liked how the entire island blew up and all the guards running around to escape it. That and the front man almost tearing up seeing gi hun muster the courage to kill all the other players was peak squid game moment for me. All in all I\u2019d give it a 6/10. (This is my first review that I\u2019ve ever written so if my writing style was not on point or too casual please don\u2019t mind)",

        "content": "\nJust an idea: I think Netflix should add an incognito mode feature to the app! Sometimes users just want to watch something without it affecting their recommendations or appearing in their viewing history. This would be really helpful for people who share accounts, or even just for times when you\u2019re watching something different from your usual preferences\u2014like a kid\u2019s movie, a guilty pleasure show, or a documentary for school.\n\nAdding incognito mode would allow users to explore more content freely, without worrying about Netflix\u2019s algorithm messing up their suggestions. People use incognito mode in web browsers all the time for similar reasons\u2014why not bring that privacy option to streaming too?\n\nAlso, I noticed a small typo in the original idea\u2014\u201cincognito mouse\u201d was probably meant to say \u201cincognito mode.\u201d But hey, imagine a sneaky little mouse sneaking around Netflix too! \ud83d\ude04\n\nOverall, I think this feature could attract a lot more users and keep current ones happier.\n",
