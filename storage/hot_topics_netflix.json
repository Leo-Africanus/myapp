        "content": "I was really enjoying the movie and the comedy until the end. It was so bad, I kept expecting a last minute reveal but there was none. So this whole time you have Elizabeth, this former MI6 agent investigating four murders, and then she finally cracks them, and despite their morally ambiguous nature she takes them to the police anyway. Like Penny killed a man for a woman who would never get justice in the courts. Totally valid in my opinion! There was no justice for women in that day. And then you have Penny\u2019s husband killing a piece of trash businessman to protect his wife. Again, I personally wouldn\u2019t complain. But instead of understanding and saying \u201chm maybe we should not pursue this mystery\u201d she confronts the husband which leads him to killing himself and his wife. And of course this is expected, because jail at that age?? Meanwhile, she lets a crime boss who cut off people\u2019s fingers, steals people\u2019s passports, and is essentially facilitating modern slavery live his life as a floralist because she wants the retirement home to stay open. Talk about double standards?! She has a moral superiority complex for sure. And the Polish guy, Bogdan, was literally just trying to escape what was essentially slavery to see his dying mother, and yet his story is ended when he\u2019s arrested as well. It left such a sour taste in my mouth. These people, who had good reasons to do what they did, got arrested and a crime lord didn\u2019t? And that\u2019s just the end of the movie and Elizabeth gets to dance and pretend like she didn\u2019t ruin three peoples lives? Like WTF??\n\nAlso what is it with everyone confessing to their crimes?? There was no evidence to prove Penny and her husband did anything, but he just admits to it with the slightest pressure. He would\u2019ve been fine otherwise. And Bogdan telling Elizabeth\u2019s husband even though he also had no evidence? Come on, lazy way to conclude the story.\n\nAnyway, TLDR it had so much potential but the ending ruined it",

This is about Owen, Khloe, his mother, Kendra\u2019s husband and Lauryn. This should have been about the victims. They should have highlighted everything Kendra took from Shawn (Kendra\u2019s husband.) Kendra is literally a family annihilator without the redrum. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t Netflix put more emphasis on the sexual messages to minors??? Why did Netflix make a mockery of this situation??? Why didn\u2019t they center the other parents? Why platform a literal abuser??\n\n\nY\u2019all might drag me for this but I feel like Lauryn\u2019s reactions are odd. Like I didn\u2019t see any shock or surprise or even anger. I\u2019m extremely surprised that the fact that Lauryn stayed in constant contact with her mother. It almost seems\u2026 dismissive of the whole ordeal. \n\nShawn and Lauryn lost EVERYTHING and Kendra is making it seem cool. I\u2019m just appalled. ",

        "content": "This was a very misleading documentary.\n\nThe emphasis was on all the wrong places - it would even lead some to question if she was the only culprit or if her daughter was involved.\n\nThere was no explanation as to how some of the details in the messages (that contained information that only the close groups of students would be privy to) would be open knowledge to Kendra.\n\nRather then answering the loose ends, or asking Kendra the right questions, they actually gave Kendra a narrative to run with - \u201c I was raped and wanted to control the outcome for my daughter, and protect her\u201d\u2026 by you know, telling her to kill herself?\n\nBased on the way this whole story was documented, I\u2019d (potentially incorrectly) infer from this that the mother AND daughter had something to do with this. The mother obviously got caught - hence why the daughter is so forgiving and willing to reconcile. This also explains her lack of reaction when the police tell her this information. The mother was less concerned about her daughter finding out in that moment then the others at the school\u2026\n\nIf this was directed a bit better and answered the important questions - and also maybe emphasized that this woman, if she did act alone - correctly portrayed that she was a predator, obsessed with her daughters boyfriend and jealous of her own daughter\u2026 then I think this whole documentary would have made more sense.\n\nThis leaves a lot more questions than answers, and unfortunately, might leave some (like me) with the potentially wrong impression that the daughter and mother were both in on this.

This wasnt a OOPSIE moment. And no Kendra, we have not all broke the law but got away with it, and certainly not to this level. Please, the rationalization of it all. People try to logically rationalize their actions as if it makes them understandable. Girl, Hitler had his reasons too, and was very convincing in his rationale, he still was a monster. That woman gives me chills. I have strong reasons to believe her daughter will cut her off way later in life, when she is going to become more aware. At the moment, she\u2019s too young to fully process it and have perspective. She\u2019s in a bubble. She clearly doesnt seem to fully understand.",

I wonder if it needed to be a Netflix show - maybe it would have been better for this to die down as a local news story, to protect everyone involved\u2019s sanity. \n\nOn a bright side, I wonder if the attention to this might lead to more checks so that what all of us noticed - it was a sexual harassment of minors rather than just catfishing - gets properly investigated and hopefully leads to either more jail time or stricter consequences.

        "content": "Reading the comments here, most people agree Kendra is a psychopath and pedophile, which: yes absolutely. And I agree she needs to be locked away for a much longer time (and studied).  But there are some other takes I had that I don\u2019t see reflected. What do you think, and what unpopular opinions do you have? Please share:\n\n1. Yes, obviously Kendra was fixated on Owen, even when he was still a little prepubescent boy (sick). And she was jealous of Lauryn for being with him. That\u2019s all the comments I\u2019ve read. But I believe it went much deeper than that. She was also deeply jealous that her daughter was growing into a pretty teenager who had her whole life ahead of her and hadn\u2019t fucked up her marriage, finances and life like Kendra had. Owen was the target of her fixation but It wasn\u2019t only about Owen. There\u2019s a lot more going on. \n\n2. I\u2019m sorry but Owen\u2019s parents/mother are not the heroes people are making them out to be. Why in the free world would they not take the kid\u2019s phone away? He was being harassed into a place of suicidal ideation. They are terrible parents for letting him just deal with it while the mom pranced around pretending she was a star on Law &amp;\nOrder \n\n3. Lauryn\u2019s dad was an incompetent father. I believe Kendra is a master manipulator but what the hell must he have been doing to not see signs that something was terribly wrong? I think he was having affairs/a double life or at the very least was willfully burying his head in the sand. What do you mean you trusted your wife to handle your daughter\u2019s severe sexual harassment and abuse? You didn\u2019t think you should help? You didn\u2019t think the situation warranted all hands on deck? Where the hell were you the whole time? And all he could say about Lauryn now is that she\u2019s \u201cgrowing\u201d and will be a \u201cbeautiful woman.\u201d  Something is also off with him. \n\n4. Regarding Lauryn's non-emotional reaction to what her mom did to her: Lauryn never had close friends and was always quiet and withdrawn, per all her peers. Owen said she was trying to isolate him from his friends so it was just \u201cthe two of us\u201d. As far as we saw, Kendra was her primary parent, with barely any paternal involvement. Kendra\u2019s sociopathic ways are normal to Lauryn because it\u2019s all she knows. (I hope she gets a lifetime of therapy.) During the confession conversation, either she was in shock and, as any\n15 year old child would be, confused and unable to process the emotions on the spot (and also focused on following an authority figure\u2019s directions to call her dad) \u2026or she knew or suspected her mom was behind this.",

I didn't love the show and I was deeply affected by the depiction of rape and suicide (I saw it when it came out and I was 15 so you can imagine, it was uncensored) but I think everyone quite literally embodied their characters very well, especially Dylan and Katherine, which is probably the reason why people were able to invest in this show in the first place. I remember tearing up after Clay's tape and the last 3 episodes just ripped my heart out, but I feel bad for these actors because most of them (especially Katherine) aren't seen much after this and it might be because of type casting or the bad reputation this show got.",

        "content": "So I\u2019m halfway through S2 of My Life With The Walter Boys and it has just made me so much more aghast that this show got a second season, yet masterpieces like *frickin emmy nominated* The Residence and Kaos didn\u2019t?!?! \n\nI liked MLWTWB\u2019s first season - nothing amazing but an easy enjoyable watch. But this season has so far been meh. \nAnd now, currently on the big scene at the house and just\u2026 the acting is awful, the premise is stupid\u2026 \n\nAnd it\u2019s enraged me! Incredible shows getting cancelled when stuff like this gets the greenlight?! \n\nWhen do we boycott and show netflix that this is not ok/ find a way for other services to take on shows &amp;actually continue them even if they don\u2019t get binged &amp; no. 1 in 30 countries the first week they\u2019re out?!? \n\nHonestly, when do we all boycott netflix for serving us shows that are pretty trash over genuinely amazingly crafted, acted &amp; executed productions?!",

        "content": "Hey! So, I've bought myself the Netflix subscription service for 5 \u20ac (with ads) on my PS5. On it Netflix works flawlessly but when I try to log in on my phone I can enter my email and password correctly but get send to the payment page of registration on Netflix.\n\nThis is where I'm lost. Why am I getting sent to the payment page when I obviously already have a plan and just try to log in on another device? How can I log in on my phone? I did not even want to watch something on my phone, I just wanted to browse Netflix to see what I'd want to watch in the evening.  \n\nThanks in advance! :)",

And she was doing two jobs? Her husband did not notice this woman was not contributing ANY money? And he looked blue collar. Their last house looked like a trailer home. How do you not know your wife doesn\u2019t have one job, much less 2? Who was filling out these rental applications?\n\nThis whole story was weird. But that one part I major side eyed because it made no sense. You can\u2019t really hide whole ass salaries like that. ",

It felt forced and drawn out. I think this ended up taking away from the experience more than it added.\n\nThe accents were thick and difficult to understand. This made it challenging to get invested in alot of the dialogue.\n\n\n\n",

But she was also obsessed with the boyfriend! And then we learn that she lied about having a job! And then we hear her skirt accountability blaming it on her trauma, and then we see how manipulative she is at every level. Like\u2026 I have questions. Weigh in on any:\n\n1. WTF did we just watch?\n2. What mentally illness do you think she has? And what makes you think that?\n3. Why was she fired?? We need a follow up on this. Sounds like Casey Anthony at Universal Studios..\n4. We\u2019re all in agreement that she was obsessed with Owen right? \n5. HOW DID THIS PSYCHOPATH GET FREE IN 18 MONTHS?",
