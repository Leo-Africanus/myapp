Even other bands (Siren Society and Soulidified) showed that they don\u2019t like Allison. A member or Siren Society even blurred her face in a group photo lol (deserved). \n\nAlso keep in mind Alison talked about it and never apologized. She said it was evil editing which is proven not to be since her groups members talked about it after the show. So she is also a liar lol.\n\nSo maybe even tho they may not be best friends, I just think this is very weird from Nori to make tiktoks with Alison. \n",

        "content": "Think about a game that's like Hogwarts Legacy but it takes place at Nevermore Academy in the Wednesday universe. You could pick the power, gender and appearance of your character where the things you could do would be decided by your power.\n\nYou could have friendships and romantic relationships, you could date the other students/outcasts at Nevermore according to your gender preference.\n\nYou would be assigned your dorm hall, dorm and roommate which would be part of the games story. Your roommate would be the same as the gender yours so if you picked to be a guy your roommate would be a guy and it would be the same if you picked to be a girl, your roommate would be a girl. Your roommate would always be the same in the story every time you play the story so they could actually be part of the story.\n\nThe story would make sense with what happens in the show and would contain things from the show like the Poe Cup and The Nightshades.\n\nThe game would contain side quests where some of them would correlate to the power you chose.\n\nAfter the story is done you could walk around the campus and still do classes like learning about carnivorous plants and fencing. There would be extracurricular activities like choir or archery. You could still talk to NPC's after the story is over and make relationships with them.\n\nThe game would have other locations outside Nevermore like Jericho, The Weathervane, Crackstones Crypt or even the Gates family mansion.\n\nAfter The Wednesday Series ends I think this game could work, the only problems would be the amount of powers in Wednesday, the useless powers in Wednesday, the useful ones that become useless after the story ends like the visions or if the game would be possible after the Wednesday Series ends because we don't even know what will happen in the show but yet again the game could take place before the show takes place.\n\nSo yeah that was my game idea if Netflix would make a Nevermore game, I wanna hear your thoughts on it so feel free to comment anything or ask anything.",

        "content": "So I've been watching the best show on the planet - Lost through Netflix, but lately I keep getting this popup at the beginning of an episode saying that I only have until August 14 to finish watching it. Does that mean it will only stop showing in my region or all together?",
