Either she's gonna be an important character, or Netflix wants star power (as usual) to hype up the final season.\n\nThen it became as bland as it could be: She's the new \"Papa\", trying to restore \"the program\". She even does exactly what was shown in the trailer, shooting at Eleven &amp; co.\n\nI know that being Sarah Connor in those 2 terminator movies is the only career highlight of her, but being in Stranger things doesn't change much either (for her &amp; the show)",

If there are english subtitles built into a show or movie, even with subtitles off Netflix adds their own subtitles and puts them on top of the built in subtitles. I wanted to add a picture of the issue but I dont think this subreddit allows it. \n\nI can see that the subtitle option is obviously turned off since the subtitles only happen when a language other than English is spoken. Its impossible to read what's on the screen which can affect the plot of what I'm watching. I've tried to find solutions but haven't had any luck. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4W8QtEo",

No explanation of why they were all friends then stopped being friends when they all seemed to watch Anna\u2019s rape\n4. Why did Zoe stop being friends with Helen and Rachel if she was complicit in the rape?\n5. Why was Catherine trying to get back at Anna when it was Anna that was raped? What was with all the \u201cmurder\u201d supplies she got Richard to buy\n6. Jack said Alice showed signs of dementia during the year Anna left. Was she premeditating that far in advance?\n\nFinally, how am I supposed to believe an old woman is capable of pulling off gruesome murders that require lots of physical strength as noted in one episode\u2026 I mean 40 stab wounds? Also, how did she get the friendship bracelets? Did Anna have them in her box I.e do we assume they all gave them back to her?\n\nWhat was the side story about the blackmail In Rachel\u2019s phone when it came to their weird shit with Duffie?\n\nLazy ending and the show had more potential.",

Look at how interesting the romance felt in heated rivalry compared to people we meet on vacation, heck even Emily in Paris romance arks are better though people are tired of them now.\n\nThis movie while watchable was just not it, there just wasn't really a reason as to why they did not get together earlier . I feel like friends to lovers works only in tv shows, like that is why so many people were shipping Harry and Hermione ( well that is a series of films/books but you get the point ).\n\nThe only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex.\n\nI don't get why Alex was pissed at Poppy for not I guess being more forward with her feelings when um he has a girlfriend and even got engaged to her after they had an emotional moment the previous night ? Like isn't that him running away and not wanting to acknowledge he feelings for Poppy and he is accusing her of running away?\n\nThe ending where Poppy was like \" home is where you re with your person \" was soo juvenile .\n\n  \nEdit : I know I said the \" only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex but really it was for Alex to have those boundaries , he was the one engaged to Sarah after all , why is it Poppy the one to apologise.

It\u2019s on my laptop, I\u2019ve uninstalled and reinstalled yet the issue persists. It\u2019s extremely irritating ",
