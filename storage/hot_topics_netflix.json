When I saw the title my hopes went up for a long-due second season, but this is just stupid :(",

Given the name of the series, I expected that it would be mostly a documentary about Team USA, which wasn't necessarily my primary interest, but I was fine with if I got to see some Curry highlights.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how the other countries were featured just as significantly, probably pretty close to even time with the US (in accordance with the depth of their run in the tournament). Besides interviews with the players and coaches talking about their lives and about the games, they also followed the teams in the locker room, training sessions, and off the court before and during the Olympics. Team France and Team Serbia were followed very extensively. Team Canada was highlighted quite a bit too. Only Team Germany got the shaft in terms of how much it was featured given their 4th place.\n\nI think the players that were followed the most (in terms of interviews, behind the scenes camera time, family life, etc) were probably (in no particular order) Durant (USA), Batum (FRA), and Bogdanovic (SRB) followed by 2-3 other players and coaches from each of those countries and Canada.\n\nDon't be turned off from this Obama executive produced miniseries because you thought it would just be a Team USA chest thumping piece. It's much more than that.",

Do i just hope for the best, or try to contact Netflix support, which is also a problem, since I haven't been able to contact them about previous issues.\n\nAny help would be kindly appreciated, thank you.\n",
