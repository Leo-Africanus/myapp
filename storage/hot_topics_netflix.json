If you rewatch the show with that in mind everything makes sense.\n\nThey tell each other when they are the millionaire off camera. They have to fool the producers and the audience too \u201cthe ultimate lie\u201d to pull it off, so they sell it as best they can.\n\nWhen Sam is the millionaire, despite obvious clues pointing to her, Cara keeps coming up with reasons to go for someone else.\n\nSam gets away with her Justin Timberlake agenda by using it with Cara, how does she not realize when she hears her do it a second time at the table? Cause she\u2019s on her side, she only has to worry about Jaymie catching on.\n\nSam\u2019s go to \u201cfake lying face\u201d when she\u2019s the millionaire was a wide open mouth, she uses it when the person they voted for has no money in the box at the elimination dinner. \n\nWhen Cara is the millionaire she tells sam off camera. They masterfully break up the guys alliance and start voting them out.\n\nSam tells Cara off camera the clue about the millionaire was 2 sisters. Later, on camera she asks and Cara knows to lie.\n\nCara has the guts to sabotage her laser challenge with Sydney because she has the assurance that sam will not vote for her no matter what and that sam can probably sway corey. Only reason she takes that \u201crisk\u201d. If corey moves to vote Cara out, sam would just deadlock it. Both Cara and sam view Sydney as their biggest threat and corey easy manipulated.\n\nWhen Sydney opens her box, fake big open mouth from sam.\n\nAt the end when Cara wins, Sam is kind of weirdly excited and not that upset. After seeing Cara cry due to winning and corey cry due to losing, Sam figures she needs to cry to to sell it and no tears actually come out cause they are fake crocodile tears.\n\nWatch the show again there are more tells not listed here but it\u2019s plain as day. Cheaters Cara and Sam need to be exposed! \n\n\n",

Why didn\u2019t these parents file a criminal complaint against her if she SA\u2019d your child? \n\nThese parents who filed the lawsuit settled as soon as they got the money. Throughout the series them and the kids keep on saying they are worried for Piper and they wanna save her but, they stopped the fight when a settlement came. Shouldn\u2019t they have continued the case till Tiffany was held accountable by the court? Like why would you wanna make money of this too? \n\nFor anyone\u2019s child who had being SA\u2019d, the better thing would be to see the person who did this face justice rather than take money and forget it. I\u2019m baffled by it. \n\nWhy can\u2019t the law enforcement look into this and investigate all these claims and get the people responsible for this accountable? ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve seen mostly positive takes about this movie here, so I was curious\u2014did anyone else ***not*** enjoy it? Personally, I didn\u2019t like it much. It gave me post-Infinity War Avengers vibes\u2014trying to juggle being super funny and deeply serious all at once. Maybe I\u2019m just a bit burnt out on that kind of tone.\n\nI was also surprised by how many A-list actors were in it. At first, that was actually what drew me in, but in the end, it didn\u2019t really work for me. It felt like the star power overshadowed the story. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s role in particular threw me off\u2014it didn\u2019t feel like a natural fit compared to his past performances. The \u201chot scientist\u201d angle also felt a bit forced. Not to say he wasn\u2019t handsome in his prime, but the way it was played up didn\u2019t really land for me. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have bothered me as much if he weren\u2019t such a big name\u2014it kind of made the whole thing feel like it was trying too hard to flatter him.\n\nPlease be nice, I am just sharing my thoughts about the movie.\n\nEdit: And the satire? It just felt way too on-the-nose. Instead of being sharp or subtle, it came across as preachy and heavy-handed. I get what the movie was trying to say, but it felt like it didn\u2019t trust the audience to connect the dots. That really took me out of it\u2014and honestly, I ended up really disliking it because of that.",

        "title": "Million Dollar Secret Winner",
        "content": "This is one of the best reality game shows in Netflix. I was hooked from the beginning.\n\nThere were plenty of times I wanted to scream at the contestants, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell them this\u2026\u201d to convince them you\u2019re not the millionaire, but they end up getting emotional, defensive and raising voices. I learnt that getting defensive like your \u201clife\u201d is on the line can be a truth / honestly signal instead of a signal for deceit. It happened every time in the game (eg Chris, Jaimi) \n\nFor example, Jaimi was twice a suspect. One for voting Lydia and telling the truth. (Sam and Sydnee lied so they wouldn\u2019t be targets) No one believed Jaimi. To me, if I was the millionaire (or not), I would lie about voting Lydia because it instantly puts a target on my back because that was the clue. Jaimi admitted to voting Lydia. So it was obvious she was telling the truth! If you were worried of being caught, you would lie.\n\nStill, no one believed Jaimi. When they found out from the clue that she wasn\u2019t the millionaire, Jaimi could have used that as proof to the group for the next time they suspect her.\n\nAgain, when she was the suspected millionaire, everyone thought it\u2019s her because she told Sam to having two sisters (clue) and everyone refused to believe that another person would conceal it or lie about it. They would always target truth tellers (eg Jaimi or Corey in this case) When Jaimi was in the chopping block, again, she just screamed and cried to defend herself which we already know does not change people\u2019s minds.She could have used the last time she was suspected as proof that she was telling the truth (eg Last time you didnt believe me, and you found out I was telling the truth. This is a game of deception, someone is lying. Anyone who has been honest has been an easy target and has been pinned as the millionaire)\n\n Next, I feel terribly bad for Corey in a way. I don\u2019t think he would ever be able to trust anyone after this show. Lol but in a way, he was naive and his intuition was off throughout the show. He always suspected easy targets instead of thinking deeper (if I was the millionaire, how would I act?) this was missing from him throughout so in a way he was easily manipulated by Cara.\n\nFinally, I feel conflicted about Cara winning because she wasn\u2019t that exciting to watch. But by the end of episode 6, I had a feeling she would win or at least play big in the finale. Why? Because she flew under the radar, everyone trusted her, and she actively kept information about herself hidden. She chose not to share. Her intuition was correct almost all of the time too (Sam was asking info about her sisters because she knew she had the clue, Corey and Sam would vote Sydnee out, Sydnee had immunity, Corey took her box etc) She played the game so very well because of her intuition but I so wanted the winners to either be Sydnee or Sam. They just actively played the game and revealed just enough, but because they were threats that put them in everyone\u2019s radars to be voted off either way! \n\nSam was correct most of time but her emotions got in the way in which she trusted Cara. She kept saying she didn\u2019t have it in her to think Cara would even ever be the millionaire because she wouldn\u2019t let herself go there - that Cara is capable of deceit. This was Sam\u2019s downfall and toxic trait lol Had she kept people at bay and not let her emotions cloud her I believe she would have won. Corey was the same but Corey was off throughout lol \n\nI wonder how they are and what they think about how they were all duped as Sydnee would put it.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently bought a set of speakers (2.0) that i would like to connect to my smart tv via optical cable.   \nEverything works but there is a significant difference in sound quality between netflix and spotify or youtube. I cannot select a 5.1 audio option in the settings, but i suspect i might still not be getting 2.0 audio. Is this possible? Can i somehow change the audio settings?\n\nThank you very much",
