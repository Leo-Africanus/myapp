        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m trying to track down a Japanese film I watched on Netflix around 2010-2011. I\u2019m sure it was a sex film. Not sexual scenes but scenes with full blast sex. The movie had explicit sex scenes, comedic elements, and was definitely in the adult or niche section of Netflix at the time.\n\nSome details I remember:\n\t\u2022\tThe film featured actual sex scenes (not just sexual content, but actual explicit scenes) of a young woman and an old man where he feels her up on and begins to try and have sex with her, he tries to penetrate her but she keeps blowing him until he finishes to prevent him from wanting to feel like finishing in her or whatever. \n\t\u2022\tIt had a comedic tone, not taking itself seriously.\n\t\u2022\tThere were scenes involving bugs being used in fights or some bizarre concept along those lines.\n\t\u2022\tAt one point, the suns face turned to the face of one Japanese dude in the film and started talking to him.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the word \u201csex\u201d was in the title, but it\u2019s been so long I can\u2019t recall the exact name. Has anyone seen a film with these themes from that era? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Here's a rewritten version:\n\nCritiquing Lily Bloom's Character: How Her Behaviors Attract Violence\n\nAs a liberal feminist, I believe it's crucial to examine Lily Bloom's character flaws that make her vulnerable to violence. Her actions, though often romanticized, demonstrate harmful patterns.\n\nKey Issues:\n\n1. Ambiguous Boundaries: At that party where they first sleep together we see how the character plays with \"no\" - this toxic dynamic that exists in our world where if we say yes we are a ho that gets used and discarded so we are pushed to say \u201cno\u201d they\u2019re this culture of encouraging pursuit, but subconsciously that does plant the seeds for a dynamic where no isn\u2019t exactly no. \n\n2. Lack of honesty and transparency: Withholding information and lying fosters mistrust and escalates conflicts. Her poor boundaries also lead to lying more. \n\nExamples:\nNot introducing Atlas to Ryle, or st least mentioning him after, lying about her tattoo, and keeping Atlas's number in paper form in the phone all demonstrate a lack of boundaries, honesty, respect, lying by omisi\u00f3n. This plants seeds for distrust and brings out the worst in some types of people. \n\n2. Not giving space when someone storms out creates broken boundaries.\n\nMore on the culture of the chase and no not meaning no. If when you storm out you expect to be followed you do the same. But some people storm out they need to go calm the F down. Give them space to process and potentially be a better person. Had this character if Ryle not been lied to or followed when he explicitly asks for no help or clearly didn\u2019t want to be followed he wouldn\u2019t have accidentally hurt her. \n\n\n\nI shine light to this not to \u201cvictim blame\u201d or \u201cvictim shame\u201d but to EMPOWER. Recognizing these flaws can help women develop self-awareness, establish healthy boundaries, and promote respectful relationships. It\u2019s hard because the media, even a movie that is trying to help women say no and leave abusers is still glorifying the \u201ccoy\u201d indirect, playing with \u201cno\u201d behaviors that are inadvertently drawing out drama. By being self aware we can be honest and direct, and we can set and respect better boundaries reducing the likelihood of violence and cultivate positive interactions.",

I then went to watch it on my browser and it worked perfectly fine. \n\nThe issue only seemed to come up with programs with spatial audio. I am using a DAC with optical input and this issue has not come up before. My other ports seem to also just be working fine. So I'm not sure if the issue was just with the app itself or something else",
