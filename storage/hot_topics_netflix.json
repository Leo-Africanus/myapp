Which is great when watching regular shows and movies, but sucks when watching a live event.\n\nI understand that this may be baked into the core architecture of Netflix, but they need to at least add a button to jump to the live action.  Currently the only way to do this is to fast forward until you reach the live spot.  \n\nHopefully someone from Netflix sees this and makes it happen.",
