Seems like he really didn't value women at all.\n\nThe woman was even worse. She couldn't even hide her delusional love for Diddy. You can tell she was jumping with joy every time how she explained how Diddy would make eye contact with the jurors. She's so delusional I wouldn't doubt if she thought he was making eye contact with only her.\n\nThose two were absolutely vile in their reasoning for only counting him with two charges.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the grammar error in the title. It was suppose to say \\*The documentary",

I checked and confirmed that this title is not available in your location.\"\n\n\"Currently we do not have issue but can you send us a report regarding this title\"\n\n\"As I checked the title lists based in the US, this title is not seen meaning it's not available.\"\n\nI live in Texas, so im wondering if there's local laws that banned the movie or something like that. There are articles online from like 5 days ago saying it was coming back on the 1st of December, so i know im not crazy!\nAlso, what I was able to watch was censored in weird spots, and I know for a fact it wasn't like this a couple years ago. Does anyone else find this fishy??\n\nEDIT: The movie is back on Netflix, uncensored. False alarm everybody lmao",
