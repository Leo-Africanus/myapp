        "title": "Netflix urged to prepare for 'long and messy' Baby Reindeer legal battle\nThe woman who claims to be the real life Martha from the hit Netflix show Baby Reindeer is suing the streaming giant for $170 million, with a pretrial conference taking place",
        "content": "Article - A woman claiming to be the real life Martha from Baby Reindeer [is suing Netflix for $170 million](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-real-life-martha-524997) and one legal advisor has warned [the streaming giant](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/netflix) to expect a \"long\" court battle.\n\nFiona Harvey [filed a lawsuit against Netflix last year for defamation](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/golden-globes-netflix-baby-reindeer-882144), intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and violation of her right of publicity, according to court documents obtained by The Mirror US. She alleged Netflix \"created an easily accessible road map to allow viewers to track her down in real life and connect the dots to her identity.\" In the show, the character Martha is played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nHarvey claimed she was \"tormented\" after [the show, in which she isn't named](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-richard-gadd-issues-462748), was released. She said she suffers from \"anxiety, nightmares, panic attacks, shame, depression, nervousness, stomach pains, loss of appetite and fear, extreme stress and sickness,\" according to the court documents. She's seeking $170 million in damages.\n\nA pretrial conference will be taking place in regards to the case today. Legal advisor James Pipe has spoken to The Mirror US and shared what he thinks Netflix could expect as the case begins.\n\nPipe told us, \"This lawsuit between Fiona Harvey and Netflix is already making headlines, and honestly, it's got all the ingredients of a long, messy legal battle. Harvey is suing for $170 million, claiming Baby Reindeer is basically a version of her life, and that Netflix defamed her, violated her privacy, and acted negligently by letting it air. But is she likely to win? That's not so easy to say.\"\n\nHe continued, \"First, she\u2019ll need to prove that viewers could clearly tell she was the inspiration behind the character, and that what was shown was both false and harmful to her reputation. That's a tall order.\"\n\nThe expert explained, \"Netflix hasn't named her, and the show is billed as a dramatized 'true story', meaning some parts are based on real life, but others are fictionalized.\" When suggesting how Netflix will respond, Pipe said they will \"likely lean hard on freedom of speech.\"\n\nHe added, \"They'll argue that the show is protected artistic expression, that names and details were changed, and that no reasonable viewer would assume the character was a 100% accurate portrayal of a real person, especially someone never named.\"\n\nPipe also suggested Harvey might find it difficult to win the negligence parts of her case. \"They'll argue they didn\u2019t act recklessly and took steps to fictionalize the story,\" he said.\n\nThe trial could be a long one, according to Pipe. \"With a claim this size and the level of media attention, we're probably looking at least a year or two before there's any final decision, unless they settle early, which can happen if both sides want to avoid a drawn-out court fight,\" he suggested.\n\nThe expert concluded, \"Bottom line: Harvey has a shot, but Netflix has deep pockets and strong legal arguments. It\u2019s going to come down to whether the court sees this show as storytelling, or something more damaging.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer tells the dramatized story of comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked, with the character Martha ending up with a nine-month jail sentence for her harassment against him. In a statement shared with The Mirror US, Harvey previously said, \"Earlier in 2024, Netflix released a program called 'Baby Reindeer', which they billed and marketed as a 'true story'. One of the two main characters, 'Martha', was clearly intended to be based on me.\"\n\nJames Pipe is a legal advisor who spoke with The Mirror US on behalf of [Free Grants For Felons](https://www.freegrantsforfelons.org).",

I actually even enjoy good horror movies and I had to fast forward a ton because it ended up just being big stretches of watching the full on surgery and long shots of the injuries and wounds.\n\nWatch it if you really get off on fucked up injuries, I know some do, but skip it if you enjoy the stories and getting a vibe for what\u2019s happening in a hospital the 99.99% of the time you aren\u2019t there.

        "content": "I was DOOM-scrolling on TikTok and Netflix looking for some good movies to watch but I couldn't find anything to match my mood.\n\nSo I built a quick tool that asks for your mood and gives you 3 movie recommendations that match what you're feeling thriller, depressed , heartbreak, action, whatever.\n\nYou can even choose moods like:\n\n\u201cscary and funny\"\n\n\u201cAdventurous\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to cry but in a good way\u201d\n\nEach movie recommendation also includes a quick description so you can scan fast and decide.\n\nI'm also thinking of letting users leave their own reviews and rate each movie out of 5 stars so it feels more like a community-driven list, not just an algorithm.\n\nYou can try it here \u2192\u00a0[https://cypress-hide-0280.typedream.app](https://cypress-hide-0280.typedream.app/) \\---\n\nRight now I\u2019m testing it and would genuinely love feedback:\n\nAre the recommendations good? I made sure it doesn't give just mainstream movies.\n\nDo the picks feel right for the mood you typed in? Or kinda off?\n\nDoes it feel like something you would actually use to look for a movie? if not why?\n\nPLSS tear it apart. I\u2019m here to improve it.",
