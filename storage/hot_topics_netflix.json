Go to the official Netflix Help Center website.\n2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page.\n3. Look for the section that says \"Contact Us\" or \"Need more help?\"\n4. You should see an option to \"Start Live Chat.\" Click on this link.\n5. The website will guide you through a few quick steps (like signing in if you haven't already and selecting your issue) before connecting you to an agent in a pop-up window.\nThe chat option is generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIf enough ppl share feedback, they may be compelled to bring these features back.

Is there not a judge present or a team of judges that gets to decide the final verdict?\n\nI find the two jurors in the episode don\u2019t seem that smart and like they could easily be coerced/ that their subjective values played a huge role in their decision. I always thought that the foundation of a solid legal system is that we have highly intelligent professionals who have been trained and educated for years, who chose to dedicate their lives to upholding the law, and have gone through a rigorous process to become a judge, making important decisions over people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m quite shocked by the idea of just choosing random people from the general population, to make decisions like this..\n\nBut maybe someone can explain more about the legal side of how the jury system works and why it is in place in the US.",

        "content": "This was easily one of my favorite movies this year.  Surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The acting was top-notch across the board, Clooney was brilliant, only I found Dern's constant complaining tiresome.  The sub plot between her and Sandler was unexpected, but definitely helped to really hammer home the theme of the movie.\n\nIn scrolling through some comments, I was wondering if we had watched the same movie. I think for some, if it is not an action-packed thriller, or maybe if you're younger, they can't stick with it. Curious to see if others see what I saw-  to me, this was a universal theme of looking back on life and assessing profound regret of choices made or the hand you are dealt.\n\nI think it was even more.  I took it that it is just fundamentally the human condition to not be happy.  Crudup, who is excellent, is the opposite side of the same coin as Clooney.  He has everything Clooney does not, yet Crudup is obviously filled with anger and regret.  Sandler &amp; Dern clearly regret their choices, despite saying otherwise.\n\nSaw some reviews talking about how this was too inside baseball of the movie industry.  To me, it's a universal theme that is so often the case in many people's lives. Anyone who travels for work, or is always at their home, but is absent either by constantly being at the office, whether mentally or physically.  Not showing up for family or friends in the sense of being truly present. You don't have to be a movie star millionaire to see money does not solve everything.  In fact, this movie proves it is just the opposite. You can have what everyone presumes is having won the lottery, but be profoundly lonely.\n\nIt is, at the end of the day, a sad movie.  Life is a game of choices, and it seems that everyone in this movie regrets theirs. So many people cannot reverse course.\n\nI said it's the movie version of the song Cat's in the Cradle.  I do think, though, it asks the question, if you did change course in life, would you really be happy?",

Easily among my favorite movies of the year and both George as Jay Kelly and Adam Sandler as his manager Ron were absolutely brilliant in it.  Clooney was tailor made for Kelly and I don\u2019t think anyone else could have played him as brilliantly as he did.  The movie itself is such a fun rollercoaster ride of emotions and depth that nearly brought me to tears towards the ending.  I think partially cause of how many of my own memories are tied to movies throughout the years and how film and/or movies were a big part of mine and my Dad\u2019s (R.I.P. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc) relationship over the years prior to his unfortunate passing a little over 5 1/2 years ago.

        "content": "After about 20 years of re-watching every Christmas, I have come to the conclusion that my favorite storyline is the couple who meets while they're working as stand-ins for a sex scene in a movie.
