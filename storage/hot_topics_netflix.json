This happened almost a 100 years ago, and it is also going on today. The same bullsh\\*t and this was almost 100 years ago!! It makes me wish we would all evolve as humans and live peacefully together. If you hate someone, who is not bothering you or does nothing to affect your life in any way, you have a problem. I really enjoyed this film. Old archives from the Nazi days and a different subject than most Nazi movies. It is wild. I knew Nazis didn't like gay or trans people, but I didn't know to what extent they didn't like them. Now, trans are the enemy, again. Without getting too political, it really looks like we are repeating everything that happened in 1933.\n\nEdited to add: A chilling quote from Hitler, in this documentary. \"Homosexuality has to be combated at all costs, otherwise it will be the end of Germany, the end of the Germanic world.\"\n\nCan't we all learn from history?\n\nIf you want a thought-provoking film, I recommend this one!\n\n",

The adoptive mom is definitely one and it seems like she made J Lo keep her promise as she is very nonchalant and uninviting in that scene. Plus, in the reunion scene before when she and J Lo meet eyes and she is not even looking at her in spite of looking straight into her face. J Lo, on the other hand, nods while she proceeds to ignore her and hold their daughter tighter, especially when J Lo is pulling off, not giving a chance for the daughter to turn around and watch her leave.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would J Lo only observe her daughter and would they communicate only from a distance like in that scene?",

        "content": "The show has so many great characters and truly left me feeling appreciative for the exposure it gave me to Palestinian culture, but the character Mo himself became unwatchable in S2.\n\nMo only gets the wins he doesn\u2019t deserve. It\u2019s hard enough to sympathize with a character who suffers from problems they caused themselves, but it\u2019s even harder when the character does basically nothing to redeem themselves before picking up a life changing win. The whole subplot of his relationship with Maria revolved around him being a terrible partner - always lying, always selfish, and only supportive until his own pride ruins whatever Maria had going on. And in the end, all it took was for him rage quit, blame her for all his misfortune, then walk back into a store and tell her \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d for all of his problems to be solved? Gimme a break.\n\nOn the flip side, every time he displays an ounce of character development and is on the cusp of getting a win he actually does deserve, he ruins it for himself by saying/doing something so unreasonable that it\u2019s borderline insulting to the viewer. It made it impossible to root for the guy by the end of S2. \n\nFor the record, this isn\u2019t something that bothers me in other shows where I the main protagonist is supposed to be dumb, pathetic, or simply a bad person. In the end, I just don\u2019t think Mo himself was funny enough for me to excuse all of his character flaws. It was basically just Eastbound &amp; Down (one of my favorite shows btw) but without the main character being funny enough for me to be happy when he \u201credeems\u201d himself. ",
