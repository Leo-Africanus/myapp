Since as long as I can remember, you've been able to select whichever resolution you want for whatever video you're watching.\n\nI am so sick and tired of the fact that you cannot just select the resolution of the video you want on Netflix. The only options I can find on video quality are universal for your entire profile and include \"Low, Medium, High\" which is completely ambiguous and meaningless to any user with half their brain.\n\nWhy can't I just select the resolution that I want? If it's laggy or my hardware can't handle a specific resolution, then I can turn it down to something else. This is absolutely basic functionality that should exist for such a large company and it's obviously done intentionally. I also can't believe that more people don't complain about this. This should be changed. Why aren't a larger number of Netflix users complaining about this?",

Sometimes i set something aside to watch later. Maybe a month goes by. Since live is busy. And... its gone. It really is now or never sometimes now with netflix. This isnt how it used to be. I have netflix since... 8 years ago? 9? And it was complete freedom of watching whatever you wanted whenever. Now it feels very limited. And having the part 2 movies and not part 1 being available. Is very frustrating. \n\nI get it. Licences and all that. But to be honest. As a consumer. I dont care about that. I care about having the freedom to watch whatever i want. Whenever i want.

After s2 I really wanted to know what happened after especially my favorite characters Bert and Ken. But we have to move on.

I was watching Netflix and a pop up says you have the 1080 subscription do you want to PAY MORE and get the 4K subscription? Ummm\u2026no\u2026I do not want to pay more\u2026no thanks. Then, after that, any time I played something, the picture would flash and as it played an 8 inch bar across the tv had no picture and would flash. I set out to return it but was suggested to restore to factory settings. TV is back to normal. Has anyone had anything similar happen?",
