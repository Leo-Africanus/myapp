Hwang is producing the series, which has been described as a 'high-stakes casino crime drama,' but there is at least one element in the description that sets this new series apart from Hwang\u2019s most well-known work.\n\nIn The Dealer, Geonhwa is a casino dealer who has to return to the shadowy world of illegal gambling after she falls victim to a scam and has to put her wedding plans on hold. However, to give her an edge at the tables, she 'is compelled to tap long-suppressed supernatural abilities,' which sounds like such a fun spin on the Squid Game formula of high-stakes tension and uneasy alliances with huge sums of money on the line.\" -full article [here](https://www.thepopverse.com/tv-squid-game-netflix-creator-next-project-the-dealer-supernatural-twist)",

        "content": "Talk about a waste of time. I never thought watching this show would be EXHAUSTING! If they don\u2019t get a new writer\u2019s room and switch up the cast, I hope this is the end of this show\u2026my favorite YT reactor often uses the phrase \u201cthey reheating their nachos,\u201d and that about sums the entire season up. I could tell from the trailer there were certain things I wasn\u2019t going to like, but I tend to think of EIP as a fun, lighthearted show that I don\u2019t have to overly invest myself in. Now, it\u2019s like I\u2019m begging to be removed from the group chat.\n\n\nThings I strongly disliked(which I totally blame the writers for)\n1. Makes me feel like a prude, but I\u2019m tired of seeing Sylvie in sheer clothing and sleeping with younger men. Mind you, I love the actress! Don\u2019t know her age, but she\u2019s lithe &amp; trim, and I love how she/her character seems to embrace her divine femininity. But it just feels like enough is enough, idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n2. Love Lucien Laviscount, though I haven\u2019t seen him in many things. Last season I felt like he was ill used. This season he gave me the absolute ick(for which I blame the writers.) Alfie as a character was kind of, idk hesitant about relationships, a little aloof, but serious about love. He deserved to be able to love someone fully and have that returned. In what world, would him &amp; Mindy even begin to make sense? They could have at least made the attraction/obsession plausible.\n\n3. I didn\u2019t like whatever was going on with Gabriel\u2019s hair. Looked like a toupee or something\n\n4. For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE let Emily be single. That girl hands out \u201cI love you\u201d like it\u2019s a business card. Did she actually love any of her boyfriends to date? Does she even want to be in love? Contrary to the words spilling out of her mouth to poor Marcelo, she was not serious about him and she did not think he was the one \ud83d\ude44 atp Mr Muratori dodged a bullet with her\n\n5. Why did they randomly throw Bryan Greenberg  in there? I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s dating somebody from the cast, and just so happened to be on set that day when they needed someone. Nothing else makes sense. LOVE Jake Jagielski btw\n\n6. Then we get to Mindy, who suddenly has serious feelings for Alfie \ud83d\ude44 PLEASE! Wasn\u2019t she just having lingering feelings for Benoit while in a relationship with Nico? Which is understandable since everyone on this show hops from one bed to the next without talking a second to I \ud83e\uddfc their hoo ha. Now she\u2019s sleeping with her friends ex behind her back, in her bed, and somehow it was on Emily to get over it \ud83e\udee9 then, after she discards Alfie like dirty underwear (which at the time he didn\u2019t deserve) she gets back with Nico, but allows Alfie to keep coming around being disrespectful to her relationship. Is this who her character always was &amp; I missed it?\n\n7. I also don\u2019t like that that stepdaughter didn\u2019t get a comeuppance for her snakelike behavior \n\n8. Lastly, Sylvia\u2019s marriage. Was she working on it or not? Was she going to take it serious or not? Because her words and her actions never quite met up.\n\n9. I also think the DIVINE Minnie Driver was ill used, and most of her outfits looked a hot mess\n\n10. To me, the whole Rome excursion was pointless. They just wanted to give us new scenery\n\n\n\nThings I enjoyed!!!\n1. Marcelo Muratori\n\n2. Emily\u2019s improved fashion, or maybe it was the show\u2019s budget that improved. Well no, because Cami, Mindy, and Sylvie always had a good wardrobe. \n\n3. The bob \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Lily Collin\u2019s looked like she had a short cut for a couple seasons now, but they were making her wear a hairpiece. LOVED the new look\n\n4. Julien &amp; Luc did not disappoint, though Julien had less sassy moments this season \u2639\ufe0f\n\n5. I liked all of Gabriel\u2019s scenes, though they were few and far between. He was also looking pretty beefy \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd70 I may have seen him in a movie trailer or something, which would explain the choice of hair.\n\n6. I liked how Emily &amp; Sylvie\u2019s relationship has grown. I especially loved Sylvie giving Emily her blessing &amp; encouragement to move on. That was beautiful\n\n7. It might be petty of me, but I feel like Sylvie\u2019s financial troubles is deserved for participating in that farce of a marriage. What a mess. She should\u2019ve divorced that man long ago. Sucks for her mother though. \n\n8. Mindy never fails to give good performance! She\u2019s a \ud83d\udcab \n\nOverall, I just don\u2019t feel the show had enough to it to make people want to keep watching. I also think if they can\u2019t bring anything new to the storyline, and keep recycling relationships/behaviors, they should just let the show go.\n",

        "title": "Looking for recs on short (half hour max) shows.",
        "content": "I'm looking for a short, tea time show - ideally 20-30 minute episodes. I'm UK-based and have Netflix but also iPlayer and Sky so I don't mind recs from those, but I don't have access to other services. Can be drama, comedy or animation.\n\nLoved (and recently finished) The Good Place. Currently finishing What We Do in the Shadows (iPlayer). Previously enjoyed Barry (Sky Comedy).\n\nAnimated shows I've seen: Cyberpunk Edgerunners (enjoyed - watched because I loved the game), Neon Genesis Evangelion (weird), Delicious in Dungeon (loved), the Terminator anime (forget the exact name - it wasn't bad), Cowboy Bebop (loved), Vinland Saga (liked the Viking stuff but the monologues and all the crying drove me up the bloody wall), Monster (didn't finish - liked the concept but lord it was slow), DanDanDan (puerile - quit after one episode), Scavenger's Reign (liked).\n\nFor the record, I am a nerd and a gamer, like sci-fi, fantasy, thrillers and basically anything imaginative. I am also a 58yo woman so I'm probably not going to enjoy anything aimed at kids and young adults.\n\nCheers.",
