It had me laughing, crying, and just feeling all the feels.\n\nSerious credit to the actors, producers, and screenwriters for real.

Garfield was a Civil War hero and a abolitionist, and he didn't initially want his parties nomination, and is considered one of the last 'log cabin' Presidents, because he like Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Guiteau had hidden the gun in his pocket and the police only found it after taking him to the police station, and the first metal detector was used on Garfield. Guiteau's brain was actually studied, and its thought that his actions may have been due to syphilis, though of course in the 1880s medical tests like that were very unreliable. And Chester Arthur passed a lot of Garfield's corruption reforms. The score was great, made by the same composer that did Game of Thrones and Iron Man. I also thought they nailed Michael Shannon's look, his beard looks very similar to Garfield's pictures. Betty Gilpin's performance was so convincing.",
