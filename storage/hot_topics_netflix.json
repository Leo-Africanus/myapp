Hypothetically, if he survived into the current era, I feel like he could walk around in public without much more than a few quick glances from people trying to get a better look at him without looking like they\u2019re starring. Nowadays, people are a lot more conscious of not appearing rude, especially in public, and are generally a lot more accepting of people who look different. Let\u2019s say Jacob Elordi\u2019s creature went walking down the street in somewhere like Town Square. As long as he was dressed relatively normally and had his hair grown out, most people would probably assume he had gigantism and some scars from a really bad plastic surgeon.\n\n",

It\u2019s pure Guillermo del Toro \u2014 his signature way of storytelling and visual poetry.\n\nHowever, what truly jolted me was the conversation between Victor the human and Victor the creature. It felt like a juxtaposition of God speaking with man. The arguments, the rejection, and the final acceptance without humiliation reflect the entire lifespan of the relationship between God and humankind.\n\nIt all ends, fittingly, with Nietzsche\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cGod is dead.\u201d\n",
