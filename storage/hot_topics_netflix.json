        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Netflix customer since the early days. I travel frequently for work and usually bring a Roku stick to use in hotels.\n\nThis week I couldn\u2019t log in, so I contacted Netflix support. I was told that my subscription is intended for use at my home location and that I can\u2019t use it while traveling.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that I\u2019m on a plan with a 4-device limit and I stay within it. I\u2019m not sharing my account with anyone outside my household \u2014 I\u2019m just logging in from a different location while traveling.\n\nIt feels like Netflix has shifted from enforcing device limits to enforcing location, which is a big change in how the service works, especially for people who travel often. Streaming on a phone or laptop seems to work, but devices like Roku or Apple TV are where the problems show up.\n\nThe policy itself was disappointing, but what really pushed me to cancel was how little concern there was about losing a long-time customer. The response was essentially \u201cthat\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nIf you travel often and rely on streaming devices, this is something to be aware of.",

The whole point of his character is that his self important douchebag persona isn't the real him, and that he's actually a decent guy who had his heart broken and used the former as a sort of coping mechanism.  \n\nWallace also went from snarky dick who cares to just a dick.  Neil went from naive and a bit silly to just being a full on moron.\n\nRamona also patches things up with her exes without really growing in any way on her part or realizing how badly she hurt people and how she's largely responsible for a lot of their douchebaggery to begin with.\n\nI feel like the show had to move so quickly, it didnt have a chance to actually have any proper characterization.",
