In fact, I turned off both App &amp; System updates and this keeps happening still. I wonder if this has happened (is happening) to anyone else?\n\nI understand that they\u2019re cracking down on shared accounts, accounts being used outside of the primary residence (which has proved quite flawed recently), but this is a new low for me.

When I switched back to Norwegian with subtitles, the actors' mouths and teeth looked VERY different.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be an option to turn this \"feature\" off... Netflix, if you're listening, please add the option to remove this cuz it's just extremely off-putting... we already lose a ton of emotion and context with dubs, but at least the physicality of an actor's face would make up for it somewhat.
