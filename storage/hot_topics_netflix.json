It\u2019s not ozark but it\u2019s only 1 season compared to like 5. I would give it a 7-8 out of 10. Topher grace\u2019s character was pretty fun as well, he\u2019s a good actor.

I cried in the end, because that show is limited series and the ending further emulsified the rollercoaster of emotions into the shed of tears. I know it\u2019s been like what 5 months, shows like this are often forgotten, my point is that maybe if you had seen some emotional movies or tv shows, they tend to make you feel nostalgic and bizarre like whoa time\u2019s really flown so fast.

        "content": "I recently found this Netflix Show *Boca a boca* (or *Kissing Game* in english) and ... that show is very trippy at times - literally. But the tone is also curious because it's serious, scary, tragic and dire but then sometimes it flips and almost seems like a parody of some sort (although I have no clue what it could be trying to poke fun at). The strict school director prefers to give her intimidating monologues to nervous students while sitting on a bouncy ball? There are regularly parties happening where everyone dresses up as if the theme was \"80s disco ball room with 90s grunge and a dash of hellraiser\"? And they all kind of become temporarily bisexual for as long as the party lasts?\n\nThen there is also the \"\"cows\"\" and the romance(?) with the cowboy(?) \n\nOh, in case you have zero clue what this show (supposedly) is about: there is a village shut off from the outside world (but also not at all) and they believe in a cult that's stalking the nearby woods (yet everyone knows they exist but they're not a cult or if they are virtually nobody cares anyway \\[cuz' drugs, I guess?\\]). Suddenly a disease starts wreaking havoc on the village folks. People start getting paranoid and violent. Shady business is being conducted, lies are being spewed, deception takes place. Also, \"\"cows\"\".\n\nWhile watching all of this unfold and refold and then unfold again in front of my eyes I began wondering if this could have been another *Stranger Things*. It has peculiar tone and sense of danger with some very strong visuals (especially later on in the show). Now I'm just curious to know if there is anyone else who has watched it - if you haven't, perhaps this is exactly what you're looking for. It sure is unique, in a way.\n\nSeriously, what in the trip is this show?",
