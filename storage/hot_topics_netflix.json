I do have Netflix Premium so I don't know why this could be a problem since it's noted that premium has more features compared to the other plans and it just says I can download on up to 6 supported devices at a time but never specified how much I could download.\n\nI am a person that notices every aspect of quality change and like my downloaded content to be at least 1080p.\n\nSorry i had to use this account, I didn't have enough karma on my \"main\".",

I\u2019m not including romance anime\u2019s because most of them low-key all follow the same format but maybe just different names / looks. Does anyone agree about my take?

Just felt like there was something I wasn\u2019t picking up on.\n\nAlso, Devon. Man. It felt like she was kinda in love with being miserable?

Not even the gorgeous soundtrack the series boasts and brilliant editing could save the two from being borderline unwatchable.\n\nI hope the Way brothers direct more episodes in the future because they are some of the most talented and exciting filmmakers at the moment.  \n\nJust a personal opinion of course",

        "title": "Netflix New Interface is Sooooo Horrible",
        "content": "I was looking online to see if anybody else had complained about this yet and it didn't come up in my search. What I found was from 6 months ago people complaining about what appears to be the issue now, so maybe they were in beta. But I see that Netflix did a new interface that they think is so lovely for all of us. I think it's horrendous and people 6 months ago were complaining about how large these tiles are and so hard to look at things. I hate that I have to see this huge icon in my list and I can't see very many tiles so I lose track of where I'm at. Why doesn't Netflix listen to users complaining about it 6 months ago? \n\nI was able to turn it off but I'm wondering if it will be only temporary b/c Netflix thinks it's so grand. Anybody else feel this way?",

This must be offensive to not only me as a Brit but also to all of the French who died in this war 700 years ago. \n\nTimothee de Chalamat more like Timothee Me Chardonnay because that's what I needed after looking up their names on IMDB ",

        "title": "AB Wynter was a Sh** Boss: The Residence",
        "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\nThe end of the series really acts like Wynter is beyond reproach just for caring about the traditions of the White House -- and tries to blame his employees for having conflict with him. Na-ah dude he's a poor manager and management is more than half of his job.\n\nDespite his strong loyalties to the house and professionalism. AB Winter is a sh** boss. He's great to have as an employee, totally collected yes-man, but as far as working under him-- \nhe doesn't acknowledge hard work, he calls in overqualified people for non-emergency situations and, despite references to the contrary, he appears to be quite prone to conflict at all times in private AND public.\n\nMost importantly he doesn't stick up for his staff at all. He says something about \"it's not our job to push back\" to Jasmine-- that is not the point-- last minute changes disrespect your staff and ruin the ability for things to run smoothly. \nIf the weird anti-tradition squad wants to make changes let them do it within a reasonable time frame. \n\nSomeone else's lack of organization is NOT your fake emergency. These poor people putting in all this work just to have their boss let it be thrown away without his acknowledgement or apology it's nuts. Feel so bad for them..and yes I worked in service for 8 years so that might be influencing me here \ud83d\ude02. \n\n",
