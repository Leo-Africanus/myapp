Under that email, is three profiles, mine, my brother-in-law\u2018s, and my nieces.\n\nThe secondary account, which is under my email, is the additional account so it is limited to only \u201cone profile\u201d. And the profile attached to that account is my sisters.\n\nSo basically the issue is I need to swap the profile assigned under my sister\u2019s email address (the main account) with my profile on the secondary account.\n\nI called up Netflix and they said there was no way to do this, but I just don\u2019t buy that as an answer. If anyone has any advice or input at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

Like when you click on the show to watch a ep and the dimness from when the play skip buttons appear. Usually the dimmess goes away when you click off so no buttons show but this isn't working. I've tried opening and closing the app, restarting it. I've also checked if this is on ther shows but it seems to jsut be on this one. I'm not sure what to do. The brightness on my phone, iPad and Netflix is all the way up. Also when I click on previous episodes when it wasn't dark they turn dark. Help???",

        "content": "I believe these are the views for the first time they appear in the Netflix Top 10 site.\n\nI recommend giving them a try. I've watched most of them, except Baki Hanma, Dragon Ball Daima, Demon Slayer Season 4. All of them are available in English dub too.\n\n**Sakamoto Days** (Currently simulcasting/weekly release) - 8/10  \nComedy action anime about a hitman who left his job after falling in love at first sight with a convenience store lady. As a result, he left his job and became a father who helped people, prohibited from killing. He's now living his peaceful quiet life... or is he?  \nHe is also being hunted or searched by his former rivals and partners, so he has to stop his enemies without killing them.\n\n**DAN DA DAN** (there's an attempted rape at ep. 1 by the aliens, afterwards it's safe) - 8.5/10  \nHe was an alien fanboy, she was a ghost fangirl. They're in dispute over which one is real since they believe the other one doesn't exist, so the female MC (main character) decided to look for alien; male MC looked for ghost. Turns out both are real. Male MC lost his balls (literally) to Turbo Granny in a tunnel. Long story short they both gain supernatural powers, guess you can say they are a match.\n\n**Record of Ragnarok** - 7/10  \nAnimation needs improvements imho, but it's still enjoyable. The gods want to wipe out humanity due to their sins and selfishness, but one of the Valkyries (Brunhilde) said hold up, let them cook, and proposed an idea to make humans literally fight against the gods in an arena instead. If humans have more wins than gods, humankind will be spared. Some of the fights include Adam vs Zeus, L\u00fc Bu vs Thor, Jack the Ripper vs Heracles, Raiden vs Shiva.\n\n**My Happy Marriage** - 7.5/10  \nThe female MC lives in an abusive household ever since her mother died and her father remarried an evil woman and her daughter. She got forced to be a servant/mais. Her father suddenly brought a news that she is to marry a guy from a noble and distinguished family. Her fiancee is known to be callous and dismissed all his previous fiancees. That's what she expected, but turns out he treated her nicely.\n\n**Ranma 1/2** (2024 remake) - 8/10  \nI'm sure you've heard of this slapstick romance comedy before; if not, it's about a dude (Ranma) who is a gender bender after falling into a hot lake in China; likewise his father who can turn into a Panda. Ranma got engaged with a tomboy girl by his father who is a friend to the fiancee's father.",

        "content": "TLDR: idk if Netflix is breaking or if show just has weird transitions theyre trying out this season\n\nI'm currently watching House MD on Netflix, and during transitional scenes, the very last fee seconds kind of pause and then speed up (kinda like the cinematics of how the running works in Twilight, slowish background, fast characters) and it's not like the kind of transition where that kind of cinematic is needed (I know nothing about film so I may be using the wrong verbiage here)\n\nTrying to Google but I just get stuff for Netflix video error (don't notice it with Youtube, hdmi seems fine) and for House but not weird / oddly placed transitionals like that\n\nIt's not every transition, most times just ending ones, screen doesn't go black like a scene transition, but more like, if they go to a seperate room, its sped up? Idk if any of this makes sense, thanks in advance to anyone who does know (or understands)",

        "content": "Just finished watching S2 and damn it was fun. I didn't rewatch Season 1, but this one had me hooked from the first episode. I was on edge and invested in the characters.\n\nBut let's get real - Rose's character just didn't do it for me. I couldn't connect with her, and her storyline felt like a convenient plot device. On the other hand, Alice was a breath of fresh air. I loved her charm and personality, and I was gutted that we didn't get to see more of her. I think the screen time should have been the opposite. Alice in the lead and Rose on the side. Which makes more sense since Alice is an Agent where Rose is just a civilian \n\nCatherine, though personally I enjoyed her character. So classy and poised  There has to be someone who keeps Peter in check and I like Catherine for . And Noor? I liked her strength and perseverance. I loved how the show gave us these glimpses into the characters' pasts, making them feel so much more real and adding depth to the characters. I'm a big fan of characterization and they did it good .\n\nHere's the thing, though: I just don't buy Peter and Rose romance. They have no chemistry at all. I'm really looking forward to some other female lead. And Rose's character, in general, felt like an afterthought. It was like she was only there to advance the plot. So I don't get why people want to see more of her in s3 especially as a romantic interest.\n\nDespite that, I'm still booked with this show. The side characters were definately the show stopper",
