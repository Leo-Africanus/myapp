        "title": "Love Con Revenge is honestly the most amateur, misleading, defamatory, insulting to our intelligence \"documentary\" I've ever watched.",
        "content": "I honestly don't know where to start with this. The primary host is presented as some expert \u2014 even speaking about psychology she clearly has no understanding of \u2014 when in reality she's just someone who fell for a scam. The private investigator? She doesn't seem to understand the law at all, calls up people and says *\"I'm investigating this person\"* with zero clue if the recipient of the call is friends with the target (which could expose her), and tails cars by following them in U-turns, parking lots, etc while wondering \"Do you think he spotted us?\"\n\nSeveral guys on the show are clearly unpredictable criminals. Which also makes it nuts that they're taking these women to confront them face to face when they should be calling the police. They tracked a guy who was a fugitive from justice, and instead of calling the cops, they went to yell at him (tipping their hand and potentially giving the target time to flee). Even worse? It's the misleading crap and leaving information out. \n\nThroughout the series, the show presents claims that are in no way verified. It's like they took *every* \"case\" that came their way, and when stuff started to look sus, they kept going and just left out info. For instance, [another Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/s/tymYcHrKzg) looked up the clinic from the Dr. Wilkerson episode and discovered that the victim was *heavily* involved in the practice \u2014 with many of the complaints over the years specifically mentioning her behavior. \n\nAnd while we're on that episode, the \"victim\" dropped her civil suit? And she's facing charges for filing a false police report? And even though there's a claim that the guy opened fake accounts in the daughter's name (a clear crime that would result in arrest), there's been no charges filed? And Netflix didn't feel like showing us evidence of those alleged fraudulent accounts? Even worse, the \"after story\" text at the end of the episode was up for mere seconds. I'm not into conspiracies, but it's almost like they *didn't want us* to read the additional info that cast doubt onto the entire story. \n\nLeading up to the Dr Wilkerson episode, I was already a little irked by the show. Even when it was established that there was no evidence of crimes, the hosts would say things like \"At least he's been exposed.\" Been exposed about what? That an ex partner is saying negative stuff about them? Stuff you completely didn't prove, not even enough to support a civil lawsuit (which isn't a high evidentiary standard)?\n\nBut yeah, the episode with the doctor is going to be it for me. By marrying his \"victim,\" he ensured that any debt would be his responsibility too. Great con artist, right? The episode clearly left out all information that showed the \"victim\" might be lying. And while earlier episodes *clearly* showcased real con artists, the way in which they were handled was dangerous, amateur, and is very likely to result in defamation lawsuits against Netflix. \n\nThis show idea was great, but the execution is absolutely pathetic. Did these two ladies just go out filming stuff on their own and then show up to Netflix like, *\"You should show this\"*? The \"private investigator\" is essentially using Google and hiring others to find info for her, and Cecilie Fjellh\u00f8y's only place in the show should be in a \"this is what happened to me\" role rather than speaking as if she's a subject matter expert (she's clearly not). Even worse, they're pushing unverified claims that will ruin people even if they end up not being true. \n\nAnd by the way, repeatedly badmouthing the police *is not* a smart way to ensure the police keep discussing cases with you in future seasons. This is worse than amateur hour. It's amateurs manufacturing anger for ratings \u2014 because they know a large portion of folks won't care about pesky little things like a lack of facts while treating real scam incidents and jilted ex scenarios as if they're equivalent. \n\nNetflix, do better.

That card was charged for service in July and August. This month we had a notice to update our card because it was being declined. When we checked before updating it we found that the card was not ours. We were never notified that any changes had happened to our account either time. \n\nWe called Netflix who offered that we could again change our email and password as a fix again but offered no insight into how this happened again nor how they can guarantee that it will not happen again or if our own information was secure. \n\nThe first email was mine, the second was my husbands and has never been compromised nor have we ever shared our Netflix account info with anyone or used it anywhere but our home. We have no issues with any other service that we use. \n\nWe are looking to get answers for our privacy concerns as the customer service representative was unable to provide any other info or a pathway to figure out what happened. Twice in 2 months is concerning. \n\nUntil our concerns are addressed we have canceled our account. \n\nCan anyone provide somewhere for us to get some answers or file a formal complaint regarding the lack of security at Netflix? \n\nThank you in advance.

        "content": "Does Netflix send you guys unwanted emails you can't unsubscribe from? I recently started getting ads for fights that I'm not interested in sent to my email. I tried to unsubscribe but there was no button. Also, my settings show that I have all unnecessary emails turned off.  I am very deliberate with the services I sign up for with my email addresses and I will probably have all Netflix emails sent to my spam folder via rules. But I was just wondering if it is a me thing or if others were getting these emails as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5qgcm1npo6pf1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb40b334c8ad3aa25f2a023629ac97c8c956b30\n\n",

        "content": "The third and final season of Alice in Borderland is just right around the corner. Been seeing an influx of people on YouTube reacting to the show. Squid Game, too, had just recently wrapped up and with a controversial finale at that. \n\nAnyway, I had just finished watching a reactor saying that Squid Game was \"way better produced\" and had \"way better casting\" than AiB. *To each their own* of course, but I guess I was a bit taken aback by this comment since I personally felt like AiB actually took the notch of the survival show genre higher. This is not to say that Squid Game was bad or anything. I also liked Squid Game, especially the first season. In fact, I think that Squid Game had more of a social commentary than AiB. It's just that when it comes to the games and overall premise, I'm definitely more biased towards AiB. \n\nBTW not saying that people should like AiB more than SG. I could see why some people would like SG over AiB. It's just my personal bias when I say that Squid Game is not in any way \"waaaay better\" than AiB. They might be equally good, but SG is definitely not far off better than AiB imo.\n\nFor those who have watched both, which one do you like better?",
