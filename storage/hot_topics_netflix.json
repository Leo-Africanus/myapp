How low can a person go. \n\nNot to mention, how stupid were those jurors? They dropped the ball completely. \n\nIts nice to know he likes his \"fans\" so much he needs to shower with peroxide after greeting them. \n\nHe's a vile person.\n\nWhat's your opinion of the doc or the person its about? \n\nOn the upside sting got richy rich from Diddy over that song.

It was painful, sure, but the eventual drop was a single, glorious binge-fest. We adapted. We endured the long waits for the return of hits like the final run of *Stranger Things*.\n\nBut now, the streaming overlords have added a new layer of torture: **Volumes**.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that we waited for what we were promised as \"Season 5\" of *Stranger Things*, only to get Volume 1\u2014a cruel, tantalizing fraction of the story. You get four episodes of vital plot, a massive cliffhanger, and then... nothing. Back to the waiting game for Volume 2, which is essentially just the back half of the same season. The same happened with the highly-anticipated return of *The Family Man*, only for fans to have to wait again between parts.\n\n  \nWe signed up for the convenience of binge-watching, the freedom to control our viewing experience. Now, we are being forced back into an anticipated, staggered release schedule, only without the benefit of the traditional weekly TV model that kept the community discourse alive for months. Instead, we get an initial flash of binge-mania followed by a frustrating, momentum-killing pause.\n\n",
