In fact, I turned off both App &amp; System updates and this keeps happening still. I wonder if this has happened (is happening) to anyone else?\n\nI understand that they\u2019re cracking down on shared accounts, accounts being used outside of the primary residence (which has proved quite flawed recently), but this is a new low for me.

However, I want to understand more about their work culture, especially from people who\u2019ve worked or currently work there.\n\nI\u2019ve read about Netflix\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d and radical candor, which sounds appealing but also potentially intense. I thrive in high-performance environments but would like to avoid a culture similar to Amazon\u2019s (which I\u2019ve heard can be cutthroat and overly demanding).\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked in Netflix\u2019s Experimentation team, could you share:\n\n1.
