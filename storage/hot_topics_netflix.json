        "content": "I just saw His &amp; Hers Tv show and i have a mixed feelings about the show. If we talk about storyline and direction i think it lacks depth, urgency and tbh bit of logic. I get it it\u2019s a small town so they wanted to show solving murder there is not easy but showing them straight up dumb is another thing. It was frustrating to see that even with so much attention and media coverage of high profile murder in town a detective is so easily ruining and manipulating the case with no question asked. I mean the concept and twist was tbh good, it got me and i didn\u2019t see it coming. Last episode first half i was like this is so illogical and they built it all for this and then second half made sense of it all. If they chose better actors, and storyline and plot was played in bit different and more tension filling way it could have been great thriller mystery show but they relied it all on last 20-30 mins which made it frustrating. I am sure many people have different take on it and i would love to hear that. ",

        "content": "Like here's how I would have done it, I would have spent the first few episodes establishing growing political tensions to really sell this idea of the world ending. Maybe there's this race against time plot that's more central where the dad is racing to get his son out of prison in time so they can make it to the bunker. As time goes on, you see something isn't right, the characters get to the surface, and realize the entire thing was a ruse, and we walk back through the events of the story with that info. I haven't reached the final episode yet, but I thought it would be cool if a nuclear war broke out for real, and suddenly all these people playing pretend had to really try to survive. \n\nAs for the twist, I really loved it. I think many of us sensed something was up. I remember asking questions like \"Why is this state of the art doomsday bunker designed to survive a nuclear war being so heavily damaged by a nuke being dropped miles away?\" Felt like a fake bunker. When I saw the leader smile, I knew. \n\nBut the pacing of the show is fucking terrible. Like the first episode is establishing these characters, establishing this tragic event, a prison story, a partial redemption arc for the main character, getting released from prison, getting to the bunker, setting up the tense environment within the bunker between characters, the world ending, and finding out it was all a simulation in literally the first episode. \n\nThen it's just 6 episodes of the same back and forth story telling, and characters fucking. Like the dads ex-wife is a psycho. She's literally like \"You beat my son, that's hot, let's fuck\" and you're just like WTF. Overall, very lackluster given the premise and twist, maybe the finale will save it, but I feel like it's gonna just be cliff hanger BS that's never resolved because the show got canceled. ",
