She was quite adamant that no account exists and that we must be reading number wrong as there is no way that they couldn\u2019t locate the account with her debit card account number. We\u2019ve been through this process multiple times and the lady ended up telling us that there\u2019s nothing she can do for us. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to go from here as the account definitely exists, I can still watch Netflix on my TV and a monthly payment is still being taken. Is there any way we can get money back, someone higher up than the call centre to email? Or do we just have to suck it up, close the account and create a new one? \n\nWe are in England for context and I\u2019m not angry at the customer service lady, I know they\u2019re trained to read off scripts and can only do what they can do.

        "content": "As streaming libraries merge and ad-tiers become the norm, data tracking is ramping up. One specific method often flies under the radar: Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking.\n\nThe Gist: Advertisers hide high-frequency sounds in TV content that human ears can't hear. But your phone's microphone can. If a random app on your phone (like a free game or utility) has background mic access, it hears that signal and instantly links your TV viewing habits to your mobile profile.\n\nWhy it matters now: With the WB/Netflix changes, linking your TV to your Personal Device is the holy grail for their ad inventory.\n\nThe Fix: Audit your phone's Microphone Permissions. If an app doesn't need to listen to function (like a flashlight or puzzle game), revoke access. That is usually how the bridge is built.\n\nFor those wondering no, a VPN will not stop this. Since the tracking happens physically (sound waves hitting your microphone), no amount of encryption can block it.",

You should see an option to \"Start Live Chat.\" Click on this link.\n5. The website will guide you through a few quick steps (like signing in if you haven't already and selecting your issue) before connecting you to an agent in a pop-up window.\nThe chat option is generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIf enough ppl share feedback, they may be compelled to bring these features back.

Is there not a judge present or a team of judges that gets to decide the final verdict?\n\nI find the two jurors in the episode don\u2019t seem that smart and like they could easily be coerced/ that their subjective values played a huge role in their decision. I always thought that the foundation of a solid legal system is that we have highly intelligent professionals who have been trained and educated for years, who chose to dedicate their lives to upholding the law, and have gone through a rigorous process to become a judge, making important decisions over people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m quite shocked by the idea of just choosing random people from the general population, to make decisions like this..\n\nBut maybe someone can explain more about the legal side of how the jury system works and why it is in place in the US.",

        "content": "This was easily one of my favorite movies this year.  Surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The acting was top-notch across the board, Clooney was brilliant, only I found Dern's constant complaining tiresome.  The sub plot between her and Sandler was unexpected, but definitely helped to really hammer home the theme of the movie.\n\nIn scrolling through some comments, I was wondering if we had watched the same movie. I think for some, if it is not an action-packed thriller, or maybe if you're younger, they can't stick with it. Curious to see if others see what I saw-  to me, this was a universal theme of looking back on life and assessing profound regret of choices made or the hand you are dealt.\n\nI think it was even more.  I took it that it is just fundamentally the human condition to not be happy.  Crudup, who is excellent, is the opposite side of the same coin as Clooney.  He has everything Clooney does not, yet Crudup is obviously filled with anger and regret.  Sandler &amp; Dern clearly regret their choices, despite saying otherwise.\n\nSaw some reviews talking about how this was too inside baseball of the movie industry.  To me, it's a universal theme that is so often the case in many people's lives. Anyone who travels for work, or is always at their home, but is absent either by constantly being at the office, whether mentally or physically.  Not showing up for family or friends in the sense of being truly present. You don't have to be a movie star millionaire to see money does not solve everything.  In fact, this movie proves it is just the opposite. You can have what everyone presumes is having won the lottery, but be profoundly lonely.\n\nIt is, at the end of the day, a sad movie.  Life is a game of choices, and it seems that everyone in this movie regrets theirs. So many people cannot reverse course.\n\nI said it's the movie version of the song Cat's in the Cradle.  I do think, though, it asks the question, if you did change course in life, would you really be happy?",

        "content": "58 minutes into episode 4 \u201cBlink again\u201d Kirk Burrowes comments on how Diddy has shown violent behaviour since the 1992.\n\nHe goes on to say \u201cit seems to be all of a sudden with Sean, and it isn\u2019t. Some of it happened before our eyes. We blinked twice, and then we blinked again and were like \u201cokay, I guess this is cool now.\u201d\n\nIt struck me while watching it and reminded me of the movie Blink Twice, and how when it first came out there were conspiracies about it being loosely based around Diddy and/or Epstein.\n\nAfter seeing the series, and hearing \u2018blink twice\u2019 in an episode called blink again, I can\u2019t help but think it was intentional to call attention to it and inadvertently confirm the conspiracy.\n\nDid anyone else pick up on this? I know I could be reading into it too much but 50 cent is his biggest hater and it wouldn\u2019t suprise me if he would take the opportunity to throw shade wherever he can.",
