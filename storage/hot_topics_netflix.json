The spacing and editing made me wish the 2x speed play feature was available on the tv. \n\nI wished it was more buttoned up because the investigator shared some good info but it\u2019s a slog to get through and it feels like not enough people will see it. \n\nWhat did you think?

It also that the aftermath of Katrina still has a major impact on Modern day New Orleans. Very well done Netflix.",

        "content": "I really liked it. It's a great crime thriller with a ton of climax and tense atmosphere all around. The whole vibe is perfect, super dark, gloomy Scandinavia and I love the role the little chestnut mans play in it. The main detectives, Thulin and Hess, have that classic clashing-partners dynamic that totally work. The story may not make a lot of sense until you know the chain but it does well to ask you to just go with it. Also, a heads-up, it is quite graphic. Even with its flaws, it\u2019s an awesome watch if you're looking for a dark, fast-paced thriller with some good twists and turns that'll keep you hooked, go for it!\n\nI'd give it a 7.8/10\n\nFlaws: some may feel its a bit predictable (I didn't feel that way) at the end and you have to suspend your beliefs about the killer's abilities lol.",

        "content": "After years of being curious about the hard-to-find, acclaimed 1979 film, *The Seduction of Joe Tynan,* it has popped up on Netflix (Alan Alda, Meryl Streep, many others in supporting roles).\n\nI realize Meryl Streep is known as the great virtuoso of accents, but I'm finding *The Seduction of Joe Tynan* challenging to get through it, due to her character's \"Southern\" accent.\n\nStreep plays the daughter of an influential aristocratic Southern powerhouse of the Democratic Party but her accent is.......cloying, hammy, overdone, and inauthentic. It \"feels\" self-indulgent, like Streep determinedly set out to *master* a Southern accent. It seems self-conscious and affected to the point of caricature.\n\nI looked into it, and in a 1980 NY Times' interview, she says she modeled the accent after the way actress/singer/talkshow host, Dinah Shore speaks. Here's a video[ clip of Dinah Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI-pDqAe2do).  What Meryl Streep wields in *The Seduction of Joe Tynan* is not even in the same universe, much less state or region, as Dinah Shore.  It sounds more like a put-on or parody of a mish-mash of a dozen Southernesque accents.\n\nFurthermore, being the daughter of a rich man from Louisiana, and undoubtedly having been educated in the northeast, Streep's character would not have much of an accent at all in the late '70s.  But if she did, it would be a soft but distinctive accent from her particular area of Louisiana.  Instead we get a **gross distortion of Dinah Shore's** ***Tennessee*** **accent** by way of Florida Panhandle cracker--with a dash of Andy Griffith rural North Carolinian hick twang, a sprinkling of Scarlet O'Hara--and swallowed words and droppin' those G's as if she copied Sissy Spacek channeling Loretta Lynn in *Coalminer;s Daughter.*\n\nIn vibe it's precious---very smug, Yale Drama School MFA actress--and ironically, ultimately *inaccurate.*\n\nThe movie otherwise so far is pretty good, tho it unmistakably reflects the culture and \"liberal values\" circa 1979, which is a somewhat dated.",

        "content": "Just finished the Osama bin Laden doc. Wow. And now almost done with the Boston Marathon Bombing doc. These film crews &amp; Netflix absolutely nailed these. Firsthand accounts and photos inside the White House war room, etc. The dramatizations and recreated aerial footage of events really add to the realism, and are so convincing I forgot at times they were recreated. I can\u2019t wait to dive into the others they\u2019ve made and hope they continue this series. Well done Netflix. Very well done. ",
