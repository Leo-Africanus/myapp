I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

That's weird I thought to myself cause Netflix usually would promote their shows leading up to the release. \n\nAnd now with You season 5 being released, I realised that Netflix hasn't done any promos for their old shows for a while for the past 2 years ? It's only a week after the season hits or some random Tiktoks that i would find out a show is coming up. What happened ? \n\nEdit: I just went through their trailers and like, this entire year is loaded with their highest viewership shows ? How are they not making a big deal out of this year being the year of Netflix coming back with their cult classic shows ? We have Sandman, Love, Death and Robots, Wednesday, as well as Stranger Things (although I did saw Stranger Things being announced this year BUT not because of Netflix bombarding it in my face). ",

Writing, production, acting, casting, costumes, what have you: it\u2019s all on point 90% of the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a gangsters/families, cops and robbers martial arts drama, with the various gangs being fictional, but still feeling plausible in its\u2019 historicity. I treat it as fiction, but made in imitation of real life, at least as far as the broad tensions and power dynamics of that place and time.\n\nThe writing is sharp, the characters are great portrayals of certain archetypes. The action is excellent and stylish. It\u2019s quality top to bottom. And it\u2019s a unique perspective.\n\nThe focus is the Chinese immigrant population of 19th century San Francisco, but also the Irish population and other ancillary forces such as nativist white supremacy, economics, existing political structures, culture barriers, space and resource limitations etc etc. \n\nIf you like historical fiction, martial arts, sopranos style gangster drama\u2026this is for you. \n",

It doesn\u2019t feel fair.\n\nWhat\u2019s more annoying is that even though this policy started a while ago, I was still able to use Netflix on my laptop \u2014 just not on the mobile app. But today I got a notification on my laptop saying I can\u2019t use it anymore either.

And I think the director has deliberately kept it that way.\n\nWhen Maddie was put in the cage by Joe, maddie tried to show for a moment that she\u2019s quite strong and doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s a hostage, but soon when Ketoacidosis kicks in, and she gets know about her \u201csuperior\u201d twin learning about the affair\u2026 she just looses it and reveals how she\u2019s such a weak little girl. All throughout the season we see her as impulsive and extraordinarily weak in every minor situation after the cage incidence\u2026 which wasn\u2019t really the case before that!\n\nMy theory is \u2026 when  Reagan was locked in with her\u2026 who just showed moments ago that she can easily beat up Joe, and is quite tough, CAN\u2019T BE KILLED THAT EASILY BY HER WEAKER SISTER , that too by an insulin injection when she\u2019s all awake and athletic!!\n\nAlso, the killing of Reagan scene and the scene when maddie hits her husband unconscious is both not shown on the show\u2026 making perfect sense that Reagan killed maggie and then pretended to be her for the rest of the show!\n\nBut even till the final episode .. it wasn\u2019t shown.. the hallucinations, the - going to jail and still not breaking character were all a big show to make people hooked on when the show will reveal that it\u2019s actually Reagan pretending to be her twin and not the other way around\u2026 but it was never shown!\n\nDid anyone else notice that?

I'm guessing her coming back was more of a ptsd thing. \nNadia working with Kate was interesting but kind of boring in my opinion. \nJoe should of kept Maddie out of jail bc she was more useful outside of jail. \n\nAlso Maybe unpopular opinion, I'm not a fan of Bronte. I thought her character was annoying and she was the one to outsmart Joe, idk i guess I can see it but she just wasn't it for me.  Honestly I wished she would of drowned bc i really didn't like how they kept bringing everyone back to life. How did Bronte survive a gunshot and being drowned.\nHow tf did Kate survive a gunshot and burning building with  just minimal scaring?! The bookstore was on fire and she was shot like what.... That makes absolutely no sense. \n\nI love the series and it was a fun season the show finale I would of like to see Joe kinda disappear and with a new look in like Canada or Iceland and have the credits go Hey.. YOU... and fade off j think that would of been more impactful then this feel good everyone lived stuff.\n\n\nJust my. Opinion ",

        "title": "What YOU season 5 should have been (spoilers)",
        "content": "It\u2019s honestly hard to ignore how incredibly one-sided the final season feels. Yes, Joe is a psychopath\u2014there\u2019s no denying that. But Kate is just as morally compromised. Not only did she know that Joe killed her father for her, but she also directly asked him to kill her family\u2019s long-time advisor when he betrayed her. That wasn\u2019t implied or subtle\u2014it was a calculated, deliberate request. She knew exactly who Joe was and what he was capable of.\n\nKate claims she's trying to be \u201cgood,\u201d but that fa\u00e7ade cracks the moment she no longer needs Joe or starts seeing him as a liability. It\u2019s manipulative, self-serving, and above all, dishonest. If she had just admitted that she was a narcissist playing her own long game\u2014and that she didn\u2019t want Joe messing up her plans\u2014it would\u2019ve at least felt real. Instead, she tries to present herself as the noble heroine who had to \u201cescape\u201d Joe, when in truth, she reclaimed her empire with him.\n\nBronte\u2019s character only adds to the emotional whiplash. One minute she loathes Joe, the next she\u2019s falling for him, and then she\u2019s back to exposing him. It\u2019s not nuanced\u2014it\u2019s incoherent. And it undermines the idea that she\u2019s supposed to represent the moral compass of the season.\n\nAlso, it feels like the writers were trying to position Bronte\u2019s emotional flip-flopping\u2014her swinging between attraction and repulsion toward Joe\u2014as a reflection of what women experience in abusive relationships. The confusion, the push-pull dynamic, the trauma bonding\u2014that seems to be the angle they were aiming for.\n\nBut the problem is, Joe never actually abused Bronte. Not emotionally, not physically, not psychologically, leading up to her betrayal. Yes, he\u2019s done horrific things in the past\u2014to other people\u2014but not to her. In fact, he was protective, vulnerable, and even deferential around her. So her behavior, if it\u2019s meant to mirror the experience of an abuse survivor, comes off as misapplied and unearned in this context.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more tragic is that Joe did try. He was a loving, faithful husband for three years. The only time his darker instincts began to resurface was when Kate emotionally withdrew and saw him not as a partner, but a monster\u2014even though she had already accepted, even relied on, that side of him before. Her disgust is performative, not principled.\n\nThis season could have been so much more. Instead of Bronte preaching to Joe about love without violence, imagine if Kate\u2014the person who truly knew him\u2014had taken that role. If she had said, \"I love you, but you don\u2019t need to earn my love by killing. I\u2019ll love you no matter what, and we can keep each other good, like we said,\" it could\u2019ve been a transformative arc. Joe finally learning to separate love from violence, not through punishment, but through someone loving him without conditions. That\u2019s how redemption works\u2014not through shame, but through truth.\n\nEvery woman in this story is painted as either a victim or a victor, when in reality, they\u2019re playing the same games Joe is\u2014just with cleaner hands.\n\nIn my view, the most poetic and meaningful ending would\u2019ve been one rooted in sacrifice and selflessness\u2014in what love should be, not what it\u2019s been distorted into throughout the series.\n\nImagine this: Kate finally snaps\u2014driven to the brink of destruction with her sister about to expose the pipeline scandal\u2014and does something reckless. Something that reveals she was just as damaged, just as capable of destruction, as Joe ever was.\n\nBut instead of spiraling back into violence, Joe, now genuinely changed, makes a different choice.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t retaliate.\nHe doesn\u2019t manipulate.\nHe protects her.\n\nHe takes the fall\u2014not because he was caught, but because, for the first time in his life, he chooses to do the right thing for someone else, with no ulterior motive. He sacrifices himself, not to preserve an illusion of love, but to protect someone he truly loves. It\u2019s not about possession, or control, or fear\u2014just pure, quiet selflessness.\n\nThat would\u2019ve been the ending this series could have earned. One where love doesn\u2019t conquer darkness by pretending it\u2019s not there, but by confronting it with honesty, and rising above it with compassion, accountability, and grace.\n\nActual character growth in Joe\u2014not a full redemption, but a man finally choosing selflessness over control, love over violence.\n\nInstead, the show reduces everything to a flat message:\n\u201cEvil is evil. Kill it.\u201d\n\nNo nuance. No context. Just a binary ending for a character built in shades of gray. To the writers: maybe the problem is YOU. ",

        "content": "I can't for the life of me figure out how on earth to get Netflix working again on all our devices and it's infuriating me because the help info online and on the apps is absolutely useless and doesn't offer any troubleshooting options.\n\nNetflix works currently on my TV, my laptop, and my phone. The issue is with my ipad and I assume the issue is because it spends a significant amount of time connected to my mum's ipad when I'm at her place. The issue is even when I'm at home at MY place, connected to MY wifi, that my TV is also connected to, it still tells me that the device isn't part of my household?! And there don't seem to be any options to fix it. I sign out, reconnect wifi, sign back in, refresh app, etc. but nothing makes a difference. What gives? How the eff do I get it connected?\n\nAlso, as an aside, what the hell happens now if I want to watch Netflix outside my own home not connected to my wifi? I travel, spend a lot of time at other people's houses, etc. I get that Netflix doesn't want one person sharing their account with their 10 buddies, but it's genuinely outrageous that I can pay for a service and then not actually use it outside my own house. How does the 14 day temporary access thing work? What if I'm travelling overseas for a month?! At this rate I'm tempted to just unsubscribe because this is outrageous. I feel sorry for kids moving between divorced parents' houses. What a nightmare that must be. \n\nThanks for your help.  ",
