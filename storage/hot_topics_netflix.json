It's a good length too - long enough to tell a story spanning some years, but not so long you don't ever want to see another race.",

        "content": "I went into Netflix\u2019s new dating show excited because of the premise, but also because I\u2019d been following Logan for years on social media. She seemed like an accomplished researcher, author and advisor to companies like Hinge which is so cool. I\u2019ve also heard some of her original sound bites on dating that seemed decent. \n\nHowever I was really let down by her appearance on the show. First of all, she had zero personality. She came off as very meek, and bland, and if anything the participants facilitated the scenes and kept things energized. \n\nI also felt like her coaching moments were a mixed watch - some were totally decent, but others were lacking, and others came off as abrasive. \nFor example, there were many dates that seemed very decent and with potential, but the participant wrote it off quickly. As a coach, Logan should have challenged them a bit more instead of just agreeing - and I think this caused some people to lose out on connections that could have developed with a bit more time. \nOr another example - she tore into the lady with the big glasses - attacking her glasses choice and also telling her that her personality is too big. IMO Logan, as a coach, could have more gently engaged with the lady, rather than potentially making her self-conscious and feel put-down. It also just seemed odd to me to target her fashion choice, when the woman clearly puts in soooo much effort and presents herself thoughtfully. It\u2019s not like on Queer Eye when a makeover is part of the deal, and the participant is in need of it - not just for dating but for their well-being. \n\nI think Logan is clearly still a smart lady! But I think she\u2019s better suited for research\u2026or for consulting on a show like this - with someone more charismatic in the spotlight. \n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts?\n",

Also I didn\u2019t like the final table because it felt rigged at the end and too dramatic.

The beginning with the little girl listening to the show instructing her to go outside, we have that now with these crazy ass YouTube shows \u201cfor kids\u201d.

Why isn\u2019t he taken back to the station to file a formal report?\nHow does a lawman fail to recognize the difference between running over a nail and a textbook slashed tire on the side wall? Why would the reporter be considered or treated as a suspect off the bat? just because he's a writer, he's automatically a body chopping homicidal individual? this is no Jussie Smollett case,(all though even his \"assailants\" were taken under better preliminary scrutiny) it's a possible cartelish sounding case with professionals at hand, which is far more pressing. yes, there's little proof to corroborate his story, but can a real cop tell us what would have taken place if a CNN or Fox personality with news media influence came to them with such a story?\nWhy hasn\u2019t the reporter contacted his colleagues at the station? And why would he even stay near that property alone after the police left?\nThis isn\u2019t a critique of the characters in this pilot ep.\u2014it's about the story writing. It\u2019s unrealistic, sloppy, and a product of LOUSY MADNESS so far.\n\nLousy madness or keep watching it gets better? \n",

        "content": "Netflix only wants instant sensational hits so if it\u2019s not instantly discovered and instantly popular within one month of release they\u2019re just gonna abandon it before it gets discovered\nBut the problem with that is, they do nothing to advertise the new shows outside of their platform\nAnd the the form of advertisement they do have is absolutely terrible\nIt\u2019s advertising the product Netflix not individual shows \n\nEveryone knows the name of Netflix so start using that data you\u2019ve collected to have targeted ad campaigns so you can run advertisements for shows and movies that you think people would like\n\nDiscoverability of Netflix doesn\u2019t need to be done, but discoverability of Netflix shows need more of it \n\nBecause I\u2019ve noticed a lot of shows do not get discovered, because there is absolutely no advertisement outside of Netflix, and even with in Netflix it was badly advertised\n\nIf they want to actually have TV shows that actually are successful give them some breathing room like if it\u2019s obviously a failure all the reviews online are saying it\u2019s bad. We hated it don\u2019t make anymore. Sure maybe that\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s a horrible TV show. \n\nBut if everyone\u2019s talking good about the show, even though you\u2019re not reaching  the preferred metrics of 80% completion or more within a week\nAnd even then that doesn\u2019t matter there\u2019s shows that meat Netflix is arbitrary metrics, and they decide to cancel it anyways \nIf you want to show to be successful, give it some breathing room, Bojack Horseman Netflix always goes on about how Bojack Horseman is there really good, animated, cartoon  because they gave breathing room\nBojack horseman, season one and two sucked \nBut by the end, it was a cultural masterpiece, because you gave the breathing room to the writers to actually write some thing instead of just abandoning ship. As soon as you don\u2019t meet your preferred metrics. \n\nIf Netflix released any TV shows that were big hits in the early 2000s they would\u2019ve cancelled them \n\nI understand their business to make money, but maybe instead of putting your profits into horrible movies that nobody wants to watch \nMaybe start putting it into TV shows and movies that people actually want to watch \n\nBecause the majority of shows that are actually really good nugget cancel Netflix doesn\u2019t give us a reason but there\u2019s tons of shows that are horrible dog shit with barely any ratings and Netflix keeps it going \n\nIt\u2019s just Netflix does not allow users to discover new shows before they cancel it \n\nYou have to know every show that comes out on Netflix\nEven though they do not advertise when they\u2019re coming out or what they come out with half the time \n\nI\u2019m not following Netflix is Twitter every single day checking their Twitter account every single day for the new release because 90% of their posts are absolute brain rot Just to keep them relevant. \n\n\nJust stop cancelling shows \nBefore people discover them \n\nIf it\u2019s 50% or more in the first season, give it a second season greenlight \n\nWe don\u2019t expect you to buy five seasons at a time \n\nAnd if popularity is dying off before the show is released, you can just cancel it and cut your losses \nDo that with every other movie they think it\u2019s going to do bad \n\n\nAnd another thing that is more of the movie industry problem than Netflix problem is companies expect movies to do poorly and they\u2019re really good. They expect movies to do really good and they do poorly so maybe stop cancelling those movies you think you\u2019re gonna flop  the couple of uptight critics said it would\n\nBecause time and time again, I see a movie come out critics say it\u2019s going to be horrible\nAnd people love it \n\nLook at the Mario movie everyone said it gonna be horrible. All the critics were against it.\nAs soon as it came out, everybody loved it \n\nAnd that\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve noticed with a lot of movies critics when they hate a movie and think that it should be cancelled before it gets released so they can get a pay out \nBecause it\u2019s only 80% complete\n\nMaybe finish the movie and release it because if you think it\u2019s gonna do bad, it\u2019s gonna be good\nIf you think it\u2019s gonna be good, it\u2019s gonna be bad",
