        "content": "Many of us love a good procedural. Adolescence was unique in many ways. The single shot experience is amazing. But contrasted with Dept Q, it really showcases a slowed down, normal way of talking that is rare in tv. I'm very much into the story of Dept Q, but far too often the characters are slinging witticisms, even normal ideas, back and forth clearly faster than normal cognition allows. Nothing too wrong with it, its exciting and fun. In early Guy Ritchie movies its amazing. When Jeremey Brett does it as Sherlock Holmes you believe it. But in this show, for me at least, it kinda breaks the spell. Adolescence told a great story in four episodes, and every character was understandably too busy digesting the situation and processing their emotions to be pumping us with dialogue - that is great tv! Fast pace high level dialogue is a choice, a gamble, and ultimately a hard sell, especially for a 'procedural.' ",

He was \ud83d\udcaf percent correct on this. \n\nI can't believe the two of them were even in this documentary. Unless every person who watches it gets that same disgusting reaction to her that I do, then maybe this helps more in the court of public opinion.\n\nI still have 26 min left.

Sure, it fits with the other installments to keep a consistent release schedule.

And it is NOT even hidden in the home section. This, and the \"coming this week\", \"coming next week\", \"worth the wait\" were great functionalities. \n\nanother missing section is games, but dont care about it. was crap anyway, most of the games.\n\nSo I wanted to ask, if something is wrong with my TV (its about 5 years old), or if its a feature and not a bug, or if they plan to update the app. \n\nObviously, theres a workaround, i can still see \"new and popular\" in PC or mobile app, pin it to \"my shows\" and then follow on TV, but it feels cheap and uncomfortable. \n\nany info would be greatly appreciated.",

Let\u2019s make it so our subscribers can only see a maximum of 4 selections on their screen! Isn\u2019t that a great idea! Pat me on the back I did a good thing! Now they can spend 4x as much time on Netflix looking for something to watch! Now THAT\u2019S customer retention! Give me a bonus!\u201d\n\nProbably not and it\u2019s a horrible idea. Max lets me view 5, Disney is 12 thumbnails, starz is 16 and my tv Home Screen is 8. With Netflix I can only view 4 items on a 100\u201d screen? Horrible UI this app just gets not better and better.
