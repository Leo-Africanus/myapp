        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\n  \nThis post is mostly a rant about Netflix and the way they handle stuff with many of their shows. I came to realize Netflix has an absurd strategy to keep customers locked in releasing new series/shows at a steady pace but for the majority, series are almost never finished unless they are really classics or series they have acquired. I am really annoyed but the number of times I locked into one of the series and then have to realize there will not be any ending of the show. It came to the point where I even start to lookup whether or not there is going to be a final season before investing the time to check it out. \n\n  \nSeries which have left a bitter taste to me personally since there is no \"what's next\":\n\n* Marco Polo\n* Away\n* 1899\n* Snowpiercer\n* Barbarians\n* Pulse\n* The recruit\n* Boots\n* Lost in space (it has an ending but there was more imo)\n* ..\n\nI know this post is not going to make any difference and I understand more than anybody else the business, it is money first, customers second but damn me, damn me for watching unfinished series. Especially the science fiction seems to be affected by this problem quite a lot. (or maybe that is because I watch too many of those)\n\nI just hope I am not the only one who has this feeling and who has been disappointed more than once in the past years?",

Back in 2017, the Mind Flayer in the sky was the biggest thing we had ever seen, but now Netflix is literally putting the series finale in 500 theaters.\n\nThe transition from a standard TV binge to this massive holiday event model is actually genius when you look at how the story has evolved. Season 2 was a local mystery, but the Season 5 Volume 2 trailer shows that this is now a full-scale war involving the military and multi-dimensional tech.\n\nSplitting the final season into three parts across Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s is the only way to give a story this big enough room to breathe. If they had dropped it all at once, we would have missed all these connections to the early seasons that the Duffers have been planting for years.\n\nI\u2019m actually glad they are moving away from the one week binge cycle for this one. \n\nIt makes the show feel like a blockbuster movie trilogy rather than just another season of television.

You can check your order status on their website with the order number and your email but when you try, the wheel spins and it never populates a response. The customer service phone number provided by Netflix Shop isn\u2019t in service and their chat bot just spits out an automated response that you\u2019ll receive an emailed response within 48 hours (which also hasn\u2019t happened within time). If the answer is that it\u2019s delayed and it won\u2019t make it before Xmas, fine. I can accept that.
