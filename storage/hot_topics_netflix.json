I\u2019m open to other genres too if the story and acting are solid.

I didn\u2019t subscribe to Netflix for their originals. They do have good ones but they\u2019ve also recently just been pumping them out to get people on their platform.\n\nAll the streaming services are doing it and its unsettling. Knowing the majority of the population have a subscription to one or multiple. Idk it just seems fucked they still have to go over the top by providing location so I can\u2019t watch on the same acc as my family down the street. They want my extra $5 so bad (idk what it cost now tbh I\u2019ve been sharing acc with my immediate family since Netflix existed) and I understand it adds up when you cut hundreds of thousands of people off from sharing under minuscule distance. But they also have 1000s of hundreds of thousands in profits (exaggerated) but still feel this enforcement is necessary?\n",

Loosely based on true events the drama is very engaging but troubling in the brutality of the crime. Subtitling (or dubbed English) from Hindi is good but occasionally the spoken English (not captioned) is hard to make out. Acting is very good with the dramatic focus being on the under resourced local police identifying and tracking down the suspects against background of political pressure. I like getting an insight into The culture of both police and locals. But be warned: though not graphicly shown, the discussion of sexual violence is stark.",

But then I thought about it, and it has a lot of depth. Maybe I\u2018m overthinking this, but this series shows us how easy it is to make the women the villain, how to frame them and how we do so easily believe it. Looking back, I just ignored the signs of Kiki being just nice without any agenda. The whole time I expected her behaviour to be calculating and cunning. I  jumped to the conclusion that she must be the bad guy as the show wanted us to believe at first. Even her behaviour contradicting this assumption didn\u2019t sway me at first. But now I see the man who manipulates the viewers perspective. I so easily believed Peter when he talked about his alienation from his kids and it being kikis fault. But when she talked about how small the marriage made her and how horrible the kids were to her, it didn\u2019t quite resonate as much. Frightening tbh, particularly because I would go as far as saying I have definitely and massively educated myself about the patriarchy and intersectional feminism. Maybe I\u2019m interpreting too much, but if you look at it from a feminist perspective then it - amongst other things - shows us the sway of men\u2019s opinion\u2019s still and the smear campaign that always hits the women ten times harder. It shows us the dangers of dependency, especially as a woman. So, I kind of liked the show. I liked how it was over the top mostly and also sometimes even a bit satirical while dealing with heavier topics.  Let me know what you think and what your interpretation is",

I\u2019m an adult and I enjoy watching all kinds of shows, but on the weekends I want to watch Netflix while I\u2019m working out and my 4yo daughter is in the room playing, so I can\u2019t have any bad dialogue or mature subject matter coming up.\n\n In the past I\u2019ve really enjoyed watching a lot of ESPN 30 for 30 documentaries, but I\u2019ve pretty much exhausted all the PG rated ones in that series. I\u2019ve also watched movies like My All American, Home Team, and The Long Game, which have a sports theme but are family friendly. It doesn\u2019t *need* to be a sports show though. Any suggestions?",

        "content": "I just flipped through a long list of recommended shows/movies (because you watched... ) and MORE than half of them were foreign. I only want to see movies in the English language. Is there any way to filter out all these foreign films? If I wanted to watch a foreign film, I would look for a \"foreign film\" category. I'm so sick of weeding thru films that aren't in in my language. Thanks!",
