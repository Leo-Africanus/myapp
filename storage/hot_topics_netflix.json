Rose wants everything to be perfect and ideal when it\u2019s not realistic at all, for example she demands that the agent go and save noors family with little to no time to prepare not only endangering his life but noors family as well but then when it goes wrong she gets upset about it when it should\u2019ve already been expected as a possibility, then she\u2019s iffy about having to lie to get the pictures when she\u2019s already been told that thousands of lives could be at risk but no she\u2019s right it\u2019s a hard choice wavering honesty over thousands of lives. She\u2019s extremely entitled and full of herself. I think the actor did a great job it\u2019s just the way the character was written. \n\nEdit: also biggest nitpick later on rose acts like she was dragged into all this and didn\u2019t ask to be a \u201cnight agent\u201d after having her tantrum when she quite literally inserted herself into every situation any way she could when everyone was hesitant on her doing so.",

Delicately, not exploitedly, and showing strength and resilience in the survivor, instead of the usual crumbling and broken victim. It felt authentic. It was treated with compassion and without shame. \nI do think I would have ended many things differently, it was depressing AF, but overall I liked the series. ",

        "content": "I believe these are the views for the first time they appear in the Netflix Top 10 site.\n\nI recommend giving them a try. I've watched most of them, except Baki Hanma, Dragon Ball Daima, Demon Slayer Season 4. All of them are available in English dub too.\n\n**Sakamoto Days** (Currently simulcasting/weekly release) - 8/10  \nComedy action anime about a hitman who left his job after falling in love at first sight with a convenience store lady. As a result, he left his job and became a father who helped people, prohibited from killing. He's now living his peaceful quiet life... or is he?  \nHe is also being hunted or searched by his former rivals and partners, so he has to stop his enemies without killing them.\n\n**DAN DA DAN** (there's an attempted rape at ep. 1 by the aliens, afterwards it's safe) - 8.5/10  \nHe was an alien fanboy, she was a ghost fangirl. They're in dispute over which one is real since they believe the other one doesn't exist, so the female MC (main character) decided to look for alien; male MC looked for ghost. Turns out both are real. Male MC lost his balls (literally) to Turbo Granny in a tunnel. Long story short they both gain supernatural powers, guess you can say they are a match.\n\n**Record of Ragnarok** - 7/10  \nAnimation needs improvements imho, but it's still enjoyable. The gods want to wipe out humanity due to their sins and selfishness, but one of the Valkyries (Brunhilde) said hold up, let them cook, and proposed an idea to make humans literally fight against the gods in an arena instead. If humans have more wins than gods, humankind will be spared. Some of the fights include Adam vs Zeus, L\u00fc Bu vs Thor, Jack the Ripper vs Heracles, Raiden vs Shiva.\n\n**My Happy Marriage** - 7.5/10  \nThe female MC lives in an abusive household ever since her mother died and her father remarried an evil woman and her daughter. She got forced to be a servant/mais. Her father suddenly brought a news that she is to marry a guy from a noble and distinguished family. Her fiancee is known to be callous and dismissed all his previous fiancees. That's what she expected, but turns out he treated her nicely.\n\n**Ranma 1/2** (2024 remake) - 8/10  \nI'm sure you've heard of this slapstick romance comedy before; if not, it's about a dude (Ranma) who is a gender bender after falling into a hot lake in China; likewise his father who can turn into a Panda. Ranma got engaged with a tomboy girl by his father who is a friend to the fiancee's father.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Netflix subscriber for years, but with the latest price hike for the Premium plan (now $24.99/month!), I\u2019m really starting to question if it\u2019s worth it anymore. They keep raising prices while pushing out content that, honestly, doesn\u2019t always hit the mark. It feels like they\u2019re making us pay for their poor-performing shows and movies instead of focusing on producing quality content that people actually want to watch.\n\nAnd the password-sharing crackdown? I get that they want to boost profits, but it feels like they\u2019re ignoring how modern households actually function. Not everyone under one account lives in the same house 24/7\u2014people go to college, travel for work, or stay with family temporarily. It just seems dumb to alienate loyal customers who aren\u2019t trying to cheat the system but just have a normal life.\n\nA lot of people I know have either canceled their subscriptions or switched to other streaming services that offer just as much\u2014if not more\u2014for less money. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If they\u2019re losing subscribers because of price hikes, why keep doing it? Shouldn\u2019t they focus on improving their content and keeping people around instead of squeezing every dollar out of us?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are you sticking with Netflix, or are you moving on to other platforms?",

Otogi found out about the disaster prophesied to befall Nico within the year, and has to protect her as her bodyguard, while upholding his duty as her familiar.\n\nComing to Netflix, Hulu, and Crunchyroll, thanks to MBS, the producer of the anime.
