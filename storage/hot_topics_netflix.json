You hear of data breaches as well and it feels like anyone with enough motivation could piece together my whole life.  \n  \nLowkey freaking out about it lol.",

With these half season releases I\u2019m just going to wait until the full season is out and avoid discussions of the first half as best I can, which I think defeats their goal of trying to make series be in the spotlight longer. Either way, between this and their show cancellation decisions, it seems like Netflix figures out the worst thing they could do and then do that thing. ",

I feel Rust's character has been crafted perfectly, gotta love his firmness and his straight up honesty, anywhere portrayed like more of a crazy person with flaws who makes mistakes but I love how Rust has come to the point of acceptance and is so self aware.\n\nAnd for Mindhunter I'd have loved the next season. I loved the show and I'm very positive on the open ending. Infact I love the imperfect endings of both shows, it doesn't always have to be all smiles or sorrow.\n\nI think you should love Unbelievable too if you loved both the shows.",

        "content": "I tend to like more realistic shows but an open to all genres for the most part just no anime or cheesy cliche written stories. My favorites include\n\nLost\nThe leftovers\nThe stand\nMr robot\nAmerican primeval \nThe man in the high castle\nMindhunter\nOzark\nBloodline\nThe crowded room (very insane)\nMobland \nThe last of us (season one only)\nWalking dead\n\nThat\u2019s all I can come up with at the top of my head and I do like most of Tyler Sheridan shows except for lioness and landman was \u201cok\u201d would have been better without the obnoxious ex wife and daughter. The ones listed above are generally the shows I tend to enjoy. \n",
