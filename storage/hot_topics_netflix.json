What was Lexy\u2019s plan at the house if she wasn\u2019t the killer? Did she think Anna was the killer? Was she just upset and defending her husband who had been locked out? Fighting Anna because she slept with Richard? There seem to be a variety of motives here, but if Lexy was not the real killer, the whole scene seemed odd \u2013 particularly when Richard had all the tools and materials for kidnappings, etc. laid out on the table.\n2. When Zoe corners Jack in his office, what was she going to say to him about Anna not being what Jack thought she was? Seemed like a loaded and odd thing to say once you see how the 16th birthday secret actually played out. Could be Zoe trying to deflect or misdirect Jack because of her own guilt around that event?\n3. Why/ how would Anna marry the brother of someone who sat by and encouraged her assault? It seems like the trauma of the assault caused her to memory hole the events a bit (she doesn't mention her own assault when recounting the tale to Jack), but it still seems far-fetched.\n\nThere are plenty more questions I have, but these ones \u2013 particularly #1 \u2013 are sticking with me the most.",

I had to yell at my son to close his eyes while scrambling to hit the mute button so it wouldn't ruin the show. I know he's late to the party, but he's just now old enough to watch the show and was so excited to start it.\n\nAiring trailers for future seasons which spoil unwatched seasons is bad enough, but this seems like a new level of disregard. If nothing else, can't they put it some type of setting to disable these types of things?",

        "title": "How Netflix brought interactive voting to \u2018Star Search\u2019",
        "content": "On January 20, Netflix is bringing back the popular talent competition\u00a0*Star Search*, with a twist: For the first time in its history, Netflix will let its audience decide the outcome of a show with live voting. However, unlike how shows have done this in the past, audiences won\u2019t have to send text messages or call a special number to make their votes count. Instead, viewers will vote with their TV\u2019s remote control, or right within the Netflix app if they watch the show on their phones.\n\nNetflix hopes that this level of simplicity will help to make live programs like\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0a lot more exciting, and offer its audience a chance to experience shared watercooler moments that tend to be missing from today\u2019s world of hyper-personalized streaming. \u201cYou can influence the outcome \\[together with\\] everyone at the same time,\u201d says Netflix member product VP Elmar Nubbemeyer. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the Zeitgeist at that moment.\u201d\n\nTo bring real-time voting to\u00a0*Star Search*, Netflix relied on work it previously did for interactive narrative shows. It also snuck voting tests into David Chang\u2019s Netflix show, and showed focus groups segments from two fake shows it cooked up for testing purposes.\u00a0 The company even built internal tools that will help it to repurpose live voting and polling for other live events and shows in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are planning more of these types of moments,\u201d says Netflix\u00a0product designer\u00a0Navin Iyengar. \u201c*Star Search*\u00a0is really the big unveiling of it.\u201d\n\nWhen\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0debuts Tuesday evening, viewers will have two distinct opportunities to make their voices heard. Once a singer or comedian is done with their performance, a graphic will pop up on screen, encouraging each viewer to give it a rating ranging from one to five stars. \u201cWe knew early on that giving a star rating as an interaction was really important,\u201d says Iyengar. \u201cIt\u2019s core to the\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0IP.\u201d\n\nLater on, they\u2019ll also get the chance to choose their personal champion of the night out of four choices presented next to each other on screen. Each voting graphic will remain on screen for about 60 seconds, and the show\u2019s host\u2014Anthony Anderson, best known for the ABC sitcom\u00a0*Blackish*\u2014will respond to the incoming vote tally in real time.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Netflix has done real-time voting like this, but the company has been experimenting with getting viewers more actively involved for almost a decade. In 2017, the streaming service released its first interactive TV shows, which prompted viewers to choose their own adventure through branched narratives. In one scene of \u201cBandersnatch,\u201d an interactive episode of the dystopian sci-fi show\u00a0*Black Mirror*, the viewer has to decide whether the main character should take his medication by pressing left or right buttons on their remote control, with different choices leading to vastly varying outcomes.\u00a0\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91477533/how-netflix-brought-interactive-voting-to-star-search)",

        "content": "I've been a loyal Netflix user since nearly the beginning, and throughout these years, I've consistently relied on the platform's Details/More Info page. This feature allowed me to read descriptions, check ratings and captions, confirm runtimes, and select the right episode to watch. However, with Netflix's recent design change, many titles now play automatically when you click on them, without allowing us to view these crucial details first. This shift not only disrupts our viewing experience but also raises several significant concerns.\n\nFirstly, the removal of the Details/More Info page undermines accessibility. Users with hearing or vision impairments, or those who prefer certain languages, have been left without immediate access to critical information such as available captions or language options. This change diminishes the inclusive spirit Netflix formerly championed.\n\nFurthermore, for parents, the inability to preview content poses a risk. Without being able to assess content suitability via ratings, parents may inadvertently expose their children to inappropriate material.\n\nAdditionally, for those on limited data plans, it's essential to preview content details to ensure their data is used wisely. Confirming that a show is appropriate and worth watching before it begins streaming is no longer straightforward, leading to possible unnecessary data consumption.\n\nCan we please ask Netflix to restore the Details/More Info page? At the very least, create a customizable account setting allowing users to choose whether to automatically play content or to view details first would greatly enhance user experience and satisfaction.\n\nThis request aims to improve the service for all users and underscore Netflix's commitment to accessibility, family safety, and user choice. Please feel free to weigh in\u2026 anyone else annoyed?",

Y no solo a los del tri\u00e1ngulo.\n\nSiento que Jackie ama a Cole, pero le aterra perder el control. Con Alex hay confianza y cari\u00f1o, pero no esa pasi\u00f3n abrumadora. Y ahora Alex act\u00faa como \"rebelde\", pero claramente es una coraza por el dolor.\n\nMi sue\u00f1o (y quiz\u00e1s el de muchos) ser\u00eda esta estructura:\n\n\u00b7 Temporada 3: \"La Sanaci\u00f3n\"\n      Que no gire solo en torno a \"\u00bfa qui\u00e9n elige Jackie?\".

Que dejen de ser decoraci\u00f3n.\n  \u00b7 Las amistades: Darle arco a Skylar, a Nathan y hasta a Kiley. Que sus relaciones tengan peso.\n  \u00b7 Los adultos: Que la mam\u00e1 Walter y la t\u00eda tengan sus propias historias de superaci\u00f3n.\n\u00b7 Temporada 4: \"La Construcci\u00f3n\"\n      SOLO entonces, con personajes enteros, podr\u00edan explorarse relaciones saludables.\n  \u00b7 Un posible reencuentro Jackie-Cole ser\u00eda desde la plenitud, no desde el trauma.\n  \u00b7 Alex merecer\u00eda encontrar su propia felicidad, con alguien que lo elija desde el d\u00eda 1.\n  \u00b7 Podr\u00edamos ver relaciones s\u00f3lidas entre los hermanos, amistades que perduran y, en general, un \"despu\u00e9s\" feliz y cre\u00edble para todos.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\nPorque Colorado y los Walters son un ECOSISTEMA, no solo un escenario.

        "title": "[THE WALTER BOYS] My vision for S3 and S4: \"Healing first, then love\" (And more development for EVERYONE)",
        "content": "Hey everyone, #TeamCole and #TeamAlex (and most importantly, #TeamJackie).\n\nJust finished S2 and, while I loved it, I was left with a strong feeling: if this show wants to be memorable and not just another teen clich\u00e9, it needs to give its characters time to HEAL. And not just the love triangle.\n\nI feel Jackie loves Cole, but she's terrified of losing control. With Alex, there's trust and affection, but not that overwhelming passion. And now Alex is acting \"rebellious,\" but it's clearly armor for his pain.\n\nMy dream (and maybe many of yours) would be this structure:\n\n\u00b7 Season 3: \"The Healing\"\n      Not centered solely on \"Who will Jackie choose?\" But on healing the entire Walter family and their circle:\n  \u00b7 Jackie, Cole, and Alex (as described above, each with their therapy and personal growth).\n  \u00b7 The Walter Siblings: Deepen Will's journey with deafness, Danny's passion for art, Lee's search for identity. Let them stop being background decor.\n  \u00b7 The Friends: Give Skylar, Nathan, and even Kiley proper story arcs. Let their relationships have weight.\n  \u00b7 The Adults: Let Mom Walter and Aunt have their own stories of moving on.\n\u00b7 Season 4: \"The Building\"\n      ONLY then, with whole characters, could healthy relationships be explored.\n  \u00b7 A potential Jackie-Cole reunion would come from a place of wholeness, not trauma.\n  \u00b7 Alex would deserve to find his own happiness, with someone who chooses him from day one.\n  \u00b7 We could see solid sibling bonds, lasting friendships, and an overall believable and happy \"after\" for everyone.\n\nWhy?\nBecause Colorado and the Walters are an ECOSYSTEM, not just a backdrop. Their healing should be collective. This would give the series incredible depth and make Jackie, Cole, and Alex's journey feel part of something bigger and real.\n\nI know Netflix loves quick endings, but... wouldn't this be more powerful and satisfying? Would you support a \"healing\" season that develops EVERYONE, even if it delays the main \"endgame\"?\n\nShare your thoughts. I hope the writers see that there are fans who want a whole world, not just a love triangle.\n\n#TheWalterBoys #Netflix #TeamCole #TeamAlex",

They have just recently started promoting it on my feed, and I am happy to see the series is now available, since before cutting the cable cord that was one of my favorite cop shows. It used a number of storytelling devices which at the time felt new to me, and had a real, gritty flavor. We are planning to watch it as soon as we are done with the series we are watching now! Highly recommend. ",

If I activate it here, will I run into problems when I get back home and try to use a different WiFi?",
