        "content": "After a quick search I see this documentary has been talked about quite a bit here, but the one thing I haven\u2019t seen mentioned is the fact the documentary is almost entirely filmed on police body cam.\n\nI personally found this fascinating as someone who enjoys seeing live clips, police interviews, especially when tied into a documentary.  (For me it adds an extra layer of \u201crealness\u201d to the documentary.)\n\nI wonder if we will see more true crime documentaries filmed this way with the advancements of technology and body cam footage etc. I think the documentary was beautiful put together and even with majority of the documentary being on body cam footage, it still told a very clear story.\n\nCurious to know anyone\u2019s thoughts on this? Did you think the body cam footage made things \u201ctoo real\u201d? Invasion of privacy? Would you like to see more true crime documentaries that include police body cam footage etc?\n\nTIA! \ud83d\udc8b",

When the episode ends it won\u2019t automatically go to the next episode, it\u2019ll say some error code and when I click on it, it says that error code as well. Then I try something else and the error code is there too. I swipe netflix out, and I\u2019m logged out yet this time it won\u2019t log me in regardless no matter what, I have to wait a couple hours or for me usually the next day. Is this common? Thanks.
