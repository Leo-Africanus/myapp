She meant William saw the man with the cap and not that he identified Lyle considering both lingaard siblings couldn't have remembered how Lyle Jennings looked like now\n2) Lyle acts extremely stupid when he's with his mom. Is this something to do with being abused? Because it is a little difficult to believe he pulled off all those crimes\n3) they never show the motive behind why Lyle targeted Sam. Was that because he ran in similar circles with Merritt or he just wanted to get back at Sam for punching him. Also, did Lyle pretend to be Sam H to know Merritts whereabouts or was he eventually going to know because he was stalking her.",

But they have clearly stated that if this happens the world economy will get destroyed... So what's the point in having all that money?\n\nGranted, she would still be considered \"rich\" and could look to use the money to buy other assets that hold more value in an economical disaster, but my guess is she's probably already fairly wealthy as it is, so she's probably not going to be in any considerably better position afterwards which makes the whole thing utterly pointless.\n\nJust my thoughts anyway.

        "content": "I liked the series Dept Q except for one glaring problem. It seemed obvious much earlier than the final episode that Harry Jennings death was linked to Merritt's disappearance yet it took the team a long  time to finalize this conclusion. I found it hard to suspend disbelief that two people from the same small town Mhor both disappearing off a ferry would not be a huge story where news people would not be poking around and interviewing Ailsa right after the kidnapping. Then for Morck and company not to press harder when first trying to talk to Ailsa I find it hard to believe they would just leave Mhor without talking to her first. Just seemed like they should have figured this out way earlier. \n\nSecondly the police chief of Mhor disappears and no one goes looking for him? I know small town but pretty sure when investigating crimes you radio in where you are going and even then him going missing would have triggered an immediate response which would have included pinging his cell phone. Not really believable it would take more than a few hours. ",
