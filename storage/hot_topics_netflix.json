Everyone have their flaws &amp; pros but friends are people who just don\u2019t care about your pros and flaws but only about your happiness. \n\nI loved the show for its quirkiness, rawness of being a human, being old, depiction of love that is unconditional, personalities such as grace &amp; brianna, i personally relate with them.\n\nGood show!

Truthfully, if they'd tried to do a modern adaptation of it then ending up with freddie should've felt right\n\nQuite frankly, they should've switched brayden and freddie, give brayden (as freddie's role) more screen time so it adds up to the persuasion plot. If they wanted this show to be a second chances trope it clearly backfired super hard  \nMoreover, i'm pretty sure by the public outrage s2 endgame is most likely going to be braydriana. Riley and Brayden will not work out and neither will freddie and adriana. I hope Adriana and Freddie get the closure they deserve tho\n\nI'm a huge fan of this whole figure skating romance trope. I really liked spinning out and i was super bummed when it was discontinued, i was hoping for this to be bettter\n\nPS- is there anyone who's a fan of adriana and freddie ??? bc as soon as i finished the show and opened insta- all i could see was just insane braydriana love, like yeah their chemistry was off the charts but i couldn't help but feel for the whole freddie and adriana trope too.

        "content": "Maybe it\u2019s because I watched the documentary, but I never once thought \u201comg he\u2019s gonna fall\u201d while watching that. He knows what he\u2019s doing. Sure, it was nerve wracking, and it being live added an element of uncertainty. But he was never going to (and didn\u2019t) fall. That building was not as tall as El Capitan and he practiced it many times, so the risk of him falling was actually quite low. I think the only reason people freaked out was because it was in an unnatural environment (a city and not out in nature). I\u2019ve seen so many people online criticizing him, calling him inconsiderate at times because he has a wife and kids and people watching him. I don\u2019t really get it.",

We really enjoyed the story and wished it was a real book series so they could continue the character. But one detail that was not explained to my recollection is \"Where did the blood in the Lincoln bedroom that Kylie Minogue found come from?\". Maybe I missed it but any answer would be appreciated. Thank you",
