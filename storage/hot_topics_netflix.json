I liked that they actually used a Native American cast and language. I liked the conflict plot between the different groups a bit more than the journey portion. But Oh My God, the shots of nature were gorgeous! And of course the acting was great all around. I just liked it, lol. There were some things that were...questionable \\*cough\\*wolfattack\\*cough\\* and some others, but whatever.\n\nI def wanted to slap Sara a few times, like girl! Just listen one time!! Two moons was so cute!! Bridger was awesome! I'd like to have a drink with him. \n\nI know the mormon church is probably pissed about how they are being represented...but IYKYK\n\n",

I checked what other people were saying after I finished so my opinion couldn't be swayed by others and thank god I didn't. Some points I didn't like were Farhad, Rose (she was off icel), and Tomas specifically what annoyed me was the fact that no one could lie to save their life. BUT I loved the action I think it was 10x better than S1 kinda felt repetitive with the mole or whatever but I still enjoyed it. I'm not no film critic or wtv i'm actually employed but I'm hoping for a S3 with the last scene with Peter and Catherine seemed promising.",

For context, I was rewatching SPY X FAMILY and currently watching SAKAMOTO DAYS.\n\nI have my account logged in on both our TV, Laptop, and my phone. I noticed that I couldn't search up the titles on the TV. I tried searching in on the web then clicking the link to redirect me to Netflix, it worked but I couldn't play the series. The series shows up on my phone too, but there wasn't any play button as well. I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. **(EDIT: Just a few days ago, even yesterday, I was watching SPY X FAMILY just fine.)**\n\nI don't know if this information helps but I was also on time with payment for my subscription. I am currently on the Standard plan, \"Great video quality in Full HD (1080p). Watch ad-free on any phone, tablet, computer or TV. Download on 2 devices.\"\n\nAnyone knows what happened here?

        "content": "Jack Reacher, Jack Ryan, James Bond, Jason Bourne, whatever. The trope of the hyper competent spy action thriller that's geared specifically towards the male demographic. There are so many of these already, and apparently we needed another one?\n\nIMO what set the first season of The Night Agent apart was the male/female duo dynamic which tapped into both demographics and a wider audience. And while the writing occasionally went on the corny side, I appreciated the realistic aspect of physical limitations, i.e. the fighting was often clumsy, Rose was the computer wiz and not suddenly defeating men twice her size in hand-to-hand combat, and Peter wasn't this unrealistic prodigy agent who was somehow equally talented at technology and combat - they both needed the other in a believable partnership.\n\nSeason 2 felt like they were diverging away from the formula in order to turn it into another long-running spy thriller franchise, which the show runners pretty much confirmed in an interview. Also, the decision to make her suffer from PTSD and anxiety, and be in therapy twice a week felt entirely out of place considering Peter is somehow completely mentally unaffected? And how has no government organization recruited Rose yet to be a cyber intelligence officer? Instead this season wrapped up with her effectively becoming his Bond girl, with the writers saying it's undecided if Rose will even be back next season. Peter being willing to trade his whole life to save her and Rose in turn being like \"this gives me anxiety, I just wanna go back to Silicon Valley and be a normal girl :(\"\n\nAll of this made complete sense btw when I found out S1 is based on a book, and S2 was the show runners writing without any source material. For me the season was a letdown, and I'm honestly just uninterested in the direction they're taking this show",

        "content": "In December of 2024, Tyler Perry came out with a movie called The Six Triple Eight, starring Kerry Washington. I love history and after doing a deep dive on the story, I found out that, while dramatized and a handful of fictional characters sprinkled in for the sake of good storytelling, it was in fact very accurate. I really love Kerry Washington's portrayal of Major Charity Adams, especially the scene where she tells Dean Norris, \"over my dead body, sir!\" Especially since this scene actually happened in real life. She was a woman, being sick of mistreated for so long, that she wasn't going to let anyone stand in her way of what she wanted. ",
