But two episodes in, monsters Ed Gein, is monsters Alfred Hitchcock, psycho, featuring Ed Gein. I get that the making of psycho would make for a very interesting story. I just didn't expect a series about Ed Gein, being about that. Or mostly that. When I watched monsters Jeffrey Dahmer, or the Menendez brothers. I didn't watch a series about a movie based on them. And some hard hitting issues involved with that. Again, would make an excellent series. Not the one I thought I was watching though. Is this a me thing?\nEdit\n\nI made it to episode 4. To all of you who hinted it was going to also be about the Texas chainsaw massacre, this and silence of the lambs, well done. But honestly ffs. If they didn't know enough of Ed Gein to make a series out of it, than don't. No need to make stuff up. Or connect him to movies. Or I half part get that part. But make that it's own series, movies inspired by Ed Gein. Usually monsters takes some creative licence. Here, they took all the licence. Most of this is made up. When it didn't have to be. What he did was plenty to base a series on. What they did was make up shit surrounding this case, give the lead an awful voice the real Ed didn't. And than show,  hey, remember this movie? Wasn't that guy weird. Oooh that and making the lead in the Hitchcock movie gay. And him going, ugh, gay, that is so shit. My life is so shit. *I heard the real actor went through conversion therapy* All of this I hated. Im not watching episode 5. To those who stuck with it, let me know if I got it wrong. Im just done. The acting is fine. It's not them. The series is just so all over the place bad",

Through research I tried to figure out more about her role and the real life events of the story to which there wasn\u2019t a clear cut answer. But anyways, I found her character not needed or necessary for the show. To be honest, I was anticipating that the twist would be she was just a hallucination the entire time but supposedly she\u2019s not. Her character is repulsive and equally disturbing as Ed. Why are we getting a pointless arc of her going to New York to glaze a graphic comic book novelist? Are we supposed to feel bad for a person who set Ed up to defile the body of another side character? Throughout the episodes, I was trying to figure out the motivation of her character, and I was still left confused.\n",

However, the main character was a girl and everyone was targeting her because they thought she would be an easy target. (Not the 100 tv show) I also remember near the end of the show, the main character was talking to a tree and the tree held memories and some kind of special power. ",

The way the show builds Elliot\u2019s world is wild, the loneliness, the paranoia, but also the almost surgical precision he has when it comes to tech. What blows me away is how grounded the hacking feels. It\u2019s not just flashy movie effects, it\u2019s real exploits, social engineering, digging through code, finding weak spots, and using them in ways that could actually happen. Even the little things, like using encrypted communication and throwaway identities, make it clear the writers wanted it to feel authentic. (saw some interviews on youtube about that aswell)  \n  \nThe whole vibe of the show also makes you think about bigger questions like surveillance, data collection, and how much of ourselves we\u2019ve basically handed over without even realizing it. Watching Elliot manipulate those cracks in the system really drives home how vulnerable our digital lives can be. All of this has me seriously curious. How does someone actually reach that level of skill in real life, it really is crazy. Either way 10/10 show, especially the ones like the PDF file one (idk if it gets censored if I post the word). I'm actually considering making into a career.  \n",

The first few videos are relatively self-contained Halloween stories with the settings and characters of \"Sing\" and \"The Bad Guys,\" which can be enjoyed even if someone hasn't seen any related movies, although many children will have.  \n\nBut then the rest of them were mostly episodes of series. And while I guess something like an episode of *The Cuphead Show* is probably easy enough to follow out of order, there are also mid-season episodes of heavily plot-driven shows like *Jentry Chau versus the Underworld*, *Unicorn Academy* and *Wolf King* that would probably leave most people desperately confused. \n\nThere are even things like the season finale of *Scaredy Cats*, which *is* a Halloween episode, but also the culmination of the plot of the whole series, and probably most confusing, the third season finale of *Jurassic World: Chaos Theory*, where not only does understanding what in the world is going on almost requires having seen the three previous seasons (and ideally five seasons of *Camp Cretaceous*), but any connection to Halloween seems tenuous (dinosaurs = Halloween, I guess?) \n\nWhat is going on with this collection?
