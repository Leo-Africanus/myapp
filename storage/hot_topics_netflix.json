During the first episode, when she's putting together those bath salts and preparing for her guest, I really believed she was hosting them in her home. \n\nThen I found out it was a set when she met Mindy, and suddenly everything felt staged. From every single ingredient being perfectly placed in mason jars to the bacon wrapped in brown paper. a perfectly curated homemade life. (and perhaps this is what she wanted? who knows?)\n\nThe whole vibe is weird, honestly. It's giving major Ballerina Farms energy, like she's trying to be the next big homestead influencer. I wouldn't be surprised if she came out with a cottagecore cookbook next.\n\nLook, I still love her and have always supported her and Harry, but this just feels so forced and It's like watching someone try to build a lifestyle brand instead of sharing their actual lifestyle.",

        "content": "I remember when 'Kinda Pregnant' with Amy Schumer released last month and for like two weeks straight it was showing as #1 on the trending movies and I just, straight up don't believe it. This isn't like some big takedown or the tired trope of \"Amy Schumer is horrible and no one likes women comedians\". Her movies aren't usually my cup of tea but I'm not here to hate. \n\nThis one though, I just cannot believe it was actually number one. Especially with the scene that auto plays when you stay on it too long. It's hard for me to even imagine a demographic that would see that and decide to spend the next hour and a half watching it. Let alone enough to make it #1 for 2 weeks straight. So I guess I'm asking if anyone else feels like they just lie about the numbers to push their newest originals? If they put it as #1 someone might at least give it a try. Or do y'all think I'm just way off base here and imagining things or out of touch. \n\nAgain to reiterate, I have a wide range of movies I'll watch and enjoy, even some of the Netflix original movie slop has its merrit for just turning your mind off and having a little fun. See 'Red Notice'. All this to see I don't just hate the actress or the genre, but still, this looks even worse than their normal original slop. ",

For those that don't know, this is based on an Italian 1963 film of the same name, that more or less follows the story of the Italian uprising, and documents how the rich are able to hold onto their power and position even after large scale upheaval. \n\nThis is definitely worth the watch, and I am surprised that Netflix is just digging out these old films that no one expects them to remake and actually does a really good job of recreating them. While I have been in a slump with netflix at the moment, this is definitely a show that's worth the watch.",
