        "content": "I have the highest tiered plan, which literally allows 6 devices, shared between my parents on one TV, then myself, then my brother. I live a few cities over and my brother had to move to a different state, and we were able to stream no problem, but recently my brother and I can't watch it because it says we are not part of the household...? What's the point of paying for all these devices if we can't even use them? This isn't an issue on any other streaming service. Not being able to watch on more than 2 screens at one time is one thing that I can understand, I guess, but if you're literally paying for a plan that is laid out well to be shared, it's weird that we cannot actually share it. \n\nI'm also doubtful of \"adding an extra slot\", because while that sounds like it would alleviate the problem (unless it's just...another useless device) I refuse to give more money to Netflix and support the greed. Tbh I was willing to add the extra slot, but putting a tier on that too with ads/no-ads is just too far. \n\n\"Just Unsubscribe\" - I despise Netflix, and no longer use it, but my brother and parents still rely on it for streaming so while this isn't really my problem anymore, we won't be unsubscribing because my family is still enjoying it (regardless of me begging them to transition to another service, which we have already). I only know it does not work on my computer because my bro asked me to check what's up with Netflix rn. This doesn't change the fact that Netflix puts out sub-par cash grab originals (while cancelling/removing actually good content) behind the priciest plans, and it's even more frustrating that so many people are so tethered to Netflix that the company will never have a reason to decrease their prices.

She meant William saw the man with the cap and not that he identified Lyle considering both lingaard siblings couldn't have remembered how Lyle Jennings looked like now\n2) Lyle acts extremely stupid when he's with his mom. Is this something to do with being abused? Because it is a little difficult to believe he pulled off all those crimes\n3) they never show the motive behind why Lyle targeted Sam. Was that because he ran in similar circles with Merritt or he just wanted to get back at Sam for punching him. Also, did Lyle pretend to be Sam H to know Merritts whereabouts or was he eventually going to know because he was stalking her.",

        "content": "I cannot believe everyone worships this show. It's horrendous. There are so many plot inconsistencies. The sheer amount of plot armor the characters have is ridiculous. The female characters are so disposable and irrelevant to the story (especially the wives). The screenplay is absolutely terrible, making the characters deliver the most cringe-worthy dialogue ever (I saw the show in Spanish, I'm a native Spanish speaker, and I'm well acquainted with the idiomatic expressions and cultural references used in the show). Scenes that are supposed to be emotionally charged are underwhelming at best. Scenes that are supposed to be shocking have no shock value whatsoever. I wasted 6 hours of my life expecting this show to get better and it never did. I cannot believe they are going to do a second season!\n\nI haven't read the comic this show is supposed to be based on, but I believe it can't be worse than the show itself. \n\nOk, rant over. But I'm so annoyed! The only redeemable thing was the cast. I'm sure most of them did their best to work with what they had. ",
