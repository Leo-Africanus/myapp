        "content": "So I just finished the series, and at first I thought: what the hell did I just watch? At first I was kinda disappointed that it didn\u2019t turn into a cult revelation thing. But then I thought about it, and it has a lot of depth. Maybe I\u2018m overthinking this, but this series shows us how easy it is to make the women the villain, how to frame them and how we do so easily believe it. Looking back, I just ignored the signs of Kiki being just nice without any agenda. The whole time I expected her behaviour to be calculating and cunning. I  jumped to the conclusion that she must be the bad guy as the show wanted us to believe at first. Even her behaviour contradicting this assumption didn\u2019t sway me at first. But now I see the man who manipulates the viewers perspective. I so easily believed Peter when he talked about his alienation from his kids and it being kikis fault. But when she talked about how small the marriage made her and how horrible the kids were to her, it didn\u2019t quite resonate as much. Frightening tbh, particularly because I would go as far as saying I have definitely and massively educated myself about the patriarchy and intersectional feminism. Maybe I\u2019m interpreting too much, but if you look at it from a feminist perspective then it - amongst other things - shows us the sway of men\u2019s opinion\u2019s still and the smear campaign that always hits the women ten times harder. It shows us the dangers of dependency, especially as a woman. So, I kind of liked the show. I liked how it was over the top mostly and also sometimes even a bit satirical while dealing with heavier topics.  Let me know what you think and what your interpretation is",

I\u2019ve also watched movies like My All American, Home Team, and The Long Game, which have a sports theme but are family friendly. It doesn\u2019t *need* to be a sports show though.

It is a bit drawn out, some dialogue and scenes feel unnecessary and 'unreal'- acting didn't make it feel 'real'.\n2. It lacked a sense of urgency, a fear factor. The kind of feeling you get when you\u2019re caught between wanting to witness horror and wanting to escape from it.\n\nIf you haven't watched it, give it a shot. You likely won't be disappointed unless you have Fast &amp; Furious posters in your room.",

And how we feel about the characters in this season?\n\nGet ready for spoilers \n\n1\n\ud83d\udca5\n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n2\n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n\ud83d\udca5 \n3\n\ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\udca5 \n\nTo start off nicely, I want to say I really liked Hunters character in this season and I also liked him with Padma. That\u2019s really all I can say that\u2019s nice because everyone else\u2019s character was pretty much the exact same or got worse.\n\nPaul: I lost all respect in him. I lost it as soon as he walked up angrily to Georgia and slammed his hand on the wall right next to her head. Before then, I could understand where he was coming from. But to act like that is unacceptable. And he didn\u2019t apologize.\n\nGeorgia: I have so many mixed feelings and thoughts on her. Like she\u2019s selfish but yet she isn\u2019t because she cares deeply for people. She definitely thinks she\u2019s all that. Not like she has money, but like you can\u2019t touch her. Like she could do anything and get away with that. Which is what happened. I couldn\u2019t decide if I thought she deserved to go to prison or not. And not even for the last murder because that one I can actually understand and I wouldn\u2019t have blamed her honestly. But for the other two murders. Like three murders in total is a lot to get away with for a person. \n\nGinny: I really grew to not like her. I didn\u2019t like how judgmental she was on her mom. Like yes, I understood where she was coming from for the most part\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have to be so judgmental. Like let\u2019s understand that your mom had a terrible life and this is all she knew how to survive. And she did everything she thought she could to keep her kids safe and with her. And the way Ginny turned Austin against his dad. Like I know her thought process with everything but still she should have thought about how it would affect her little brother. What she had him do is going to stay with him for the rest of his life. And then obviously the way she treated Maxine. The scene between her and Maxine talking at the party in the last episode. I was not OK with how she was looking at Maxine or the way she talked to her. I lost a lot of respect in ginny because of that. I understand in the show Maxine\u2018s attitude is overwhelming, but the way Ginny acted towards her just wasn\u2019t it for me. I also couldn\u2019t stand how rude Abby was to Maxine either. But that was more predictable and not surprising from Abby. I felt really bad for Maxine and all the stuff she was going through and didn\u2019t have her friends to talk to. I know how that is and it sucks.  So yeah boo Ginny and Abby.",

Or explain what the writer might have been thinking??\n\n- Georgia. Why is she helping Paula if the police already know what happened? Why did Kay contact her in the first place? \n\n- So Paula killed Kay just because she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about her daughter? That\u2019s that thread wrapped up? Really?\n\n- The amount of unsafe baby things happening in the show that go completely unmentioned and normalised - infant sleeping in a crib with blankets, mum driving with baby in the front seat (!!!), placing basket bassinet on a ledge and walking away\u2026! What is going on here.\n\n- Did the niece just play along? \n\n- How did Ellen overcome taking all those pills? At this point I was ready for the episode to end o admittedly I was fast forwarding - maybe this is explained and I missed it. \n\n- We\u2019re supposed to believe Ellen just all of a sudden learned/ figured out how to hot wire a car? \n\n- How did the police end up in the library? They didn\u2019t believe Ellen before so why would they now believe it was Paula who took the baby and not Ellen? \n\nI was so excited about this after the first episode so am a bit flabbergasted at how off the rails it got. Would love to hear what everyone else thought \n",

        "content": "So I can speak German and English fluently. However, whenever I opt to dub a show I pick German as it tends to be a lot better.\n\nThe English dubbing usually feels like it's been recorded in a tin can, with 0 intonation.\n\nPart of me wonders whether I'm both more used to German dubbing and German dubbing is more developed because they do a lot.\n\nIn contrast, I feel like English speakers don't usually watch dubbed content. Hence English dubbing has less effort in it?\n\nAlso English dubbing also has such heavvvyyy American accents. Sometimes I wish that if it's a Spanish show they'd dub with Spanish English accents to keep it more authentic?\n\nWhat do people think? I literally can't listen to English dubbing as it's sooooo bad.",
