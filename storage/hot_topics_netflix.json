By the time we agreed on something, I was like, \u201cDude, we basically wasted an entire evening doing nothing.\u201d It was ridiculous.\n\nIn a fit of frustration, I threw together this weird little site: cineswipe[dot]com Think of it like swiping on Tinder, but instead of deciding if you like Becky or Brad, you\u2019re deciding if you\u2019d watch Jaws or some random French indie flick. You swipe left or right on whatever comes up, and hopefully land on something you both can actually get behind before your popcorn goes cold.\n\nI\u2019m not selling anything, it\u2019s just a random idea I had to fix a personal annoyance. Not saying it\u2019s perfect\u2014there\u2019s probably some bizarre movies in there\u2014but it might help break that cycle of \u201cwhat do you wanna watch?\u201d \u201cI dunno, what do YOU wanna watch?\u201d and so on, until the heat death of the universe.\n\nIf anyone tries it and has thoughts, I\u2019m all ears. If not, that\u2019s cool too. Just figured I\u2019d share because it\u2019s 100% better than staring blankly at endless streaming menus. Enjoy or ignore\u2014no biggie.",

I wanna say she was a brunette if that helps.\nHe is insanely popular and rich (possibly royal) invites her to a vacation with his friends. But he rents out a separate place for her to sleep because he was to be able to secretly sneak in at night to stay with her. There was also a scene where she stops by his house to drop off a bag of candy or something and meets his family and realizes he's insanely rich or royal and eats dinner with his family.\nI can't find anything.

        "content": "We watch shows, we either like them or hated them, but either way, we are done with the show and don't want to see the show again. This could be done by setting a \"Hide\" flag attached to the entire show, it would apply to all shows in the series. For example, we watched all of \"Monk\", so we could set the \"Hide\" flag and we'd never see \"Monk\" again in any search, except a search for \"Hidden\" shows. The thumbs up and down would indicate why the show was hidden.\n\nThere are other shows that we start watching and do not like, will never like, and don't watch to be bothered with ever again. Usually, these are Hallmark movies, but could be anything for anybody. We would mark these as thumbs down and Hidden. Then we are never bothered again with the show. Again, if we change our minds, we can go to the \"Hidden Shows\" page and unhide anything we want.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Some people seem to misunderstand. First - this is a completely optional feature, if you don't mark something as \"hidden\", you would never know the feature exists. Second - filtering out \"hidden\" shows is the default, but can be disabled (un-checked) so all shows would appear if you are looking for something that might be hidden.\n\nOn Netflix's side, this is more data to evaluate user preferences. It will also reduce network data by reducing the results of any report, so should be cost savings after implentation.",
