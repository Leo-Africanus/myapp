        "content": "I'm a little late to the party here, as it came out in 2023, but gosh -- what a great premise for a show. It's the first interior design/renovations show I've seen that puts as much thought and care into what will work for their clients, and the solutions they come up with in regards to small/tight spaces are incredible. \n\nAre there things they could do better? Definitely. I didn't enjoy the bits where they'd bully Brooks, for example. We did not have nearly enough Ati, who was such a warm and welcoming joy in every scene she appeared in. And I'd like a little more vetting of the families beforehand (there was one episode in particular that was low-key upsetting to watch tbh). \n\nBut those are growing pains, and shouldn't disqualify the show from a second season. You had episodes like the Dome House, and episode 7 with the kid who was stuck on a murphy bed in the living room, and you see how life changing it is for them to suddenly have their own space. And I loved the first episode, too -- what they did with that basement blew me away. \n\nI've watched a lot of renovation shows in my time (it's a guilt pleasure of mine) but those shows tend to focus more on appealing to audiences rather than the person who'll be living in that space. This one was such a fresh and fun take. \n\nI know Netflix doesn't lurk here, but maybe if more of us watch it, we can catch Netflix's attention and get a second season, lol ",

All those times when people run over you and you tell yourself it is ok, even when you know it is not. You keep going anyway, trying not to look unhinged, trying to survive the feeling. It is painfully relatable.\n\nYour Monster carries strong Beauty and the Beast energy with a love story that wrestles with the inner self. It explores the struggle to overcome the distance between loving who you are inside and facing a world that keeps pushing past your boundaries.\n\nJust gorgeous and completely unhinged in the best possible way.\n\nThey also killed the ending!",

        "content": "I just rewatched Dash &amp; Lily after having a pretty rough week, and I\u2019m kind of emotional about it.\n\nI first watched it when I was 14, and I don\u2019t think I realized at the time how much it shaped my idea of what love should be. That show genuinely formed the way I see romance, as something pure, intentional, and almost\u2026 perfect in its imperfection.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most spectacular or dramatic series ever. It\u2019s not trying to shock you or overwhelm you. It\u2019s just balanced. A little humor, a little sadness, a little awkwardness, a little magic. But somehow it all comes together in a way that feels so safe and warm.\n\nThe whole notebook concept, two people connecting through words before really knowing each other  it just feels so sincere. Like love doesn\u2019t have to start with fireworks or chaos. It can start with understanding. With curiosity. With vulnerability.\n\nAnd the atmosphere?? The Christmas vibe in New York City, the bookstores, the quiet moments, the soundtrack it creates this world that feels softer than real life. Like there\u2019s space to breathe.\n\nWatching it again now, after feeling kind of suffocated by the world lately, it still gives me that same healing feeling. Like maybe out there, somewhere, there really is someone who fits you in that almost poetic way. The right timing. The right dynamic. The \u201cthis makes sense\u201d kind of connection.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t rewatch it sooner. I think I\u2019m going to make it a thing now anytime life feels heavy, I\u2019m putting it on.\n\nIt might not be the most complex show ever made. But to me? It\u2019s perfect. And I kind of owe it for shaping the part of me that still believes love can be something pure.",
