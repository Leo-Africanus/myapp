Between all the different platforms, we keep it low tier just so we can still have access to most stuff.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re chilling on vacation, decide to throw on a movie, and go straight to Netflix \u2014 our usual go-to. And what do we get? A notification saying:\n\u201cYour subscription tier is not available in this region.\u201d\nSo\u2026 basically, we can\u2019t use Netflix at all.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 get this \u2014 it hits us with:\n\u201cYou can change your subscription [here]\u201d with a link to upgrade.\nLike that\u2019s gonna make me go \u201coh yeah sure, let me give Netflix more money just so I can use it on my vacation.\u201d Bro, be serious.\n\nI\u2019ve been paying for Netflix for years. I\u2019m not asking for a free ride \u2014 just some common sense. Would it really kill them to say:\n\u201cThis tier isn\u2019t available in your current region. You have 7 days of access while traveling \u2014 enjoy your vacation!\u201d\nGive me a little grace period. A little respect. I\u2019m not a new user. I\u2019m just out of town for a minute.\n\nSo what now? Am I supposed to pause or cancel my Netflix sub every time I leave the country? Is it even worth paying anymore if I\u2019m gone for part of the month? It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated.\n\nAnd this is why people are done with streaming services. They nickel-and-dime loyal users, and act surprised when people jump ship. It\u2019s like they want to lose us.\n\nNetflix \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 stop punishing your paying customers for traveling. It\u2019s not a good look. Especially when all we wanted to do was watch a damn movie on vacation.",

She has also watched all of Star Gate SG1 and Hallmark movies as well as antique road show on repeat for like a month. She has varied tastes. But her favorite is action. \n\nIf anyone has suggestions for some shows that I can recommend her I'd greatly appreciate it!

        "content": "I'm aware this finished ages ago but just decided to binge-watch this with a friend in one day. I would say this is the epitome of so bad it's good.\n\n* the detective character who is initially shown as a very serious character when introduced, but quickly turns into a goofy ass character who goes on random side quests because the plot demands he does random shit until the final episode.\n* that bully who is the main antagonist. Pretty much a Looney Tunes character\n* a girl that seemed like she would turn into a second antagonist and play a bigger role but hides in a storage room for 3 episodes (the same classroom the other kids are stuck in as well and no one even thinks to open the storage for supplies or something) and then dies unceremoniously\n* every episode there is **at least** 2 or 3 things that happens in the plot or the characters' actions that will absolutely blow your mind on how every character is a glue sniffer. It's a mystery how any of these characters even survived past childhood without getting run over in traffic or something. There's a scene where the students try to [sneak behind a zombie facing the window](https://youtu.be/EJzu9sCR-Ys?t=250). Of course one character decides to hold onto a pink steel flask when he's literally wearing a bag pack.\n* unintentionally funny scenes like the last episode when the half-zombie girl decides to jump off the building like some superhero. Or when the main character jumps out the window and you see a zoomed out shot of the character doing an inhuman acrobatic movie via cgi.\n* Pointless sideplots, pointless deaths, pointless characters that seemed like the show is setting up something but nothing happens.\n* Least on the nose political themes with the assembly woman character\n\nrecommend watching this while high. I'm also interested in what mind state the writers and showrunners were in while they produced this",

        "content": "I'll preface with saying it's not an internet issue as I have gig speed and not other service has this problem. But I've noticed it in quite a few shows. Sometimes the shows will start again when you exit out and play, but most of the time they just play a few more minutes and then freeze again. Sometimes they just won't play at all after they freeze. I've noticed it on Devil May Cry, the New Witcher Animated movie, Next Gen, and a few other animated movies/shows. And it's seemingly happening more frequently. Only switching the audio out of atmos fixes the problem. I do have a 7.1.4 set up, so idk if that's effects it at all either.",

        "content": "I have a memory of my father watching a show years ago where this group of young adults/teens are like figuring out some town\u2019s conspiracy (or at least that\u2019s what it seemed like) while being chased down. The scene I remember most is 3 (i think it was 2 guys and a girl) of them hiding in a house while these bad guys start surrounding it. I think they might\u2019ve gotten shot at, and it also might\u2019ve been more of a log cabin than a house. It also belonged to one of their family members iirc. I assumed it was on netflix because that\u2019s all we\u2019ve had apart from a fire stick and its what my parents usually use, but there\u2019s always a possibility I could be searching in the wrong place.\n\nAny guesses?",

        "content": "I have the highest tiered plan, which literally allows 6 devices, shared between my parents on one TV, then myself, then my brother. I live a few cities over and my brother had to move to a different state, and we were able to stream no problem, but recently my brother and I can't watch it because it says we are not part of the household...? What's the point of paying for all these devices if we can't even use them? This isn't an issue on any other streaming service. Not being able to watch on more than 2 screens at one time is one thing that I can understand, I guess, but if you're literally paying for a plan that is laid out well to be shared, it's weird that we cannot actually share it. \n\nI'm also doubtful of \"adding an extra slot\", because while that sounds like it would alleviate the problem (unless it's just...another useless device) I refuse to give more money to Netflix and support the greed. Tbh I was willing to add the extra slot, but putting a tier on that too with ads/no-ads is just too far. \n\n\"Just Unsubscribe\" - I despise Netflix, and no longer use it, but my brother and parents still rely on it for streaming so while this isn't really my problem anymore, we won't be unsubscribing because my family is still enjoying it (regardless of me begging them to transition to another service, which we have already). I only know it does not work on my computer because my bro asked me to check what's up with Netflix rn. This doesn't change the fact that Netflix puts out sub-par cash grab originals (while cancelling/removing actually good content) behind the priciest plans, and it's even more frustrating that so many people are so tethered to Netflix that the company will never have a reason to decrease their prices.
