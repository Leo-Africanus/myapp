        "content": "\nOne common point of contention among both critics and viewers of the new season of Wednesday is Netflix's decision to split the release into two parts. As the first four episodes set up a satisfying new mystery, many feel the mid-season cutoff is abrupt and disrupts the show's momentum, leaving viewers with an \"unsatisfying appetizer\" rather than a complete meal. \n\n\"Fans will have to wait until Wednesday, Sept. 3, for Wednesday Season 2, Part 2 \u2013 which will conclude with episodes four through eight.\"\n\nWith so many taking it to the Internet streets; Is the uproar warranted? Or are we just spoiled brats moonlighting as binge divas?",

I'm tired of them pumping out series like candy, some of which in my opinion are really good, only for them to eventually get cancelled often times after just one or two seasons.\n\nIt's annoying. It's a disservice to subscribers. And frankly, I've been reading books of any series I find online now instead anyways because I've been so conditioned to just assume anything I like will eventually get cancelled anyways. \n\nAnd honestly? The books have been offering me a much better experience overall. I feel better, even if I spend all day reading a book or two, than I would've had I spent it binging a show. I also have the added confidence knowing that I'll be able to finish the series without getting pissed off after wasting so much time watching it only to find out it's cancelled later.\n\nSo yeah... books for the win! Depending on how into books I go I may honestly just get rid of my Netflix subscription altogether.",

This confuses me: how can the algorithm have changed completely in just half a day?\n\nAnyways, I logged into the account, changed the password, logged off from all devices. I enabled PIN verification for all profiles and verified email and phone number. What more can I do to ensure that these people can no longer access our account? Or should we delete the account altogether for safety and create another one with a different email adress?\n\n  \nThank you for your help! Any advice is appreciated.",

        "content": "I just finished watching Mo on Netflix. I had never seen this show before or heard of him.\n\nHe reminds me of several other comedians/actors/characters. At least his character on the show does.\n\nParticularly his comedic timing, phrasing and the way he talks/sound of his voice. But also the qualities of his character on the show.\n\nSort of a blend of: Seth Rogan; Brett Gelman; Robb Wells; Jeff Garlin; Mike Mitchell\n\nand a tiny bit of Larry David. I think because of the repeated horrible situations he gets himself into.",

        "content": "So, I\u2019m watching Netflix and on every show, it will not play the credits. And I\u2019m one of the few people who likes credits, they have nice music. You know that tiny screen it turns into when the credits play and asks if you wanna skip to the next episode? Doesn\u2019t play the credits. Highlighting that window just plays the episode over.\n\nThe Netflix is hooked up to the Sky Box, and the Sky Box has two other slave boxes connected to it. When you play Netflix on those TVs, the credits play. It\u2019s just the main box that doesn\u2019t play them. I was at one point told to turn the Sky Box off and on again to reset it, I even did a hard reset where I cut the power, and rebooted it, but nothing. No change. \n\nCan you help me fix it? Wednesday just started, and I like clicking my fingers at the end\u2026",
