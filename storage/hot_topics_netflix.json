        "content": "I just have to get this off my chest, even at the risk of getting massively downvoted, this character is so poorly written. She changes her mind ten times in a single episode and is excessively annoying. The story itself is dull and weak overall with no character developments, but I could live with that if it weren\u2019t for ***this*** one character being forcefully inserted into every situation. It made sense in Season 1 since the story revolved around her, but in Season 2? Even FBI agents are unaware of Night Action, yet somehow, this civilian is deeply involved in everything??seriously? If the writers were so intent on keeping her relevant, why not just hire her as a tech? Instead, they throw a civilian into the field like it\u2019s nothing. To top it all off, the actor really cannot act. It was really difficult to finish season 2. I am not even getting to the other issues like poor writting, countlessly irritating character arcs.. S1 was not the greatest but it felt like this had some promise going forward and boy, oh boy, was I wrong.",

I am only one episode in, but I thought this would be an interesting place to discuss the series.\n\nEdit: I have finished the series and I can say I went through pretty much every emotion while watching this-mostly anger and sadness. Gabby was such a beautiful soul. Feels like we all know someone like her.\n\n It's truly a shame so many people find themselves stuck in relationships with manipulative abusers. It was like Gabby couldn't wrap her mind around leaving him. Even in her final text message, she tells her mom that they aren't breaking up. It's almost like some people feel like if they break up with their partner, they consider *themselves* a failure. Just a really sad and devastating story. Watching the vlog outtakes of them made me so uncomfortable. It makes you think about how the internet is truly a facade.",

        "content": "I just finished watching the Netflix series about this and omg how sad and shocking. These documentaries really put me off relationships these days and make me so skeptical about how people truly are and just what we see online. \n\nIt\u2019s very true that sometimes the people that seem the happiest online are often the saddest sometimes and with the most skeletons. I personally know many couples who would constantly post how in love they are and suddenly the very next day decide to divorce. And others who never post about one another but live a very happy and quiet life.\n\nAnyway this whole case was so sad and she seemed like such a bright and bubbly girl. One thing though, I need the caveat before I say it is that I\u2019m not blaming her parents but just I know if it were me in that situation and I had said those things to my parents about him they absolutely would expect me to come back to them and would not be happy about me continuing. I know everyone has different parenting styles but me coming from an Asian family - they wouldn\u2019t be ok with some of the things the parents already knew.\n\nThat guy seemed really creepy but it\u2019s the kind of creepy that isn\u2019t obvious which makes it more scary and I do wonder just how involved their parents were. None of this matters anymore I guess, sadly she\u2019s dead and I just hope everyone (men and women) are all careful of the kind of people they get involved with. It\u2019s a scary world out there and relationships don\u2019t seem to be what they were. Not saying everyone is a killer, just that\u2026. I think it\u2019s really hard these days ",

        "content": "I am 1.2 episodes in and I hate this show already. It\u2019s got nice camera work and acting but that\u2019s it, so far the plot has refused to grab my attention and the male characters are all so rapey. I hate it. Which is a shame because I love period pieces and thought perhaps I could stomach the more mature themes but just an hour or so in and I can tell it\u2019ll be one of those shows that romanticizes women\u2019s pain. I googled some reviews before deciding not to continue watching, and apparently it\u2019s like this the whole show so it\u2019s an absolute no from me. \n\nI\u2019m down for any better recommendations if you can spare some please and thank you\ud83d\udc97\n\n\nEdit: Thank you to all of you with your amazing recommendations!! And thank you for understanding my struggle to continue with watching Outlander without dismissing my experience. \ud83d\udc97\n\nBut just as remind for a few trickling comments: \n\nIt\u2019s not that I cannot stomach such scenes, it\u2019s the way in which this show goes about those scenes that is of my dissatisfaction. \n\nI understand a writers need to include \u201crealism\u201d into a story. However SA isn\u2019t like a lighthearted comedy that you can throw in for fun, it\u2019s something that writers should add in with purpose. So far I don\u2019t get the feeling that this writer does that often. SA is something that startles the viewer and immediately grabs their attention. Adding it in for realism\u2019s sake, in my own personal opinion, is a waste and distasteful. \n\nEven though I could be wrong, and if I stick it out maybe the rest of the show might make up for how often it illustrates that kind of pain to it\u2019s audience, I\u2019m just over scenes like that in general. I get it, you get it, we all get it. We all know it happens. From a woman\u2019s perspective it\u2019s exhausting to see SA as a commonplace troupe in shows all the time, period pieces or not. I\u2019d at the very least love it if they were significant to the plot, as well as less graphic. \n\nI understand that I may come off as sensitive, but I\u2019d rather that than be desensitized to seeing this kind of stuff on the big screen time after time again. It just gets to a point. ",

($2.50/month = $30/year, $60/year pre-tax! And since I plan to be alive awhile, that could be $1200 over the next 20 years. (Plan photo attached.)\n\n*I digress.* \n\nThere are actually **two** Standard plans, one with ads, one without. (Both 1080, both HD, both stream to 3+ devices at once.) When I called to discuss plans with Netflix, I got a lengthy response that the Standard plan without ads (at $7.99 month, which is more than *half the cost* of the Upgraded Standard) \"has limited availability of movies and shows\", although still full HD. When I asked where the list might be of limited movies and shows so I could decide...Netflix told me they just don't have one. So how do I find out I ask..?  Agent told me to switch to the new plan and then I need to look for a \"lock\" symbol on various movies and shows, those won't be available. Really? In 2025, with all the technology we have, including AI, this is how to compare plans?\n\nAny insight?",

        "content": "In your opinion, what is the best kdrama to stream on Netflix today? I'm currently watching Marry You and When the Stars Gossip and they're both okay. I like WTSG better though. The story is quite interesting than what I normally watch. It's refreshing to see Lee Min Ho playing a character that is very different from his usual rich or powerful guy roles. He is kinda an underdog here. Shows a little bit of his range as a actor. ",
