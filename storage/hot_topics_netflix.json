Like there are times where it doesn't even sound like it's playing in Atmos, even though I know it is cuz a badge on my TV pops up saying so. Is this normal? If not, what's going on? \n\nI reached out to customer service and they weren't able to help me. Can someone in this group help me PLEASE???? I've been having this issue for YEARS! ",

It explores the struggle to overcome the distance between loving who you are inside and facing a world that keeps pushing past your boundaries.\n\nJust gorgeous and completely unhinged in the best possible way.\n\nThey also killed the ending!",

It's the first interior design/renovations show I've seen that puts as much thought and care into what will work for their clients, and the solutions they come up with in regards to small/tight spaces are incredible. \n\nAre there things they could do better? Definitely. I didn't enjoy the bits where they'd bully Brooks, for example. We did not have nearly enough Ati, who was such a warm and welcoming joy in every scene she appeared in. And I'd like a little more vetting of the families beforehand (there was one episode in particular that was low-key upsetting to watch tbh). \n\nBut those are growing pains, and shouldn't disqualify the show from a second season. You had episodes like the Dome House, and episode 7 with the kid who was stuck on a murphy bed in the living room, and you see how life changing it is for them to suddenly have their own space. And I loved the first episode, too -- what they did with that basement blew me away. \n\nI've watched a lot of renovation shows in my time (it's a guilt pleasure of mine) but those shows tend to focus more on appealing to audiences rather than the person who'll be living in that space. This one was such a fresh and fun take. \n\nI know Netflix doesn't lurk here, but maybe if more of us watch it, we can catch Netflix's attention and get a second season, lol ",

        "content": "I saw the trailer for a show last night on Netflix. The categorie was \"cops\" or some thing similar. I believe it was 6-8 episodes. Wanted to watch it today but can not find it. The description was something about the robbers and the cops following them. It was not a documentary. Does anyone know what it is? I wish I wrote it down. Not sure when It came out",

The whole case and how it played out was done brilliantly as well as integrating the side cases with Lorna.
