Having his wife appear from inside - it\u2019s like they\u2019re doing everything they can to throw him off his game. This is incredibly anxiety inducing as it is, and it\u2019s like the production team have instructed certain behaviours to make it borderline unbearable. It just feels so performative which is not what his climbs are usually about. \n\nI get it\u2019s fun for the show, and looks cool, but the guy is climbing a skyscraper ffs. \nHe\u2019s doing enough to get you your views, please just let us watch him climb and PLEASE LET US HEAR HIM. I\u2019m so sick of the constant yapping from the panellists; it\u2019s like they\u2019ve been told not to come up for air. Stop doing weird commentary and playing these videos when he\u2019s talking, we want to hear his thoughts, his process, his funny quips. \n\nFeels really irresponsible of Netflix to allow this tbh; like the marvellousness of a free solo climb is just being made a mockery of tbh and this is a real person up there. A huge disservice to climbing, and to Alex. Props to him for absolutely giving the crowd what they\u2019re after though. Couldn\u2019t be me! \n",

Nothing is ever explained properly and we\u2019re expected to take whatever we see and roll with it. It\u2019s unfortunate because the plot could\u2019ve been more refined.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the tooth tree and the opening in the ground Alex and Petal found? And the growling sounds? Never explained. How did Amber fall off a cliff and reappear so close to the party site after Mia ran to get help (I thought it was going to be a clone thing). Never explained.\n\nLuke wasn\u2019t a character we needed, Mia is not the hero we all want and I\u2019ll be assuming the relationship Dev and Mia had before Amber messed with them was the reason they got together even though they never explicitly told us if Dev and the others got their memories back. (Given that Midge had to make Mia remember and none of them remembered the funeral)\n\nLuka and Mia did NOT need to kiss, stupid plot point. The doll house also had almost no significance. She went to \u201cface her past\u201d and did nothing but get tricked. That could\u2019ve happened anywhere. They also didn\u2019t explain why Jenna and Luka had those not seemingly random headaches after they got injected with the drug?\n\nHarry\u2019s disappearance was never properly explained. I thought only dead people appeared as those black figures and I thought he was dead all along. Why do Sam and Midge have physical forms? Why did the ghosts mark Luka?\n\nAmber was the only interesting thing about this whole fiesta and her existence isn\u2019t even properly explained, I kept going thinking the ending would at least be satisfying but it wasn\u2019t. I wish Amber disappeared, I wish the ending didn\u2019t try to infer Midge was living as Mia. I would\u2019ve taken that. Blood sisters my arse.\n\nThere might be more but these are the ones that really stuck with me, I went from curious to pissed off really fast.",

It is their business.. how can they be so careless?\n\nThe UI is so stripped down that it is impossible to get show information without finessing it. A sentence or two description which usually isn't helpful and no ratings or reviews. \n\nThey want you to just click on thru from their suggested row without knowing anything and the one thing they have to do is start from the beginning. It really bothers me that such a huge company with ever increasing fees refuses to update the UI or fix major bugs. \n\nOther streamers have figured it out, why not Netflix?

The poster for the show with the flames in the back and the red coloring looks epic, but none of the scenes in the show actually look like that. It's just realistic scenery and outfits/hairstyles don't represent anything about the characters.\n\nThe show obviously is about the character and their relationships with each other and not about what is the parallel universe and it's mythology, but it's too much to the point where after months of being in New Ham, Kelly mentions the bus driver in the final episode and doesn't even address the fact that there are more of them and they're the ones who dropped them off in New Ham.\n\nIt just makes the characters really stupid.

Due to weather conditions, the live event is postponed, and will now stream on Saturday, January 24 at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT.\"*\n\n\\--\n\nEDIT to add:\n\nThe weather forecast in Taipei for today is 15 - 20c, 80% chance of rain. Maybe this is why the date is shown as one day later. But I haven't seen any official announcements that they're postponing it.  \n\\---\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI'm in the West coast and it's 4:19pm PT, Jan 23 Friday.\n\nI thought it starts Friday 5pm PT, but why does my Netflix says Skyscraper Live is t**omorrow 5pm PT**?\n\nI can't paste a screenshot but wonder if others see the same?",

I always have to play the content and then drag my finger to the beginning of the seek timer on the buttom. Other services like Plex and Amazon prime video have a play from the beginning button. Is there some sort of patent that Netflix is not allowed to use as I feel like this is a pretty common UI feature amongst streaming platforms?",

        "title": "SS: Single Salma",
        "content": "Let me start with a disclaimer,\n\nI love Huma Qureshi.\n\nShe is bold. She is beautiful.\n\nEver since I first saw her next to Madhuri in ***Dairh Ishqiya***, I was enamored by her sensuous charms.\n\nUntil I saw Single Salma.\n\nS ... \\*hit\n\nS ... Show\n\n81 minutes of utter and complete brain rot!\n\nI finished the movie and haven't left my spot since. My grey matter loss is so huge that my capacity for functioning seems compromised. No movie has ever done this to me before.\n\nI can see that at some stage, probably during the ideation phase, Single Salma intended to be an unconventional feminist movie. It had the right elements. But somehow along the way the writers switched their dealer perhaps, and then all those promising elements went up in flames of a dumpster fire. The film ended up losing the plot to a point that the feminist in me was left staring at this Huma Qureshi shaped train wreck moving in slow motion. Agonizing.\n\nYou see, the thing is it's infuriating to watch a supposedly feminist movie that mock the entire concept of feminism this remorselessly. Designed for an predominantly South Asian audience, the film uses infidelity, cheating, undressing in public as vehicles of a feminist narrative. I mean isn't this EXACTLY what \"***babban's***\" (the bleach head villian of the movie) of this world imply and insinuate as the only implication of women empowerment!\n\nThe film opens with a promise of connecting the dots between Salma - Sikandar's beloved from the past - and Sikandar's present day success. And the only triumph they ended up communicating is that Salma left the alter. Sikandar's success was in effect born out of his thankless, cheating bride running away for a modeling gig.\n\nEven if you never paid to watch this movie, it is still super costly because you'll be paying with a fried brain. Learn from my mistake. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nVerdict: Indian Judiciary should consider adding this to the jail time of inmates as their penal labour.",

Then he gets a happy life with a young hottie, and no consequences? Are we just ok with this? Not to mention, the ex wife doesn\u2019t get invited on any of the friend trips and really gets the short end of the stick. I know the ending isn\u2019t as great for him but there still aren\u2019t any real consequences for his choices. It\u2019s like moral of the story is just leave your boring old wife for something younger and you\u2019ll finally get everything you want? ",
