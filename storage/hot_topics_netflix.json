Her absolute favorite was Bly Manor. We also watched Wednesday, she loves this show. In the end, she also liked Beef, but thought it was a bit too crass at times.\n\nNot Netflix but she also liked 9 Perfect Strangers on Hulu.\n\nBasically I'm looking for quirky shows that are sort of sentimental and ultimately wholesome, maybe bittersweet dramas with real meaning to them, but aren't too sexual, violent, or vulgar? and very much character-focused.\n\nShe doesn't mind anything related to relationships or kissing or LGBT content or anything like that, romance is fine, just when anything sexually explicit is shown on a regular basis.",

I was told that my subscription is intended for use at my home location and that I can\u2019t use it while traveling.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that I\u2019m on a plan with a 4-device limit and I stay within it. I\u2019m not sharing my account with anyone outside my household \u2014 I\u2019m just logging in from a different location while traveling.\n\nIt feels like Netflix has shifted from enforcing device limits to enforcing location, which is a big change in how the service works, especially for people who travel often. Streaming on a phone or laptop seems to work, but devices like Roku or Apple TV are where the problems show up.\n\nThe policy itself was disappointing, but what really pushed me to cancel was how little concern there was about losing a long-time customer. The response was essentially \u201cthat\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nIf you travel often and rely on streaming devices, this is something to be aware of.",

Tonight it did the same thing again.  Right in the middle of a show, the audio dropped down real far and got tinny.  Then after 30 seconds, it went back up to normal.  Apparently it's not limited to the Fire Stick...\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?  I don't think it's my equipment since it's just the stick into the TV and the audio to my tuner.
