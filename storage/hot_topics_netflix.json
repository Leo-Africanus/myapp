Especially the mother. Blaming Shannan for everything. With Gabby, Brian\u2019s mom is also narcissistic. In the same aspect as Brian. Both sons were narcissistic same as their mothers. \n\nThe body cams/story. In both body cams both Brian and Chris have that same smiley expression. They also both blamed the other party on wrong doing. Brian convinced the cops that Gabby was also being the aggressor. With Chris during the start he blamed Shannan stating they were fighting and she could of left with the kids. Also made the story convincing by her \"leaving the ring behind.\" During the interrogation Chris also claimed Shannan was choking one of the daughters and that's what \"made him\" kill Shannan.\n\nI just wanted to state this information because I started noticing the similarities when I saw the Brian body cam happened on August 12 2021. Chris murdered his family August 13 2018. \n\nIf there is anything else that is worth sharing please comment below! I'm sure there is a lot more similarities than my findings! ",

It made sense in Season 1 since the story revolved around her, but in Season 2? Even FBI agents are unaware of Night Action, yet somehow, this civilian is deeply involved in everything??seriously? If the writers were so intent on keeping her relevant, why not just hire her as a tech? Instead, they throw a civilian into the field like it\u2019s nothing. To top it all off, the actor really cannot act. It was really difficult to finish season 2. I am not even getting to the other issues like poor writting, countlessly irritating character arcs.. S1 was not the greatest but it felt like this had some promise going forward and boy, oh boy, was I wrong.",

Seeing victims document much of their lives in 4k adds a whole other heartbreaking element to these kinds of series and stories. I am only one episode in, but I thought this would be an interesting place to discuss the series.\n\nEdit: I have finished the series and I can say I went through pretty much every emotion while watching this-mostly anger and sadness. Gabby was such a beautiful soul. Feels like we all know someone like her.\n\n It's truly a shame so many people find themselves stuck in relationships with manipulative abusers. It was like Gabby couldn't wrap her mind around leaving him. Even in her final text message, she tells her mom that they aren't breaking up. It's almost like some people feel like if they break up with their partner, they consider *themselves* a failure. Just a really sad and devastating story. Watching the vlog outtakes of them made me so uncomfortable. It makes you think about how the internet is truly a facade.",
