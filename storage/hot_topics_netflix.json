This has been a complaint for a long time and I can\u2019t fathom why Netflix isn\u2019t listening?? The viewers aren\u2019t excited about new show due to the fear of having them cancelled.

I cancelled my Netflix at 630am, by 930 I somehow had upgraded. The funny thing is the cancelation was put in during the weekday when everyone was at either school or work. Netflix of course had no answer for me other than I made the mistake. I suggest anyone trying to cancel, call the customer service number and have them delete your payment method. ",

If people aren't watching shows under a certain amount of seasons, won't that lead to more cancelations? Kind of a Catch 22? \n\nShould Netflix have more Limited series where the story is complete on its own and there's an option to add another? (Dept. Q. for example)\n\nI'm not changing my criteria.

        "content": "Disclaimer - I don't expect 100% realism in fiction. That's what documentaries are supposed to be for. I'm also a big sci-fi fan, so I can enjoy watching fantastical and implausible scenarios.\n\nBut I just don't see the point of setting a TV show in a real-world setting if you are going to completely distort that setting. That just makes it annoying, not fun.\n\nThis brings me to Hostage, the new political thriller about a British Prime Minister's husband being kidnapped, starring Suranne Jones and Julie Delpy. The sheer number of inaccuracies in the show are too numerous to point out (Oldham FC, anyone?). Mostly, they are the result of sloppy shortcuts in the writing.\n\nSo I'll just focus on the big one. The premise itself is simply not viable. There's absolutely no point in a kidnapper demanding that a British PM resign, because they can resign and then be reinstated almost immediately after the victim is released. Even if the kidnapper insisted on them resigning as a Member of Parliament, this presents only a minor technical hurdle to them being re-appointed.\n\nI can forgive shows taking liberties with reality if they're getting to the heart of an emotional issue. But this show doesn't do that because the whole family vs country dilemma doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Yet again I despair at the TV industry spending millions of pounds bringing together a huge agglomeration for talent for something that doesn't make the slightest sense.",

Called today and they said, NOT ONLY do I have to wait for the next billing cycle (3 weeks) to upgrade it, but they have to completely delete her account and terminate all the data to then add her back without ads...\n\nFirst, I've never heard of a company making it impossible to upgrade a service mid-billing cycle. Seems to just be bad business. But also that we have to delete her data? They already deleted all my add'l a year ago, which happened to millions, and then blamed it on me.

        "content": "I don\u2019t really understand how the contract works, does the tv show/movie receive money every few months and then Netflix decides if it\u2019s worth paying? Also surely it\u2019s best to keep as many popular shows as you can on rather than only have Netflix originals because it means that the site will have the most famous movies which, as a collective, will be the most searched for and that will make Netflix seem like it has more media than it does. Why not let go of random films no one watches instead?",

        "content": "I wish there was a way to filter My List by duration, for two use cases:\n\n1) Find the longest movie from my list that fit within the remaining time (i.e. from now until bedtime). \n\n2) Find a new series based on duration... On TV nights, we binge \"regular\" hour-long shows (or movie) until close to bedtime than maybe switch to a shorter half-hour show if time allows... Finding a good 22-30 minutes show in My List or the whole catalog is sometimes a lot of clicks!\n\nIs it a good request? Any tip?",
