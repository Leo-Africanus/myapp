It's the sort of thing someone with schizophrenia might say.\n\nAnyway I was just surprised not to see a single mini article mention it, or to see anyone mention it in the breakdown threads after her win.

Honestly all i\u2019ve heard about this show is that it\u2019s like ,,The summer i turned pretty\u2019\u2019 but from Netflix (I haven\u2019t seen that other show, just saw clips and edits and decided it\u2019s not for me). Also i mainly don\u2019t watch teen shows anymore but sometimes i\u2019d check something out from Netflix. Those who\u2019ve seen this show, is it good enough to spend your time on watching or is it really like that other teen show from Amazon Prime ? So far the only reason i\u2019ve been planning to check it out is because one of the main actresses was in Suits and i loved her in there. But other than that I don\u2019t want to watch it if it\u2019s just some cheesy drama with teen romance. ",
