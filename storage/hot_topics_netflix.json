The girl from Stranger things is a married woman with a child and still playing a teenager in the show. It's been on for over 10 years. WTF? It's become a meme at this point. There's no way the higher ups at Netflix aren't hearing the jokes. They're not course correcting or trying to give us more consistency. By the time any new season of anything comes out, I've forgotten what's already happened. I think they just straight up don't give a shit about their customer base. ",

        "content": "ey everyone,\n\nMy cousin recommended this show to me, saying it was on par with *Mare of Easttown*. I binged all 6 episodes, and... wow, what a frustrating mess. I had to come here to see if I'm the only one who felt this way.\n\nThe concept is solid gold: a detective has to team up with his estranged mother, a famous serial killer known as \"The Mantis,\" to catch her copycat. It's got that classic *Silence of the Lambs* vibe, and I was completely on board.\n\nBut the execution is just painfully slow. It feels more like a boring soap opera than a thriller, with characters just talking endlessly while nothing happens. The plot is full of holes you could drive a truck through\u2014the copycat's motivation makes zero sense, and there are entire subplots with red herring characters that are completely pointless and could be erased from the show entirely.\n\nI was so baffled by the writing that I wrote up a full, no-holds-barred review on my blog, **Freddy's Cine IT**. If you're interested in my full takedown, you can check it out.\n\nAlso, if you've seen it and were as confused as I was, the post has a **complete episode-by-episode explanation** to try and make sense of the convoluted plot. I'll drop the link in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else felt this way or if you actually enjoyed it!",

I reposted the link and said \"here is a good review of history\".\n\nThe video got flagged by their AI bots and said I violated the \"Hate speech\" rule. I LITERALLY did not do that.\n\nI then appealed the decision and they rejected my appeal and removed the post and I got a Community violation mark.  However, I was also given the option to do a \"training\" to get said mark removed. SO I said OK.. I will do your training and proceeded to answer the questions. However, I got to one question about gangs.    I answered the question correctly but the system said I didn't. I had selected the 3rd answer and it said it was WRONG and that the correct answer was 3... the answer I literally selected. It would not let me move on. I even tried to redo the training but got hung uup on the same question.\n\nI tried to select another answer 4 (which was a wrong answer) and it said that was the wrong answer BUT that answer 4 was correct.. WTF?  I Have screen shots of all of this.\n\nI provided FEEDBACK but doubt if anyone will get back with me.\n\nThe TRAINING is designed to fail apparently so you can't remove the mark against your channel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot3dt2y4jxpf1.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94ed4437efe19c5d18f62efc9909994fc67f5af6",

I'm a rabid SoA fan, and CH fan. \n\nI'm also a huge fan of the movie and watch it a few times a year. I did not have my hopes up for this but if it's half as good as the trailer, I can't wait. Come on October 2! ",

        "content": "When I watch Netflix and I pause the movie/show im watching long enough for my monitors to turn off (I have 3 monitors) one of my monitors (an LG if it matters) will start to \"reboot\" over and over.  It doesn't matter what monitor I'm watching Netflix on, as soon as I resume the show Im watching the LG monitor will start \"rebooting\".  It will go black for a few seconds and then come back on and randomly within 5 to 30 seconds it will reboot again over and over until I log out of my account and log back in (I don't have to reboot, I just have to logout and log back in).  Does anyone have any idea/fixes for this?  I've tried reinstalling drivers several times and it makes no difference.  I've tried changing ports on the video card to see if this makes a differences and it doesn't.  It's always the LG monitor that this happens to.",

And yes, not a total idiot, I did check the default language on all profiles was English. \n\nNetflix tried to tell me the problem was only with Korean movies I watched.  \n\nBut, the problem occurs between two episodes of the same English show (the new episode is in Spanish!), and with multiple native English shows.
