His facial expressions alone are so telling. He definitely pulled off the suave sociopathic part hands down. \n\nNow Claire Danes was something else. I kept wishing she would have reined her face in at least 50%. It was just too much. Too much quivering. Too much warbling. Get it together woman. \n\nBrittany Snow is in everything these days. \n\nThis was one of the best Netflix original series in awhile. They\u2019ve been pumping out a lot of junk lately. I was genuinely excited to hit play on the next episode and see how this all ended up. ",

If he needed to be on meds and he wasn\u2019t on them, especially with so much childhood trauma, I could see him cracking. And from what I understand, physical oceanography and the study of currents is not \u201cjunk science\u201d and has led to many rescues and sunken boats for a long time now.
