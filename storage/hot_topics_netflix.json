I felt like there was this big build up that ultimately just was him going to jail with no resolution really. Also, in the beginning when the woman falls off the cliff, the police were back and forth about if she was already dead before she fell or not but we could clearly see she was dead. She also had some animal tear up her knee after she had been shot. When they finally showed the chain of events, it showed her getting shot, but no animals attacking her. It only showed her \u201cjump\u201d off the cliff. So, she wasn\u2019t dead? She committed suicide? Another thing, they made it seem like the man that was showing up to see the girl was this creepy ominous guy who she trusted. The way they showed him opening her bedroom window made it seem like he was going to hurt her. Idk, this show felt like the audience was being lead in different directions with no real \u201cah ha moment\u201d or pay off. oh and, the whole drug ring side plot was incredibly unnecessary in my opinion too.

Also, my internet wifi is a steady 400mbps+ and Netflix is the only app that does this, so it\u2019s not an internet problem. Anyone have any advice or tips to try to solve this problem?",

Is it because the mystery was just focused to enola and Sherlock to solve? Haha maybe that was the answer but I just could help thinking for them to have more screentime, especially as a one family. Even Sherlock did not see his own mother in that movie. Maybe in Enola holmes 3. And even Mycroft! Knowing the actor struggled in schedule that is why he is not in the movie.",
