Remove it or allow users to at least hide it. I'm considering just dropping netflix entirely at this point the way they've been going recently.

Last week I went to, cough, streaming site, to watch cocaine bear because it was grainy on Netflix.\n\n  \nChecked the bitrate quality - streaming Superstore its 1920x1080, streaming Cocaine bear it's 960x540.\n\nAnyone know why? Is this is a buffering thing? I can't watch movies on Netflix because of this. Pls help!",
