A cliffhanger\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to satisfy; it\u2019s to provoke. It\u2019s meant to leave you unsettled, questioning, and desperate for what comes next. If you\u2019re angry or frustrated, it\u2019s because you\u2019re invested.\n\nBinge-watching culture is the real culprit behind your disappointment. When you consume an entire season in a single day, you\u2019re not allowing the story to breathe. The anticipation, the buildup, and the time to process each episode are lost. Without that, of course, you\u2019re going to feel dissatisfied when you don\u2019t get an immediate conclusion. Stories aren\u2019t always meant to be devoured all at once\u2014they\u2019re crafted to unfold over time, and the impact is diminished when you rush through it. \n\nI give the season a 9/10. I was thoroughly entertained. I'm glad it didn't follow the same notes of season 1. The story is progressing naturally and the last episode was effective. ",

Imagine Gi-hun discovering that the Front Man was the detective\u2019s brother\u2014and instead of immediately trying to blow up the system, he played along in the games to dig deeper.\n\nPicture Gi-hun maneuvering through the games with this knowledge, inching closer to exposing the truth.

        "content": "I just finished Squid Game season 2 and I really do not understand what is happening at Netflix.\n\nSince 2023, they produced completely terrible seasons of shows that destroyed every single time the subreddits of each of those shows. I\u2019m thinking of : \n\n- Squid Game season 2\n- Outer Banks season 4\n- You season 4\n- The Witcher season 3\n- The Umbrella Academy season 4\n- Sex Education season 4\n- Disenchantment part 5 \n- Virgin River season 6 \n\nDoes someone have an explanation for all of those messes ? Should we be scared for Stranger Things season 5 ?  ",
