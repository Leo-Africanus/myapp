Had a bit of a giggle about it with my boy, and we watched Netflix as usual.\n\nOnce finished watching, I took a look at the \"Manage access and devices\" page on the web version of Netflix and noticed that the only devices which were showing on the list were the browser based access from my phone, and then desktop PC.  None of the other devices I know are used to access Netflix, including: iOS (iPad &amp; iPhone), xBox (my Son's xBox both at my house and his Mum's) or my LG TV.\n\nAs a bit of a test to see if i could force any of these devices to show in the list, I changed my password &amp; forced a logout.  Not only did the LG TV get logged out, the only device which were forced to input the new password was the browser based devices.\n\nCouple of questions:\n\nDo any of you have an idea as to why the device list is incomplete?\n\nHow quickly, following a password change will a user be logged out of the account?\n\nCheers!!",
