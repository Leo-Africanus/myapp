        "content": "Surprisingly, I'm actually really liking Building the Band because it's a little more authentic than I expected, with the ability for the kids to pick their own groups (minus the fact that they only have 6 groups so timing matters....hope they change that in the future and then cut off how ever many that they need to with the first round of group performances. )\n\nIf 3Quency does not stay together, I'll be ticked because their voices blend so well in harmony. Their only other job is to get along, which they appear to be doing so far.\n\nWhatever group Alison is in, I think we all feel like the other two girls joined because it was Band #6 and there weren't other choices. She can sing but she's pretty much insufferable. \n\nSZN4 - not a huge fan of the band name but they are my faves for sure! That unique mixture of people....the beatiful strong voices of all of them (especially Cam but they all sound great,) Donzel's positive energy...so many more things that I can say about these kids but I love it.\n\nThe only other band that I really like (after SZN4 and 3Quency) is Soulidified. They have more work to do but all of them are so precious and so far have won my heart. \ud83e\udd0e\n\nIn the chaotic boy band (Million Miles to Wherever the Heck They are Going) I really like the mop haired Aussie. His personality is so cool and they can all sing. I do agree with people who have said that the tatted guy and his narcissistic Alison mean girl fling might be actors. Hope not but they are capturing some horrific moments so maybe it's for film.\n\nLastly, now I realize why Nicole left The Masked Singer. Smart move, girl. I've heard Netflix pays well and if this turns out to be a hit, you will be the superstar of the show and the money will keep on multiplying. Same with Queen Kelly leaving The Voice AUS. Wish I had their managers lol",

For example, how did Mira and Zoey join Huntrix? It\u2019s said at the start of the movie that Celine took Rumi in under her wing (well\u2026 tried to. Not the best mentor). But what about the other two? We can guess Mira doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her parents because she was a wild child, but what about Zoey\u2019s family? We just know she used to live in America before, that\u2019s it. Nothing else about her family.\n\nWas Celine the only one who trained them? Or were they trained by some kind of institution? Does the whole \u201cdemon stealing human\u2019s souls\u201d thing only happen there, or in other parts of the world? Are there other demons hunters like them from other countries? Are there any interviews in which the creators of the movie answer some of these questions?\n\nI need freaking answers, Sony!",

        "content": "I'm currently watching episode 7 (out of 8) of FUBAR season 2. Back in episode 2 or 3, they mention that four power plants need to be shut down in order to trigger a nationwide blackout.\n\nBut unless I missed something or just forgot, I can only recall three being taken out:\n\n1. The first one is the satellite attack, where Greta blows up the plant from the inside after Luke's team manages to push the satellite away.\n\n\n2. The second is the cyberattack with the virus and submarine.\n\n\n3. The third is in episode 7 \u2014 the one with the underwater foam, where they end up shutting down the plant themselves to trigger the blackout.\n\n\n\nSo if I'm right, only three plants were actually shut down... but they said four were required to cause the blackout.\n\nDid I miss one? Or is this just a plot hole? \ud83d\ude05",
