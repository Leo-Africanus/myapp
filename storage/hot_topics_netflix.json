I understand the concept of leaving an ending open for interpretation by the audience, and as much as I hated the way The Sopranos ended, it was obvious that they were leaving their options open for sequels or whatever, but to just build, build, build to an ending from every point of view with absolutely zero closure or at the very least, a final decision by the President whether or not to even respond to an imminent nuclear bombing of Chicago????

This was one of this worst series. First of all, why was the daughter not a suspect for the police as she was the last person who saw him dead? There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

Like, do they think there was some Christie 2.0 running around, writing mysteries? Or is it more likely Netflix has pushed its copywriters to use AI to generate descriptions, and this is the result?",

I\u2019ve called my bank several times to confirm that I have e commerce and international transactions on the card and what do you know? Everything\u2019s on and running smoothly and I have no issues using the card on any other platform. Ive rechecked my details on the card a thousand times and theyre all correct. Ive checked my card\u2019s expiration date blah blah blah and it\u2019s not expired yet. I\u2019ve spoken to at least 10 Netflix agents via Customer support and they keep telling me that it\u2019s a general error and to just try another payment method. The problem is I only use this card and have no other payment options besides Apple Pay, but Netflix has decided to stop accepting Apple Pay payment which leaves me with nothing. I thought canceling my subscription and retrying the card would do the trick but it only left me with the error message of \u201cSorry we can\u2019t accept blah blah try again another time\u201d over and over. What do I do at this point? I can\u2019t use any other accounts since they cracked down on password sharing. ",

The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

Movies belong in THEATERS first, streaming second. Streaming is TV. Always has been always will be. That's not to say TV isn't good, but it's bad when it's the only option we have. And actors and directors will say the same thing if you asked them\n\nSorry if that hurts but the reality is that's a fact. Movies are better in theaters than television. Teddy Saranwrap should just throw in the towel and admit that's what the people want \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Maybe not the best place to say this but I'm sure many of you agree with me",

But if I turn to a 20+min TV series, or even a 2hr movie then it\u2019s fine.\n\nFigure it out soon. WWE is already borderline unwatchable these years and now you\u2019re having all these issues still not worked out since the beginning. ",

        "content": "Posting this so others don\u2019t waste time troubleshooting. On iPhone with Dynamic Island and iOS Picture in Picture enabled, the Netflix ad supported tier does not allow Picture in Picture, background playback, or Dynamic Island playback.\n\nAs soon as you swipe up to leave the app, playback pauses immediately and then fully stops. No PiP window appears. It feels like a bug, but *Netflix support confirmed this is intentional on the ad tier so ads remain full screen*.\n\nThis restriction is not clearly disclosed in the app. If Picture in Picture matters to you on iPhone, the Netflix ad tier is not worth it.",
