Netflix is adapting into French, Italian and Dutch versions. Hope that the Italian and the Dutch versions will have the same high quality as the original Spanish version.",

        "content": "Jack Reacher, Jack Ryan, James Bond, Jason Bourne, whatever. The trope of the hyper competent spy action thriller that's geared specifically towards the male demographic. There are so many of these already, and apparently we needed another one?\n\nIMO what set the first season of The Night Agent apart was the male/female duo dynamic which tapped into both demographics and a wider audience. And while the writing occasionally went on the corny side, I appreciated the realistic aspect of physical limitations, i.e. the fighting was often clumsy, Rose was the computer wiz and not suddenly defeating men twice her size in hand-to-hand combat, and Peter wasn't this unrealistic prodigy agent who was somehow equally talented at technology and combat - they both needed the other in a believable partnership.\n\nSeason 2 felt like they were diverging away from the formula in order to turn it into another long-running spy thriller franchise, which the show runners pretty much confirmed in an interview. Also, the decision to make her suffer from PTSD and anxiety, and be in therapy twice a week felt entirely out of place considering Peter is somehow completely mentally unaffected? And how has no government organization recruited Rose yet to be a cyber intelligence officer? Instead this season wrapped up with her effectively becoming his Bond girl, with the writers saying it's undecided if Rose will even be back next season. Peter being willing to trade his whole life to save her and Rose in turn being like \"this gives me anxiety, I just wanna go back to Silicon Valley and be a normal girl :(\"\n\nAll of this made complete sense btw when I found out S1 is based on a book, and S2 was the show runners writing without any source material. For me the season was a letdown, and I'm honestly just uninterested in the direction they're taking this show",

I love history and after doing a deep dive on the story, I found out that, while dramatized and a handful of fictional characters sprinkled in for the sake of good storytelling, it was in fact very accurate. I really love Kerry Washington's portrayal of Major Charity Adams, especially the scene where she tells Dean Norris, \"over my dead body, sir!\" Especially since this scene actually happened in real life. She was a woman, being sick of mistreated for so long, that she wasn't going to let anyone stand in her way of what she wanted. ",
