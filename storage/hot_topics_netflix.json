Especially, with Kate Bush's song, there could have been no other better scene to compliment her song.\n\nSo fed up of this culture of adoptive parents being jerks. The adoptive mom is definitely one and it seems like she made J Lo keep her promise as she is very nonchalant and uninviting in that scene. Plus, in the reunion scene before when she and J Lo meet eyes and she is not even looking at her in spite of looking straight into her face. J Lo, on the other hand, nods while she proceeds to ignore her and hold their daughter tighter, especially when J Lo is pulling off, not giving a chance for the daughter to turn around and watch her leave.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would J Lo only observe her daughter and would they communicate only from a distance like in that scene?",

I can't remember but I'm pretty sure there's blood involved somewhere given the fact I know this show had guns and knifes involved. \n\nThe show from the 2nd scene I know wasn't in English because subtitles and voice didn't match up.\n\nI came to see if anyone has seen or heard of a show(s) with similar details or a scene with similar details",
