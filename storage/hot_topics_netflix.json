Even after closing Netflix the entire screen will remain glitchy until the monitor is turned off and on again. Disabling widevine prevents this from happening but obviously that\u2019s not a solution as it prevents me from watching video.\n\nI had thought this may have been because of Nvidia Overlay but the issue persisted even after disabling it. I also tried to update drives and have the same issue",

Or it's video displayed like the broken channels on not-so-legal cable boxes back in the day, you know, rainbow lines, video \"noise\" but not much else. It doesn't happen on every movie or show, but enough of them that it's an annoyance. \n\nAnyone had this happen? Or any suggestions on how to fix it? Netflix is on the Xbox, I've already deleted and reinstalled, I've changed hdmi cable and port, nothing fixes it. Is Netflix just bonked?

I enjoyed the back and forth between the vampire focusing on the telling of the story and the interviewer trying cut out the embellishments and go for the stuff he\u2019s leaving out.  In a way it feels like, yes the vampire wants to look good in his story, but also cares more about HOW it sounds something pretty important for stories that last the rest of time.  Whereas the interviewer focusing on hard hitting facts that are cut and dry is something often focused on tonight news.  Something not know for its longevity.  Like each one wants a story but its style of storytelling reflects their age relatively.  I\u2019m used to Netflix being some quick on and done stuff and it\u2019s nice to see something with a little more art and vision.  Like comparing an album to a mixtape.  Can\u2019t wait for part 2",

The moment I exit fullscreen mode and leave Netflix app maximized, audio starts to works normally. It makes no sense that a change into fullscreen makes audio go silent every few seconds.\n\nAny ideas?",

I live in the same house with them and have my own profile on my phone and PS5 however Netflix will randomly lockout my profile on both these devices but works on the main computer my parents watch on and the only way to fix it is get a code sent to my dad, but the weird thing is it clearly states on their account that both my devices are apart of the household but they only work once he opens the link and goes through it. Any ideas?",
