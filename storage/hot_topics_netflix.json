My primary interest lies in watching WWE, as I\u2019ve been a fan of professional wrestling for years. However, before committing to Netflix, I want to ensure that their content library includes WWE programs in India.\n\nI know WWE has various shows, including Monday Night Raw, SmackDown, and pay-per-view events like WrestleMania. These events are central to keeping up with storylines, rivalries, and the thrill of wrestling entertainment.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some countries have WWE-related content on Netflix, but availability can vary based on location. Considering that WWE has its dedicated streaming service, I\u2019m curious if Netflix in India offers any WWE shows, documentaries, or classic matches.\n\nIf Netflix doesn\u2019t provide WWE content, I\u2019ll need to consider alternatives, such as the WWE Network or other platforms, to catch all the action. Could you confirm whether Netflix has WWE in India?",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nMy TV is an ordinary LG B8 4K OLED with 3840\u00d72160 resolution (16:9). A lot of content on Netflix is properly recorded in 16:9 aspect ratio UHD (3840\u00d72160) and the picture fills the screen.\n\nHowever, theatrical movies are a different matter. They're recorded in DCI-4K (4096\u00d72160 resolution, \\~17:9 aspect ratio) with an extra 256 horizontal pixels. Movie theaters make use of the entire resolution, there are home projectors and some exotic TVs that can display 4096 horizontal pixels, but my TV can't.\n\nHowever, I can't force the TV to just discard the 256 pixels, and instead it rescales the video to the 3840 horizontal pixels, displaying it in a very slight letterbox. The slight rescale also means a bit of blurriness which basically makes the displayed picture not much better than full HD resolution. Not that it matters much with typical viewing distances, but Dolby Vision isn't available with full HD video and I'm not sure about Dolby Atmos, I always had the UHD package, never tried the lower tiers.\n\nAt the very least, it wastes 6.25% of bandwidth and causes the TV to get warm due to having to rescale the movie.\n\nAnother missed opportunity is that the smart TV app is not smart enough to just align the top of the picture with the top of the screen and use the extra 135 pixels on the bottom for subtitles so they cover less of the movie, but it can't.\n\nIn short, I'd like Netflix to just send a UHD (3840\u00d72160) stream to my TV. It can be pan/scan to show the important bits if the director was so inclined as to use the entire frame to put something important on it, but I'd be fine with just a crude center crop, it's not like trying to fit as much as possible from a 2.35:1 CinemaScope content on a 4:3 CRT TV thirty years ago.",
