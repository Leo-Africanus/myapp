        "content": "Okay what an amazing amazing show. Loved it. Last episode did feel a little rushed inspite of how dragged out the earlier episodes were ? Like there was so much happening. Few things I need to clarify though-\n\n1) Why did Rose say William saw Lyle on the ferry and got scared ? She meant William saw the man with the cap and not that he identified Lyle considering both lingaard siblings couldn't have remembered how Lyle Jennings looked like now\n2) Lyle acts extremely stupid when he's with his mom. Is this something to do with being abused? Because it is a little difficult to believe he pulled off all those crimes\n3) they never show the motive behind why Lyle targeted Sam. Was that because he ran in similar circles with Merritt or he just wanted to get back at Sam for punching him. Also, did Lyle pretend to be Sam H to know Merritts whereabouts or was he eventually going to know because he was stalking her.",

It's the definition of a light summer watch. I personally love all of the punny jokes and references to arnold's past movies as well as the father daughter dynamic. Some people are acting like the shows goal was to be the next mission impossible or something like that. It's clearly not. Plus, I absolutely love the trope of \"will they? won't they?\" between Emma and Aldon. ",

I am actually not new to Netflix- I am a long time user (I got the DVDs in the mail in 2009), so needless to say the price change is CRAZY compared to 10+ years ago. The flair was necessary to ask the question. Anyway, I ditched the subscription last year because I just wasn't using it, but after a nice break I wanted to come back. The price difference between ads and no ads is large enough that I am considering getting the basic ad-supported version, but I wanted to know how bad the ads are. Is it tolerable? How often and how long are they? ",

My fav part while rewatching (I try to be ironic a bit with the word of fav) when Ginny starts to feel owerhelmed by her emotions, instead of self harm, goes to Marcus and tries to have sex, she wants to distract, and in the third season with Wolfe also, I am very familiar with this feeling. And if we are at Wolfe careless sex, and Ginny also has tendencies to overuse anything is a big waving flag for BPD. Oh, and the realitionship with her mother is a big big trigger, Georgia always flips the narrative about herself, she flips the blame, she doesnt see Ginny\u2019s feelings and also invalidates them, because he runaways from the feelings as from problems (Third fun fact, it was the same dynamic with my mom, still this day, but without murder and stuff, but I lived 6 places til I became 18, and she always lied to \u201csave me and my little brother\u201d this shit is traumatizing) And also, she likes to write - which means she feels a lot - most of the artistic persons dealing with mental health issues - it is just a note.\n\nMaxine - ADHD, quiet depression I was diagnosed with ADHD also, and in the third season they perfectly show how it feels like, with Maxine carachter, you want to be everywhere, you feel to much, you have so much thoughts, and in a sudden you you just get exhausted, and you freezed, get depressed, and you realize burnt every bridges around yourself - it can be some bipolar traits also, but that is not my first impression about Maxine. There\u2019s the episode where she switch off and on the lights, lot of people said that it is OCD, yeah it can be, but I think ADHD sometimes includes OCD, and if you check the whole episode, it is def ADHD demonstraition.\n\nMarcus - depression Oh dear Marcus! I had two big love in my life, as I mentioned I had my \u201cMarcus\u201d when I was 17, and in that time honestly was so hard, because I didnt understood depression (discovered latley I had also that time, but not in that way in Marcus). It is hard to write about it because depression sometimes seems selfishness, but the other person is dying inside, I think the series tries to show this both side of this mental health problem. They say it out loud he has depression. Depression is something you see in the other eyes. You feel nothing but the darkness. You know you love someone, but sometimes you can\u2019t feel it. Because you belive you are a bad person, you are acting like one, and push everyone away who loves you, because you are someone who unloveble. Til that they I couldn\u2019t figured out how to handle it, the one who has it\u2026 It fckn sucks. And addicton I think it comes with it\u2026 or with any other mental health issue. You want to be normal. And you feel yourself normal with any addictive mind altering thing, until you not. When nothing is enough, and you find yourself in the rabbit hole - Marcus is great example for it.\n\nAbby - Eating disorder Abby is pro example of someone who deals with eating disorder, most likely bulimia, and in the world of social media it got so much worse in the last years, so much more teenager, starts to develope the traits, not because it became a fashion, as some stupid people says, it is because that looking good became more public than ever. But I also think, it is also about being traumatized in every age. Abby\u2019s parents divorce can be a trigger, and also that she never feels to being fit anywhere.\n\nGeorgia - narcissistic traits, avoidant attachment style, cpstd, panic disorder The question is on every social media platform that Georgia is a good or bad mom. My opinion is def that she isn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t say that she has a narcissistic personality disorder, because she feels empathy, but she brings to the table lots of narcissistic traits. I mentioned at Ginny\u2019s phrase. But you can relate with this character, because you know how much she got traumatized in the past, that\u2019s why I think she have CPTSD, or actual PTSD, the memories are hunting her. But if we speak about her as a mom - she says that herself doing everything to their kids - which is true, but in one hand, she doesn\u2019t do it that the way the kids needs, in the other hand she always wants to good in the others eyes. The list could goes on, I was crying in every Ginny&amp;Georgia fighting scene, because my relived my childhood traumas\u2026\n\nAustin - Autism I don\u2019t know much autism, but I saw some example in my life, and Austin shows traits. Even Paul mentions in season 2 that maybe Austin has the similar issues that his little brother, which Georgia instantly denies, but it can be. And Paul\u2019s brother clearly has autism.\n\nI didn\u2019t wrote about panic disorder at the mom and daughter phrases, but it is also a hell, I\u2019ve been there also, and now I developed a generlized anxiety disorder, and I think it hard to point out on the screen, maybe that Georgia is always in a flight or fight, and drinking about every day can be a working sign of it, but it is not clear.\n\nI think the author seen a lot in her life, because it is a well fckn well written script about mental health issues.\n\nLet me know if you noticed something else, I am corious what\u2019ve may seen based upon your experience.\n\n(English is not my first language so sorry if it is not correct somewhere \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb)",
