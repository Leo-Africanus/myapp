But the consistency that Dexter maintains is unreal.\n\nIn fact it's still airing and having one of the best tv ratings ever. This series dominated the genre of serial killers.\n\nAnd the character Dexter Morgan has been played so well by Micheal C Hall, truly amazing. It's just simply lovely.\n\nThe progression of season and new serial killers introduced in each season keep you hooked with the series.\n\nI am currently on the final season of Dexter and I must say it did not miss any aspect whatsoever.\n\nI am sure most of you have already seen it but, of you haven't, then I must say it's a must watch.",

Any other series worth watching that were previously blocked due to ads being shown? \n \n               Watched Death by Lightning. I thought the nomination convention scenes were fabulous with that incredible Garfield speech. So well done. Surprised they kind of glossed over the front porch campaign with just a scene with old black soldiers. I wanted more. I actually visited that historical house recently and learned about the front porch campaign. They would bring thousands in by train to hear Garfield. He always tailored his speeches due to the different groups of people that would come hear him. He was a savvy orator. Disappointed they didn't show this.\n\nStaircase.\nI can't believe how many episodes this was. After the trial I checked how many more episodes and couldn't belive how many more to go. I watched it all but have to admit I fast forwarded all the flashback scenes between the couple. Who knows what went on really between those 2 in private. I think he's guilty. ",

It was selfish as he sold himself over the actual members. Hybe\u2019s hitmaker Bang wasn\u2019t the focus of Dream Academy. Second, Simon doesn\u2019t understand that kpop is a rigorous program. You can\u2019t just wing it. For example, the boys had a staged meeting with the label CEO and they supposedly were nervous. It talked about how they were nervous and couldn\u2019t banter because they didn\u2019t know each other so well. In Dream Academy, most of the girls spent 2 years with each other and had media training. There is a reason why Katseye has so much chemistry. Simon didn\u2019t do any research on why Hybe is successful. He is a dinosaur that is still stuck to live auditions. Two of Katseye\u2019s members Lara and Manon were scouted online.\nThe last thing is December 10 doesn\u2019t even have a single launching today. Katseye had a single that launched with Dream Academy. There is lack of strategy from a producer of supposed hit groups. Yet, I do see potential in one or two members. I can see that he is trying to replicate Harry styles again. It is such a pity that the boys are being used for his ego. Hope they get to release a single at least.",

The final season is out...so is development on this secretive new DN series still happening or did it get quietly canned? They announced like 3 years ago and from the articles I've read it seems they were still just busy with scripting, maybe filming will finally happen next year???\n\nThen again they also say that they're working on two other projects and maybe even a spin-off to Stranger Things so I dunno.......\n\nHere are the articles btw just in case someone is reading this and thinks I'm talking out of my ass:\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/](https://deadline.com/2022/07/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-netflix-upside-down-pictures-deal-spinoff-series-stephen-daldry-stage-play-manga-death-note-the-talisman-1235058665/)\n\n[https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/](https://deadline.com/2022/10/death-note-halia-abdel-meguid-series-adaptation-manga-netflix-duffer-bros-1235151144/)\n\nMaybe I'm huffing huge amount of copium but I'm still on the side of \"It's still happening just slowly\", and I have several reasons for my hope:\n\n1. The Death Note anime is on Netflix now and available for world wide users, not just japan, the country specifics dubs aren't available everywhere but it's unusual for Netflix to release one show in so many regions anyhow (\\*that is not a Netflix original)\n2. A metric FUCK TON of merch released this year and there's still more announced to come out in 2026, maybe it's just because the anime is turning 20 years old but maybe also because behind the scenes they are working on some kind of new project, wheter it's this supposed new Netflix series or something completely different\n3. Killer Within and the social media accounts. Killer Within still has decent success and is still getting updates even after the initial hype died down around it, and many Death Note related official social media accounts have been active or have been revived ever since 2024, posting almost every day or every week.\n\nFinally, Death Note is still really damn popular even among new gen anime fans, it just kinda makes sense for it to be revived with a BIG project someday right?...I mean, they did try that in 2017 I guess. :P\n\nIf anyone has any sort of new information, I would appreciate hearing some kind of new info that I haven't stumbled on. Because after writing all this out, I feel like I'm having a Pepe Silvia moment.",

        "title": "Morally grey ML and overly righteous FL are the most annoying trope",
        "content": "I was watching an old Japanese series now in Netflix \"The black swindler\" plot is cool and all. About ML who is \"the black swindler\" a scammer guy who ONLY scam other scammer. \n\nThe FL is a character trying to be a prosecutor. So she got this overly righteous character. \n\nThese two crossed paths because the FL's uncle got scammed and wanted to off himself by jumping on a train track, the ML saved him and the ML offered his help. The FL was skeptical (which is acceptable bc he's a stranger) and she begged the uncle just let the police handle it rather than accepting a help from a sketchy guy. \n\nThe police, being on the wrong side of justice (typical) basically told them there's nothing they could do to catch the scammers. In fact, the police was basically more busy spending their resources trying to catch the ML rather than other scammers. \n\nThe ML wanted to include the uncle in his scam to scam back the ppl who scammed the uncle. Which the FL was against of her uncle being accessory to a crime and she doesn't believe in \"an eye for an eye\". Long story short, the ML successfully got the uncle money back and basically berates the uncle for trying to off himself when he have a family. Happy ending? But you know what the FL did? She basically told the ML off for getting the money back while yelling \"I won't thank you bc this is still wrong\" yada yada yada gurl even slapped the ML. \n\nFr this girl is pissing me off, I get that she wanna blindly believe the law exists for a reason, but what I cannot accept is all these bs ideal she is talking about when she doesn't contribute to solve the main scam issue. In fact she tried to sabotage the ML plan too many times. And after he got the money back still you wanna complain? Girl, be fr, Turn the money back to the police then. Why you didn't complain to uncle for accepting the money and just look down on the one guy who basically saved your family?\n\nDon't speak about ideals when you don't do anything. It's so annoying in these types of dramas, whoever wrote the character just give one character all the common sense and one character just have too much ideals but no actions. It pissed me off bc they give the ML all the cool traits while the FL is so one dimensional, arrogant and have zero brain cell. \n\nAlso the ML end up being the FL landlord and she still act like she got a stick up her ass, gurl you're too broke to be so arrogant to a guy letting you rent his place for cheap. Mind you the ML just mind his own business and doesn't act like a typical jerk or even stuck up. Dude is still letting her stay despite her insulting him too many times.\n\nIt's only the first episode and I just boiling in hatred for the FL. Thank you for listening to my rant haha",
