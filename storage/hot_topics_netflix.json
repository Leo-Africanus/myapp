I do have Netflix Premium so I don't know why this could be a problem since it's noted that premium has more features compared to the other plans and it just says I can download on up to 6 supported devices at a time but never specified how much I could download.\n\nI am a person that notices every aspect of quality change and like my downloaded content to be at least 1080p.\n\nSorry i had to use this account, I didn't have enough karma on my \"main\".",

I\u2019m not including romance anime\u2019s because most of them low-key all follow the same format but maybe just different names / looks. Does anyone agree about my take?

They manage her presence nicely without being overly sexual, which I can appreciate. \n\nThe show also mingles comedy with hard topics such as living with disabilities, misogyny, and failure really well. \n\nI've rewatched it several times, especially when winding down at night or if there's nothing else to watch (skipping the doll episode). \n\nAnyone else find this show oddly comforting?

Not even the gorgeous soundtrack the series boasts and brilliant editing could save the two from being borderline unwatchable.\n\nI hope the Way brothers direct more episodes in the future because they are some of the most talented and exciting filmmakers at the moment.  \n\nJust a personal opinion of course",

He's great to have as an employee, totally collected yes-man, but as far as working under him-- \nhe doesn't acknowledge hard work, he calls in overqualified people for non-emergency situations and, despite references to the contrary, he appears to be quite prone to conflict at all times in private AND public.\n\nMost importantly he doesn't stick up for his staff at all. He says something about \"it's not our job to push back\" to Jasmine-- that is not the point-- last minute changes disrespect your staff and ruin the ability for things to run smoothly. \nIf the weird anti-tradition squad wants to make changes let them do it within a reasonable time frame. \n\nSomeone else's lack of organization is NOT your fake emergency. These poor people putting in all this work just to have their boss let it be thrown away without his acknowledgement or apology it's nuts.

Just felt like there was something I wasn\u2019t picking up on.\n\nAlso, Devon. Man. It felt like she was kinda in love with being miserable? Like her sister chose a life of comfort and happiness, and Devon just could not wrap her head around it.

        "content": "Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies of all time. I own a blu ray special edition and I\u2019ve easily watched this movie 50-100 times. I watched it on Netflix tonight, because why not. I swear there is a sequence out of order. I watched it and immediately had to rewind because something triggered my brain. It\u2019s the scene with the baby sitter who works for him moving drugs. It\u2019s inserted during the Lufthansa heist scenes. It doesn\u2019t make sense for it to be there and I thought it came later in the movie. Am I going crazy here?",

        "content": "I\u2019ve tried everything I can to resolve this issue but haven\u2019t had success, so I would really appreciate any help or suggestions.\n\nThe issue I\u2019m facing is that in Microsoft Edge, the bitrate and resolution of streaming titles don\u2019t go above **1080p** and around **700 kbps**. This is despite the fact that my system and display support much higher quality \u2014 I\u2019m using a **1600p OLED** panel with a **240Hz refresh rate** and **Dolby Vision** support.\n\nJust so you know, my system has an **RTX 4070** GPU and an **Intel Core Ultra 9 185H** processor, and I\u2019m on the **Netflix Premium plan** that supports **Ultra HD playback**.\n\nInterestingly, on **Google Chrome**, the bitrate can reach up to **18,000 kbps** (18 Mbps) and **4K resolution**, even though Chrome itself is capped at 1080p in some cases. Still, the quality and bitrate are noticeably better on Chrome.\n\nHowever, I prefer using Microsoft Edge because **Chrome doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision**, and I\u2019d like to take advantage of that feature while still getting the best possible bitrate and resolution.\n\nCould you help me figure out why Edge is limiting the quality and how I can unlock higher bitrate and resolution when streaming?\n\nThank you in advance!",
