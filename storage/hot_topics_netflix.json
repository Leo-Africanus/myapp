        "content": "IMO the movie was charming, very catchy songs. It was a great original story and i like it so much better than the slop pixar/disney have been pumping out. But I noticed the whole demon analogy fell short. The messaging related to the demons and what they meant was confusing. \n\nRumi's identity as a half demon who is \"better\" than the full demons because she kills demons felt morally confusing. Its implied that atleast some of the demons, like the lead of the boy band, are misguided people who sold their souls to the demon king or had their souls taken non-consensually. There was a lot of footage of the demons tricking people into basically becoming depressed and insecure enough to be \"content/hypnotized\" into transforming into demons. And some demons, like the tiger and bird were just neutral without any ill intent. Which made it hard to hate the demons as an antagonistic force. Yet, the demon slayer girl group wanted to kill the demons to save the people (when some of the missing ppl are implied to be demons.) \n\nthe swap from TAKE DOWN (hateful song) to GOLDEN (positive song) felt confusing, because regardless of the swap, the girls still killed *all* the demons. The other two members also wanted to kill Rumi at one point but decided against it because they knew her, their strong distrust and hate for all demons besides her was never questioned even after they almost became demons. \n\nThen there was the bit about Rumi (the half demon girl) wanting to save Jinu (the demon boy band lead). Because she finds him attractive shes able to humanize his \"demonality.\" Jinu is only redeemable  because he kills himself to save the Rumi (implying hes valueless as a demon and beyond redemption alive.)\n\nOverall the esthetics and vibe was great but I was sucked out of the movie when I spent 5 seconds too long thinking, \"whats the message and point regarding the demons?\" In the end it feels as though the message is, \"Your inner demons are insecurities and depression, and idk bro kys if you cant get that in control \ud83d\ude2d tf is redemption\u2014\"",

        "content": "So what are we thinking so far? \nMy thoughts below because I wish I knew someone who watched this \ud83d\ude02\n\nI personally am loving this show, so much talent and appreciated that they did all the showcases in one episode, I really thought they\u2019d annoyingly split it. The pace has been good, and I know they need the cheeky cliffhanger. \n\nSZN 4 - \nI absolutely believe that SZN 4 are the clear winners unless they royally screw up. \nI really wish they\u2019d chosen another name though! They all have such star quality, particularly Donzell and Aaliyah - incredibly powerful voices. Cameron\u2019s is so unique and I feel when Katie gains her confidence she shines.  - plus they seem like nice people. \nThey all scream \u201cI would have such a good time chilling at a party with them all\u201d \nAbsolute fan here of what they are bringing to the table; the energy, the difference in voices, the oomph they give. \n\nSweet Seductions - \nI\u2019m on the anti-Allison train and I know she\u2019s being made the villain, but she just seems like such an awfully narcissistic person that I don\u2019t think they could have edited it that much. it goes to show that chemistry on stage and actually having true friendship in the band really shows in the performance, \u201cSweet seductions\u201d were not conducive - and I don\u2019t see longevity in the band just based on their toxic relationship growing due to Allison being a drill instructor and treating them like props.i wish the other 2 had ended up with the other girls that Allison ditched. Allison will be the demise of them all. \n\nI think Soulidified and 3quency will also go far. \n3quency really surprised me tonight! But wow, they really did work so well together and seemed like such a unit. It was real sweet having the other girls try on the makeup too. \nAgain, seeing people be friendly to each other and supportive of each other is just going to make me like the band more haha but yeah they aced it. \n\nSoulidified is not my cup of tea BUT I can see how they would appeal to others, working hard as well together, seems like they have the business side of it all down pat and there voices do really work with each other. But some are definitely better than others, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter as much though because they are blending so well. They really were great tonight and had fabulous energy with each other. Song choice suited them for sure. Even if they don\u2019t win I think they\u2019ll get signed elsewhere. \n\nMidnight till morning - I\u2019m not going to lie I got my hopes up that they might try something a bit different with country dusky voices but they seem to just be wanting to fit the cookie cutter. I know it\u2019s for the drama, but Connor is annoying me and the immaturity/insecurity shines whenever he makes a snarky comment about another band. Being Australian I was having hopes for them, but maybe the \u201claid back\u201d Aussie way is preventing them from pushing themselves further \ud83d\ude18 I\u2019d be so frustrated too if you\u2019d made it that far and your 20 something yr old band mate just wanted to get laid. \nAlso very sad moment when Mason spoke to the late Liam Payne about seeing him way back, and about it being full circle. RIP Liam. \n\nAnd finally ! Gosh this is long - \nSiren society - I think they might leave, which is unfortunate as I actually think they did well tonight and really tried to push themselves with so much choreography. They seem really sweet to each other and supportive. I would have preferred them over sweet seduction any day. \nChoosing a song of one of the judges I don\u2019t think did them well either, way too risky at that stage - and as Nicole said - she has her own way of interpreting her own song, to then emulate that - well it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nAnyway everyone, I am SO KEEN to hear your thoughts on everyone! Who are your favorites? Who do you think is being carried? Who\u2019s going out? \n\n",

If not, then why build it so large? If so, then how would he have controlled it? To me this seemed like he wanted to build something big enough that it would seem credible for a small person to fit inside when he called the police.  \n\nAnother thought\u2026 when the kid said \u2018I thought we were doing this for a show,\u2019 I think it spilled the beans that he was always planning to \u2018accidentally\u2019 let the balloon go so he could call the FAA. (Who would ever think to call the FAA?! That clearly seemed planned). So I\u2019m wondering if  it\u2019s possible his kid going missing was not the original plan but just became part of it. Either way, I think jail time was suitable. Thoughts?",

        "content": "Isn't it funny that Netflix basically invented the concept of releasing all episodes of a season at once, and they are the ones now introducing dividing the seasons into parts? At first, it was just two. Now, with *Stranger Things*, it's three. If they keep this trend, they will loop all the way back to releasing all the episodes separately.",

The actors are great but my suspension of disbelief has been tested, a lot. Especially in these last episodes that deal with the realms of the Endless and their troubles. Having it be animated would not only have solved it but allowed the show to be even sillier and closer to the graphic novels without having to cut and adapt so much. I am aware of the allegations against the author and so pissed off at him, this of course also unfortunately leads to The Sandman never being adapted again.",
