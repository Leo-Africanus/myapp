None of them can keep it in their pants. They bang, regret it, get back together, break up again, then immediately start dating someone new. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the way they run this marketing firm. It's crazyy. All they do is make reckless decisions, ignore basic logic and somehow every campaign is a massive success anyway. No planning, no strategy, no consequences. Just Emily \"girlbossing\" her way through it. I know it\u2019s all fictional, but come on \ud83d\ude2d a little bit of logic would be nice. ",

Only seven episodes anyway. I hope there's a prequel tho.",

        "content": "One could say \"it's easy to make a show with a 'sketch' animation approach\". Another could say \"It's been done\". Perhaps both views can be correct, but it is safe to say the medium has found its intended audience in 'Samuel', a light hearted, and uniquely rich journey through the eyes of a young boy who uses sketch animation to bring life to the various stories which compromise his diary. \n\nSamuel demonstrates a micro series type of storytelling, making short entries in a diary each a distinct episode, while tying them together through the common themes of growing up, falling in love, and socializing as a preteen. \n\nThe messages of each story are often as relatable as they are personal, rich with flaws of life as a child growing up at the turn of the century. The additional wrinkle of 'Samuel' taking place in the early 00's makes it as much a fresh experience for younger audiences, as it is a look back for older ones. \n\n'Samuel' may perform well as its own one season micro series, or it may continue to grow as the titular character does. In either case, such a vibrant, heartfelt experience told in such a succinct way is a welcome addition to the world of 'coming of age' media. It is a beautiful story that will leave one not only looking back, but looking forward.",

If so, it's worth my time to keep doing it.

There is some good acting and actors that carry the story, as well as some not very good acting and actors that actually (whether intentionally or not) keep it light and silly, but I didn\u2019t actually see that as a turnoff.\n\nIf I expected Black Sails I\u2019d probably hate it, but my wife and I found ourselves bingeing it and laughing with it (and sometimes at it which was just as enjoyable). The story wasn\u2019t deep but kept us watching all the same, would definitely watch a second season.\n\nDid anyone else get into it?",

        "content": "I just finished Secret Mall Apartment and I honestly don't know where I stand on it. The story is a total 2000s fever dream. It\u2019s about eight artists building a hidden 750sq-ft flat inside a Rhode Island mall and living there for years. The lo-fi footage they captured back in 2003 is incredible, but the doc raises some massive questions that I haven't stopped thinking about.\n\nOn one hand, you have Michael Townsend and his crew, who frame this as a \"living art\" protest against corporate gentrification. You can\u2019t help but be impressed by the pure audacity it took to smuggle cinder blocks and furniture past security for four years. For the \"art is life\" crowd, it\u2019s an inspiring story about reclaiming space from billionaires.\n\nOn the other hand, the film itself acknowledges a huge elephant in the room: white privilege. The artists admit they likely only got away with this because of how they looked, and some of the \"magical\" reenactments (like using a diverse cast of actors for a mostly white project) feel like they're trying to rebrand a very specific, privileged experience into something more universal. It also touches on the heavy personal cost, showing how Townsend\u2019s singular obsession with the project eventually led to the end of his marriage.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see what everyone else thinks!!\n\nIs this a brilliant act of resistance that proves art can happen anywhere?\n\nOr is it just a case study in how \"mischief\" is only called \"art\" when the people doing it have a certain level of privilege?",
