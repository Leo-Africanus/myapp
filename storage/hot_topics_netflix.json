The way the documentary lays out the Cambridge Analytica scandal feels like a thriller more than a history lesson. They follow people who were directly involved  journalists, former employees, even people who had their data pulled into the whole thing  and it shows how personal information became a weapon during elections.\n\nThe film does a really good job of making you see data as more than just numbers on a screen. They literally call it the most valuable resource in the world now, even more than oil, and watching how easily it was collected and sold was pretty disturbing.\n\nI think the scariest part was how much of it happened quietly. Most people had no idea their Facebook likes or quiz answers were being used to build psychological profiles on them. By the time they realized it, the damage had already been done.  It made me think about how much info we all give away without even noticing and it makes you a little sacred or at least made me a little scared. \n\n  \nWhat did you people think, did you like the premise? And also what are some movies like it that I can watch to feed my paranoia lol",

It\u2019s frustrating that season 2 ended on basically the same cliffhanger as season 1\u2026 but at least there\u2019s clear growth with Cole this time around. His character feels more grounded and less arrogant, which I loved seeing. Jackie and Cole\u2019s bond also felt a lot stronger this season.\n\nThat said, I have such a love/hate relationship with Jackie, I just want her to finally settle down instead of bouncing between the brothers. Alex might be the \u201cgood boy\u201d type, but it\u2019s obvious Jackie\u2019s heart is with Cole. That\u2019s the relationship I want to see play out in season 3, please let it happen!!!!",

I have Netflix on my iPhone (both updated to latest software version), I use it to play a show for background noise while I fall asleep. It used to stop playing a few hours after I fell asleep but last month I got a notice from my ISP that I was coming up on my data limit because of streaming video. Well I was thinking about it and realized that my show was usually still playing when my alarm when off in the morning all of a sudden when it never used to do that. \n\nI've tried google but the only results I'm getting are either how to turn it on or off completely, nothing for how to have it automatically stop playing after a few hours. And I've checked the settings on both the app and the desktop site with no success either\n\nHas anyone else had this problem and if so how did you fix it? It's persisting even though I've rebooted and updated my phone multiple times and uninstalled and reinstalled the most recent version of the app a couple time. I don't remember ever going into settings to change it so I don't think it's something I did. \n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nEdit to add: I just confirmed for sure that the \"are you still watching\" popup happens on PC as expected",

That seems crazy unrealistic lol so what do you guys think it\u2019s worth? Was never sold retail, thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hi there, I just subscribed for a month of Netflix and immediately ended the subscription. I just need a month and am not interested right now in returning for a longer duration. Now every time I open the app or browser, I get a screen blocking message to take back my cancellation OR be reminded again. There is no other option and the screen is on EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app. Is there a way to remove it?\n\nWith these kind of blocking screens, I wouldn't even return for a month in the future anymore :/",

I've never seen a movie that looked like it was shot in a weekend, before. What's going no, here? Anyone have any input as to why this was ever actually shown? It was so bad, it would be the basis of a decision to get out of Netflix completely.\n\n&gt;",

        "content": "Just finished the Jussie Smollett doc on Netflix and wow\u2026 what a joke. Instead of finally owning up, it felt like one long attempt to keep the lie alive.\n\nHonestly, people would have respected him way more if he just came clean years ago. Dragging this story out only makes him look worse. He\u2019s not some A-list celebrity, he\u2019s acting like the world revolves around him when, in reality, he\u2019s just not that important.\n\nThe ego, the facade, the refusal to admit the obvious it\u2019s exhausting. Imagine if he had just said \u201cyeah, I messed up, I lied.\u201d The redemption arc could\u2019ve actually worked in his favor. Instead, we get a documentary trying to polish a lie.\n\nCome on, man. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nWhat are your thoughts? ",
