Like he \"allegedly\" had a part in Tupac and biggies deaths. And he wanted to throw biggie the biggest funeral, made it all about him and made biggies estate pay for the entire thing? How low can a person go. \n\nNot to mention, how stupid were those jurors? They dropped the ball completely. \n\nIts nice to know he likes his \"fans\" so much he needs to shower with peroxide after greeting them. \n\nHe's a vile person.\n\nWhat's your opinion of the doc or the person its about? \n\nOn the upside sting got richy rich from Diddy over that song. Sting earns two thousand dollars a day on it from what I understand. \n\n",

        "content": "I watched Simon Cowell trying to compete with kpop boy bands. It was actually guide on how to not make a modern boyband to rival kpop. First, it was all about Simon Cowell. It was selfish as he sold himself over the actual members. Hybe\u2019s hitmaker Bang wasn\u2019t the focus of Dream Academy. Second, Simon doesn\u2019t understand that kpop is a rigorous program. You can\u2019t just wing it. For example, the boys had a staged meeting with the label CEO and they supposedly were nervous. It talked about how they were nervous and couldn\u2019t banter because they didn\u2019t know each other so well. In Dream Academy, most of the girls spent 2 years with each other and had media training. There is a reason why Katseye has so much chemistry. Simon didn\u2019t do any research on why Hybe is successful. He is a dinosaur that is still stuck to live auditions. Two of Katseye\u2019s members Lara and Manon were scouted online.\nThe last thing is December 10 doesn\u2019t even have a single launching today. Katseye had a single that launched with Dream Academy. There is lack of strategy from a producer of supposed hit groups. Yet, I do see potential in one or two members. I can see that he is trying to replicate Harry styles again. It is such a pity that the boys are being used for his ego. Hope they get to release a single at least.",

It just seemed unrealistic like that they connected dots that weren't even there in the first place. I wish they took more time to establish how they could have made a connection between the murders and Elmer. It was just like \"oh 10 people went missing but all of them are definitely dead and i don't know why but it definitely has something to do with this strange boy and his mother\". Like the swimmer that got murdered in the first episode...after talking to the fake witnesses that said they saw only him and he definitely drowned in the OCEAN, how did Carrera refuse to believe any single person and just conclude that he didn't drown???!!! Like obviously we know he didn't actually drown as the viewers but it didn't make sense that she immediately thought \"hmm three people are giving the same account of this man drowning but nope he was murdered\". I think I'm being over dramatic but I really needed to rant about this part of the series.",

You get four episodes of vital plot, a massive cliffhanger, and then... nothing. Back to the waiting game for Volume 2, which is essentially just the back half of the same season. The same happened with the highly-anticipated return of *The Family Man*, only for fans to have to wait again between parts.\n\n  \nWe signed up for the convenience of binge-watching, the freedom to control our viewing experience. Now, we are being forced back into an anticipated, staggered release schedule, only without the benefit of the traditional weekly TV model that kept the community discourse alive for months. Instead, we get an initial flash of binge-mania followed by a frustrating, momentum-killing pause.\n\n",
