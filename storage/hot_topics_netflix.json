Having his wife appear from inside - it\u2019s like they\u2019re doing everything they can to throw him off his game. This is incredibly anxiety inducing as it is, and it\u2019s like the production team have instructed certain behaviours to make it borderline unbearable. It just feels so performative which is not what his climbs are usually about. \n\nI get it\u2019s fun for the show, and looks cool, but the guy is climbing a skyscraper ffs. \nHe\u2019s doing enough to get you your views, please just let us watch him climb and PLEASE LET US HEAR HIM. I\u2019m so sick of the constant yapping from the panellists; it\u2019s like they\u2019ve been told not to come up for air. Stop doing weird commentary and playing these videos when he\u2019s talking, we want to hear his thoughts, his process, his funny quips. \n\nFeels really irresponsible of Netflix to allow this tbh; like the marvellousness of a free solo climb is just being made a mockery of tbh and this is a real person up there. A huge disservice to climbing, and to Alex. Props to him for absolutely giving the crowd what they\u2019re after though. Couldn\u2019t be me! \n",

Free Solo was an extension of that. When you are high up, you are looking for peace and to leave the heck of it all below you. What we got yesterday was the antithesis of peace. Elle Duncan, Mark Rober, etc., were named, but they were not needed; they don't understand the point of being Free. Sure, you hire these people, but nobody wants them. There is a reason Elle Duncan never worked out on ESPN. If Netflix wanted more respect, they could have gotten Will Smith, Jimmy Chin, Zac Efron, etc. to host. People who actually understand what Alex is doing, people who want to live in the moment and not make it this is my 9/11. This was unacceptable and a masterclass of complete disaster.",

Nothing is ever explained properly and we\u2019re expected to take whatever we see and roll with it. It\u2019s unfortunate because the plot could\u2019ve been more refined.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the tooth tree and the opening in the ground Alex and Petal found? And the growling sounds? Never explained. How did Amber fall off a cliff and reappear so close to the party site after Mia ran to get help (I thought it was going to be a clone thing). Never explained.\n\nLuke wasn\u2019t a character we needed, Mia is not the hero we all want and I\u2019ll be assuming the relationship Dev and Mia had before Amber messed with them was the reason they got together even though they never explicitly told us if Dev and the others got their memories back. (Given that Midge had to make Mia remember and none of them remembered the funeral)\n\nLuka and Mia did NOT need to kiss, stupid plot point. The doll house also had almost no significance. She went to \u201cface her past\u201d and did nothing but get tricked. That could\u2019ve happened anywhere. They also didn\u2019t explain why Jenna and Luka had those not seemingly random headaches after they got injected with the drug?\n\nHarry\u2019s disappearance was never properly explained. I thought only dead people appeared as those black figures and I thought he was dead all along. Why do Sam and Midge have physical forms? Why did the ghosts mark Luka?\n\nAmber was the only interesting thing about this whole fiesta and her existence isn\u2019t even properly explained, I kept going thinking the ending would at least be satisfying but it wasn\u2019t. I wish Amber disappeared, I wish the ending didn\u2019t try to infer Midge was living as Mia. I would\u2019ve taken that. Blood sisters my arse.\n\nThere might be more but these are the ones that really stuck with me, I went from curious to pissed off really fast.",

        "content": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I went into Emily in Paris Season 5 ready for the cute outfits, chaotic love triangles, dreamy Europe vibes.. the usual comfort-watch formula.\n\nBut somehow? It felt a little flat.\n\nThe fashion was still fun, and Paris/Rome remain unreal, but the storylines felt recycled. Same relationship drama, same misunderstandings, same Emily making questionable decisions but somehow winning anyway. I kept waiting for a moment, a twist, growth, something,  and it never really came.\n\nAlso, does anyone else feel like the characters are kind of stuck? Like five seasons in and we\u2019re still running in circles emotionally? I miss when the show felt light, surprising, and effortlessly charming instead of predictable.\n\nThat said, I didn\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s still an easy, colorful watch. Just not the binge obsession it used to be.\n\nCurious if it\u2019s just me though \ud83d\udc40\n\nDid you love Season 5, or are you feeling the Emily-in-Paris fatigue too?",

        "content": "My favourite movies are the ones with a crazy twist at the end, mainly because I\u2019m really bad at guessing what\u2019s about to happen so I suppose it\u2019s a natural shock to me. Also, I absolutely hate spoilers so if I accidentally tly read a spoiler about a film or movie I was intending on watching , I don\u2019t watch (eg Shutter Island \ud83d\ude24) Anyway, I was looking forward to watching the short series His and Hers, as I\u2019d read that it was that type of film, but because I read one comment about how much of a crazy twist this series had, before I\u2019d gotten around to watch it, I started to see other comments of a similar nature (social media feed for you). Although this isn\u2019t a direct spoiler, I managed to guess what would happen early on and I suppose it ruined it slightly. Bear in mind , I\u2019m usually crap at guessing stuff. Hey ho, maybe it was that type of film where it was easy to guess I suppose. ",

It's not all that\n\nThe idea of teens being stuck in a parallel universe with no one else is cool and I love how the show demonstrates political conflicts between characters.\n\nIt's just that it's insanely boring to watch. The poster for the show with the flames in the back and the red coloring looks epic, but none of the scenes in the show actually look like that. It's just realistic scenery and outfits/hairstyles don't represent anything about the characters.\n\nThe show obviously is about the character and their relationships with each other and not about what is the parallel universe and it's mythology, but it's too much to the point where after months of being in New Ham, Kelly mentions the bus driver in the final episode and doesn't even address the fact that there are more of them and they're the ones who dropped them off in New Ham.\n\nIt just makes the characters really stupid. Also I hated all of the sex scenes, none of the ships/couples actually mattered to me.",
