        "title": "Old Guard 2 - did you notice?",
        "content": "So here\u2019s my Old Guard 2 questions: \n\n1- So Quynh is out, but she speaks modern language fluently after 500 years? Also she is completely sane and in control? Does this whole immortality and healing thing applies to mental health as well? \n\n2- did they use young face filters on Charlize ? She doesn\u2019t look normal. Too smooth and toned face like instagram filters. Or is it just me? \n\n3- Discord - completely useless character?! She is the first immortal. Ok, but no background story at all? Tua\u2019s speech implies - he said \u201cshe is the first immortal by design\u201d. Meaning what?? She was designed? Or is it some English phrase I\u2019m poorly understanding (English isn\u2019t my 1st language).\n\n4- the whole immortality lore - Nile being the last one and she is the destroyer because she has the same mark with Discord. Ok but how and who or what decides it? Why now? And how exactly Book gave up his immortality to Andy? Just by thinking about it? I thought there may be some hug or physical touch, some glow or at least something that implies \u201chey it\u2019s done\u201d. But just thinking about it transfers immortality? \nEven let\u2019s say Nile is the destroyer, then how the F the other immortals died before? How Discord is mortal? Is that because their mentality or body gives up? Discord doesn\u2019t seem like she gave up on her immortality. I mean in that case Book would\u2019ve died long ago. How those book lore\u2019s created and by whom? There were times when immortals were known or designed ? I thought Andy was just worshipped as a Goddess. But that was it.\n\n5- storyline was WAAAY off - Andy\u2019s mortality and second immortality wasn\u2019t even revealed. That would be badass if Discord just thought Andy was mortal, may be she would even try to approach her and lie about working together for cure, and then betray her by taking all other immortals, and in the last fight she learns Andy is immortal again, which is what she wants the most, and it would anger her so much and that would\u2019ve lead to more aggressive fight sequence? That would be cool. Now, Quynh herself is mortal too. And she is so cool with it? And nobody said to Quynh \u201cyo, Discord actually let you get captured and thrown into the ocean.\u201d I was like \u201cSAY SOMETHING TO HER\u201d.  Quynh would turn against Discord in the end. And this whole bomb sequence? That was just out of nowhere? \u201cOh hey come to me or I will blow up this country?\u201d And then \u201cI wanna end you because you help people\u201d. Excuse me ?! \ud83d\ude02 did they really sat down and wrote this ? I mean,  these are incredibly strategic immortals fought thousands of wars over the millennias. And this is the sequence you write for these characters\u2019 battle? Chatgpt could\u2019ve written better scenario than this. Discord\u2019s stabbing Tua in the beginning - for what exactly? \u201ci need some books about myself so people don\u2019t know who am I, so lemme stab your immortal ass real quick\u201d. Yeah OK. They were literally pals for centuries, he can tell everyone. And Tua is doing what exactly? Immortal librarian? Sounds cool tho \ud83d\ude02 And what was the scene with Quynh and Andy in the past? No explanation? Am I missing something ? I hope I do, cause that was left out. \n\n6- Fight sequences - the 1st movie fight sequences were the highlight of the movie, they were delicious to watch, old combat styles mixed with modern styles? There was a whole video about choreographing Andy\u2019s fight style. They actually spend time on it. Now in this one? It seemed robotic, weird. First fight scene in the mansion was ok, but other scenes later on? Downgrade from the 1st movie. I was expecting something epic in the last battle with Discord and Andy. And that scene was like someone sketched a good portrait and a toddler scribbled on it. There were good parts but execution and delivery was OFF. \n\n7- acting and directing - Quynh actress: yeah, she didn\u2019t deliver the character. She was slow, kept zoning out of the character, she looked badass and fights scenes were ok, but when she spoke she was speaking like someone just learned how to act, the only time I felt power in her was when she spoke mandarin when she cursed Andy. I was like \u201cdamn girl where was that power in other scenes before?\u201d Uma Thurman was just chilling in the movie. She was like - yeah lemme take a walk around the set and you capture me occasionally. She looked bored AF. I heard that she wasn\u2019t interested in the project because the shooting schedule kept changing. Can\u2019t really blame her if that\u2019s the case. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t feel right to see a sequel to this movie to be done this way. Old Guard 1 was epic. I\u2019m sad. \n",

It is a gripping mystery layered with secrets, emotional weight and a few unexpected turns along the way. While it may not be the most fast-paced series in the Coben collection, it builds slowly and deliberately, pulling viewers into a web of personal trauma, hidden motives and long-buried truths.\n\nThe story centres around the disappearance of a loved one and the unraveling of the past that follows. It strikes a strong emotional chord while still keeping the tension tight. There is a genuine sense of suspense, and as the puzzle pieces begin to fall into place, the emotional stakes rise alongside the intrigue. It is not just about solving the mystery, it is about how the mystery affects those involved.\n\nThe cast delivers strong performances, with a lead who carries the emotional weight of the story convincingly. The supporting characters are well-placed and relevant without taking the focus away from the central narrative. While some twists may feel familiar to those who know Coben\u2019s formula, the payoff is satisfying and the story feels complete.\n\nWhat sets this apart from other adaptations is its emotional grounding. It focuses just as much on grief, trust and memory as it does on the thrill of uncovering the truth. That balance is what makes it work.\n\nMissing You is a solid entry in the growing library of Coben adaptations. It earns a confident 4 out of 5 for its storytelling, acting and emotional impact.\n\n**Release Date:**\u00a02024\n\n**Genre:**\u00a0Mystery, Drama, Thriller\n\n**Episodes:**\u00a06 episodes (Season 1)\n\n**Rating:**\u00a04 out of 5",

        "content": "I've noticed this with some of the new anime releases on Netflix that are streaming weekly, the episode count is wrong in the hovered preview. For example \"The Summer Hikaru Died,\" only 2 episodes are available but Netflix says there are 3 episodes , and \"Tougen Anki\" only 1 episode is available but it says there are 2. And it's not like these extra episodes even exist yet since they are released on all platforms weekly. It seems like a bug but if it's not I can only guess that it's Netflix's way of showing that another episode is coming?",

        "content": "Hey so I'm having a very strange issue I can't figure out at all. My family has Netflix with three different profiles set up. My sister was going to watch a new show and could not find it when searching or anything, apparently this has also happened with a few other shows as well. However they can see the shows just fine on one of the other profiles. I figured this had something to do with that one profile setting but that doesn't seem to be the case and all of the shows that are missing appeared on the other devices we have. So for some reason only on that one computer, some shows do not show up for that one profile. I am not even sure where to begin to troubleshoot this. Anyone have a solution or idea of what might've caused this??? The 3 specific shows we tried to look for were all anime (Sakamoto days, Violet Evergarden, and Delicious in Dungeon), not sure if this is relevant information at all. It seems like many other anime appear just fine",
