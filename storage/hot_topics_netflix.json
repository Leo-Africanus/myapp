        "content": "So I just finished the series, and at first I thought: what the hell did I just watch? At first I was kinda disappointed that it didn\u2019t turn into a cult revelation thing. But then I thought about it, and it has a lot of depth. Maybe I\u2018m overthinking this, but this series shows us how easy it is to make the women the villain, how to frame them and how we do so easily believe it. Looking back, I just ignored the signs of Kiki being just nice without any agenda. The whole time I expected her behaviour to be calculating and cunning. I  jumped to the conclusion that she must be the bad guy as the show wanted us to believe at first. Even her behaviour contradicting this assumption didn\u2019t sway me at first. But now I see the man who manipulates the viewers perspective. I so easily believed Peter when he talked about his alienation from his kids and it being kikis fault. But when she talked about how small the marriage made her and how horrible the kids were to her, it didn\u2019t quite resonate as much. Frightening tbh, particularly because I would go as far as saying I have definitely and massively educated myself about the patriarchy and intersectional feminism. Maybe I\u2019m interpreting too much, but if you look at it from a feminist perspective then it - amongst other things - shows us the sway of men\u2019s opinion\u2019s still and the smear campaign that always hits the women ten times harder. It shows us the dangers of dependency, especially as a woman. So, I kind of liked the show. I liked how it was over the top mostly and also sometimes even a bit satirical while dealing with heavier topics.  Let me know what you think and what your interpretation is",

Strong narrative, engaging from start to finish, and enough depth to keep you hooked.\n\nThe reason it's an 8/10 is because:\n\n1. It is a bit drawn out, some dialogue and scenes feel unnecessary and 'unreal'- acting didn't make it feel 'real'.\n2. It lacked a sense of urgency, a fear factor. The kind of feeling you get when you\u2019re caught between wanting to witness horror and wanting to escape from it.\n\nIf you haven't watched it, give it a shot. You likely won't be disappointed unless you have Fast &amp; Furious posters in your room.",

That\u2019s really all I can say that\u2019s nice because everyone else\u2019s character was pretty much the exact same or got worse.\n\nPaul: I lost all respect in him. I lost it as soon as he walked up angrily to Georgia and slammed his hand on the wall right next to her head. Before then, I could understand where he was coming from. But to act like that is unacceptable. And he didn\u2019t apologize.\n\nGeorgia: I have so many mixed feelings and thoughts on her. Like she\u2019s selfish but yet she isn\u2019t because she cares deeply for people. She definitely thinks she\u2019s all that. Not like she has money, but like you can\u2019t touch her. Like she could do anything and get away with that. Which is what happened. I couldn\u2019t decide if I thought she deserved to go to prison or not. And not even for the last murder because that one I can actually understand and I wouldn\u2019t have blamed her honestly. But for the other two murders. Like three murders in total is a lot to get away with for a person. \n\nGinny: I really grew to not like her. I didn\u2019t like how judgmental she was on her mom. Like yes, I understood where she was coming from for the most part\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have to be so judgmental. Like let\u2019s understand that your mom had a terrible life and this is all she knew how to survive. And she did everything she thought she could to keep her kids safe and with her. And the way Ginny turned Austin against his dad. Like I know her thought process with everything but still she should have thought about how it would affect her little brother. What she had him do is going to stay with him for the rest of his life. And then obviously the way she treated Maxine. The scene between her and Maxine talking at the party in the last episode. I was not OK with how she was looking at Maxine or the way she talked to her. I lost a lot of respect in ginny because of that. I understand in the show Maxine\u2018s attitude is overwhelming, but the way Ginny acted towards her just wasn\u2019t it for me. I also couldn\u2019t stand how rude Abby was to Maxine either. But that was more predictable and not surprising from Abby. I felt really bad for Maxine and all the stuff she was going through and didn\u2019t have her friends to talk to. I know how that is and it sucks.  So yeah boo Ginny and Abby.",

Why did Kay contact her in the first place? \n\n- So Paula killed Kay just because she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about her daughter? That\u2019s that thread wrapped up? Really?\n\n- The amount of unsafe baby things happening in the show that go completely unmentioned and normalised - infant sleeping in a crib with blankets, mum driving with baby in the front seat (!!!), placing basket bassinet on a ledge and walking away\u2026! What is going on here.\n\n- Did the niece just play along? \n\n- How did Ellen overcome taking all those pills? At this point I was ready for the episode to end o admittedly I was fast forwarding - maybe this is explained and I missed it. \n\n- We\u2019re supposed to believe Ellen just all of a sudden learned/ figured out how to hot wire a car? \n\n- How did the police end up in the library? They didn\u2019t believe Ellen before so why would they now believe it was Paula who took the baby and not Ellen? \n\nI was so excited about this after the first episode so am a bit flabbergasted at how off the rails it got.

It doesn't show up on my homescreen so I have to search for it every time, which is another whole thing, but it also never keeps track of where I have most recently left off. It just has the entire series marked as watched for me, so it doesn't bring up S0105 after I've just watched S0104 for example. Very frustrating process every episode. ",

Idk why I can't seem to get into Ozark when I've heard Soo much about this show. \n\nIs it really not everyone's cup of tea or should I give it another try?  ",

Everyone talks about the Tylenol poisonings but the way the doc weaves in Ray's disappearance from 1978 is seriously haunting.\n\nHe was this retired truck driver who knew James Lewis and then just\u2026 vanished. What they eventually found in his house is wild. And the connection to Lewis is super sketchy.\n\nHonestly feels like this should\u2019ve raised way more red flags back then. Makes the Tylenol case even creepier in hindsight.\n\nAnyone else still thinking about that part? Curious what others make of it, coincidence or something bigger?",
