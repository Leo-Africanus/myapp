        "content": "Generally enjoying the show Victoria, but there is one thing that takes me out of the show every time I notice it. The (gorgeous and talented) actress who plays the queen is wearing the most god awful blue contacts. Everytime she is in the light she literally looks like a twilight vampire with these huge cheap looking contacts sitting unnaturally over her eyes.\n\nOf course I understand that the real queen had large blue eyes, but I hate the way these contacts look and it\u2019s all I can look at in any scene where she\u2019s in the light. No one else on the show has such strange contacts in\u2026 \n\nIt honestly looks like she is wearing gag gift/Halloween costume contact lenses sometimes! Has anyone else noticed this? I am only on season one, so do they get better over time? Or is this something I should just do better ignoring? It seems strange to me that a show that went to such lengths to have amazing costumes, sets, and historical accuracy would allow such a wildly weird element and expect people not to notice. ",

Just uninstalled the movie and the quality resumed. \n\nJust posting this for anyone who searches a similar problem in future. ",

She's so delusional I wouldn't doubt if she thought he was making eye contact with only her.\n\nThose two were absolutely vile in their reasoning for only counting him with two charges.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the grammar error in the title.
