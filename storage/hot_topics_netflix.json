I grew up in Philadelphia with a step dad who owned multiple successful restaurants in the city and Jake reminded me so much of him as he was in the early 2000s. Charming, charismatic, ambitious but underneath, stressed out, under pressure, and constantly worrying about money trying to keep up appearances. Even the staff brought back early memories of my life as a hostess/bartender at some of those restaurants/nightclubs. Very close, very tight knit, but riddled with drug use and drama, and overlooking major red flags. I really appreciated the effort they went through in giving the viewer a realistic representation of that world. ",

        "content": "Watched Coded Bias recently and it raised some serious concerns. The documentary dives into how facial recognition and AI systems aren\u2019t actually neutral at all. Because they\u2019re trained on flawed datasets, they end up making mistakes that disproportionately affect women and people of color.\n\nThe unsettling part is how widely this technology is already being deployed in policing, workplaces, schools, even housing, often without the public really knowing or having much of a say. If these systems are already showing bias, what happens when they become a permanent part of everyday life? AI is often framed as being smarter and more objective than humans, but if it\u2019s just reinforcing the same prejudices at scale, is it really progress? At what point do we step back and question whether some decisions, especially around law enforcement and surveillance, should even be left to algorithms at all?\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s seen it or works with AI, do you think these are just early flaws that can be fixed with better design and regulation, or are we headed toward a future where algorithms quietly shape more of our lives than we realize?",

By doing that, he exposes his identity. Junior\u2019s father learns exactly who he is, and it puts everyone in danger.\n\nIf Vince had just stayed away, no one would have ever been able to confirm for sure that he was the other shooter. Going to the fence with the jewels was basically like announcing, \u201cYes, I was the second robber.\u201d\n\nAm I missing something here?

I watch mostly English and Korean language shows/movies... but now I'm getting constant suggestions for Indian things which I have 0 interest in.  Is there a settings function I'm missing?",
