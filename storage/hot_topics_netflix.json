Look at how interesting the romance felt in heated rivalry compared to people we meet on vacation, heck even Emily in Paris romance arks are better though people are tired of them now.\n\nThis movie while watchable was just not it, there just wasn't really a reason as to why they did not get together earlier . I feel like friends to lovers works only in tv shows, like that is why so many people were shipping Harry and Hermione ( well that is a series of films/books but you get the point ).\n\nThe only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex.\n\nI don't get why Alex was pissed at Poppy for not I guess being more forward with her feelings when um he has a girlfriend and even got engaged to her after they had an emotional moment the previous night ? Like isn't that him running away and not wanting to acknowledge he feelings for Poppy and he is accusing her of running away?\n\nThe ending where Poppy was like \" home is where you re with your person \" was soo juvenile .\n\n  \nEdit : I know I said the \" only redeeming quality was Poppy speaking honestly with Sarah and apologizing for her closeness with Alex but really it was for Alex to have those boundaries , he was the one engaged to Sarah after all , why is it Poppy the one to apologise.

In my country, Stranger Things, My Hero Academia (Anime), etc is given a TV 14 (Early Teens) or TV MA (Late teens) rating sometimes.\n\nI know that TV MA is a rating warning that it contains more extreme violence than TV 14 like stronger nudity scenes, stronger gore, the usage of the F word is used more etc\n\nI watched shows like Weak Hero (KDrama) and it felt TV 14 despite the TV MA rating it got cuz lack of gore and sexual content. The amount of swearing it has makes sense why it got that rating, but other shows with a TV 14 rating even had swearing and more brutal scenes to watch imo. Even some Anime with a rating of TV MA has milder swearing or minimal swearing than other TV 14 shows lol (maybe Anime does have more like others, but it's just mistranslation)",
