To me, they are very unnecessary and very confusing. It ruins the show. One minute he\u2019s paranoid about getting caught hacking and the next he\u2019s hearing voices that aren\u2019t there? Like why? The last straw was the opening of Episode 6. He (i guess) imagined being in a sitcom. Why couldn\u2019t they continue with the hacking greedy corporations storyline without the dad being an imaginative character in Elliot\u2019s head? Like i said, i enjoyed the original concept and am thinking about finishing it but idk? Have any of you finished it? Is it worth it? It just annoys me when writers try so hard to be clever and eccentric with these shows ultimately losing the plot &amp; ruining a good show. ",

All the gang members casually sitting in different places in the building and carelessly having the chit chat of their life without anyone really looking after the hostages. \n\n5. The entire gang was on hostages' mercy that they didn't try to run away. \n\n6. Shouting, abusing and pointing gun towards own gang member and the incharge, and trying to kill them too. \n\n7. Professor getting beaten and tied by a pregnant lady risking the entire heist. \n\n8. No plan on how to get the gang out of the bank. And neither anyone caring about it. ",

First, her mother nearly kills her. Then her dad neglects her to the point where she's starving. THEN she gets taken into foster care and is sexually abused there. \"Stealing\" someone's husband is one of the lesser evils she could have committed given her awful circumstances. It's immoral, of course, but desperation will lead to desperate measures.\n\nDevin is alright. She's had it pretty tough, but Simone arguably had it even worse. Given what we know now, I'm surprised she wasn't a bit more sympathetic towards Simone for not wanting to come home. I don't have too many thoughts on her. \n\nMichaela is fabulous! No notes. Prime example of how \"powerful\" women, or women with a strong presence, are villainized or even suspected to be \"witches\" (the series tricked us into going along with that narrative, when it was Peter pulling the strings all along). \n\nIMO, the main villains are Peter and Bruce (the dad). One intentionally manipulates and tricks people (Peter), and the other was just a neglectful parent who caused irreparable trauma to both his daughters. The main characters are just products of their circumstances. ",

He checks the perimeter and leaves his partner to look at the man\u2019s ankle monitor. The man then tries to kill the partner, but the MC stops him just in time. And guess what happens next? The MC slams him to the ground, then he and his partner just walk away\u2014leaving a man who just attempted sexual assault and murder completely free.\n\nAnother example is in Alice in Borderland. There\u2019s a recurring character who repeatedly tries to rape people, and the group has multiple chances to get rid of him. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but one scene had the main character strangling this guy after he tried to assault what seemed to be his love interest. Yet, instead of finishing it, he just lets him live\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get what kind of message the writers are trying to send here, but it feels like it completely falls flat. Why are they portraying rape like it\u2019s something that can just go unpunished?\n",

        "content": "On half it's my fault as well because I promised myself a long time ago that I wouldn\u2019t start a new series without making sure it\u2019s well-finished and not ending on a cliff-hanger.\n\nBUT...\n\n  \nI sometimes feel like I'm being punished because all the series I've watched so far became my favourites, I could relate them, all them have a unique, strong story that kept me glued to the screen from the beginning, but then its too late when I realise I won't see the end of this story, only can feel a gap inside me caused by the lack of sequel.\n\nBy Netflix: Travelers, Archive 81, The OA, The society\n\nBy Fox: Wayward Pines (yes its in Disney's hand now and they could had finished it if they'd had cared at all but no)\n\n  \nI know the sad reality that in this greedy capitalist world is all about the money how much they can take, but in the end of the day always the fans get the short end of the stick. When we read the news about the series being cancelled, what the first line tells about most of the time? The viewership has drastically decreased. I'm asking you that whose fault is that? \n\nIt's on me or on you who actually enjoyed the series and wanted more, or it's on the directors, creators, producers, executive producers, the very people whose job it is to specialize in this industry and create works that can stand the test of time in front of a wide audience without having to abandon them at the first bump in the road? In a normal parallel universe, they wouldn\u2019t just give up but would find a solution to the problem.\n\nI understand it\u2019s not easy to satisfy millions of people unilaterally according to your own vision, especially when it comes to film/TV production, but I don\u2019t think the solution is to throw all that work in the trash and never look back. That\u2019s not how you grow or learn. Instead, if everyone sat down and carefully discussed what could be done differently, how to carry the storyline forward in a way that brings viewers back, or even gains new ones, it would elevate them to a higher pedestal for being able to rise above and set aside their grievances. \n\nIn the long run, this would pay off, not only financially (for their own pockets), but professionally as well.  \nYes, I know there are numerous other factors why a show could be dropped. *The Society* and a few others were left hanging due to COVID-19. But that was years ago, then why haven\u2019t they picked it back up since then? Is it because these shows are too unique, and they prefer mass-producing cookie-cutter content that doesn\u2019t require much thought or effort? That\u2019s part of it.\n\nIf they stopped the mass production machine and quit churning out the same series every year with a different coat of paint, new actors, and new locations, and instead went back to the roots to fix their mistakes, they could actually finish the abandoned shows. And there are plenty of them.\n\nI'm asking you reader if you've watched these series I mentioned above, how did you like it? How'd you feel when you found out there won't be a sequel?",
