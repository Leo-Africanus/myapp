        "content": "My God! This show is so fucked. In mere 4 episodes, the show manages to tackle huge issues like the evil of social media among younger generation, the consequences of it, the legal system of a nation and the family which suffers through it all.\n\nThe cinematography and the music is intense. Check out the soundtrack by Aaron May and David Ridley. Stephen Graham is a mad actor! The other actors have done a great job and the overall production is a beautiful piece of art. They shot entire episodes in a single take! \n\nThe finale of the episode will tug at your heart strings. You can't stop from feeling the dread of the family. Stephen really outside himself in this episode, he better have an Emmy or atleast a nomination. I nearly cried, he portrays the emotion in such a devastating way that you may have to look away. \n\nI found the series highly engrossing. It draws you in and let's you do the work of filling in the gaps as a viewer, really makes you think. Most Netflix shows have been mid for me for the past couple of years, I haven't loved a Netlix show as much as this one in a long while. Do give it a watch.\n",

The back and forth, the one-take, the expressions, the physicality, the _craft._ I gave this episode \na standing ovation in my room because it deserves it and soooo much more. The way both the actress and the child actor did their scenes... I am truly speechless. Their talent is astounding and apparent and so compelling. The range of emotion, the humanity in the twistedness of Jaime, the eventual realisation and coming-to-terms of the psychiatrist, the way the spectrum of Jaime\u2019s character was shown without disarming clarity. \n\nI will never ever forget this episode. I thought the first two were amazing but this one. Goddamn. God fucking damn. Some actors are just meant to be and I hope this boy goes far and I hope him and the actress earn their flowers (I will look them up once I\u2019m done with episode 4 but I just HAD to spew my thoughts out about episode 3 first. The writing, the dialogue, the camerawork, direction, cinematography all are spectacular in their own right but I feel like in such a claustrophobic setting as the third episode, it couldn\u2019t have worked so magically had lesser actors been on the job so just appreciating that aspect here primarily).

But honestly episode 2 hit me harder. The power the kids had over the adults. The fucking hurt and rage of Jade. The sheer magnitude of having 100+ child actors doing their job effortlessly for a full hour. The CAMERA WORK (a literal seamless transition from ground to drone). The fluctuations between tight, emotional portraits to clinical medium to wide shots. The acting all around from, what\u20267 leads? It was an absolute masterclass in filmmaking and already is in my top episodes of any TV show, ever. I am completely marveled.",

It got to be a bit too much after awhile. Maybe I outgrew it, but it\u2019s great to see how wrestling was in those days. A reminder of young pop culture. If anyone has ever been a WWF/WWE, this is a must watch.",

I didn't like the writing and overall series but she definitely carried the series. I watch a lot of mysteries mainly British and this wasn't really a mystery but a dramedy.",
