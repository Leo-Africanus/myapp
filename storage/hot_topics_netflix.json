My phone is Huawei P30 Lite and the DRM control application that I downloaded from the Appstore shows Widevine L1, but Netflix shows L3 and does not play Netflix content in HD. Now I have observed that the same thing is happening on my PC, the image quality is very low in both the Chrome browser and Netflix app under Windows, movies play in a garbage resolution like 576p. PC was not like this before. Why do we need to try to find a solution even though we are legal members of a paid platform? Where did this nonsense come from? While there are no restrictions if we watch from torrent or any other pirated platform, Netflix that we pay and subscribe to only works in full HD on my Xbox One and Xiaomi Mi Box, it is not certain that they will not close them soon, fuck drm and this illogical situation\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtr0kvpti01e1.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02fcca63de599813a003073e5e88e9ad1742a955\n\n  \n",

        "content": "For as long as I've had a netflix account, I shared it with my parents since I lived in their household.   Even when I moved out 12 years ago, I moved into a condo that they owned, and paid them rent.   They used to come out and stay with me for 3-4 months out of the year, until my father passed in 2020.   \n\nUntil recently I was traveling back and staying with my mother for 5-6 months each year, to help her out.   Last time I went back to my place, Netflix forced me to either have her locked out of her profile until I visited again, or I could pay for an extra member.   I did the latter.  \n\nAnd now I've moved back in with my mother, to help take care of things, and want to have her profile transfered back.   I've been told this is impossible, and the only options I have result in her profile getting deleted.   \n\nThat can't be right is it?   If an account can be transfered from one email to another, why can't it be transfered back?   Especially when, the uts the main account thats paying for everything and according to Netflix own rules, we're in the same household now!",
