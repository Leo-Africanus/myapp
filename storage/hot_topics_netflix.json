It was a fairly popular movie with a good number of fans. Do you guys think this is a case of trying to ensure a good product or finding some excuse to bury it for tax purposes at some point? It's been ~~84~~ 5 years almost since the first movie... \n\n[https://m.imdb.com/news/ni65065549/?ref\\_=nmnw\\_art\\_plk](https://m.imdb.com/news/ni65065549/?ref_=nmnw_art_plk) has some more info on this rumor.",

Then she finds out that not only was the ex fianc\u00e9, who abandoned her and broke her heart, was the one who killed her dad. But that her best friend (who had lied to her before) WITNESSED IT. I realized then that the show was pretty much over so I was waiting to see her reaction. \n\nShe was gonna at least yell at the ex, right? WRONG. She reaches over after a few seconds and holds his hand. \n\nWhat the actual hell? \n\nThe show was pretty all over the place to begin with. The weird dog breeder plot, The detective constantly being lied to by her closest friends and family, All these forced \u201ctwists\u00a0and turns\u201c about Josh that turned out to have nothing to do with him etc. \n\nI guess I should\u2019ve kept my expectations low lol but I at least expected an ending that would be a teeny bit satisfying.

I like intelligent and well written shows, where u get deeply involved with the characters and story and where there's also something important at stake, like real world issues. I have liked and like more comfort shows like The Office, Parks and Rec, Curb etc., but they tend to bore me in the end and feel a bit superficial/like a waste of time so that's not what I'm looking for. I would like something to really dig deep into, something that'll engange me and something that's preferebly about real world issues/power/politics/business.\n\nI've enjoyed Succession, BB, Better Caul Saul, Game of Thrones, House of Cards to name a few, and have lately been giving Mad Men a shot (currently in the last episode of season 1, but not really feeling it). Debating whether to start West Wing/The Newsroom/The Wire/Billions/Six Feet Under instead.\n\nAnything u can recommend? Would greatly appreciate it :))",

But I don\u2019t think that was the point.\n\nI think the point of the film was to get at the heart of how this show, that loved the numbers it drew from shocking the public - because they literally wanted people to stop flipping the channel when they passed by and it worked - and how the impact of seeing people violent and pitted against each other had a horrible influence on all of us.\n\nWe see reality TV shows still push the boundaries in different ways, but they feed off of making us disconnect from our own lives and play comparison - at least my life isn\u2019t that bad!\n\nBut we are further seeing the psychological impacts on our everyday lives in the political world. We are losing our empathy for each other when we are all each deeply shaped by our life experiences. I get that everyone is different, but we\u2019ve become so divided and I have no doubt that Jerry Springer among other reality shows, among other factors in the media are doing an excellent job at feeding our apathy. We aren\u2019t each other\u2019s enemies. It\u2019s the people at the top who are playing mind games. We aren\u2019t going to see the change we long for until we stop turning on each other.\n\nThis is what I got out of the film at least. Anyone else?",

        "content": "SOLVED!!\n\nI need your help in finding an older medieval tv series. I can't remember the name of it and all my searches have come up short.  It was on Netflix for awhile, still could be.  It had a number/year for the name. It was a medieval/kings/magic type show. \n\nHere come some spoilers, so if you have watched it then you know - \n\nIt is a story about 3 friends. 2 are dating, and the other was adopted by a king. Long story short - as I remember the three of the them come up with a plan. The female in the couple agree to \"fake\" marry the friend to save the kingdom or something... there is a battle - she thinks her boyfriend is dead, so she and new hubby really start looking at each other as husband and wife - then find out bro isn't dead... there is a big battle at the end of the series - chick finds out she is preggers with bro's baby....\n\nWhat was that series called?\n\nThank you!! \n\nEdit: Much thanks to everyone who took time out of your days to help me find this! The show is called Barbarians! Thanks @ExitStageRight99",
