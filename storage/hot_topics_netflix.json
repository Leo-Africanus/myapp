I do not share my account outside my household. Last night it happened again but only on my PC.\n\nI do not have location hidden. I am using a wired connection through the same Wi-Fi box it wants me to sign into. I have a high-end PC and use Ethernet because it gives the best connection. I have Comcast for internet and cable. Netflix is part of my plan and I pay extra for an upgraded version through Comcast.\n\nThis only happens on my PC. It does not happen on the TV, Fire Stick, or Comcast box. My PC is in a different room and I like to play shows while I work.\n\nWhat made it more frustrating is that Netflix sends a code by email that expires in 15 minutes. Each time the email took around 20 minutes to arrive. After five failed tries it made me wait 24 hours before I could try again.\n\nI checked and the only devices connected are inside the house. Does anyone else have to deal with this nonsense.   ",

Other platforms manage to stream with ads via Chromecast\u2014so why can\u2019t Netflix? Seriously??\n\nToo bad\u2014I\u2019m voting with my feet. No more Meghan and Harry nonsense.

        "content": "I'm hard of hearing, to some extent (mental disability, not physical. My ears are fine, but I have difficulty processing words that are said), so I strongly rely on subtitles for a lot of shows.\n\nUsually it's fine, but Netflix struggles hard with them, where even Youtube's auto generated subtitles tend to be more reliable in some cases.\n\nSome animes I've watched through Netflix ended up just being confusing due to poor translation, but even fully english content has serious\\* flaws.  \n  \n\\*serious in the case of my disability, as I can still hear the word fine, I just take longer than usual to register it.   \nWhat this means, is if I want to keep up with what's happening on screen, I need subtitles so I'm not in the dark about what's happening in the moment. However, if I read a word and \\*do not hear\\* the same thing, my brain just stutters, and I feel like I'm tripping over my own comprehension.\n\nTo memory, the most recent case was The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, by Wes Anderson. The subtitles were missing words, adding words, and in some cases just changing the context of this \\*very\\* deliberately composed film.  \nIt was one of the few cases I've ever decided to turn off the subtitles and just accept that I'm going to be behind on the words.\n\nFrom what I understand, far more people are using subtitles recently, especially with so much media becoming more \"mumbly\" with their dialogue.  \nIn this world, where subtitle usage is growing more and more, what is it about Netflix that causes them to fall so far behind?\n\nI have DVDs with subtitles on them that are more accurate than the exact same movie on Netflix. Why can't they just use the perfectly usable and accurate subtitles from the DVD, or wherever they get it from?\n\nEspecially with their own productions, don't they \\*own the script\\*? Can't they just pull the actor's lines from that, and call it a day? Surely that would be better than whatever it is they're doing now.",

This case has truly haunted me ever since bc of how blatant the failure of child services and complete lack of justice + lenient sentencing of the murderers were\n\nSecrets We Keep follows the exact same storyline as the Tiahleigh Palmer case. Tia was a 12 yo foster child living with the Thorburn family in Logan City and just like in the series she was being raped and abused by her then 19 yo foster brother Trent Thorburn, who again like in the show got her pregnant. that rapist pos panicked someone would find out and told his parents who then decided to kill Tia and dispose of her body in a river or lake (again just like with Ruby who was  raped by Oscar and murdered by the Hoffmans + her body disposed in a lake). Trent confided in his cousin about the pregnancy just as Oscar showed Viggo a video of him abusing Ruby.\n\nThe father, Rick Thorburn, was the only one who received a life sentence while the murderous mother and son served only a few months in jail. That monster never cracked under pressure to tell the full story even tho all evidence also implicated the mother + the son. since he was the one who physically killed Tia and disposed of her body he was the only one held fully accountable. He actually died recently on april 12 in prison (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/12/child-killer-rick-thorburn-who-murdered-tiahleigh-palmer-found-dead-in-queensland-jail-cell-ntwnfb)\n\nThis case is so fucking sad, i really wish Netflix would acknowledge that the series clearly mirrors tia story and at least state that it's inspired by a true case bc those horrible stories do happen irl. Tia never got justice and was failed by everyone around her, I just hope shes at peace now. I\u2019m so incredibly sad and angry that the whole system failed her in every way possible \n\n\n",

If you watched the show all the way through, would you say it\u2019s worth watching till the end because i\u2019ve heard it ends on a cliffhanger. I don\u2019t want to be disappointed in the end because I\u2019m loving it so far. \n\n",

        "content": "just want everyone to know real twinflames are not what Jeff and Shaleia are, I feel like after watching escaping twinflames on Netflix I need to shed light on the real truth about twinflames, not the lies that Jeff and Shaleia have said and created about twinflames\n\nwhat Jeff and Shaleia from Twin Flames Universe are doing is not okay. They are not real twin flames, and their teachings lie about what this connection is truly about. A twin flame connection isn\u2019t about being sexually available to someone every day or focusing on just physical aspects or trying to stalk them, when this is a SPIRITUAL CONNECTION   MEANT FOR SPIRITUAL, GROWTH, AWAKENING, AND ENLIGHTENMENT, AND AWAKENING TO THE DIVINE AND UNIVERSE, SIGNS AND SYNCHRONCITYS, NOT FAIRYTALE ROMANCE OR CRAZY PHYSICAL ACTIONS \n\nIt\u2019s meant to help both souls evolve, not to control One another. I\u2019m saying this to bring awareness and protect others from being misled. Even if you don\u2019t believe in twin flames, I'm saying this to also remind people that no spiritual journey should ever be sold, forced, or twisted into something harmful.\n  \nYou can\u2019t buy your way into meeting your twin flame. It happens only through divine timing  soul readiness, and if your soul chose to be a twinflame before this lifetime no person, course, coach can control or gurantee that. \n\nWhich again twinflame connections aren't guaranteed romantic love forever the main purpose about them are spiritual awakening. \n\nREAL TWINFLAMES ARE NOT THE ONES THAT WILL ENCOURAGE OR JUSTIFY STALKING BEHAVIORS, SEXUAL PLEASURE NO MATTER WHAT, CHANGING YOUR GENDER OR BECOME A CULT / ARE A CULT, that is NOT what true twinflames do or are about. \n\n\n I wanted to also say all this because I am a true twin flame and I want people to be aware as I found it unfair for true twinflames like me and others ON THIS SPIRITUAL JOURNEY. \n\nEven if you don't believe in real twinflame connections or care about them I just wanted everyone to be aware of this real truth.

        "content": "I paid for the 1080p tier and now I barely ever get a chance to stream at the bitrate I paid for. Did y'all just accept this and move on with subpar quality? I am so close to cancelling at this rate. I have closed my netflix tab several times past few days cause I am getting forced on near unwatchable quality. It puts me on 960x540 or lower. Any help appreciated.",
