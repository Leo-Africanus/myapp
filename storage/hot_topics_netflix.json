        "content": "My mum had a Netflix account that when I moved out she transferred to me through change of email. She still makes payments and I was able to log in with no problem on my smart TV and iPad. \n\nAfter a while (maybe after updates to the app) I was logged out of the account on my iPad and no longer able to log back in. This is something I just ignored for a long time as I was still able to watch on my TV. \n\nI am about to travel and would like to be able to watch Netflix away from home so, again,  tried logging in on my iPad. I\u2019m told neither me or my mums email address are linked to an account, I\u2019ve tried with both of our phone numbers and we get the same response \u201cno account linked to these numbers\u201d. We have also tried the option of using her debit card where payments are still taken monthly as it\u2019s the \u201ccan\u2019t remember email or phone number\u201dlast resort option, same response. \n\nWe called Netflix customer service today and she just ran us through the exact same process. She was quite adamant that no account exists and that we must be reading number wrong as there is no way that they couldn\u2019t locate the account with her debit card account number. We\u2019ve been through this process multiple times and the lady ended up telling us that there\u2019s nothing she can do for us. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to go from here as the account definitely exists, I can still watch Netflix on my TV and a monthly payment is still being taken. Is there any way we can get money back, someone higher up than the call centre to email? Or do we just have to suck it up, close the account and create a new one? \n\nWe are in England for context and I\u2019m not angry at the customer service lady, I know they\u2019re trained to read off scripts and can only do what they can do.
