Anton posted with a new girl? What is happening that these shows have no element of surprise anymore? I thought they used to have to sign a contract. I think it has to do with their long draw out on weekly episodes, but that\u2019s just me. Air the season all at once!!! ",

If I am watching a series on Netflix and choose the program, it used to open a screen where you can view the different episodes/add to watchlist/view similar etc. You then had an option to play it. It now starts auto-playing whenever you select an item and you have to go to an option on the screen to see an episode list. This happens on Apple TV and Google TV. \n\nIs there any way to turn this really annoying feature off? I've turned off previews in the profile but that makes no difference - it actually starts playing the item everytime.",

You know, you may be wondering why I am actually here, typing this text, however I have been interested in the real answers for some time.\n\nHow is it possible, that Interstellar is not in 4K option?\n\nOr even better question is.... HOW many movies are you able to find that are in 4K available on Netflix? Just find some spare time to search throughout the genres and movies and series and try to do some math and calculation. For an example, search through random 100 movies and write in the comment section the actual result of 4k movies that you find.\n\nI mean, this cannot be serious. I pay 14-15 EURO a month so I can watch movies in 4K and actually there are only a few out of hundreds. How is this possible?\n\nWhose idea was to put Interstellar on Netflix with that trashy resolution? What is it? FHD? Where's 4K? Where's the IMAX 4K version so I can enjoy that? I am currently at the 36th minute and the quality of face is like painted out of Minecraft game.\n\nDo you have any explanation why I am not seeing titles in 4K, but rather old-trashy FHD? So why am I even paying for 4K when like all movies I have watched so far, were not in 4K at all....",

Sometimes the show does play but takes ages for it to load(I have a 750mbps connection)\n\nThis just started today and only happens on my local network. I've already reset my router + modem, confirmed it happens on all devices(apple tv, fire tv, phone) though I restarted these devices and even reinstalled netflix.\n\nNetflix works on my 5G connection.\n\nMy ISP says they are unable to see any issues on their network. I worked with them, they checked the screenshot of the issue, HAR file, etc. Everything else works as well - all websites, steam, prime, twitch, etc. It's really just netflix on my home connection. It worked with no issues for years.\n\nNetflix support was frustrating to say the least. I just learned they can't even receive a screenshot and was just asked to restart my router, device, everything I already did. I did anyway but yeah no dice.\n\nAnyone experienced the same thing?\n\nImage for reference [https://ibb.co/sJVSgcNB](https://ibb.co/sJVSgcNB)\n\nI mean it almost seems as if there's something in my local network that is blocking Netflix but I checked my Netgear router and I do not see any armor turned on, nor any content filter or any filters at all. Not sure what else I am missing.\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any advice. ",

        "content": "Why is every single show on Netflix excessively sexualized with nudity and sex scenes? My girlfriend and I have noticed that this trend is prevalent on Netflix, and it\u2019s actually concerning that there aren\u2019t many TV shows or movies that don\u2019t include nudity or sex scenes.\n\nWhen discussing this with my girlfriend, my defense was always, \u201cIt\u2019s fake, they\u2019re not really having sex!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s become so normalized in TV shows and movies that I can watch those types of scenes with my parents without feeling awkward.\u201d\n\nHowever, she pointed out that we\u2019re so accustomed to this content that we perceive it as completely normal, even though it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want to sit with my partner and watch soft-core pornography or implied pornography in a regular TV show or movie. She contended that women no longer need to be concerned about their partners watching pornography because they can easily watch TV shows or movies on streaming platforms like Netflix (the most popular option).\n\nI understand that audiences can become desensitized to certain scenes over time, so they need to intensify them every few years. I support this approach for violence and gore, but not for sex. They can imply sex without explicitly showing it, and we don\u2019t have a problem with that. Why can\u2019t they imply a couple having sex by making out, partially removing clothing, and then transitioning to a scene where they\u2019re lying in bed cuddling? That would be more acceptable, and we wouldn\u2019t be having these conversations. These days, we\u2019re watching pornography with plots in TV shows and movies, which is quite disappointing",
