At the time, the version of the Netflix app on her cable box was only able to use the primary account. Her show preferences were polluting my watch history and recommendations so I set up a new profile for myself. With me an the rest of the local profiles, I've reached the maximum number of profiles on the account. Now that Netflix is cracking down on shared accounts, and wants me to use the \"add extra member\" option, they need to find a way to allow the primary profile to become the extra member.",

Parents have an older TV, so we can't access Netflix directly anymore, only through the Xfinity platform. So anyway, I chose the standard plan with no ads. But Xfinity forced us to the plan with ads. I tried a few days in a row to change this myself and Netflix tried too. We were both \"denied\" and bumped back to Standard with ads immediately. Xfinity said next month we would be on the regular standard/no ads plan. Netflix can unlink us but then parents gotta learn Roku stick navigation. This is so annoying and no one at Xfinity (talked to 3 or 4 different reps) could tell me why this happened. Anyone know? And wtf why can Xfinity deny my choice to begin with?",

        "content": "I remember when 'Kinda Pregnant' with Amy Schumer released last month and for like two weeks straight it was showing as #1 on the trending movies and I just, straight up don't believe it. This isn't like some big takedown or the tired trope of \"Amy Schumer is horrible and no one likes women comedians\". Her movies aren't usually my cup of tea but I'm not here to hate. \n\nThis one though, I just cannot believe it was actually number one. Especially with the scene that auto plays when you stay on it too long. It's hard for me to even imagine a demographic that would see that and decide to spend the next hour and a half watching it. Let alone enough to make it #1 for 2 weeks straight. So I guess I'm asking if anyone else feels like they just lie about the numbers to push their newest originals? If they put it as #1 someone might at least give it a try. Or do y'all think I'm just way off base here and imagining things or out of touch. \n\nAgain to reiterate, I have a wide range of movies I'll watch and enjoy, even some of the Netflix original movie slop has its merrit for just turning your mind off and having a little fun. See 'Red Notice'. All this to see I don't just hate the actress or the genre, but still, this looks even worse than their normal original slop. ",
