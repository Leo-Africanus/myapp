There is no character build up. \n\nThis series is very vague and all over the place the only reason I kept watching was because users on here said the ending was a plot twist.

        "content": "I just finished the last episode, and I believe the show was intended to be more of a social commentary, almost borderline satire. I didn\u2019t hate it but didn\u2019t love it either. At first I was getting annoyed by the clear inaccuracies, or embellishments and what seemed like lazy writing. It feels more like the show was designed to critique modern fascination with blood lust, and the twisting of stories by the media, authors, writers, movies, etc. for entertainment. The girlfriend seemed more like a schizophrenic hallucination or possibly a symbol of a textbook female lover in a horror story. She didnt feel like a real character. Her dialogue was off, she was inconsistent, and unrealistic. I think that was the point. They didn\u2019t want to spell the underlying message out for the viewers. \n\nNow with all that said, I wish they didn\u2019t go about it this way. This show had real potential to be great. It was shot well, the music was good, good actors, interesting dialogue at times, the real story was crazy enough. But there were many scenes that were forced in there with no significance. Pulling you out of the story and into one of Ryan Murphy\u2019s strange fantasies. Also the title is misleading, the title \u201cThe Ed Gein Story\u201d gives the impression this is a somewhat accurate representation of the actual Ed Gein Story. It is far from that. While i finished the show, i lost interest halfway through episode 6. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Watch Mindhunter or American Primeval instead lol. \n",

ESPECIALLY in season 2 episode 7, where we had Heiya straight up take a full mag of a machine gun and survive HOURS later (while funnily enough, Ann \"died\" from two shots).\n\nNiragi was by far the craziest example. Dude got lit on fire, fell off the building into the pool, tackled into a burning building, was coughing up blood all of seaosn 2 and then took a shotgun blast, ALL of which he survived.\n\nWhat I love so much is that the show ACTUALLY has an explination for such insane plot armor; the will to live. The Borderland's are a test of how much each character wants to survive (the games). The stronger your will, the more likely you are to live. That's why someone like Heiya can take so much punishment, because she's made it clear she does NOT intend to die\n\nIt makes moments when you're on rewatch hit different, like when Usagi tells Arisu in episode 2 \"I know I'll do anything to stay alive\".",

        "content": "First off, all of these girls are much more talented than 99% of people in the world. They are the most talented of the talented, and would completely blow average joe or sue out of the water in terms of musical ability. So when I am criticizing these girls, i'm criticizing them relative to other girls on the show.\n\n**Brooklyn:**\u00a0Brooklyn always seemed out of place compared to the other girls. She was like a cross country runner in a room full of sprinters, she just seemed like she didn't belong. That doesn't mean she was untalented, it just meant that she didn't fit the overall vibe compared to other girls. I think that's a big reason why she was eliminated so early.\n\n**Iliya**: She was similar to Brooklyn in that she seemed like a cross country runner trying to be a sprinter, meaning she seemed out of place compared to the other girls. There's no doubt that Iliya is a talented singer, but she doesn't fit the k-pop vibe. I feel like she'd have been a more successful solo artist instead.\n\n**Emily:**\u00a0Emily has a very distinctive look about her. Her face is distinctive looking but not in an unappealing sort of way. No doubt, she is a very talented dancer and was easily the best out of the entire group. I could see her becoming a very good backup dancer somewhere.\n\n**Karlee:**\u00a0I think she was eliminated simply because she's a step or two lower compared to other girls. She didn't stand out as being attractive, didn't stand out as being a really good dancer, or stand out as being a really good singer. There were girls who were simply better looking and more talented compared to her across all aspects. Her chances of making the final squad were going to be low.\n\n**Lexi:**\u00a0Lexi had such a cute and innocent looking face and demeanor about her. Her face is quite cute and neotenous and when combined with her soft spoken personality, this made her stand out in terms of charisma and star power. While not a top singer or top dancer, she was good enough to not look completely out of place. If she'd have never left, she probably would have made the team.\n\n**Hinari:**\u00a0I didn't see anything wrong with Hinari but I think she was a little bit too young. If she'd have been a couple years older, she may have had a better chance of making it.\n\nThat's everyone who stood out to me.\n\n",

        "content": "Just finished rewatching Catch Me If You Can and I keep getting stuck on how much of Abagnale\u2019s success relied on people trusting a confident story and paper records. He forges checks, pretends to be pilots and doctors, and basically wins on smooth talk, timing, and exploiting gaps in how institutions verified things back then. Looking at 2025, there are two clear directions. Modern banks, airlines, and employers have more automation, KYC checks, instant database lookups, and cross-referenced ID services that can flag fakes in seconds. A fake resume or a paper letter seems much harder to use to fool those systems. Digital trails and audit logs make it easier to trace and stop suspicious activity.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a huge amount of real personal data out there from breaches and data brokers, and that can be stitched together to build very believable identities ( I myself try and remove and monitor these with privacy apps like Cloaked). Deepfakes and AI can clone voices or make convincing video snippets. Human trust is still a major vulnerability: social engineering works because people rush, want to help, or assume an authority figure is legitimate. A modern operator could combine old-school charm with new tech  build an online persona first, then use carefully timed phone or in-person moves to close the deal. Some targets would be harder today and others are still shockingly soft. Big finance, enterprise HR, and major airlines are much tighter. Small hospitals, local businesses, and customer-support teams at smaller services often rely on phone calls and quick checks, which feels like low-hanging fruit. Logistics and delivery systems can also be manipulated if you know the right touchpoints.\n\nMy mental image of a 2025 Abagnale is someone who layers things: scraped data to bootstrap a backstory, polished social media and LinkedIn history, AI-generated voice clips for cold calls, and then a confident in-person moment where people fill in the blanks. Or it could be less theatrical and more distributed: exploit gaps in onboarding flows, trick CS systems, and collect many small wins across dozens of targets instead of one big caper.  \nWould a charismatic impersonator still pull it off today, or has tech made that kind of con obsolete? If someone tried something like this now, where would you expect them to succeed first and where would modern verification stop them quickly? Any examples of modern scams that felt like a Catch Me If You Can remake but for the internet age?",

Nothing else going on in the outside world. Completely just a writer\u2019s fantasy. Typical cringe shit-ass show, similar to Indian serials, lol.",
