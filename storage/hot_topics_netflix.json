I know De Niro has a lot of alimony to pay but it's sad to see him in sub par tv shows like this.",

        "content": "Tell me it's Havana Syndrome without telling me it's Havana Syndrome was a subtle and brilliant move by Netflix in Zero Day. It was very interesting to see that they dared bring this sensitive topic to life as the US government finally admitted that there is indeed such a thing and it's officially referred to as anomalous health incidents (AHI).\n\nTo the naked eye, viewers who aren't really in the know would see the symptoms as something related to more exposed mental issues such as Dementia, Alzheimers or even Schizophrenia. Netflix did a great job there. The alternative of directly confirming that it was Havana Syndrome would have been terrifying for inquiring minds. Leaving the culprit to the viewers's interpretation was mindful. The thought of goverments having the capability to remotely mess with people's brains is best left in the Sci-Fi, Horror or Dystopian genres. \n\nIn general Zero Day and the topics discussed are beyond most people's comprehension of possibilities and capabilities meeting real-life. There were obvious political points that distract viewers from the overall themes given our current political climate. This will obviously lead to negative reviews from those who are too passionate about their political affiliations to see the series as anything other that political propaganda pushing conspiracy theories. A risk that Netflix willingly took for the greater good?\n\nThere were some things that were the product of a bit of research and imagination. Other things were clear political warnings of the IFs.\n\nIn the end, I sincerely wondered who the real consultants for Zero Day were. Some things in Zero Day were too real for comfort. ",

So, occasionally, I check and see where to watch it in hopes that they\u2019ll get added to a service that we already pay for. \n\nImagine my shock today when I looked up the Mr Peabody and Sherman Show and there was an official Netflix page that lead me to the app where I could push the remind me button. I was ecstatic! My girl and I could watch our silly cartoons again! Until I looked closer and found zero other information on these shows coming back online. \n\nDoes this mean that the show is coming back or have I been bamboozled?
