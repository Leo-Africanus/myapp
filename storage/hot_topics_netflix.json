Seeing people's personal backgrounds and giving us a reason to like the band. Them all posting on social media in real time as promo. They could've budgeted this by cutting out the whole LA trip and doing all that stuff in the uk as I mentioned for episode2. \n\nInstead it feels rushed. Doesn't seem like they mix well together - Nicolas and john shouldn't have to change their personalities just to fit in, that's obviously not gonna work long term. \n\nAlso 90% of simons comments are about how they look and their age lol which just feels creepy but suppose if they'd cut that out they wouldn't have any footage of him left. \n\nWhen they refer to it as a documentary, and the footage of his family life, I think they potentially had a different plan for what they wanted it to look like but either changed their minds or did it badly.

I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

        "content": "Watching the show for the first time. Pretty decent. Solid 7. Some unsatisfying plot holes though. Just thought I would create a list of them here. Feel free to add more in the comments. \n\nEPISODE 4 : Lorna's Death\n\nPeter and Rose meet Lorna, who clearly understands that there\u2019s a massive conspiracy and that assassins Dale and Ellen are hunting anyone connected to it. Lorna even carries a shotgun and helps Peter and Rose with intelligence they uncovered, which shows she\u2019s competent and aware of danger. Yet, despite knowing that she\u2019s now a potential target \u2014 with Dal\u200be and Ellen actively tracking their movements \u2014 she chooses to return to her isolated home alone with no backup, no protection from authorities, and no attempt to stay with Peter or Rose, even though she could have at least sought safety or helped defend them. Her decision makes little logical sense given what she knows, and it feels like a classic \u201cplot hole\u201d or plot\u2011induced stupidity moment where the story advances only because a capable character inexplicably makes an implausible choice. \n\nEPISODE 5 : Peter and Rose Don't Check Their Car For Bugs or Bombs After Leaving Georgetown Library \n\nPeter and Rose uncover the conspiracy tying the metro bombing to Turn Lake Industries  whose CEO, Gordon Wick, donates heavily to Vice President Ashley Redfield, suggesting Redfield may be involved in the cover\u2011up and potentially even behind the assassination scheme. They research this at the Georgetown University library, and it\u2019s clear that the stakes are enormous: the Vice President\u2019s daughter Maddie goes to Georgetown, her Secret Service detail knows Rose and Peter are there, and Redfield\u2019s position implicates the White House itself in the conspiracy, and that he has likely reported their location to Dale and Ellen. Despite this, and despite the fact that Dale and Ellen are already tracking them (a tracker is placed on their car), Peter and Rose leave the library without checking for bugs, calling for backup, switching vehicles, or taking any obvious security precautions, even though they know they\u2019re likely now fully compromised and in danger. It reads like an idiot\u2011plot moment where real tactical instincts and basic spycraft are ignored just to keep the narrative moving forward \u2014 your classic \u201ccharacters would never behave this way if they actually understood the risk.\n\nEPISODE 7 : Peter and Rose Are Discovered At The Pier With Jim's Boat \n\nPeter and Rose both know that Peter has been incriminated for the kidnapping of Maddie. Logically Peter is being thoroughly investigated and his apartment is being combed over by multiple agencies. Peter knows this because he's trained in counterintelligence. He must know that there is clear evidence tying him to his Godfather Jim. Peter must know that his Godfather Jim will very likely be interviewed. From there it would be easy to make the connection between his Godfather Jim and locations that they frequented together which might be isolated. Once again we have a plot hole where Peter who displays many characteristics of a very careful meticulous and intelligent FBI agent once again not displaying those characteristics in order to move the plot forward. It's not very satisfying for the audience when characters who are supposed to be more intelligent than they are act like idiots and you have elements of an idiot plot where the way the plot moves forward is characters act like idiots. \n\nEPISODE 10 : Arrington And Maddie Discuss Contacting President Travers Within Earshot Of Fake Secret Service Agent Walter\n\nKind of a silly plot hole here. After Maddie and Arrington leave the chopper and get on to golf carts to be taken to the actual residential buildings in Camp David they discuss how Maddie should tell Travers her life is in danger when Maddie meets Travers. Walter the agent Arrington already knows is a fake secret service agent after having tested them on the chopper ride is sitting directly behind Maddie and Arrington well within earshot while they are discussing warning Travers. So the guy who is bringing a bomb in a suitcase to kill Travers is within earshot of two women who are discussing warning Travers. And yet both of them aren't isolated immediately? Arrington isn't silenced immediately? I'm sorry this makes no sense. \n\nI still like the show it's got good pacing, but I can't deny the idiot plot elements are irritating. ",
