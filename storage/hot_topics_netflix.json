And then the first episode of the show \n\nWtf? I excited and picked up where it left off and then it did play til the actual end. But why would they do this? Just so you\u2019re on Netflix more?

The woman was refered to as a \"8th\" Jinn or a ???\u00bf Jinn had a favorite \"book of Jinns\". \n\n She was given The reference from a book she loved a child. Or a book her father or grandfather read to her. ( they visit this person on a cemetery). \n\nThere was a British or French MI6 or Intelligence woman attempting to gain her trust.   Was acting as a friend but really wanted to turn her over to the government,bcshe was a \"known Assassin\". \n\nThey traveled from European country to country in hiding. And fighting....but caring about each other. And sharing life experiences. About their kids, and lovers and families. \n\nThere was a secret message written on the inside of a car that could only been seen by breathing hot \ud83d\udd25 breath onthe windows.\n\nShe was known to be killed in the end but most likely secretly got away.\n\nI loved this series and wanted to share with friends and family.
