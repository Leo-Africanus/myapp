        "content": "I am stumped.  My wife and I share a Netflix standard account.  She has an iPhone. I have a Pixel.  And we have a 10y/o Sony Bravia TV that is connected via LAN cable to our network.  The TV software is up to date.  The TV has a Chromecast dongle and an Apple TV 'dongle'.  Login functionality has gone waaaaaayy downhill almost across the board and I don't know why.  Not sure if we have one problem or more than one problem.  We didn't change anything.\n\nNetflix app works fine on both our phones.\n\nNetflix will cast to the TV just fine from my phone from within the Netflix app.\n\nNetflix will not cast from her iPhone via screen mirror or from the Netflix app.  When she tries to screen mirror Netflix, it won't let her choose our TV...the device selection is blank.  She can screen mirror all other apps to the TV just fine, so this is only a Netflix issue.\n\nWe tried accessing Netflix from within the Apple TV interface.  She scanned the QR with her phone.  Her phone said she was all set while the Apple TV interface said it had trouble signing her in, Code 113.  Why the mismatch?\n\nNetflix will not start on the TV.  It tries to, then gives an error code nw-4-7.  I've reset the TV Internet content, run the Netflix diagnostics (\"Netflix server 2...nw-4-7\"), reset the Netflix app on the TV, cleared Netflix account cache via online instructions and done everything I can access from within the Netflix app,,the Netflix app on the TV and anything else within the TV ...all to no avail.  I updated our wifi mesh software.   Every other TV app works fine, and we have no trouble with computers or our phones on our wifi.  All network things have been turned off and on to reset.  No connectivity issues were found in TV self diagnostics.\n\nI don't even mind buying a new TV (\ud83d\ude02) but based on our symptoms I don't think that will fix the issue.  \n\nThoughts from the group?  Please and thank you \ud83d\ude42 Happy holidays! ",
