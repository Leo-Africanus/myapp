What makes finding a title easy is to categorize and condense the list so you can see a lot of things at once; that's what makes for a good experience. I'm now literally browsing to find something 3 titles at a time I have no comprehension of what I looked at a few clicks back.. no ability to see a group of titles at once and make that nerve wracking decision of should I watch John Wick again or Interstellar? I fucking hate having to decide on a movie sometimes and always love when I find just what I'm looking for, and right now I'm not even going to attempt to find anything on this constricting layout that's just going to frustrate me and not provide literally the experience I'm paying for which is to REALX. Whoever thought this was a good idea..I hope you're reading the feedback. At least give me an option to switch back to the old layout. Shopping other streaming services immediately after I post this.",

Georgia, as usual, was busy with her endless rants and chaotic sex life\u2014constantly yapping without much depth.\n\nGinny looked sexy but stayed low-key throughout the season, which felt like a missed opportunity to develop her character. As for Paul, I couldn\u2019t tolerate his forced masculinity and lack of real emotions. He seemed to be living in a bubble of idealism\u2014felt bad for him at times, but not enough to care deeply.\n\nOn the brighter side, I loved Lynette\u2019s character. She was a truly supportive mother and mother-in-law, probably one of the few genuine personalities this season. Meanwhile, Georgia\u2019s so-called friends proved they\u2019re not even loyal to each other, let alone to her. That dynamic felt hollow.\n\nOverall, compared to the previous seasons, this one gets a 6/10 from me. Wouldn\u2019t recommend wasting time on it.\n",

        "title": "Department Q - question about Lyle - SPOILERS",
        "content": "I just finished Dept. Q and loved it!  I loved the writing/dialog, the characters, and the acting.   At first I thought Matthew Goode (Mr nice guy in Downton Abbey) was too 'soft' for this role as Carl, but he turned out great.  And of course, Rose and Ackram nailed it.   I do have a question, which came up already in a response to another thread, but I want to post it here as a new question so it gets more eyeballs. \n\nThe question relates to Lyle (Harry's brother, Ailsa's son), and Sam Haig. I THINK I've got it mostly figured out now, so most of this is how I think it happened, but there are still some questions. \n\nMerritt as a teenager was 'dating' Harry.  She didn't see much of Lyle (Harry's brother) - he just came over occasionally and 'interrupted' them. So I guess there's no reason to think she was that familiar with Lyle.  Meritt, Willliam, Lyle and Harry all live on the remote island of \"Mohr\" - an island that is now in decline due to the demise of the oil industry. \n\nHarry robbed Merritt's household, and during that event, Harry first struck William, but then we later discover that it was Lyle who severely beat William.   The local policeman pursued the event, but mistakenly thought Harry was the culprit and chased him to his death on the ferry.   Merritt came back to Mohr to attend Harry's funeral (and presumably met Lyle again there). \n\nMany years later (10, 15 years?) ('current time'), Lyle is obsessed with Merritt (as a romantic target? Sexual? - not clear).  \n\nLyle has spent a lot of time in an institution, and while there, encountered 'Sam Haig', another inmate.  Sam was smart, and taught Lyle the art of deception / investigation / etc.  Now, Sam and Lyle are both out of captivity and working.  Sam was now an investigative journalist, doing well, driving a Porsche.  Lyle was struggling, working as a grunt on the local ferry. \n\nLyle decides he wants to get closer to Merritt. He knows she is a prosecutor (she's been on TV a few times so 'well known') and decides to impersonate Sam Haig, claiming to want to share information about corruption, etc with Merritt. Merritt finally meets him in a cafe, and 'warms' to him. She has no idea that it is Lyle and she's never met Sam Haig before so has no reason to doubt who he is.  So this is 'issue/question 1' - is it feasible that Merritt would not recognize Lyle 15 years later?  Lyle (as Sam) sleeps with Merritt.  'question 2' - is the real Sam Haig still alive at this point? \n\nIn addition to meeting with Merritt at the hotel on a regular basis for sex, Lyle is spying on her at her home - he's seen by William through the window one night.  So that explains how Lyle knows Merritt's movements. \n\nMerritt loses the case she's working on, and on the spare of the moment, decides to leave, with William, for Mohr on the ferry. \n\nLyle has followed Merritt onto the ferry (since he's been following her in general, this makes sense) and kidnaps her.  But - also on the ferry is Ailsa - Lyle's mum - who assists with the kidnapping.  How could Ailsa be on the ferry that day, given that it was a spare of the moment decision by Merritt to go that day?  Plot Hole? \n\nHaving kidnapped Merritt, Lyle then goes to kill the real Sam Haig at the 'cliff face' to tie up any loose ends, since he's been impersonating him.  Is this the correct timeline for Sam's death - AFTER the kidnap of Merritt? \n\nI don't normally pay this much attention to a show but there was something about the 'style' of this show that really connected with me, so I got really invested.  Now we have to wait to see if there's a second season! \n\nI thought the first 8 episodes were fantastic; I though E9 was a bit 'happy ever after', with the therapist showing up at Carl's house, soft music, etc but it was still great, and did set up for a second season - with the team well-funded and now respected.",

I watched it yesterday and after taking a bit of time to think about the movie, I now ask myself what it was even about. In hindsight it just seems like someone wanted to make a movie about people killing each other and then decided to wrap this motive into a little bit of story. And many have done this before, like in John Wick. But in Havoc.. well I feel like they messed it up. During every major fighting scene I had the same questions: How is she still alive? How did they get here? Where has he been? And the same goes for the scenes afterwards. The fights take do long that I forget what the story is even about and after it ends I\u2019m left wondering what just happened, what is the situation and who\u2019s friend with who now? \n\nIn conclusion, I am not necessarily saying that it was a bad movie.

        "content": "Surprising heartwarming and happy a women in prison comedy.\nThe story builds slowly but the interactions between the women inmates blossoms to a fun and intimate introspection of Korean women in prison.\nI assume that there is a big license between IRL reality and made for TV presentations of actual life in prison for as this offering is presented..\nNon-the-less, this 10 episode story brings a fun and enlightened experience between disparate women who meld into one spirit.\nExceptionally fun and well worth your time to watch a happy story.\nI actually was surprised that it was so much fun to watch.\nThis is my insignificant take on it.\nHope you also enjoy it.\n\n",

Q and I thought alright it must only have 2 episodes so far. Then I tried to find the series page and it had completely vanished. All I could do was set a reminder for it.",
