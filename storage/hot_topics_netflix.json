The girl from Stranger things is a married woman with a child and still playing a teenager in the show. It's been on for over 10 years. WTF? It's become a meme at this point. There's no way the higher ups at Netflix aren't hearing the jokes. They're not course correcting or trying to give us more consistency. By the time any new season of anything comes out, I've forgotten what's already happened. I think they just straight up don't give a shit about their customer base. ",

        "content": "This may be an unpopular opinion, but I really did not like Disenchantment. I watched the first two seasons *hoping* I would get into it, but I never did. Personally, the reason that I found the show disappointing was because I went into it thinking it was going to be some epic fantasy quest plot line. Something comparable to that of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Narnia, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc. but something with comedy as much as adventure, wonder, and advanced world building.  \n  \nThere was virtually *NO* adventure. At least not an epic one, anyway. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think there is DEFINITELY a market for an adult cartoon/fantasy parody series, similar to an animated Order of the Stick (iykyk). But with the plot line it currently has, the whole time, I was thinking, \u201cand *whyyyyyy* is it set in a medieval fantasy world?\u201d The setting didn\u2019t seem to add anything interesting to the story. It could've been set in the real world following a rich heiress instead of a princess and literally NOTHING about the plot would change other than a few visual gags.   \n  \nI wanted to like this show. I really did. I watched the whole first and second seasons hoping it would get more interesting but it never did. As a fan of fantasy adventure quest stories, this was a huge disappointment. The only thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the animation. The animation was *exceptionally* good. But again, I feel like they could've done more with the fantasy adventure aspect of the world. Like I said, there is definitely a market for something like that, but this show wasn't it.",

        "content": "As someone who is only subscribed to a few services I find that the amount I pay for all the services there is alot of overlapping content. My question centers around the idea of subscribing for the exclusive content and paying a lower amount and not getting the outside movies/shows, would this be a smart idea? Would you find it worth it(of course depending on the price)? I personally know many people who don\u2019t subscribe to Netflix, Prime, HBO etc. because they only want to watch the exclusive content but don\u2019t want to pay the price to get content they already have access to elsewhere.",
