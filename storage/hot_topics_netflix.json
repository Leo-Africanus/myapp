The writing is really well done and it's an interesting concept built upon the super power genre. The characters are all very interesting and don't feel completely forced like some shows do.\nI can see why the show might not have attracted some people but if Netflix had marketed the show better than maybe it would have done better because I think a lot of people I know would have been interested in it. \n     I'm a big fan of the themes tied to mythology and how ordinary people are altered to become beings with powers and aren't magically born that way. I think the show really did have a lot of potential to keep growing into a really great story if it had continued and it's a shame that it didn't. I'm even a big fan of the three main leads and how their powers are integrated into their daily lives and the burden of how their powers can affect those around them either negatively or positively.",
