        "content": "This is literally the best exmaple I\u2019ve seen so far of a show that should\u2019ve have been so much longer yet was obviously done in a way to make it short and full of action within just 8 episodes. This show should\u2019ve been 20 episodes. Instead the creators decided to do what Netflix has now done multiple times and condense it into one of those shows where it\u2019s just nonstop action and plot twist and turn with conflict and resolution happening way to fast. It\u2019s a great show, but way too fast passed. Which is what ruins it. The characters don\u2019t have enough time to develop and that makes the show feel shallow and not as intense or meaningful because u lack connection with the charictors. An example of this is how quickly cane\u2019s character is brought in and how quickly it goes south with him, it\u2019s supposed to be a sort of plot twist, but it doesn\u2019t even feel like one becuase there\u2019s not enough time to even developed a proper plot. Another exmaple is how quickly the early plot twist with sherif is done and how quickly the sherif goes from partner to being killed. It\u2019s just all far too rushed and should\u2019ve been carried out through multiple episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this exact issue of rushed shows so much recently on Netflix, they had great potential but just were executed in this poor fashion which ruins the whole thing.

Amazon Prime has both The Boys and Invincible plus Batman: Caped Crusader and the upcoming Spider-Man Noir series. HBO/HBO Max has DC shows like The Penguin, Peacemaker and the other DCU shows that are coming in the next few years. In comparison Netflix has like nothing like that.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy was a good contendant for the role but it didn't really stuck with the audience as The Boys or Invincible did and it kinda fell off after Season 3. Then there was Jupiter's Legacy that would have been another one if it didn't suck (even if i thought it was ok when it came out).\n\nI mean Netflix have already a lot of hit shows already and if they tried i know they're going to cancel it after a season or probably getting bad over time.
