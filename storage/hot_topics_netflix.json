She even does exactly what was shown in the trailer, shooting at Eleven &amp; co.\n\nI know that being Sarah Connor in those 2 terminator movies is the only career highlight of her, but being in Stranger things doesn't change much either (for her &amp; the show)",

Why did Zoe stop being friends with Helen and Rachel if she was complicit in the rape?\n5. Why was Catherine trying to get back at Anna when it was Anna that was raped? What was with all the \u201cmurder\u201d supplies she got Richard to buy\n6. Jack said Alice showed signs of dementia during the year Anna left. Was she premeditating that far in advance?\n\nFinally, how am I supposed to believe an old woman is capable of pulling off gruesome murders that require lots of physical strength as noted in one episode\u2026 I mean 40 stab wounds? Also, how did she get the friendship bracelets? Did Anna have them in her box I.e do we assume they all gave them back to her?\n\nWhat was the side story about the blackmail In Rachel\u2019s phone when it came to their weird shit with Duffie?\n\nLazy ending and the show had more potential.",

Its impossible to read what's on the screen which can affect the plot of what I'm watching. I've tried to find solutions but haven't had any luck. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4W8QtEo",
