The obsession with sex for both the boys and girls in the school, the \"sexual marketplace\" competition accelerating bullying between boys, from boys to girls and from girls to boys. \n\nJamie is eerily mature for his age, we see this in how cognisant he is of the situation that he and the people his age are in; but that maturity isn't a true maturity and acts as an illusion which I can understand make people think he is responsible for his actions. \n\nThat maturity is a very fragile one. It's superficial, only existing as an expression on the surface - a performance that others his age copy from social media and force each other to fit into. \n\nI think that's the main point to take from this show.

As if he is a victim..\n\nLike - I don't care whether your son was born like this, or became an anti-women terrorist because you allowed him to watch inappropriate online content , or you yourself radicalized him - he doesn't get a right to kill teenage girl and then play the victim card. \nHe needs to be locked away in jail as per whatever law decides. \n\nWe need to perhaps revisit our laws in various countries where underage criminals get away with almost anything. \n\nDo we show the same consideration to religious islamic terrorists and to black youth? Do we say - oh come on, they are just being radicalized online, let's not blame them. \n\nBut if it is a white straight boy, then the sympathy floodgates open up huh. \n\nI also wonder if people's reactions would be different if the victim was another boy- a white straight boy - instead of Katie. Then everyone would have said that Jamie was a criminal and not blamed the victim maybe.\n",

You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",

We don't tend to be limited by the number of concurrent users.\n\nI'm curious about the Ad-Supported standard plan. What are the adverts like? Are there 3 minutes of ads every 20 minutes, or fewer, or more?\n\nI'm also just wanting people's input as to whether it's worth the cost saving (\u00a35.99 Vs \u00a312.99 in UK), and any other thoughts about the Ad-Supported plan. What are the other positives?\n\nMy kids have almost always had Netflix/Disney over terrestrial TV, so they give me a funny look whenever their shows are interrupted by an advert.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69\\_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liBllQYkG5w&amp;list=PLufnCEJ69_etoI1fUbfEHdZoPJJeiztw1&amp;index=40)\n\nin 2018, on social media, Jerry Buting (Avery's defense lawyer in 2007) proclaimed this is the first he ever heard of this audio, and that the state knew they had found human remains in the 2 quarries adjacent to the Avery property.  (One of those properties was owned the Manitowoc County. Bones found on property owned by Manitowoc County not revealed to the defense)\n\n***Some context:***\n\n1. State of Wisconsin found Human remains on top of soil near Avery's trailer. They claimed that its where the bones were burned and cremated before even testing the burn pit soil for such evidence.\n2. State also found 4 locations (and at least some burn sites) in the quarry (piles 1-4 on map below)\n3. State wrote detailed report about the bones by Avery's trailer, and told the media, public, defense, and courts about them all the time.\n4. State didn't write any reports about the human remains in piles 1-4, didn't tell the media, public, defense, nor courts about them at all.\n5. The state forensic anthropologist examined these bones from piles 1-4 nearly a half year later, was told they were from the Avery property, and she included these bones in her summary a month before trial using the evidence numbers only and no description of where they originated from. Thus, Avery's defense team had no idea she included human remains found in the quarry in her final last minute report. Hell, she was unaware either.\n6. In court, the state claimed \"nobody knows what those are\" when referring to the quarry remains. A lie.\n\nIn short, the defense was misled about the human evidence, and they were arguing the quarry was the real crime scene. If the State had told the defense about ALL of the human remains, the defense's case would have been 100x stronger given they would be able to present human remains being found far away from their clients residence. After all, Avery wouldn't burn the body in the quarry then bring back evidence by his house to incriminate himself. No jury would buy that and the state knew that. They HAD to confine the crime scene as a whole to the Avery yard.\n\nThe kicker is the state didn't end up finding any evidence in Avery's burn pit proving a primary burn location, and their own expert testified that in her opinion, if it WASNT the primary burn location ,then she would have found other small, brittle bone fragments from other locations. (They did find exactly that, but she wasn't made aware of that when the evidence was turned over to her for examination).\n\nThose remains stashed in buckets for 6 months and never disclosed to the defense in a manner they could use. Defense claimed that area was crime scene at trial w/out this info.\n\nAnd for visual reference piles 1,2,3,4 are what the phone call is referencing, with piles 1, 2 &amp; 3 being located on the Manitowoc County quarry (same county which was being sued by Avery for framing him in 1985). Just look how far away and huge the crib\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di0ai89pynpe1.png?width=2664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd8429946c0fbc869f6afa2629d14d82c454351c\n\nEnd Result:\n\nThis map was presented by Avery's lawyer to the court in 2018/2019. The court ruled it was barred from being used because Avery once filed his own pro se (on his own, and without a lawyer) motion years before Making a Murderer came out, and the court punished Avery for not bringing this unknown information up earlier (even though the phone call wasn't released via FOIA until 2018.\n\n...This audio and Jerry Buting's admission he was never given it was not filed in court, however. Nor was it shown in Making a Murderer part 2, which was released prior to this phone call being made public.",

Dad seems indifferent to it. Meant to be funny.\n\nBut then we get this scene, where the music is an original score, where the lighting is poignant, where it doesn\u2019t feel like it was ad-libbed or quickly thrown together.\n\nWe get something raw and meaningful and an honest statement about the LGBT+ experience.\n\nThe choreography is incredible, the connection between Mac and this unknown dancer is palpable (her character in the show I mean - she is Kylie Shea, a ballerina in real life), and Mac actually got to \u201cuse [his] body!\u201d\n\nIt stuck with me and really meant a lot\n\nI hope it does/ did for you too\n",

        "content": "Like many of you I have recently watched adolescence on Netflix and thoroughly enjoyed it, but that's not the point of this post. There was some fantastic shots that would have been very difficult to perform, like the kid jumping out the window and the over the town - through the air shot in episode 2. Very cool but can probably be easily explained. \n\nHowever.. I need a media guru to tell me how a certain shot was done that I just CANNOT figure out. \n\nThe very start of episode 4 we see Stephen Graham in his shed then closes the door. The camera then side pans and appears to pass through a window pane of the shed. My natural assumption was \"Oh they've got a half built shed and the camera man walked out from a separate door or an open space\". But then the camera pans behind him and points up the garden path with a FULLY BUILT SHED! I just can't fathom how they did this in the continuous shot. If anyone has any explanation I would be very grateful and I apologise in advance if this is obvious to some!\n\nSpoiler tag added just incase... ",
