        "content": "Halfway through. It\u2019s a fun mystery. I like Cordelia when she\u2019s being her own take on Sherlock Holmes. It should be great. The problem for me are some parts that are so distractingly awful they ultimately stick with me more than anything else. To wit:\n\n- Birding. I\u2019ve never been more annoyed by a main character\u2019s quirk. Every mention of birding felt forced, and not a single analogy landed. It felt like some writer read that specific birding book Cordelia carries around and got a huge inflated ego about it. I will instantly judge anyone I find out is into birding going forward. That\u2019s not fair to them and it\u2019s The Residence\u2019s fault. \n\n- Two unbelievably bad actors. 1) The Secret Service comic relief guy is painful to watch. I feel second-hand embarrassment when he\u2019s trying to make the Kylie Minogue jokes land. Heinous comedic acting. 2) The Congresswoman who constantly interrupts the proceedings. I initially thought they were going for a caricature of boorish, ignorant politicians, but now it seems like she was supposed to be playing some kind of champion of skepticism, challenging the establishment? Either way she comes off like she read the script immediately before each take, took a shot, did her lines, then did them again after the director told her to lay on the sarcasm even more thick. Truly awful. \n\nSnark - These writers cannot do snark. They think they can and that makes it worse. I almost turned it off for good in the office scene when the slimy friend of the president tells Cordelia \u201cThis is bigger than you\u201d and her response is \u201cDo you mean the house is bigger than me, because, like, duh, I\u2019m inside the house!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I had to get this out of my system. Normally any one of those annoyances would be a dealbreaker and I\u2019d happily move on with my life. But I want to see how this ends. And I can\u2019t until I purge my hatred of some do this stuff.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been imagining an alternate take on Wednesday where Enid becomes Wednesday\u2019s love interest, but with a twist: Ej is also part of the story. Adding Ej changes the dynamics, their friendships, and even the vibe of Nevermore Academy in unexpected ways. It never appeared on TV, but thinking about it makes me wonder how this version could play out. Has anyone else imagined alternate storylines like this for Netflix shows?\u201d",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I'm tired of seeing content in what looks to be 720p. I use the Chrome browser but from previous posts I've read, using the microsoft store app helps with streaming in 4k. I have tried it and it makes no difference to the streaming quality. I am subscribed to the 4k plan, the profile is set to \"high\" quality, I am using a 4k monitor, and I am also getting \\~700mbps download/upload. If you need to know my GPU, I have an RTX 4070. Thank you in advance!",

        "content": "This is Beyond the pale. I have had Netflix since I got DVDs in the mail. I put up with rate hikes and kicked my family off as they left the house and made them get new accounts. Guess what. They never did. Not worth the cost. \n\nNow I am the only active profile and I take care of my father full time. He doesn't live in my home. I will start watching something at home but want to finish it at his house less than a mile from my house but to far to reach my WiFi. At first they said Are you traveling?  OK sure here's a code. But now they want me feel threatened and pay an Extra $7.99 a month to CONTINUE WATCHING WHERE I LEFT OFF.\n\n  Its beyond obvious that I am the same person. And that I'm bouncing between the same 2 physical locations. I shouldn't be forced to go through and entire \"Household location change/update\" twice a day everyday. \n\nI'm 99% sure I got a warning screen about password sharing from HBO max the other day, with a note that basically conveys don't worry this time though beacuse we can tell it's you by your viewing habits. \n\nGet it together Netflix. It's not that hard. I'm sure you have the technology to tell I haven't giving half the planet my password. You just wanna squeeze more out of me to pad your bottom line for share holders. \n\nSHAME ON YOU!",
