        "content": "hey hey, just wanted to drop some opinions because i'm bursting to talk about this show and barely anyone i know has seen it yet\n\n1. omggg, from the time we got to hear the first round of singers, i was rooting for aaliyah, denzel, cameron, and katie to join together because their voices are all so rich and evocative. so when they eventually teamed up, i was SCREAMING !!\n\n2. the work ethic and unity of all the groups has been a major influence in how i view them. szn4 are my faves just because of how much time and effort they've put in, not just as a band, but as a group. i really wanted to love m2m because they're the most alternative of the bunch, but right off the bat they were all flakey \u2013 the other three just seem a lot more hard-working because conor is there to juxtapose was **bad** workmanship is. this is also the reason i'm obsessed with soulidified and why siren society are my current underdogs. both of these bands just feel like long-time friends starting a project together for the sheer enjoyment.\n\n3. the group names are KILLING me. the only one i sort of like is midnight 'til morning, but even that is lacklustre. 3quency, siren society, and soulidified are taking me out tho haha.\n\n4. not gonna get into it because the discourse around these two is already super negative. but obviously conor and alison have soured the show for me. i get showbiz and drama but the show works perfectly for all the other bands without them needing constant negativity surrounding them.\n\n5. conor's \"punk\" look had me rooting for him in the beginning, but now it kinda feels forced and performative. the \"punk\" aesthetic has no politics or morals behind it, it feels fake in a lil huddy, mgk, landon barker kinda way. and alison is really giving tess tyler from camp rock. i love a mean girl archetype but it just feels cruel, especially the digs at haley during practices, and the confrontation with erica in the booth.\n\n6. while i really felt horrible during the alison-erica confrontation, the editors really did not paint erica in a great light. the amount of scenes of this girl crying is over the top, which sucks because she has so many strong, leadership moments that get overshadowed by this framing.\n\n7. i absolutely fell in love with soulidifed. they feel so light and airy and fun. you can tell there is not toxic masculinity that side and it's so refreshing. they FEEL like how a boyband should feel, just in a modernised fashion. i'm so hopeful to see what happens with them once the show has aired and they come out with what they're doing with the band.\n\n8. what is up with the judge's commentary? for the most part, i agreed. but the criticism for siren society way outweight the compliments (def feel like that's foreshadowing their demise on the show), when i felt like their performance was the ideal girlgroup. i know nicole was probably harsher because it was her song, and i did see ehat she was saying about the sexiness feeling outdated, but what they did felt authentic and real to what i envision as a girlgroup. i've been using katseye as a litmus test during the performance episodes, and i genuinely see siren society as being the most alike to what the world wants to see.\n\n9. i can't with 3quency. i tried to like them, especially since they each had such strong solos in the booth scenes. but nori really sticks out since her voice is very youthful and unique. nori definitely has the least amount of skill and it shows. brianna sings beautifully, but the rich soulful tone feels like it would be better fitted in szn4 honestly. omg but wennely? she is just amazing. her voice blends well for a group, i just wish she was in a group that didn't feel so fragmented.\n\n10. why was the show so religious in the booth episodes lol? i feel like every second word in the booth chats was about growing up in the church, learning to sing in church choirs, pre-performance prayers, etc. it just felt so out of place for a singing reality tv show. \n\n11. the band forming mechanics were sloppy. by having the bands be allowed to be formed before all the contestants had the opportunity to perform didn't sit right. and having only 6 bands be the outcome made it feel like a race to who can slap together a band the fasted, which kinda took away from the organic ethos (which was super evident in the forming of band 6). i'm hoping it was just an editing thing, but if it wasn't, it's definitely an aspect that needs to be worked on.\n\n12. idk if there was a cap on how many members a band could have, but i don't get why alison couldn't have formed a group with elise, haley, cece, and mandy? that's 5 members which we've seen in so many bands. ig it may have been the same reasoning as 3quency where they wanted bigger roles/parts in the songs and felt their voices were strong enough to carry and full out a song? still sucks that the show seemed to put drama ahead of talent and skill.\n\n13. i love how the editors made sure to constantly remind us of people's names and what songs were being sung. if not, i would have totally forgot/glossed over major players in the show.\n\n14. not everyone who has watched this has seen popstar/dream academy. but my queen karlee was an absolutely legend in that show/project. she was in this show super briefly, and i'm so mad i didn't get to see anything of her, not a performance and no booth chats. it was nice seeing the little clips of her. anyway, she makes solo music now which is amazing (go stream), but it would've loved to see what she looked like in this setting, and hearing her compare it to dream academy.\n\nall-in-all, this show has a lot of kinks to work out. but i am rooting for this to take off because, with a little work, this show could easily be a great contender for modern day reality tv. the experiment played out exactly as it was intended, unlike other netflix reality shows, so i was super happy about that. the idea of a group of unlikely candidates coming together to make magic was brilliant, and is working well for me. what are your thoughts about the show thus far?",

        "content": "Surprisingly, I'm actually really liking Building the Band because it's a little more authentic than I expected, with the ability for the kids to pick their own groups (minus the fact that they only have 6 groups so timing matters....hope they change that in the future and then cut off how ever many that they need to with the first round of group performances. )\n\nIf 3Quency does not stay together, I'll be ticked because their voices blend so well in harmony. Their only other job is to get along, which they appear to be doing so far.\n\nWhatever group Alison is in, I think we all feel like the other two girls joined because it was Band #6 and there weren't other choices. She can sing but she's pretty much insufferable. \n\nSZN4 - not a huge fan of the band name but they are my faves for sure! That unique mixture of people....the beatiful strong voices of all of them (especially Cam but they all sound great,) Donzel's positive energy...so many more things that I can say about these kids but I love it.\n\nThe only other band that I really like (after SZN4 and 3Quency) is Soulidified. They have more work to do but all of them are so precious and so far have won my heart. \ud83e\udd0e\n\nIn the chaotic boy band (Million Miles to Wherever the Heck They are Going) I really like the mop haired Aussie. His personality is so cool and they can all sing. I do agree with people who have said that the tatted guy and his narcissistic Alison mean girl fling might be actors. Hope not but they are capturing some horrific moments so maybe it's for film.\n\nLastly, now I realize why Nicole left The Masked Singer. Smart move, girl. I've heard Netflix pays well and if this turns out to be a hit, you will be the superstar of the show and the money will keep on multiplying. Same with Queen Kelly leaving The Voice AUS.

For example, how did Mira and Zoey join Huntrix? It\u2019s said at the start of the movie that Celine took Rumi in under her wing (well\u2026 tried to. Not the best mentor). But what about the other two? We can guess Mira doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her parents because she was a wild child, but what about Zoey\u2019s family? We just know she used to live in America before, that\u2019s it. Nothing else about her family.\n\nWas Celine the only one who trained them? Or were they trained by some kind of institution? Does the whole \u201cdemon stealing human\u2019s souls\u201d thing only happen there, or in other parts of the world? Are there other demons hunters like them from other countries? Are there any interviews in which the creators of the movie answer some of these questions?\n\nI need freaking answers, Sony!",

        "content": "The day netflix cancels this, is the day I cancel my subscription.\n\nI was absolutely hooked from start to finish. Excellent cast, excelent writing. Contrary to classic Netflix there is no forced diversity shoved down our throats just for the sake of it. Every character makes complete sense for the story and the locations. Akram is extraordinarily likeable, his story makes sense, his character should be the golden standard for what inclusivity done right should look like.\n\nAlso, the story is not obvious at all, you don't know the answers and are waiting for the characters to figure it out aswell, which is a breath of fresh air when compared with other recent shows which seem written for people who think that being in the 90th percentile on online iQ tests from buzzfeed is a good thing.\nI feel like my life is better after this show. Season two can't come soon enough. Netflix, you cancel this, I'm canceling the plan for my whole family.",
