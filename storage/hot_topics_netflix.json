I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Beck was so shitty towards him and the relationship she didn\u2019t really care. Marianne literally was a homewrecker. Love was crazy as hell I wish they would\u2019ve stayed together. Kate was a hypocrite, a complicit contrite hypocrite. Bront\u00eb was honestly just annoying as hell. Penn played the hell out of this role though.
