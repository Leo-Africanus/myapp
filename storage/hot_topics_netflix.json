I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s normal for siblings or parents to live in different cities. We still stay connected, so why can\u2019t we share a Netflix account \u2014 especially when we\u2019re already paying for one with multiple profiles?\n\nNetflix used to be okay with sharing. They even encouraged it back in the day. And now they\u2019re changing the rules just to make more money. It doesn\u2019t feel fair.\n\nWhat\u2019s more annoying is that even though this policy started a while ago, I was still able to use Netflix on my laptop \u2014 just not on the mobile app. But today I got a notification on my laptop saying I can\u2019t use it anymore either. So that\u2019s it, I guess. One more reason to unsubscribe.",

Who knows how long those animals were there. \n\nThe contestants are then asked to transport these animals to \"terrariums\" that are basically glass boxes with a thin screen for ventilation on top. It's visible that these boxes are receiving direct sunlight and temperatures must be very high inside.\n\nYou can tell the floor of the boxes are not grass but also glass or transparent plastic. Regardless, that means that if those boxes have been in the sun it's likely that the floors were extremely hot. Once again, who knows how long they remained in those hot boxes. \n\nIt could have been cut, but it doesn't appear that any of the contestants have recieved orientation on how to handle these animals. The show is relying on the contestants fear of the animals for dramatic effect and these aren't domesticated animals, at any time they could jump out from their hands and drop to the floor. \n\nI was actually enjoying this dumb show but I just find extremely distasteful to use non-domesticated animals as \"props\" in conditions that are clearly unhealthy.

        "content": "So I was watching You season 5 and once I finished episode 2 the pop up that only shows when you finish a movie/series shows up, it wouldn\u2019t let me move on to the next episode, and when I went back to the episode list all the episodes disappeared and it just has a \u201cremind me\u201d pop up, I\u2019m really confused as to what\u2019s going on and this has been happening a lot to shows I\u2019ve been watching. It also disappeared from my list and I can\u2019t find it when I search anymore",

        "content": "My chrome cast works with every other device and streaming service I use, but it just doesn\u2019t show up with Netflix. I was chatting with Netflix support for an hour and they gave up, asking me to send a screen recording of my issue and said they will use it for their own research without any timeline for a resolution. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m on iPhone, everything is on the same network, all updated firmwares, reset everything. It used to work, hasn\u2019t for about a year, maybe 2 ",

        "content": "I watched the documentary today, it's just over an hour and admittedly is a good summary for people who don't know much about the bombing, like me (I was 14 when it happened). But after doing more reading it barely scratched the surface. Wish it had been a series, or even a scripted series like Manhunt: Unabomber.",
