Very realistic in terms of talking about dating lives and emotions and difficulties that arise. I also love that it was shot in NYC where I live. I have never heard of this show before and I\u2019m a pretty picky person, but I thought it was fantastic with the exception of a few unrealistic scenes/occurrences in the series. It also had some really great people in it, namely Anna Kendrick, Jessica Williams, and Ego Nwodim. What are you guys think?",

The other day her email connected to the Netflix account was compromised but the hacker didn't take the email by the looks of it as I easily recovered it for my mum. But the Netflix account has been taken! They changed the password of course and email but here is the creepy thing. My mums email have our surname in it and the new email on the Netflix account has our last name in it and we tried to recover the account through mums credit card and apparently her credit card isnt on the account either. \n\nIt also has a @renew.club at the end and I've never ever seen that before. So right now I can't recover the account whatsoever as we are gonna have to call up sky and probably Netflix but Its just all werid and creepy. Like why take the Netflix account and take off the credit card? Why use apart of the original account holders email in the new email? And why not fully hack the original email to gain access to more data?",

        "content": "I just finished the 4th season of 'Stranger Things' and I observed:\n\n\n1. The demogorgon in the Russian prison when released on the captives, is so much extremely fast and powerful, kills most of the men in blink of an eye, but for some reason it goes slowly and easy on Hopper and Enzo, waits for Hopper to lit a fire and then doesn't even go away from fire, just gets very slow. It is shown to easily break the prison walls and structures and create havoc, but was for some reason waiting until now.\n\n\n2. The plan to defeat Vecna didn't seem like a plan. They all knew how fatal is upside down, but they went there casually with a few normal guns and no special weapon, while completely ignoring many scenarios which could happen. They didn't even have a proper serious discussion about the plan and any what-ifs. \n\n\n3. Everywhere these guys went they kept talking loudly and kept arguing, instead of keeping a watch and being careful, looking for any clues. They never cared if something undesired hears them or attacks them. \n\n\n4. Lucas and Max didn't even lock the house from inside or had any plan on what will they do if someone disturbs them when Max goes in trance (they were aware that Jason was on lookout for them all). This situation was not something they could compromise with. (Even though I hate Jason for being there at wrong time)\n\n\n5. It was brutal to watch Max finally getting folded by Vecna.\n\n\n6. I am tired of stupidity from characters like Eddie who had no business jumping back into upside down, when it wasn't even helping anyone. He and Dustin had already distracted the bats for a good amount of time, and just needed to take care of themselves. It was an unnecessary and meaningless loss.\n\n\n7. Found Joyce to be very irritating at certain moments. \n\n\n8. Joyce and Murray casually deciding to attack the pilot Yuri in sky without really caring about how will they survive, and then comfortably getting out of the crash with minor scratches. \n\n\n9. Seeing Hopper alive was such a normal moment for everyone like he just returned from a long vacation. \n\n\n10. After Max final gets unconscious, the gate to upside down gets cracked open throughout the city (atleast) which should completely change everything immediately. But 2 days later we see the headline on TV calling it an earthquake? Everyone in Hawkins including the police ignored the miles long (atleast) giant orange crack which is a portal to another world going through the city for 2 days? Why and how they completely ignored that? Even the kids didn't talk about it. (During the very last of the episode when the snow like particles started raining, we could see some orange gates or cracks spread throughout an area) \n\n",

I didn\u2019t expect it to be exactly like the old\u00a0Addams Family. I knew it would have its own twist, but it just feels\u00a0off.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t like the acting. It looks weird and unnatural, not in the charming, spooky\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0way, but in a \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel believable\u201d way. The makeup doesn\u2019t look good either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere, it makes the characters look kind of awkward.\n\nThe plot also feels too childish, like it\u2019s trying to be edgy but still ends up being a teen drama without much depth. The detective/thriller angle is actually a good idea in theory, but the execution feels\u2026 meh.\n\nIt\u2019s below the quality I usually expect from Netflix\u2019s big series, and it\u2019s disappointing because it\u00a0could\u00a0have been amazing.\n\nIs it just me? Or did anyone else go in with high hopes and come out feeling\u2026 meh?",

        "content": "Hi All, as the title suggests I recently renewed my netflix subscription after a year and need suggestions on what to watch.\n\nMy favorite genre is Thriller, mystery, adventure, comedy,romcom. Not a big fan of heavy dramas but comedy with a hint of drama is also great.\n\nAlso I am a binge watcher type and some of the  shows I loved in the past: Derry Girls, Travelers, \nBlacklist, Dark and all the usual cult comedies.\n\nPlease suggest some of your recent favorites as I have mostly watched all the cult classics.Thanks.\n",

Now I have been advised that there will be a $1 increase in September for me to enjoy more viewing pleasures??? \n\nI get the adds and honestly, they don't bother me at all so I'm not sure why the price is increasing after a short time. I pay $7.99 P/M now.",
