        "content": "Already posted this but it got removed for some reason.\n\nI just finished watching *Million Dollar Secret*, and the ending totally threw me off. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but I\u2019d love someone to help clear it up.\n\nAt the end, only **Sam**, **Cara**, and **Correy** are left.  \n**Sam** doesn\u2019t get to move any boxes, so she\u2019s not important for this part.\n\n**Correy** thinks **Cara** has the money, but he wants to trick her into thinking he believes **Sam** has it.  \nSo when it's Correy\u2019s turn to move the money, he moves it into **his own box**, thinking he successfully tricked Cara.\n\nThen it's **Cara\u2019s** turn, and somehow she guesses correctly, moves the money back into **her** box, and wins.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m confused:\n\nIf Correy really thought he tricked Cara into thinking **he thought Sam had the money**, then he should\u2019ve moved the money into **Sam\u2019s box**. That way, if Cara believed the trick, she would\u2019ve swapped **Correy\u2019s** and **Sam\u2019s** boxes \u2014 and Correy would end up with the money -- thinking she kept the money for herself (or she could have not moved the boxes at all). But instead, Correy moved the money into **his own box**, which only works if Cara *doesn\u2019t* fall for the trick. So... mistake?\n\nBut Cara\u2019s move doesn\u2019t make perfect sense either.\n\nIf she truly thought Correy took the money from her, then logically, he would have put it into **Sam\u2019s box**, she should\u2019ve swapped **Sam\u2019s** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes \u2014 giving Correy the money.  \nInstead, she swapped **her** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes, which happened to be the right move \u2014 but only if she thought Correy had the money in *his* box, not Sam\u2019s.\n\nSo it seems like:\n\n* **Correy made a logic mistake** (he didn\u2019t follow through with his own bluff properly).\n* **Cara may have made a mistake or just guessed right**, which canceled out Correy\u2019s mistake and gave her the win.\n\nMy question is: how did *both* of them mess this up? These are smart people, and I get one of them making a mistake under pressure \u2014 but both? Were they overthinking it? Or was it possibly staged?\n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me, so if I\u2019m missing something or misunderstood their logic, please tell me.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nCorrey tried to trick Cara but didn\u2019t follow through on his own bluff properly. Cara made a move that only worked if Correy made a mistake \u2014 which he did. Somehow both of them made bad moves, but Cara still won. Did they both mess up, or was it staged?",
