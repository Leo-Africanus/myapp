        "content": "I don't know how many of you watched this game show, but I'm on episode 3 and the use of live exotic animals is very disturbing to me.\n\nThe scene begins with each animal trapped under a cloche, those silver-dome things that cover plates. \n\nThe animals are frogs, hedgehogs, snakes, cockroaches, rats. \n\nAnyone whose worked on a film production knows behind the scenes things are extremely slow. Who knows how long those animals were there. \n\nThe contestants are then asked to transport these animals to \"terrariums\" that are basically glass boxes with a thin screen for ventilation on top. It's visible that these boxes are receiving direct sunlight and temperatures must be very high inside.\n\nYou can tell the floor of the boxes are not grass but also glass or transparent plastic. Regardless, that means that if those boxes have been in the sun it's likely that the floors were extremely hot. Once again, who knows how long they remained in those hot boxes. \n\nIt could have been cut, but it doesn't appear that any of the contestants have recieved orientation on how to handle these animals. The show is relying on the contestants fear of the animals for dramatic effect and these aren't domesticated animals, at any time they could jump out from their hands and drop to the floor. \n\nI was actually enjoying this dumb show but I just find extremely distasteful to use non-domesticated animals as \"props\" in conditions that are clearly unhealthy.

But by the end of the season, Vero is finally discharged and Camila is about to transfer out\u2026 which makes it seem like a full year has passed.\n\nSo were Vero and Nia in the hospital that entire year? And that the entire season covers a whole academic year? Because the pacing of the show feels like it\u2019s going day by day. We\u2019re in the hospital every shift, every case, and most episodes follow events in real-time (besides the flashbacks).\n\nSo did the show just jump forward without telling us? Or is it subtle time progression that we were supposed to pick up on? I\u2019m just trying to figure out if this was intentional or a timeline inconsistency.\n\nWould love to hear how others interpreted it.\n",
