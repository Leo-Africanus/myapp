Then, they described the recording devices she had set up. \n\nThe fact that the worst example of his 'abuse' that they shared from the recordings was that argument over the dinner sealed the deal for me. That OBVIOUSLY wasn't abuse and the fact they thought THAT was evidence of abuse is actually the strongest evidence that he WASN'T abusive. He sounded frustrated, and yes, he was kind of a jerk to his daughter, but abuse? Insane. A biological parent threatening to separate the kids from their stepparent in response to the stepparent threatening the same thing is a pretty natural response.\n\nMolly clearly has borderline personality disorder and both Molly and her Father are sick individuals, in my opinion.

        "title": "Problems and plot holes in 1899 (Netflix)",
        "content": "Just finished\u00a0 1899\u00a0and loved the atmosphere, but the more I think about it, the more the plot holes and unresolved mysteries bother me. Here\u2019s my breakdown of the biggest issues\u2014let me know what I missed or if you have theories!\n\n# 1. The Simulation Twist Undermines Everything\n\nThe big reveal that it\u2019s all a simulation (or layers of them) makes emotional moments feel weightless. If nothing\u2019s \"real,\" why should we care about character deaths or trauma? Even worse, the rules of the simulation are never clear\u2014why do the black crystals, memory bugs, or the Prometheus ship behave so inconsistently?\n\n# 2. Character Backstories Go Nowhere\n\n1899\u00a0set up really interesting character stories but then forgot about them. The French couple Clemence and Lucien had a troubled marriage with hints of cheating or maybe an abortion, but none of it went anywhere. The French lady who seemed to be forcing Ling Yi into prostitution just disappeared from the story. Ling Yi and her mom did something horrible - they killed another girl to steal her identity - but the show never explained why this mattered. They also hinted Ling Yi might be pregnant, then dropped it completely.\n\nThe little girl Ada died suddenly for no clear reason. Krester's story about his scar and being gay started strong but went nowhere. Why did so many people jump off the ship? Was the simulation breaking? Miguel, the stowaway, had strange visions and a connection to the boy Elliot, but we never learned his backstory. Angel and Ramiro's secret about Ramiro killing a priest to pretend to be him also didn't lead anywhere.\n\nIt's frustrating because all these stories felt important at first, but in the end, none of them really mattered or got explained. The show made us care about these characters, then left us hanging.\n\n# 3. The Pyramid, the Black Goo, and Elliot\u2019s Role\n\n* The\u00a0black pyramid/archive\u00a0is treated as a big deal, but we never learn what it actually\u00a0*does*.\n* The\u00a0black substance\u00a0spreads like a virus, but is it code? A metaphor? Who knows.\n* Elliot\u00a0exists as a child in the simulation, but why? Is he a glitch, a memory, or a failsafe?\n\n# 4. The Ending Creates More Confusion\n\nMaura wakes up in\u00a02099\u00a0on a spaceship, implying the 1899 simulation was just one layer. But:\n\n* Why is\u00a0Ciaran\u00a0suddenly in control?\n* Are the other passengers real people or AI?\n* If this is \"reality,\" how does it connect to the 1899 simulation?\n\n# 5. Cancellation Left Us Hanging\n\nNetflix axed the show after one season, so we\u2019ll\u00a0*never*\u00a0get answers about Ciaran, the spaceship, or whether any of it mattered. The creators (*Dark*\u00a0fans know this pain) love complex mysteries, but without payoff, it feels like wasted potential.\n\n# Was It All Just a Video Game?\n\nSome theories suggest\u00a0 1899\u00a0is a\u00a0psychological experiment\u00a0or a\u00a0*Matrix*\\-style VR game, but with no S2, we\u2019re left guessing.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014did the plotholes ruin it for you, or was the ride worth it?",

However, towards the end, when shit is about to hit the fan, the acting of the bullies is just hilarious. They act so over the top with their reactions and the english dub adds to the hilarity. The main female bully is the standout as every time she came on screen with her snarky smile or overconfident attitude and just grotesque screams, I was laughing inside. All the other bullies also seemed like extreme caricatures lol. \n\nI have to give props to the bully characters to keep the show interesting. The female and male leads did great job of course but the commitment the bullies showed to their over the top characters was great.",

At this point I decided to give in and pay the extra 10-18 dollars since I technically have gotten netflix for free the last few years. I saw I had to update to standard for an extra 11 dollars and then add a member for an extra 8 dollars or so. I dont mind. \n\nBut to my surprise Netflix doesnt allow extra member slots if you use a 3rd party to pay for part of the bill. Now im at a loss. I put back the ad version but now am at an empass.

        "content": "The Last Night at Tremore Beach is kind of a sleeper in that I can easily see folks blowing by it, but I actually thought it was pretty captivating if perhaps a little too drawn out.  I even had to watch it dubbed into English from Spanish because I am having some eye issues at the moment, and I thought the dub was much more natural than usual.  I;m sure there will be \"experts\" who decry plot holes and the like, but I thought it was overall put together very well as far as the mystery.",

You can install it on any other Windows 10/11 device you sign in to with that account \u2014 no need to pay again.\n\n  \nWhy You Need the HEVC Codec for HD/4K Netflix on PC\n\nNetflix uses different video codecs depending on the device, platform, and stream quality. The key reasons for needing HEVC are:\n\n 1. 4K (and sometimes even Full HD) Requires HEVC on PC\n\n HEVC (H.265) is a more efficient codec than AVC (H.264). It compresses video better while keeping quality high.\n\n Netflix streams 4K content (and often HDR) using HEVC, which requires:\n\n   HEVC decoding capability\n\n   Secure content protection (DRM like Widevine L1 in hardware)\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the HEVC codec, Netflix falls back to AVC1, which maxes out at 480p or 720p, even with a 4K plan.\n\n 2. Windows 10/11 Doesn\u2019t Include HEVC by Default\n\n Microsoft used to bundle the HEVC codec for free.\n\n But around 2017, they stopped because:\n\n   HEVC is not free to license. It has royalty fees tied to it (paid to patent holders).\n\n   To reduce Windows licensing costs, Microsoft made it an optional \\\\$0.99 addon in the Store.\n\nThis is why TVs, phones, game consoles still get HEVC support for free \u2014 the manufacturer licenses it for that device. But with PCs (especially custombuilt desktops), you\u2019re responsible for getting the codec.\n\n 3. Why You Didn\u2019t Notice Before\n\n If you only watched Netflix at 720p or lower before, AVC1 was enough.\n\n Or you might\u2019ve been on a device that came with HEVC preinstalled (like a laptop from Dell, HP, etc.).\n\n Now that you're on the Premium plan, Netflix tries to stream 4K \u2014 but it can\u2019t unless your PC supports HEVC with DRM.\n\nWhy Charge \\\\$0.99 at All?\n\nThe \\\\$0.99 price is basically a token fee to offset Microsoft\u2019s licensing cost. The real reason you have to pay:\n\n Microsoft can't legally distribute HEVC for free on Windows unless it's covered by an OEM license (e.g. Dell paid for it for your laptop).\n\n You\u2019re only charged once per Microsoft account, and the codec is yours forever.",

Yes, all his American accents are circa 1945 Brooklyn, but whatcha gonna do. \n\nAll that being said I REALLY wanted to like Havoc. If you turn your brain COMPLETELY off, it\u2019s kind of possible. \n\nIt\u2019s the cabin scene though that they completely lost me. All three standing in the wide open while a dozen guys open up on them in full auto from about 100 feet away. Not only do they have time to duck inside and \u201ccover\u201d but nary a bullet hits a one of them. The walls are essentially cardboard and somehow they are not only not getting hit, but returning fire and getting kills instead themselves. Ludicrous doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. \n\nThis movie so desperately wanted to be an updated Max Payne kinda vibe, but instead it was more Uwe Boll Max Payne. Do better. ",
