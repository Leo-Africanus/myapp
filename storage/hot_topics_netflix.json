After I watched it, I had watched his special from 2022 and you can tell he did not hold back this time around.  I mean he was honest about how he was there to take the audiences money.  He was honest about how American culture is so twisted with money when it comes to their own parents and America.  He made so many important points that people in general should really reflect on.  I love this guy - reminds me so much of George Carlin.  I had no idea who he was but I tend to watch what\u2019s in the top 10 and this is.  Not as heart felt as Jamie Foxx\u2019s special but clearly a different story there.  Ronny paid tribute to his dad at the end and I had some tears but I hadn\u2019t laughed that hard in so long.  I hope he does more specials/ tours - before he decides to peace out. I\u2019d pay to see him to make me laugh.    I wanted to see who else watched and everyone\u2019s thoughts were.  Did you love it as much as me or were you insulted like some people are by comedians these days? ",

She then gets to bond with her estranged father while defending him in a trial of which he is accused of murdering his wife.\n\nThere's a twist at the end that is totally unpredictable if you're not expecting a twist. There's just no hint whatsoever. I'm not the biggest fan of shocking last minute twists, but here it works, because it makes that character even more intriguing.\n\nI'm fascinated by characters who do bad and even evil things, but still feel like real people. What they call \"morally grey.\" This script has a few of them.\n\nThe reviewer made a casting suggestion for the main lead: Natalie Portman. I agree with him. She's never played a character like this, but she would be really interesting and probably nail it.\n\nThoughts?",

A lot of the characters feel quite hollow, which is big mistake when creating a show, but also because these are real people and they're drivers who were on camera a lot, so it feels strange that they essentially become cartoonish rather than authentic and what the person was like in real life, a bit disappointing.\n\nThey also didn't really touch on Senna's faith and religion like, at all. Which is again, a baffling decision considering Senna at one point literally said: \"I saw God visually\"\n\nI think maybe for F1 fans this is going to be quite a frustrating watch, and the question must be raised at this point - should Netflix really be producing F1 content? They've received criticism for their \"Drive to Survive\" series, and now this series as well...\n\nAnyway enough of my rambling, what did you all make of the Senna series?\n\n[Netflix's Senna Critique and Analysis](https://www.dive-bomb.com/article/netflix-s-senna-a-must-watch-for-racing-fans)",
