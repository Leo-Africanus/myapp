        "content": "You ever rewatch\u00a0**Gossip Girl**\u00a0and notice that something shifts around Season 4? It\u2019s subtle at first , like the sparkle\u2019s still there, but the edge, the bite, the tension that made the show feel alive starts to fade. The Upper East Side stops feeling like a battleground and more like a fashion runway.\n\nThe early seasons had this intoxicating cocktail of chaos. Every episode felt like a tug-of-war between privilege and pain. It wasn\u2019t just about who wore what, it was about who would survive the social hurricane. By Season 4, the show had climbed so high into its own mythology that it started to lose that New York grit that once grounded it. The parties got flashier, the scandals bigger, but the consequences smaller. Blair and Serena stopped feeling like complex women navigating identity and started becoming plot devices in an endless carousel of recycled love interests. Even Dan, once our moral compass , turned into a caricature of the self-righteous artist.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the show got bad , it just lost its danger. Remember how early Gossip Girl made you feel like you were peeking into a forbidden world, one text away from social annihilation? That electric fear , that\u2019s what vanished. The Upper East Side became too forgiving, too polished, too safe.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "content": "I just finished a painful watch of the Ed Gein story and I\u2019m just in shock as to how this got produced. This series really highlights the hypocrisy and inability to tell a story on Ryan Murphy\u2019s behalf.\n\nI\u2019m under the impression that the Monsters series is meant to help empathize with serial killers by showing the abuse they endured, as well to highlight the societal impact these cases have when they are so sensationalized. The main point of the Ed Gein story that I picked up on was that serial killers stories are misconstrued time and time again, and this has negative impacts, like glorifying violence and desensitizing audiences towards situations like this. Such is completely ironic.\n\nThe exact irony this show is trying to call out is simultaneously partaking in that irony on a whole new level. \n\nEd Gein never had an infatuation with \u201cisle Koch\u201d and \u201cisle Koch\u201d never had comic books made about her. Ed Gein also never had a fiance she was completely fictional for this series. Ed Gein also never had any contact with \u201cBirdman\u201d, and it was never corroborated that he had any romantic affiliation with the shop owner he murdered. I could go on about the historical inaccuracy\u2019s of this show. And I understand some artistic liberties need to be drawn to help tell a story, but these plot lines really had no correlation towards telling his story, and were completely made up for the sake of entertainment, it dilutes his story and shows a complete hypocrisy in the shows mission.\n\nIn my opinion a gritty docuseries about his actual life would have been hard hitting. He lived a boring isolated life, and yeah that would have made for less drama in the show, but it would have struck a nerve with the audience. It could have highlighted a truth that I think is extremely interesting; that anyone with a similar mental health disorder could have easily committed the same crimes that Ed Gein did, if their condition where left untreated and consumed by isolation, grief, and childhood trauma. That Ed Gein could have been a peaceful (yet eclectic) member of society if access to mental health care was available to him. \n\nThat would have really driven the shows moral standpoint clearly. That we are all vulnerable, and all deserve empathy, and that media never shows the real truth (and the negative consequences of that).\n\nInstead we got Birdman shaking his boobs in Ed Geins face, and a dance montage of Ed walking up to heaven while owner of a lonely heart plays \ud83d\ude02 pure brain rot.\n\n",

        "content": "I enjoyed Wayward. As a matter of fact, I thought it was pretty good. I *did* go into it with absolutely no expectations, simply clicking the link after a brief look at the description. A critique I would have is that the eight episode format felt, to me, sort of limiting. There was a lot that was touched on but not really elaborated upon in a satisfying way. The show may have benefitted from either being shorter and more concise, in order to remove elements that were either unnecessary or improperly explored, or longer, so as to deal with these issues in a more coherent manner and to keep some of the plot points from having such a rushed execution.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re down for a wild, and somewhat tonally inconsistent, ride, then there is fun to be had here. I found it relatively easy to get invested in the characters and their lives. The show was, at turns, endearing, unsettling and downright disturbing. There were twists I honestly didn\u2019t expect and ended up enjoying (sometimes despite the execution and not because of it, but whatever). The psychological drama, I thought, was more often than not well done and satisfying. The fact that one pair of protagonists are teenagers and the other pair are adults allows the series to walk the line between teen and adult drama without fully committing to either audience, and maybe being accessible to both (but I will leave that for you to decide). In terms of acting, some performances were more memorable than others, but I found nothing unserviceable and the main antagonist to be delightfully both creepy and easy to hate.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I feel as if I was able to feel satisfied with the series because I went into it with very little hype. It certainly wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, but it gave me eight hours of solid entertainment and left me wanting to know *more-* about the characters, their pasts and their inevitable fates. That\u2019s the primary pro and con of this series: it is like walking through a museum and looking at its portraits of people and landscapes. You are looking at \"snapshots\", and what both intrigues and frustrates about the experience is that each piece *suggests* so much to the mind, in terms of questions, speculations and fantasies, but the ultimate satisfaction of these suggestions occurs only in our imaginations.\n\nI have not settled on a rating yet, but I liked it, and my initial recommendation is to watch if you\u2019re into some creepy cult-thriller fun with a heavy dose of teenage angst and a penchant for leaving you with more questions than answers.\u00a0\n\n*I press post. I am sitting in a chair. I am crying out for the upvotes...*",

I can tolerate seeing one occasionally but not frequently. \n\nI\u2019m 4 episodes through and have a feeling they\u2019re tied to the plot. \n\nI like it so far though, should I continue?  (Please no spoilers) \n\nEdit: thanks for all your input, I stopped after a couple more episodes, felt like it was going nowhere. ",

I've spent the last hour trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong, and googling answers to this, but I'm about to give up.\n\nI do have an older ipad, that can't download past ios 15.8, but I can't find on their help page where it says you must have the most current OS to download things to your device.\n\nMy account says I can have 2 devices with downloads, and it can work on my iphone, but I can't find anything on the app on the ipad with the download icon?\n\nMaybe it's moot, because starting tomorrow I might not be able to use the app at all, on this specific device, but I am going bananas trying to figure out why I am not prompted anywhere to download anything, as it never was an issue in the past.\n\n  \nThanks all!!",
