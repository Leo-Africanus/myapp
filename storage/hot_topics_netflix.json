        "content": "I let my netflix subscription end last November. I'd always have the 4k plan through some deal, I believe the last year I had it through a verizon deal of like $140 bucks for the year with amc+. And I'd get something similar all previous years for the past like 5 years. But there have been zero deals this go around, and I'm now at a point where I'll be cancelling a couple other streaming services that are lacking or cheaper trials ending (i.e. apple 3 month trial). \n\nAnyway, the 4k plan is now $25 which is pretty insane to me. I did get a quality tv and sound system back in 2020 and am used to 4k on every other service. So I'm deciding if I want to do $25 a few months a year, or do $8/mo continuously for 1080p. Since netflix releases all episodes at once, it doesn't really create the weekly discussions the way a show like severance, last of us, white lotus, etc do. So I'm heavily leaning towards just subscribing for a month at $25, immediately cancel it so it ends that month, and rejoin when theres at least a few more new shows/seasons that actually appeal to me. Wondering how many other people just subscribe occassionally throughout the year. ",

        "content": "I was scrolling on instagram about a month or so ago and saw a trailer for a what looked like a new show coming to Netflix. \n\nThe only scene I remember is that there was a girl sitting in the dean\u2019s office talking to the dean about something. I can\u2019t even remember what. But I remember thinking it was interesting and that I\u2019d \u201cdefinitely remember this for later\u201d. \n\nWell now it\u2019s later and I can\u2019t find this trailer on any Netflix page and have nothing to go on. \n\nHas anyone else seen this or know what I\u2019m talking about? I know it\u2019s a long shot. \n\nThanks!",

        "title": "Does anyone else think that the new kid influencing docuseries is disgusting dramatic irony?",
        "content": "Netflix has released a new docuseries, \"Bad Influence\", about a kid who was exploited as a child influencer. Her mom posted her all over the internet as a kid with little / no regard for her safety, and made tons of money off of her.\n\nSo, Netflix are now using this kid's story to - you guessed it - make money off the documentary.\n\nHer full name is in it, her face is in it. I've watched the intro in which someone states \"predators were watching these videos\" AND IT SHOWS, with no censoring, the type of videos that predators would seek out - eg, of her dancing as a minor dressed in not a lot.\n\nThe real kicker is that this kid is STILL A KID. She's still 17. And even if she wasn't, I still feel this is exploitative. This is NOT the way to raise awareness of the dangers of child influencing.\n\nAlso - she's very active on social media and hasn't posted about the documentary, which makes me question whether this was even done with her consent. Imagine the mental toll this kind of thing would take on her. It seems to be an awful privacy violation for a child whose whole life has been a series of awful privacy violations. I hope she gets the help she needs and then sues the shit out of them.\n\nIt feels so disgustingly ironic to me. Gross on Netflix's part.\n\n(EDIT: I did watch an episode to make sure I was along the right lines after I posted this. just want to say I 100% agree with anyone saying that the other kids deserve to tell their stories, especially now they're adults. What an awful, disgusting situation all around. My heart breaks for all these kids. We must have better laws to protect our children from the internet. However, I do believe the publishing of the doc could make things worse for the \"main\" child in question, and I don't believe it was published with her best interests at heart. I'm also uncomfortable with Netflix monetising the situation. Thanks to everyone who's discussed this in the comments.)",
