Desire is really confusing because it's role is so confusing. \nQueen Nada got imprisoned in hell for 10000 years and when Dream rescued her she left because she was so angry at him. Destruction tried to warn dream about the atomic  or nuclear bomb that was gonna be used in wars. Delirium wanted to find out why Destruction left. Orpheus becoming the Oracle to save his wife from the underworld ruled by hades and his wife. I gotta say the writers made certain that lgbtq commu itu was included  here in this series. ",

I loved season 1 and was kind of disappointed  by season 2 until the last episode when things were picking up and we were getting somewhere but now at the start of season 3 we're almost back to where we were before the season 2 finale. \nAfter season 1 I thought it was supposed to be a criticism of capitalism and billionaires, but now that whole aspect is so much in the background and most of is just watching people die and being horrible. I get why people might enjoy that, but it's just not my type of show especially if it's mostly the same as season 1 and they just have different games. \nSo I guess I just wanted to ask if season 3 is similar to season 2 in that it mostly keeps focusing on the games itself? Or is it worth watching for people who don't just like it for the violence? ",

        "content": "So what are we thinking so far? \nMy thoughts below because I wish I knew someone who watched this \ud83d\ude02\n\nI personally am loving this show, so much talent and appreciated that they did all the showcases in one episode, I really thought they\u2019d annoyingly split it. The pace has been good, and I know they need the cheeky cliffhanger. \n\nSZN 4 - \nI absolutely believe that SZN 4 are the clear winners unless they royally screw up. \nI really wish they\u2019d chosen another name though! They all have such star quality, particularly Donzell and Aaliyah - incredibly powerful voices. Cameron\u2019s is so unique and I feel when Katie gains her confidence she shines.  - plus they seem like nice people. \nThey all scream \u201cI would have such a good time chilling at a party with them all\u201d \nAbsolute fan here of what they are bringing to the table; the energy, the difference in voices, the oomph they give. \n\nSweet Seductions - \nI\u2019m on the anti-Allison train and I know she\u2019s being made the villain, but she just seems like such an awfully narcissistic person that I don\u2019t think they could have edited it that much. it goes to show that chemistry on stage and actually having true friendship in the band really shows in the performance, \u201cSweet seductions\u201d were not conducive - and I don\u2019t see longevity in the band just based on their toxic relationship growing due to Allison being a drill instructor and treating them like props.i wish the other 2 had ended up with the other girls that Allison ditched. Allison will be the demise of them all. \n\nI think Soulidified and 3quency will also go far. \n3quency really surprised me tonight! But wow, they really did work so well together and seemed like such a unit. It was real sweet having the other girls try on the makeup too. \nAgain, seeing people be friendly to each other and supportive of each other is just going to make me like the band more haha but yeah they aced it. \n\nSoulidified is not my cup of tea BUT I can see how they would appeal to others, working hard as well together, seems like they have the business side of it all down pat and there voices do really work with each other. But some are definitely better than others, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter as much though because they are blending so well. They really were great tonight and had fabulous energy with each other. Song choice suited them for sure. Even if they don\u2019t win I think they\u2019ll get signed elsewhere. \n\nMidnight till morning - I\u2019m not going to lie I got my hopes up that they might try something a bit different with country dusky voices but they seem to just be wanting to fit the cookie cutter. I know it\u2019s for the drama, but Connor is annoying me and the immaturity/insecurity shines whenever he makes a snarky comment about another band. Being Australian I was having hopes for them, but maybe the \u201claid back\u201d Aussie way is preventing them from pushing themselves further \ud83d\ude18 I\u2019d be so frustrated too if you\u2019d made it that far and your 20 something yr old band mate just wanted to get laid. \nAlso very sad moment when Mason spoke to the late Liam Payne about seeing him way back, and about it being full circle. RIP Liam. \n\nAnd finally ! Gosh this is long - \nSiren society - I think they might leave, which is unfortunate as I actually think they did well tonight and really tried to push themselves with so much choreography. They seem really sweet to each other and supportive. I would have preferred them over sweet seduction any day. \nChoosing a song of one of the judges I don\u2019t think did them well either, way too risky at that stage - and as Nicole said - she has her own way of interpreting her own song, to then emulate that - well it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nAnyway everyone, I am SO KEEN to hear your thoughts on everyone! Who are your favorites? Who do you think is being carried? Who\u2019s going out? \n\n",

If not, then why build it so large? If so, then how would he have controlled it? To me this seemed like he wanted to build something big enough that it would seem credible for a small person to fit inside when he called the police.  \n\nAnother thought\u2026 when the kid said \u2018I thought we were doing this for a show,\u2019 I think it spilled the beans that he was always planning to \u2018accidentally\u2019 let the balloon go so he could call the FAA. (Who would ever think to call the FAA?! That clearly seemed planned). So I\u2019m wondering if  it\u2019s possible his kid going missing was not the original plan but just became part of it. Either way, I think jail time was suitable. Thoughts?",

I\u2019ve been trying to see if it has been released in Italy or if it\u2019s still filming but I am getting differing responses when I look it up. \n\nThe reason I want to watch it is because I watched DI4RI and it was great for Italian listening practice but the show was also really good \ud83d\ude0a \n\nGrazie ",
