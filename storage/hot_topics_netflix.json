        "content": "The first season had all the charm anyone could want in a show like this. It was quirky with a darker tone and I greatly enjoyed all the slight nods to the original Addams Family. It seemed like such a strong show. Every episode was good until the season final which I felt was a little over the top and lame. I thought it would pick back up for season two but my gosh was I wrong. The episodes are uncreative and unnecessarily long and to my dissatisfaction all the characters were butchered to an extreme. It hurt so bad to witness Eugene and Pugsley spend all there time causing issues with Slurp. Also, don\u2019t expect Wednesday to show any signs of improvement she seemed to have sorta gained at the end of the first season. Not only is that work erased but it actually feels like it\u2019s declining steadily. It\u2019s like she\u2019s supposed to be a badass but her character seems to have a bad case of main character syndrome. Bringing Tyler back to continue being a whiny jerk was not pleasant either and it was made worse for leaving Zavier out. Don\u2019t even get me started on the writing. It\u2019s some of the cringiest stuff I\u2019ve heard in a while. This is a lot of negative stuff but I can say some good things about the show too. Season 2 was mildly entertaining. Oh, wait. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Feel free to disagree with my opinion but for me this season was a joke.",

        "content": "I just finished this doc and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The whole thing plays out like a movie but some parts really don\u2019t add up.\n\nMax built this drug empire literally from his bedroom and the police show up like \u201cwe cracked a huge cyber case\u201d\u2026 but wasn\u2019t it basically a returned package and him using the same Packstation that gave him away? Makes me think the \u201cbig investigation\u201d angle is oversold.\n\nThen there\u2019s the money. They say millions were made, but where did it actually go? They show cops holding piles of drugs, not piles of cash. Authorities even admitted they don\u2019t know where all the money ended up. So are there wallets out there still untouched?\n\nAnd the family thing\u2026 this all happened in his mom\u2019s apartment yet she\u2019s never shown on camera. Not even after her son was arrested at home. How does a global drug empire run out of your house and you\u2019re never part of the story? Feels like something is being left out.\n\nMax himself is another puzzle. Totally flat, no emotion, no remorse. He talks about this like he\u2019s describing a homework project. Makes me wonder if he had some major trauma or if he\u2019s just wired differently.\n\nAnd the ending\u2026 they tease that he set up another website after all this but don\u2019t reveal the name. Like they want to keep the mystery alive. Later reporting says there was another site called Candylove but the doc never mentions it. Why hide that?\n\nIt almost feels like the \u201cteen genius alone in his room\u201d story is too neat. Was there really no bigger network? Or is the lone wolf angle just a legend?\n\nAnyone else feel like the documentary left out some huge pieces?",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/09rdqjbwsjof1.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd28c7e6c77cd584cd951213a1bf6b56be75f74\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts on Nikki Rodriguez, who plays Jackie (lead) in My Life with the Walter Boys. I recently found out that she\u2019s actually **33 years old**! This makes sense because her vibe feels much more **mature** than her character, who\u2019s supposed to be **15 or 16**.\n\nYou can definitely tell she\u2019s older in some ways. For example, the lines around her eyes and her smile lines really show her age and add to that mature impression. Plus, the way she carries herself feels much more adult. She graduated from Roseville Area High School in Minnesota in **2010**, which fits with her being older.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that older actors sometimes take on teenage roles, but it feels off for someone **over 30** to be playing a teenager, and this casting choice detracts from the **authenticity** of the show. Honestly, her acting is **subpar,** and she feels too mature for the role and struggles to embody a teenage character, especially given that it's almost **20 years** since she was that age.\n\nETA: Her real age is in the public domain and has been reported on social media and news sites.\n\n  \nEdit to add: My observations were about acting authenticity, not a personal attack. Physical characteristics matter when an actor is portraying a much younger character. This is a legitimate critique of casting and performance.",

Most appointments I had feel rushed Lab results get thrown at me with no explanation or I get a quick everything looks fine with zero context.

It\u2019s an AI tool that\u2019s built specifically for health questions not just general chatbot stuff. I use it to make sense of test results, get second opinions based on visit notes, and ask follow up questions I didn\u2019t get to bring up during appointments.  \nWatching The Good Doctor just kind of reinforced how helpful it is to have something that brings that kind of clarity and support into real life even if its through tech.",

        "content": "Recently has anyone else found that netflix is automatically repeating what they just watched? I had Kpop Demon Hunters on the other day while doing something, and then it just played it again, and bc I just had it on in the background I was like okay sure I'll watch it again, and then it looped it a third time, so it seems my netflix will just continually repeat movies now, is it a glitch or a new feature??? I've never had it automatically repeat before so I'm just curious \ud83d\ude02",

        "title": "Wednesday S2: am I the only one?! Am I being too harsh?",
        "content": "I really enjoyed S1 of Wednesday. It had some flaws, but overall a fun concept and use of the Addams IP. \n\nThis season though\u2026 6 episodes so far, and it feels like a completely unfocused mess, and I\u2019m considering just checking out. Where the first season had subplots BUT were NECESSARY red herrings &amp; dead ends as part of Wednesday\u2019s investigation, S2 subplots feel all over the place, as though the writers were just winging it because they weren\u2019t sure what they wanted to do. \n\nThere are also WAY too many returning characters we DIDN\u2019T need. And guest spots that don\u2019t feel like the intended nice surprise they\u2019re meant to be IF they were supported by good writing. They feel shoehorned. Especially Weems. I liked her character in S1, but they made their choice killing her off, and should have stuck with that. She now being Wednesday\u2019s spirit guide is a reach too far. \n\nI also find it perplexing that when Bianca\u2019s power would have been needed at a moment where it could have been life or death for the Nightshades facing Tyler, she doesn\u2019t even attempt to use it. Huh?!?!!?! What about Ajax? When shit hit the fan, he doesn\u2019t attempt to stone Tyler?!\n\nI also take issue with some of the way the Addams are represented here, compared to past media. Yes, the Addams are meant to be creepy &amp; kooky, and part of the gag of The Addams is how off putting &amp; backwards they\u2019re supposed to seem to regular people. But they were NEVER portrayed as bad people, doing bad things, at least to society. The subplot involving Pugsley\u2019s \u201cpet\u201d, and the lack of any genuine remorse from Pugsley &amp; Gomez for the amount of people it\u2019s killed is distasteful. I also dislike that Fester is a lifelong career criminal that escapes any true negative consequences, and even the family don\u2019t take issue with it either. The show handles these sorts of things in a \u201cYeah? So what?\u201d fashion, and it really rubs me the wrong way. \n\nI am at odds as to whether I bother continuing with the remaining episodes, because if Tyler somehow gets a \u201credemption &amp; all is forgiven\u201d arc, that will be the straw that breaks the camels back for me. \n\nCredit where credit is due though: Wednesday &amp; Enid having a \u201cFreaky Friday\u201d was great. It really seemed that both actresses had loads of fun playing each other\u2019s respective characters for that episode, and both did a remarkably good job: they totally sold that they had swapped bodies because they had the personalities nailed.
