I was like sure, this deal sounds good bc it's 8 a month for ad free Netflix? But as I logged in I see I can only have one profile, nbd, but not even a kids profile option I can switch to for when my kids are using it?? And upon reading up on it more I can only use it on one device at a time? Have I been swindled?

        "content": "Okay, I really hope I'm not the only one who has noticed and is disturbed by how apps from the Microsoft Store now work. Specifically, Netflix, Crunchyroll, YouTube Music, Facebook Messenger, and who knows how many others (probably plenty more).\n\nThe way these applications now function is by essentially using the Microsoft Edge browser. Instead of opening an app, you're basically just opening a browser tab. These \"apps\" rely on Edge's settings and even redirect links to Edge when it's not your default browser. In other words, you no longer get any of the functionality you'd expect from a standalone app. It's literally the same experience as opening the webpage in Edge. How does that even qualify as an application?!\n\nWhat's worse is that if anyone somehow manages to uninstall or delete Edge from their computer, or if a buggy update breaks it, I bet all these so-called \"apps\" will stop working entirely.\n\nI really hope nobody tries to defend this practice because it's indefensible.\n\nRight now, I'm furious about the disappearance of the Netflix app. The app used to let me directly connect to my home theatre receiver and send high-quality audio with surround sound support. That\u2019s gone now\u2014thanks a lot.   \nOn top of that, I'm facing a huge issue with Netflix lowering the resolution when playing via the browser (or the \"app\") for absolutely no good reason. I can see how it quickly buffers about 4 minutes of video, but after playing for just a few seconds, it drops the quality, it stutters, rewinds a second, and starts redownloading another 4 minutes of video. This cycle repeats, and the quality keeps dropping until it hits the lowest resolution, which in my case watching on a big screen makes it unbearable. \n\nAnd yes, before anyone asks:\n\n* My profile is set to high-quality playback.\n* I have a fast, stable internet connection (110 Mbps is more than enough).\n* I'm using a solid gaming build, so there are no hardware issues.\n\nI even tried installing an old Chrome extension called *Netflix 1080p* made by Truedread, because this problem has existed for years. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked yet, I will play around with settings and source code further in attempts to resolve this.\n\nI am new to posting on reddit so if I have not done something right please let me know ( I know you want to).\n\n",

        "title": "\"Arcane\" S1 and S2 review [No spoilers]",
        "content": "I had a free weekend and the second season of arcane came out, but didn't remember the first season at all, so it was a no-brainer, 2 days, 2 seasons, simple and easy. The first season is a masterpiece, it's the usual first season of a show that gets people into the world, into the story, into the characters and cuts off right before everything is about to go wild and MY GOD Arcane does all the above so goddamn well, after the first season you know what each character is after, how fucked up they are, what are their ambitions and all of that accompanied by stunning visuals, great music and heart-ripping drama. The second season starts off right where the first one left off, the Act 1 and Act 2 (Ep.1-6) just keep pounding you with head-blowing action, neck-breaking music and berries you under your own teers, at the same fucking time! Honestly wasn't expecting this amount of drama mid season, though it kinda makes sense, because the ending isn't as... now, idk what adjective to pick to not downgrade the ending, I mean it's a great ending, it finishes all the character arcs nicely and very satisfyingly. but it's not something epic and world changing, would call it a peaceful ending. Also the story overall is great, but I'm not sure why people keep dying, just so in the next episode they're back on their feet, but it doesn't feel like they're out of their place, I just can't trust the show to actually kill someone, forever. The music is another thing I would like to mention, it's always nice to see when creators aren't afraid to put music over action and basically everything else, but when they've spent a gazillion bucks on the amazing tracks, made by great musicians, WHY THE HELL NOT!? I mean anybody that says the music distracts the viewer, more than \"fills the glass of emotions to the top\", just hasnt seen how a monsterous beast chasesa character while heavy guitars are playing in the background or how the music gets in that crack of your heart after a lovely character dies and just rips your heart half in two. Arcane is an amazing show that left me speechless for the rest of the day and recommend it to everyone, no matter what style of animation you like, no matter what music you enjoy, it has everything for everybody and it matters not wether you like LoL or not, Arcane works as well as any other show as a stand alone piece of art.",

Looks like it was created but only released in certain parts of the world? \nCan anyone confirm if season 1 wraps everything up before I get to the end? ",

        "content": "This was an excellent show! Highly recommended.\n\nThe writer does an amazing job of giving the viewer a glimpse into the journeys of the various characters by displaying their histories, dreams, aspirations, desires, and hopes, feelings, etc. This allows the view to resonate and identify with the various characters; however, the writer also depicts both the violence and flaws of the characters and also the multiple forms of violence that these characters are subjected to and struggle against.\n\nThe beautiful humanization of those who are neglected, marginalized, and societally abandoned depicted by the series really allows the viewer to feel the full weight of the tragic and horrific final massacre.\n\nNetflix needs to continue employing such great writers and needs to keep producing content that grapples with such important and heavy themes.",

I haven\u2019t been able to find an update on it. The cast is great \n\nI\u2019ve only been able to see that it may arrive early 2025. Not sure if that\u2019s true or not ",
