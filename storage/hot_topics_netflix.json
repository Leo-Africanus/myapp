        "content": "I\u2019m disappointed to say the least. The ending was so meh. I had such high expectations from this season considering it was gonna be the last but it seemed as though the creators wanted to quickly finish it. They couldn\u2019t have chosen worst actors to play the Vips because the dialogue delivery was so terrible especially the woman vips\u2019. I get that gi hun\u2019s spirit was crushed and he didn\u2019t have anything to say but they could have added some more dialogues. He seemed disinterested which I get but it was boring because he\u2019s my fav character. Also Hwang not believing woo that captain park was playing them was so annoying, woo was his teammate and him choosing to believe the captain was just\ud83d\ude16. The ending they gave to the mother son duo too was quite anticlimactic. So many characters died very quickly in the hide and seek game, I couldn\u2019t understand who died and how (player 44 seon and dae ho) I wish they added something more to Dae ho\u2019s storyline instead of killing him right away. In the end, I kinda expected gi hun to kill himself but the way he fought player 333 and protected the baby I wish he died once he was out of the game. I was also at some point hoping he\u2019d give the baby to that North Korean guard with a daughter in china. Seeing Cate Blanchett in the end was unexpected and it felt like an advertisement. When gi hun meets the front man and he takes off his mask I was kinda hoping they\u2019d share a passionate kiss even tho gi hun was fuming with anger and was astonished. The kiss would have made up for the plot they tried to sell and made my 6hrs worth it. I liked how the entire island blew up and all the guards running around to escape it. That and the front man almost tearing up seeing gi hun muster the courage to kill all the other players was peak squid game moment for me. All in all I\u2019d give it a 6/10. (This is my first review that I\u2019ve ever written so if my writing style was not on point or too casual please don\u2019t mind)",

        "content": "Where... do we even begin. At this rate, I would've preferred if Gi-hun just got on that plane in season 1's ending. I find it insane the cast all agreed this was the best possible ending.\n\nSo many characters wasted and built-up for nothing.\n\nJun-ho? He's a terrible Dora the Explorer. All this searching for the island across 2 seasons, WASTED. He doesn't even TALK to his brother. How in the hell is him just being sent the baby and money a satisfying conclusion for his character?\n\nDae-ho is another example. All this mystery of whether he's a fake marine or lying. It seems like he has an abusive dad, always changing the subject whenever he's brought up. You think we're going to get some story of him being traumatized right? NOPE! He's literally just a fake marine, he goes crazy and then he dies, murdered by Gi-hun.\n\nThe mother and son were an exact copy of the wife and husband. Grandma gives the inspiring speech... and then just kills herself.\n\nThe season is described as \"forgiveness\" by Lee Jung-jae. What forgiveness? I didn't see ANY of that.\n\nAnd MG Coin? This season basically just proved Thanos was right. Throughout the first 5 episodes, he's a genuinely well-written morally gray character... and then the finale throws it ALL out the window in lightning speed. He goes from protecting Gi-hun and the baby to suddenly trying to murder both. Right after asking if the baby is okay.\n\nThe writer/director claims he wasn't supposed to be a one dimensional villain but rather make \"human/realistic decisions\" but NONE of that was it. He just turned cartoonishly evil in the blink of an eye. A worse Sang-woo, at least his turn was gradual.\n\nAnd the ending doesn't even feel like a proper conclusion, just a set-up for the sequel's. I don't even need to get into the VIP's.",

I don't want to imagine the smell or the illnesses people got because of it, but it's not going to last forever.  People have had to put up with worse.\n\nPooping in a bag... It beats pooping on the floor.  It's a logical measure to take when the sewage system stops working.  Poop in bags, it can all be collected, and it can be placed and contained in an appropriate area.  Truck drivers and van lifers poop in bags all the time.  It's no big deal.\n\nThose three women...  So many things about those women...\n\nFirst, the bride-to-be seemed like she was the inspiration for Kristen Wiig's role in The Californians on SNL...she was dripping with an abundance of unnecessary drama.  \"Why isn't the bar open???\"  Then taking the Imodium, doubling down on her fear of pooping without a toilet, and complaining about a soggy lettuce sandwich when there could have been zero food at all.\n\nThen the group talking about peeing in the shower.  It's like they were clueless about the fact they were born as human animals with biologic processes.  They seemed to not have an idea about how they could squat to pee in a shower.  They were disgusted with having to do it, needing a shower after.  Jeez ladies, it's just pee... ever been camping?",

People use incognito mode in web browsers all the time for similar reasons\u2014why not bring that privacy option to streaming too?\n\nAlso, I noticed a small typo in the original idea\u2014\u201cincognito mouse\u201d was probably meant to say \u201cincognito mode.\u201d But hey, imagine a sneaky little mouse sneaking around Netflix too! \ud83d\ude04\n\nOverall, I think this feature could attract a lot more users and keep current ones happier.\n",

I would like to double down and say it\u2019s worse than Season 2.\n\nThis season tried to follow the formula of the first season, where they gave meaningful and emotional deaths to characters like Ali, etc., but it fails miserably.\n\nThe death of the mother and son duo doesn\u2019t feel impactful at all \u2014 it just makes them look foolish. The grandma killing her son is like\u2026 okay? That son couldn\u2019t take out one guy when he had the chance, and instead he goes after a child? The grandma\u2019s death feels hypocritical too \u2014 she keeps yapping  to Gi-hun about saving the kid and 222, and then proceeds to end her own life. **Even TWITTER USERS aren\u2019t that contradictory.**\n\n222\u2019s death is saddening when she tries to cross the bridge, but it still feels hollow. The show had already mishandled the deaths of beloved characters, so by the time her moment comes, the emotional weight is just gone.\n\nDa-ho or whatever his name is \u2014 his death felt deserved, but it had so much missed potential. He could\u2019ve had a great redemption arc. Instead, he\u2019s taken out by 456 in such an underwhelming way after Gi-hun debates like four times whether to go through with it.\n\nThe \u201cvillains\u201d this season are bland and not well-written. They\u2019re just stereotypical greedy bad guys who are eliminated because the plot demands it \u2014 not because their arcs naturally conclude that way.\n\nThe final \u201cSky Squid Game\u201d fight felt like it was there just to move the plot forward. Gi-hun and the baby survive, along with the not-so-smart 333, just because the story needs them to.\n\nThe VIPs escape. The Front Man and his brother\u2019s conflict lacks any real tension and is summed up in about ten words. And now we\u2019re getting a **money-making spin-off** \u2014 *Squid Game: America*? This is not what we wanted, and Netflix probably knew it. It feels like **a business-first mentality took over the storytelling.**",

I tried to search online, but can\u2019t find any official announcement from Netflix on this. So seems like Netflix in silence remastered season 1 for HDR. Don\u2019t mind, HDR looks great, hard to see the difference between HDR in season 1 and 2. so they did a great job.\n\nThe scene in byers house when the Demogorgon enter through the ceiling and all the christmas lights are flashing looks insane in the HDR remaster.\n\nSame with the school scene were El destroys the Demogorgon and all the lights are flickering. \n\nThese two scenes looks brilliant in HDR.\n\nQuestion is, have anyone else noticed this? When did it happen, season 1 was SDR last time I watched it, 2 years ago.",

        "content": "So I accidentally clicked on the Kids profile on Netflix and that\u2019s how I stumbled on K-Pop Demon Hunters. And honestly? It wasn\u2019t bad at all.\n\nNetflix really needs to step up their game when it comes to promoting their content. There are so many decent shows and movies buried in there that never get the spotlight.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s my quick review:\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe story was actually interesting. It felt like there\u2019s more to the story that we didn\u2019t get to see enough of. I\u2019d love to see it turned into a full series. it definitely has potential to expand.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\nThe animation could\u2019ve used some work. Most of the time, only the characters\u2019 mouths moved no facial expressions or detailed movement. It felt a bit stiff.\n\nA live-action version might be even better, honestly. The concept is strong enough to carry it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIt\u2019s enjoyable. I\u2019d give it a solid 7/10. Worth the watch. ",

        "content": "Hello, r/Netflix community!\nI just had to share my thoughts on \"Mercy For None,\" the new limited series that dropped recently. I finished it and honestly, I'm still reeling! Without giving away any plot points, if you appreciate intense, visceral action with a truly brutal edge, you absolutely need to add this to your watchlist. I'm not saying it's the same, but it delivers an unrelenting, high-octane experience that reminded me of the best parts of action thrillers, almost like a John Wick-level intensity but with its own distinct, darker flavor.\nIt's currently climbing the ranks on Netflix, and for good reason. Has anyone else watched it yet, or is it on your radar? Would love to hear your spoiler-free initial reactions or what you're hoping for if you plan to watch!\nCheers,\n\nu/killwish_",

        "content": "Hey, im a British netflix user, and I 've noticed as of recent that the brightness slider doesn't always seek to work as intended, and it seems to be on certain shows/movies that it does or doesn't work properly. I think it has been a problem for longer, but it never used to be a thing that bothered me as much since I never used Netflix on my phone as much as I do now.\n\nI am currently using a Samsung 23 Ultra, but i am certain I have experienced this issue on previous Android phones I have used.\n\nI've found that every now and then, when I'm watching something on Netflix, the brightness seems to be too low despite me having it all the way up on the app in the overlay settings, and when I try moving the slider up and down, probably around 60%~ of the slider (from the top of the slider towards the bottom) doesn't change anything. When the slider is all the way around the bottom, it's darker, clearly lower brightness, but it only seems to brighten up to 30-40%~, after that, sliding it up higher makes absolutely no difference.\n\nAlso as I said before, confusingly, it seems to be on certain movies/shows, and as of posting this, the only show I can find where that is a problem is Inside Job, though I do remember this being an issue on previous movies/shows I've watched in the past.\n\nI have 3 questions really;\n1 - has anyone else experienced this issue with the brightness clearly not going above a certain point despite the fact that it should, due to sliding the brightness control slider higher\n2 - are there any known reasons for it happening to me, or fixes for it?\n3 - is it an issue more specifically with the individual shows somehow? (I can't tell, as the netflix website doesn't have a brightness slider, but shows that appear too dim on my phone appear brighter and fine on the website on my PC)",

The selling part of the internal organs were underground activities of the other guards. They get their funds from bored wealthy VIP\u2019s bets. The games are for entertainment. The players are tested not only physically but also morally so last one standing \u201cdeserves to live\u201d so he/gets the prize. \n\nBut I have a question, why is Hwang In Ho so loyal on that game?
