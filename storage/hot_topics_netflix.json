And which character do you think was the most realistic?\n\nCurious how everyone feels about it now vs when it first dropped.",

It is painfully relatable.\n\nYour Monster carries strong Beauty and the Beast energy with a love story that wrestles with the inner self. It explores the struggle to overcome the distance between loving who you are inside and facing a world that keeps pushing past your boundaries.\n\nJust gorgeous and completely unhinged in the best possible way.\n\nThey also killed the ending!",

        "content": "I just rewatched Dash &amp; Lily after having a pretty rough week, and I\u2019m kind of emotional about it.\n\nI first watched it when I was 14, and I don\u2019t think I realized at the time how much it shaped my idea of what love should be. That show genuinely formed the way I see romance, as something pure, intentional, and almost\u2026 perfect in its imperfection.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most spectacular or dramatic series ever. It\u2019s not trying to shock you or overwhelm you. It\u2019s just balanced. A little humor, a little sadness, a little awkwardness, a little magic. But somehow it all comes together in a way that feels so safe and warm.\n\nThe whole notebook concept, two people connecting through words before really knowing each other  it just feels so sincere. Like love doesn\u2019t have to start with fireworks or chaos. It can start with understanding. With curiosity. With vulnerability.\n\nAnd the atmosphere?? The Christmas vibe in New York City, the bookstores, the quiet moments, the soundtrack it creates this world that feels softer than real life. Like there\u2019s space to breathe.\n\nWatching it again now, after feeling kind of suffocated by the world lately, it still gives me that same healing feeling. Like maybe out there, somewhere, there really is someone who fits you in that almost poetic way. The right timing. The right dynamic. The \u201cthis makes sense\u201d kind of connection.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t rewatch it sooner. I think I\u2019m going to make it a thing now anytime life feels heavy, I\u2019m putting it on.\n\nIt might not be the most complex show ever made. But to me? It\u2019s perfect. And I kind of owe it for shaping the part of me that still believes love can be something pure.",

        "content": "Honestly, I still had a great time watching the show. It\u2019s not the next masterpiece, but it was a fun, quick 8-episode binge. I\u2019ve read complaints about the poor acting, but I couldn't care less because I actually enjoy a bit of trashy love triangle drama. However, one thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between the sisters, Adriana and Elise. They literally went from loving each other to being die-hard enemies wishing the worst on each other within five minutes. It didn't just happen once, it felt like it happened every single episode. It was laughable and made zero sense. Another thing that bothered me was how unrealistic the money situation was. Being 30k in debt is laughable if ALL of your pro athletes are going to the World Finals. I don't know exactly what figure skaters make, but I do know what sponsorships pay for a whole roster of World Champs. It made the debt plot point feel really weird. Also, why was there no winning party at the end? That felt like a huge missed opportunity!",
