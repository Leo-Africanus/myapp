        "content": "Unpopular opinion; I found Blake Lively to be an awful character in this movie. There is no excuse for the actions that happened upon her character, however as a survivor of DV myself, I couldn\u2019t help but watch her character cause so many issues in the relationship to start. Holding things back, not being up front and honest from the start. If it were me I would introduce Atlas from the beginning to my partner. Catching them in the bathroom? Having his number in the back of her case? Yeah, that\u2019s damaging to any relationship. His actions following were inexcusable, I just can\u2019t help but view this film as an inaccurate description to DV survivors and the reality of their day to day. There was a lot about the movie I did find was well made and beautiful. \n\nI found Justin to be amazing in the film. Afterwards I read about him producing and then I saw all the drama about Blake suing him. At first I was shocked, he\u2019s never had this kind of image. He did a Ted talk about toxic masculinity and is known for being an advocate for survivors. However I still gave Blakey the benefit of the doubt, knowing most abusive men can have multiple personalities. \n\nAfter more research I found out about her bringing her husband on, having BL and RR redirecting the film in many important respects for the storyline. It all made sense now. I have learned so much about BL and RR, I feel really sad for Justin Baldoni. He owns the rights, has been working on this project and very passionate about its message since 2019. BL was brought in, in 2023. \n\nAnyone else have these thoughts? I\u2019d love to hear about others views and opinions on the movie and what they thought about BL and JB\u2019s story. ",

He was honest about how American culture is so twisted with money when it comes to their own parents and America.  He made so many important points that people in general should really reflect on.  I love this guy - reminds me so much of George Carlin.  I had no idea who he was but I tend to watch what\u2019s in the top 10 and this is.  Not as heart felt as Jamie Foxx\u2019s special but clearly a different story there.  Ronny paid tribute to his dad at the end and I had some tears but I hadn\u2019t laughed that hard in so long.  I hope he does more specials/ tours - before he decides to peace out. I\u2019d pay to see him to make me laugh.    I wanted to see who else watched and everyone\u2019s thoughts were.

I distinctly remember 3 scenes not in the cut on Netflix currently: \n\n1. The plant store opening \n2. The book sequel being a hit \n3. The ski instructor/trainer moving to LA\n\nDid I make all of this up in my head? ",
