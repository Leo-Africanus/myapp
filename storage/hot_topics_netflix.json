Either have a rule that all first seasons have a closed story arc or give shows time to build viewership.\n\nGood example - dead boy detectives = I'm devastated there's no season 2, but it was a closed arc, all major ploy points resolved and I don't feel that netflix stole 8 hours of my life.\n\nBad example - the midnight club, or a whole bunch of others that I had on a watch list and then removed when I found out they were cancelled but left on a cliff hanger. I have no incentive to watch them now. \n\nAt least where there is a closed arc, I may still go and watch a cancelled show.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

It was genuinely a great show, the reason it was probably renewed initially before Covid. They had already been working on the script. Do you think it's possible to produce a Season 2?",

I\u2019ve tried logging out and back in, restarting my device, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but nothing seems to fix it. It happens across multiple devices, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem with just one. Has anyone experienced this, or does anyone know what\u2019s causing it and how to fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated \u2013 I just want to be able to watch my shows again! Thanks in advance!",

As well as the excellent new show Territory was only 6 eps. I was also looking ahead and 2 shows I'm insanely excited for Black Doves and American Primevil are also going to be only 6 eps. It's insane that every few years it feels like they push the ep count lower. Which is extra crazy because they count shows on minutes watched which basically sets new shows up to fail and is the reason we have no new shows.",
