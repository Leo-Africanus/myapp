Now also I checked my mother's profile too, and hers is set like mine= no restrictions, and hers is working fine.

This is expected, but then the UI elements fade away (as they are supposed to) but the dark filter stays and does not go away, so basically I am stuck watching a show with that dark filter permanently on, making the show very dark. Has anyone experienced this before ? Does anyone know how to fix this?",

        "content": "Minor spoilers ahead!! \n\nI'm pissed at the reaction to thos show; it feels like a lot of people hate on it because they think it's piggybacking off of Squid Game, and I really don't feel that way. Squid Game was cool but it didn't really have substance to me, it felt like a game for the most part, it felt like that's what the showrunners treated it as. \n\nBut The 8 Show, *I* believe, has such a fucking fantastic message that ot portrays so beautifully. I think the cruelty of 8th Floor and 6th actually shows you what it's like being in the shoes of someone poor going up against someone rich. I think 4th floor and 5th floor being 'slaves' to the upper floors, and, somewhat by choice, not helping the lower floors is also fucking spot on. The lower floors stick together -- except one of them really needs the money, and will do *anything* to get it, including hurting the people around them. \n\nI was bothered by some plot holes, but i can explain things like 2nd locking them all up by... Well, they didn't want more time, but now that they have it... And 5th being naive and delusional makes sense, too, to me at least. Lots of whacky shit, but it's so raw and intense that I think it did its job well. \n\nAnd with the ending, I think it tied things up well. I did NOT like the games, I did NOT like the brutality, as a matter of fact I was so disturbed i cried at some parts and the only reason i didn't skip things was cuz i didn't wanna miss story, or miss the emotions that came from things like 3 fucking HOME RUNNING 1'S HEAD. \n\nChills.\n\nIt's not for everyone. But I've been poor all my life, and i have had a lot of friends and family in different places. All the different systems of hierarchy and power that are put in place is what gets people killed. As an anarchist and anti-capitalist, the message resonated with me, not manhy shows or movies I've seen capture just how genuinely brutal and uncaring the *systems* are while somehow making sure to keep every character somewhat empathetic or understandable. Except 8. Fuck 8. \n\nGreat show, the hate is undeserved, i don't think it's really about the story so much as what it's trying to tell you. ",

        "content": "I recently started watching *Breaking Bad*, and I wanted to improve my English skills by watching it with English subtitles. However, I\u2019ve encountered a problem I'm unable to access the English subtitles for the series. I\u2019ve tried looking into the settings on the streaming platform I\u2019m using, but the option for English subtitles doesn\u2019t seem to be available, or maybe I\u2019m missing something.\n\nCould this issue be related to regional restrictions or a technical error? I\u2019m not sure if where I live is causing the limitation. If there\u2019s a specific method or setting I should be using, I\u2019d greatly appreciate your guidance.\n\nWatching the show with English subtitles would be really helpful for me, as I\u2019m working on improving my language comprehension.",
