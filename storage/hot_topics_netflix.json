No hospital or workplace in their right mind would do that. It\u2019s a welcome mat to people thinking she just got the job because of her compliant (which sounds like it cause Dr. Cruz says she\u2019s trying to handle a PR nightmare)\n\nSide note, not only would they not make her chief, wouldnt she be under mandatory therapy or leave as well after something traumatic? Seems like she\u2019s back on the floor the day after filing a huge traumatic complaint. I feel like anyone in a profession like that would have to be psychologically cleared. We already see her having flashbacks of him when she\u2019s trying to treat patients..\n\nAs if that\u2019s not bad enough, the same doctor now admits to permanently putting her sister in a wheelchair from pushing her down the steps. Just seems weird af she continued a normal life after something so major? \n\nHorrible character writing and super unoriginal plot. \n\n",

        "title": "Blindspot Binge, 3rd rewatch, answer to the finale",
        "content": "Sorry for this in depth response, but as you can see I was a fan of this show and I\u2019ve been coming on here lately because it came back to the forefront. I have always thought that Jane lived in the end and always believed the ultimate clue was in her final words, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d The reason I\u2019m posting this after 5 years is because when it was on TV and I watched the finale, there wasn\u2019t much buzz around it because of COVID and everything going on in the country during that summer, which obviously, and rightly, had people\u2019s attention and focus. \n\nThen it came back to the forefront through Netflix about a month ago and all I\u2019m seeing is how she definitely died, which was not the case. This is for a number of reasons. My first point is that basically it would mean the whole central theme of the show and character arc of Jane, Roman\u2019s sacrifice and ultimate realization that Weller was the key to Jane\u2019s living on due to his ability to ground and surround her with happiness and positive meaning, which he (as her brother) never could, was all for not. To dive a little deeper, the point of Jane\u2019s character is redemption and proving good can be found in evil and eventually turn complete evil into complete goodness. With that being the central theme, you don\u2019t have redemption if you ultimately fail at your mission and die. I get some will argue self sacrifice as the ultimate show of love and care for others, but that\u2019s not what Jane was, she was a survivor and a fighter. Her ultimately dying would be the antithesis of her characters whole persona. \n\nMoving on to my next point, a secondary theme that comes up in one of the tattoo cases is Remi and Roman are an ode to Remus and Romulus, the ill fated siblings, one who died and one who went on to found one of the greatest empires to exist on this planet. In this case the roles were reversed obviously, Remi was the Romulus, the survivor who achieved what both sought too, but only one could. In her case it was a life of \u201cboredom\u201d, but happiness with Weller, hence the finale\u2019s title \u201cIunne Ennui\u201d, which is the word ennui backwards and forwards, and is an ode to Remi and Roman (Remus and Romulus) switching fates.\n\nThis title also alludes to Jane\u2019s character, again in that it is the word written backwards first and then correctly second. It suggests she entered (first appearance) Time Square with her character\u2019s morale compass being completely non-existent, but a life full of excitement and left it (finale) with her morale compass being overly high, with a life of boredom in front of her. This is demonstrated and emphasized by Time Square being empty during the cut away scene with just the body bag in the middle. This is done to illustrate the emptiness is gone and happiness and belonging is what she is a part of, which is what the dinner scene is all about. \n\nYou also must consider that EVERYONE of those characters at the table is alive, not died like with the hallucinations and they have even grown since the events in Time Square and found some semblance of happiness in there own (now boring) lives. Everyone says it is too perfect of an ending when in actuality it is just life, think of drifting apart from friends and then coming together one time a year or every couple years. Do you commiserate over how your life isn\u2019t what you wanted it to be or do you remember the good times you had and how you grew and had awesome experiences together? (If the answer is you commiserate over depressing stuff then you\u2019re definitely doing it wrong). \n\nLastly and most importantly are her final words. The \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d response is to Roman\u2019s overall questions of, \u201cCan we be good, can we be forgiving and forgive ourselves for our past sins and can we find happiness (or a happy ending)\u201d? This is explicated expressed in the final episode of season three as he lay dying under the tree (episode 3.22), he asks her this directly. It\u2019s truly a very good bit of TV and highlights the central theme and plot of the entire, can evil become good and does a redeemed evil thing deserve happiness in the end? This question ultimately isn\u2019t answered for 2 seasons, and I know the show got outrageous in terms of storyline, but how much of that was a hallucination also? Honestly, I\u2019ve always wondered that and still do after my third rewatch. \n\nAnyways, overall, I know some think it\u2019s \u201copen to interpretation\u201d, but people never mention that in the same interview where Gero himself said this, he follows that up with, if one analyzes the \u201cauthorial intent\u201d of the show in totality and the finale at a macro level, there is a correct answer. To me, if you\u2019re writing a story, this would be the authorial intent of any good author to bring the ultimate closure to plot and central theme. Jane saying \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d literally means she changed from evil to good, was finally able to let go of her past evils and realized that even if your evil, sometimes you do deserve that second chance and happy ending, which Jane did deserve.

It gives me an immediate comparison and after watching Ep 1 of the new season so far I\u2019m not getting into it at all. Honestly the fact that Xavier is not in it is a huge loss for the show, I googled why he\u2019s not in it and it\u2019s just ridiculous. Nothing has been said officially! I read he has been seeing working the door at some bar \u2026not sure if it\u2019s true. But whatever happened to him getting cancelled so easy. It\u2019s just weird. To me he was a huge part of the series and the storyline between him and Wednesdays in my opinion was the most interesting one! I\u2019ll obviously continue watching just to see if it gets better but I\u2019m actually upset he\u2019s not in it. He was to me the most interesting character, artistically, of all besides Wednesday of course! What do y\u2019all think? ",

        "content": "I just finished the 4th season of 'Stranger Things' and I observed:\n\n\n1. The demogorgon in the Russian prison when released on the captives, is so much extremely fast and powerful, kills most of the men in blink of an eye, but for some reason it goes slowly and easy on Hopper and Enzo, waits for Hopper to lit a fire and then doesn't even go away from fire, just gets very slow. It is shown to easily break the prison walls and structures and create havoc, but was for some reason waiting until now.\n\n\n2. The plan to defeat Vecna didn't seem like a plan. They all knew how fatal is upside down, but they went there casually with a few normal guns and no special weapon, while completely ignoring many scenarios which could happen. They didn't even have a proper serious discussion about the plan and any what-ifs. \n\n\n3. Everywhere these guys went they kept talking loudly and kept arguing, instead of keeping a watch and being careful, looking for any clues. They never cared if something undesired hears them or attacks them. \n\n\n4. Lucas and Max didn't even lock the house from inside or had any plan on what will they do if someone disturbs them when Max goes in trance (they were aware that Jason was on lookout for them all). This situation was not something they could compromise with. (Even though I hate Jason for being there at wrong time)\n\n\n5. It was brutal to watch Max finally getting folded by Vecna.\n\n\n6. I am tired of stupidity from characters like Eddie who had no business jumping back into upside down, when it wasn't even helping anyone. He and Dustin had already distracted the bats for a good amount of time, and just needed to take care of themselves. It was an unnecessary and meaningless loss.\n\n\n7. Found Joyce to be very irritating at certain moments. \n\n\n8. Joyce and Murray casually deciding to attack the pilot Yuri in sky without really caring about how will they survive, and then comfortably getting out of the crash with minor scratches. \n\n\n9. Seeing Hopper alive was such a normal moment for everyone like he just returned from a long vacation. \n\n\n10. After Max final gets unconscious, the gate to upside down gets cracked open throughout the city (atleast) which should completely change everything immediately. But 2 days later we see the headline on TV calling it an earthquake? Everyone in Hawkins including the police ignored the miles long (atleast) giant orange crack which is a portal to another world going through the city for 2 days? Why and how they completely ignored that? Even the kids didn't talk about it. (During the very last of the episode when the snow like particles started raining, we could see some orange gates or cracks spread throughout an area) \n\n",

The other day her email connected to the Netflix account was compromised but the hacker didn't take the email by the looks of it as I easily recovered it for my mum. But the Netflix account has been taken! They changed the password of course and email but here is the creepy thing. My mums email have our surname in it and the new email on the Netflix account has our last name in it and we tried to recover the account through mums credit card and apparently her credit card isnt on the account either. \n\nIt also has a @renew.club at the end and I've never ever seen that before. So right now I can't recover the account whatsoever as we are gonna have to call up sky and probably Netflix but Its just all werid and creepy. Like why take the Netflix account and take off the credit card? Why use apart of the original account holders email in the new email? And why not fully hack the original email to gain access to more data?",

I didn\u2019t expect it to be exactly like the old\u00a0Addams Family. I knew it would have its own twist, but it just feels\u00a0off.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t like the acting. It looks weird and unnatural, not in the charming, spooky\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0way, but in a \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel believable\u201d way. The makeup doesn\u2019t look good either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere, it makes the characters look kind of awkward.\n\nThe plot also feels too childish, like it\u2019s trying to be edgy but still ends up being a teen drama without much depth. The detective/thriller angle is actually a good idea in theory, but the execution feels\u2026 meh.\n\nIt\u2019s below the quality I usually expect from Netflix\u2019s big series, and it\u2019s disappointing because it\u00a0could\u00a0have been amazing.\n\nIs it just me? Or did anyone else go in with high hopes and come out feeling\u2026 meh?",
