For context, I\u2019m on a 1-gig fiber connection, which is usually extremely reliable and rarely gives me any trouble. However, I\u2019ve found myself needing to refresh the stream on my PC several times to keep it running smoothly.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t a major issue for me personally, as refreshing on a computer is fairly quick and easy, I can\u2019t help but think about viewers at home who might be watching the stream on their TVs. For those individuals, I imagine it could be quite inconvenient to have to interrupt their viewing experience, potentially get up, and troubleshoot or restart the stream multiple times.\n\nI wanted to bring this up not only to see if others are encountering similar problems but also in case this might be an issue worth investigating further on the technical side. If there\u2019s a broader issue, it might be worth addressing sooner rather than later to ensure a seamless viewing experience for everyone.\n\nLooking forward to hearing if anyone else has noticed this or has insights to share.\n\nThanks!",

Most of the fights between Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul were them hugging each other. I barely saw any actual punches other than a couple of times. I didn't see anyone get a nose bleed, nothing.  People who were there actually paid around $32,392 for floor seats on Vividseats (according to CBS).. I think they should be refunded their money because they didn't get their moneies worth.\n\nI honestly can't believe that Tyson just made 20 million dollars off of that fight while the other guy gets $40 million. There is something seriously wrong about that. There are Americans busting their asses off having 2+ more jobs struggling to put food on the table to feed their families yet 2 \"boxers\" who mostly spent time time hugging each other inside the ring gets millions of dollars for a short duration fight.",
