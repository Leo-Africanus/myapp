He is a 35+ man who acts like a child and has no growth during the show. I love this show so much but the main character is insufferable!! Did anyone else think this while watching it?",

The writing is really well done and it's an interesting concept built upon the super power genre. The characters are all very interesting and don't feel completely forced like some shows do.\nI can see why the show might not have attracted some people but if Netflix had marketed the show better than maybe it would have done better because I think a lot of people I know would have been interested in it. \n     I'm a big fan of the themes tied to mythology and how ordinary people are altered to become beings with powers and aren't magically born that way. I think the show really did have a lot of potential to keep growing into a really great story if it had continued and it's a shame that it didn't. I'm even a big fan of the three main leads and how their powers are integrated into their daily lives and the burden of how their powers can affect those around them either negatively or positively.",

        "content": "Hey! I am looking for some help or good suggestions.\n\nWatching Netflix (1080p plan) with an Android TV box (Onn box from Walmart, Android 12) and a 4k LG OLED.\n\nThe issue I have is that most of the movies and series (like 80% of them) are cropped/ zoomed in/stretched. This is so annoying.\n\nTake a look at the attached video to see the issue in action.\n\nFor example I start the movie 'Inception'. All good. I leave Inception and start 'Snowpiercer'. Nothing to see but colors and subtitle. The whole pictures is weirdly zoomed in/cropped/stretched. The subtitles however are at the right place. As is the overlay, like the series' title etc. I leave that series and just for the fun of it I start 'The Fifth Element'. Another cropping issue/zooming issue to see there. Different though. Next 'Back to the Future'. All good with this movie. I leave that movie and start 'Atlas'. No picture at all, only subtitles to see. Finally 'Valerian'. No issues. Like I said 80% of the movies/series are unwatchable.\n\n\n\nWhat I tried: \n\nReset the box\n\nUpdate the box\n\nTried another monitor\n\nTried another cable\n\nTried Disney app: No issues\n\nTried Amazon Prime app: No issues\n\nTried Apple TV app: No issues\n\nTried different versions of Netflix all the way back to version 6.x or 7.x. Doesn't help.\n\n\n\nThis is a Netflix app issue. What the heck? My guess is that this ridiculous Netflix app is getting confused with some aspect ratio and never resets/adjusts itself to the 'right' ratio. What the heck? How can Netflix not be able to code a proper app?\n\n\n\nI guess a fix has to be done by Netflix. So my question is: What would be the best way to report this issue? Tried to go through their 'chat'. I realized that their chat is not the way to a solution. ;)",

        "content": "Netflix was my first streaming subscription. I started streaming it on my phone. Now all of a sudden every time I try to use Netflix on my phone it tells me that my phone is not part of this account. I'm beyond dealing with crap like this and so if anybody has a quick fix for me great otherwise I'm going to have to just unsubscribe because I can't do all this and I'm subscribing for a lot of things because of the way the world is going and the fact that I probably won't have an income in a few months. That said, I do like to have a few nice things you know and turns out that in my life Netflix used to be one of those. I got to get off Prime though because I can't keep subscribing to Amazon and paying people who are just bleeding us dry for no apparent reason whatsoever. Anyway if anybody can help that would be great. Thank you",
