The whole \"boohoo he was bullied at school\" part? literally wtf was that about please \nThe part in ep 3 where it's fake Alberto basically crying in a room and his sob story is playing in the background\ud83d\ude2d \n\nSecondly, his sentence?!! like are we actually so for real?? less than 8 years for the brutal assault and rape of the **4** girls they considered genuine, CP?!?, the what I can only assume was terabytes of footage from his parties, the texts?? I fully cannot comprehend how this man only got this tiny little sentence \n\nAnd finally on the documentary in general, I really don't think the camera footage (that may or may not have been real because there were a lot of disclaimers) added anything to the documentary at all tbh\n\nThe entire doc was a TRIP I can tell you that for sure and this case and the lack of justice the victims received and continue to *not* receive is absolutely abhorrent, nevermind the unknown number of girls he's done this to that weren't included in the case. This man should literally never be allowed in public again \ud83d\ude2d",

Guillermo del Toro once again has proven he\u2019s the best director for the dark fantasy genre of our generation. Highly recommend this film. Loved the acting of Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz and Jacob Elordi. excellent casting as well. I can see this even getting some Oscar nominations. 5/5 for me. ",

        "content": "My main 3 streaming services are HBO, Hulu and Netflix(and YouTube premium, but that's a whole different beast), but I've used others before. I'm not talking about the content on these services or how any company manages their original content, etc. This is specifically about the UI and user experience\n\nWhen I boot up Netflix, it's always snappy, it's always easy to find what shows I've been watching and continue, the app lets me go to a series page BEFORE loading an episode, it's the best about knowing I want to restart a movie/show when the progress bar is near the end, the \"are you still watching?\" prompt is actually consistent. Nearly all of this stuff is either worse or non-existent on the other streaming services I use. Hulu makes me jump through hoops to get to a series page. HBO Max will throw up huge show banner ads I have to scroll through before I can start looking at my library\n\nMaybe there's other streaming services that compete with Netflix more in this regard, but it's something that's really been bothering me lately. If I'm bored and don't know what to watch, I'll boot up Netflix 95% of the time because browsing it feels good compared to my other options.\n\nDoes anyone else here share this opinion? I've tried googling it, but all the Reddit posts are complaining about what shows are available or just complaining about streaming in general",

        "content": "So I'm now watching GLOW and am well into Season Two.  Just before creating this particular post, I searched to see if there was already a GLOW discussion, and I saw some from discussions from...over 7 years ago??  Is it possible the series is that old?  And if so, maybe it means that Netflix periodically re-releases or puts certain shows (like GLOW) back in the queue for re-watching?  I say this because...I'd never heard of this show until recently, and likely it's because when I signed into Netflix one day...a few months ago...that GLOW appeared at the top of my feed, and so I naturally assumed it was new.\n\nAnyway, for those not familiar, while a show about female wrestling sounds tacky, they've really done a great job with the show...the cast (particularly the female leads, as well as Marc Maron - who is fantastic in his role) is great.  The show is clever...well-executed.\n\nFor those who've already seen the show, I'm curious if, like me, you had assumed that Season 2, Episode 7 was going to be the series finale?  (That was the episode that included a...er...broken ankle - I don't want to give too much away ...any spoilers.... )  Considering that episode, and the way that episode closed out, I actually think it would have been a perfect way to end the series.  So imagine my surprise when I saw 'Next Episode' loading up on my screen.\n\nEither way, if you've not yet watched GLOW, I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso....Hot Spot (with Japanese subtitles) and Pernille (Norwegian subtitles).",

It is probably too late now to collect all of the amazing talent that made this happen, but I wish so much they would, or a different production company would.  Do you all think that is at all possible at this point?  One year out?  So often it takes series to become successful after 1 - 2 years into it\u2026 such an incredible shame to not have faith in this series, we need it now more than ever.\n\nI guess I just wish I understood the industry more than I do.  In my ignorant mind, I would think an old school, heavy clout, heavily connected actor like Jeff Goldblum, or any of the other high tier actors on the show, could call up Amblin Entertainment and the like and get it produced somewhere else if Netflix insisted on canceling it.
