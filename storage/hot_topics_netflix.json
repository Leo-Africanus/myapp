Mainly, people are saying it's not really believable that there wouldn't be a digital copy, therefore kiki would be able to present evidence of infidelity.\n\nIf there was a digital photo, the meta data would likely have a time stamp showing it happened BEFORE the gala ever started.  That would mean Peter couldn't even claim that he ended the relationship informally, if not officially, prior to that photo being taken.\n\nI think the only possible explanation here is that Kiki is not tech savvy, as evidenced by the fact that she was trying to get into Peters various devices and was unsuccessful. Only after Simone disclosed that he does not lock his personal phone was she able to gain access.  But that feels kinda weak.\n\nSo is there a better reason why Peter would be so confident that the photo Jose destroyed is the only copy in existence? Is this just an unresolved plot hole? Or is it more along the lines of the chocolate box, (where even Peter admits he made a rookie mistake), and he's actually miscalculated?",

        "content": "Day 1 watcher here! My dad and I have always loved watching shows as a kid together. We watched all the Star Wars shows and movies, marvel movies and shows, stranger things, and a bunch of Netflix/Paramount shows. Sweet Tooth was probably the only show that him and I watched each season on day 1. We were so hooked on S1 that we kept watching on every launch day. Now we weren\u2019t able to find time to watch the last season but the past 2 days we watched a bunch of episodes and I\u2019m going to say this. The ending made me cry. I have never cried for a show before but it just made me feel different about my whole life ahead of me (I\u2019m 15 currently). I just thought that how Gus expressed on how all things have an ending in a beautiful way was so touching and inspirational. I\u2019m not going to spoil it for people who haven\u2019t watched but I\u2019ll give an actor review. I HATED Dr. Singh and Mrs. Zhang. The actors did very well on making me hate them which is actually a great thing as they acted amazing. The guy that Becky killed in the beast also made me pissed off. Overall I loved Sweet Tooth and I suggest you watch it if you haven\u2019t. Best show I\u2019ve watched in a long time.",

And when i watch something with her, i can only watch like a quarter of the catalog because subs aren't offered.\n\nAnd the language settings on the website is a scam. It literally doesn't do anything. Not only does it not add the languages you select, which i know, licensing, but it also doesn't remove any of the languages you have unselected. If a movie or show can show you ALL the audio and sub options, it sure does and you can scroll every time.\n\nI know it's not entirely netflixes fault but they should be the ones pushing for change. What am i gonna do? Write to whatever companies make the subs in one country and beg them to think of the immigrants? Not that i could even find that information for my country, i checked. But presumably Netflix can pay to have access to them and if that's the case they should either pay for ti or offer a reduced price to people affected. I mean not at the very least, not having the local language of your location like it's the case with anime here, should be seen as unacceptable.\n\nI honestly cant imagine why companies would even care? especially for languages like portuguese (pt), which is what my girlfriend would need. You're only fucking over your people by restricting it. No one was gonna use those dubs except your citizens living abroad.",

        "content": "What the hell Netflix, you cancelled one of the most fun shows ever. Alright, this is no \"White Lotus\" or \"Severance\" or whatever, and the best part is...it never tries to be. This is one of those cheesy, over-the-top, brainless action shows that is sexy, funny and addictive. It's a throwback to shows I watched as a kid, Airwolf, Miami Vice, Knight Rider...the 80s baby. And c'mon, it's better than the shitty movies Netflix puts out like Red Notice, Old Guard, Extraction and those 100 generic Ryan Reynolds movies. The cast is hot, doing hot things, while saving U.S. from a nuclear detonation. What's more American than that? The storyline is cliche, but still decent, Russians are bad (of course), but rather than pitting them against another foreign power, there are rogue U.S. ex-military operatives vying for the bomb. There are some genuine twists (don't expect Sixth Sense/Fight Club level twists), that I found good. There are a lot of zingers in the dialogue, c'mon references to Rambo and Mission Impossible (\"fuck, we've been Ghost Protocol-ed\" had me lmao). There were even some deep philosophical shit, like the Gremlin representing Paul's inner demons, fantastic.  Characters, Ava, McKnight, Trunky, Tech Chick, Haggerty, Paul, Gomez were all likeable af, and the cast really delivered. Does help that everyone is hot, yes even Tech Chick. I didn't want any of them to die (which is unusual, there is normally always that 1 person). And Gremlin, voiced by B-99's Jason Mantzoukas, epic. Some people say this show was too raunchy, but nothing a generation that grew up watching American Pie and Hangover would find shocking. And the action was a blast, there are car chases, car crashes, helicopter chases, guns, physical fights, knife fights hell yeah. So imo, this show has a lot of gas left in the tank, they can make 1 season every couple of years (ala Witcher) set in different locations and different \"missions\". Then I found out it was canned....wtf. I really think the reception of the show would have turned out very differently if:\n\n1. Change the fucking title to something easier to remember. I found this show when I accidentally pressed \"O\" in the search bar. And it took me a while to remember the name.\n2. Have a token A-lister in the cast. Shows like Hangover and Bullet Train would've been duds if it wasn't for Bradley Cooper or Brad Pitt - just sayin'. It's not fair to the cast because they were great, it's just Hollywood economics.\n\nSo...when S2?",
