The first movie was such a unique blend of action, sci-fi, and emotional depth, and I've been waiting for a sequel. The idea of immortal warriors navigating the modern world with such a compelling backstory really hooked me.\nFor those who loved the original, what are your thoughts on the sequel coming so soon? What are you most excited to see? New powers? Deeper dives into their pasts? More epic fight sequences?\nIf you haven't seen the first one, seriously, give it a watch! It's fantastic.\nCan't wait to hear your takes!\n\nu/killwish_\n",

Every scene felt like a TED Talk no one asked for \u2014 dripping with self-righteousness, emotional manipulation, and smug therapist energy.\n\nShe didn\u2019t help Simone out of love. She helped so she could own it. So she could parade around as the long-suffering savior. That wasn\u2019t compassion. That was martyrdom weaponized.\n\nThe way she guilt-tripped, overstepped, and then had the audacity to call Simone \u201ctoxic\u201d? Nah. She was the emotional vampire of the show \u2014 draining everyone with her need to be seen as \u201cthe good one.\u201d And when Simone stopped giving her the validation she fed on, she suddenly flip-flopped from hating Michaela to loving her? Girl. That was jealousy, not healing.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t handle not being the center of Simone\u2019s emotional world. So she punished her. Classic narcissist behavior in a wellness cape.\n\nEven when she had a point, she was so smug about it that I found myself rooting against her just on principle. And that cruise? Please. She stayed behind with their dad just so she could get gold stars for suffering. It wasn\u2019t selfless \u2014 it was performative.\n\nJustice for Simone. And prayers up for anyone who\u2019s had to survive a Devon in real life.",

It is rare that I stop endlessly trying to find something good and binge a show like I did here. 2 days, binged Kaos. I was so damn invested. Canceled. Guess I will go back to watching 20 minutes and clicking off of all the garbage they seem to love spending money on. They fumbled the Witcher real hard as well. I hope to hell they don't snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with One Piece too. I do not have high hopes for netflix in the long term with such blind idiots pulling the strings.

        "content": "NO SPOILERS PLEASE I only watched season but from the first episode, I was drawn  Seyyazis' kindness and warmth (which continued throughout the entire season). He's handsome, and his face reminds me of someone I met in my past (but I can't figure out who). I am a Bi woman, so I was also attracted to Beliz.  I thought she was incredibly beautiful, and kind, but also she is incredibly smart and level headed. TBH, I also see a lot of myself her personality wise. She is a gentle person, but like me posesses a quiet confidence, that sadly gets overlooked because of the louder more messy characters.  ",
