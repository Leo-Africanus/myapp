He was also very educated when it came to law stuff, so every time they wanted to have a protection order against him and things like that, he ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS found a way to flip it on them, to the point where a couple of them would lose their own apartment to him!! Eventually he met his match and a girl had him sent to jail a couple times, his fucking brother bailed him out each time and I never knew why! Next thing you know, he kills his brother !! I think he had some sort of grudge or anger towards his brother, I\u2019m not sure what it is I just know that his older brother became more successful then him. But he gets locked up for his murder, then fucking kills hangs him self before he really even got sentenced in 2017. He put these people through wayyyy too much to to sit there and cop out on life, he was evil as fuck . I usually don\u2019t care too much when people kill themselves while waiting for their sentencing the way he did, but he was the lastttttt person to sit and have the opportunity to cop out on life the way he did. He was a smart psycho",

Everyone have their flaws &amp; pros but friends are people who just don\u2019t care about your pros and flaws but only about your happiness. \n\nI loved the show for its quirkiness, rawness of being a human, being old, depiction of love that is unconditional, personalities such as grace &amp; brianna, i personally relate with them.\n\nGood show!

And comedically of course, it\u2019s almost all entirely female character driven shows and movies that she sees compared to what I see. But even then, those same shows are not portrayed anywhere on mine.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like on my laptop I get the same 20-30 movies no matter how I try to divide up the genre search.\n\nDoes this sound like a browser setting due to maybe privacy settings as if my region isn\u2019t fixed?  I\u2019ve even gone so far to wonder if this is potentially a network thing and it just doesnt want to load more options.\n\nEdit: just went to check what shows up on my phone app and it\u2019s almost the same type of thing. *Many* shows and movies show up there that aren\u2019t on my laptop browser options.",

These are not very educational at all. I agree there are some nature-based documentaries. But give us more historic based documentaries or documentaries based on space, physics, foreign cultures or some other exciting topics. Other annoying thing is that they all follow same template where for most part of the documentary an 'expert' will be looking into the camera (The office style) and talking. Like they have so much budget, they could definitely use some b-roll or something during narration. Documentaries on national geographic or BBC are way more engaging. Honestly some of the YouTube channels make better content than Netflix (like Ruhi Cenet or Explore with us). \n\n  \nEnd of rant ",
