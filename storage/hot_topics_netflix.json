        "content": "\u2022 Season One\u2019s cliffhanger had no barring on the plot. Luke and the team\u2019s information was sold to dangerous criminals and terrorists. I would\u2019ve expected the main villain or secondary antagonist to be one of those criminals or terrorists. Instead we get a completely different villain. Plus the cliffhanger barely added much tension to the overall narrative.\n\n\u2022 Carter and Donnie added nothing to the story. The show should\u2019ve found some way to make them relevant to the plot or useful to any of the missions. Instead they just sat at the side and spewed out random unfunny humour. Also, they did nothing with the subplot of Carter and Emma still having feelings for each other. Plus i was a little upset to how insensitive the show was to Donnie being dumped by Talia and her carelessly sleeping with Luke knowing Donnie is in ear shot. The only interesting thing they did was that altercation with the biker gang which only served to have them shipped out of the story as quickly as possible.\n\n\u2022 The cliffhanger was resolved so quickly and lazily. It probably should\u2019ve still effected the team into Season Three but we get this anticlimactic conclusion where Greta uses her new fortune to assassinate all the criminals who bought Luke\u2019s information.\n\n\u2022 Season Two\u2019s cliffhanger had little tension compared to its predecessor or relevance to the leads. We find out Tina secretly steered away her Russian superiors from Barry and now he has to rescue her cause the Russians know she turned. This hardly effects Luke cause he fully retired. I have no doubt they\u2019ll shoehorn him into this plot but odds are it would\u2019ve been forced. \n",
