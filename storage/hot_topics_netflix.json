The Social Dilemma scratched the surface because I feel it's much scarier real life. (that thing about what google knows about you is actually terrifying).

Also i mainly don\u2019t watch teen shows anymore but sometimes i\u2019d check something out from Netflix. Those who\u2019ve seen this show, is it good enough to spend your time on watching or is it really like that other teen show from Amazon Prime ? So far the only reason i\u2019ve been planning to check it out is because one of the main actresses was in Suits and i loved her in there. But other than that I don\u2019t want to watch it if it\u2019s just some cheesy drama with teen romance. ",

New supernatural element kept things interesting, too.\n\nVisually, it\u2019s still got that dark and moody look. Though I must say, certain scenes stand out because of little pops of color.\n\nI enjoyed it. It didn\u2019t feel like it dragged. Enough mystery to keep ppl guessing, but not confusing. That ending left me with questions though, so I\u2019m curious what everyone else thinks about where they might take it next.",

This happens EVERY time. I have no other playback issues with any other streaming service JUST Netflix. \n\nIt works fine on my phone, just not my tv. (It's Hisense Roku tv if it makes a difference. And when signing up I did put \"tv\" as my primary source(?) for watching the app)\n\nWhen visiting my brother last month he still had my profile on his main account &amp; I used it to watch some movies &amp; his Netflix worked just fine.\n\nAny ideas as to why this happens?

Nothing.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely nothing is working to get it to play on my PC and I cannot figure out why. I'm at my wit's end with it since I've been trying on and off to fix it for a week now, and every other search I come across either tells me how to fix Error Code 1003 instead of 1290, or even how to fix it for Linux or Vivaldi users.

In the first 7 minutes it seemed so promised, but as it kept going it was clear they don't give a f\\*\\*k about the extinction of Earth when it comes to directing. 95% of this is about 2 human left on here are talking about unnecessary nonsense, making a love/emotion interest to each other tho it's not what it should have been told about but exploring the Earth, investigate for more possible survived human while they searching for more evidence which supports their research to date in the hope that there is a way to save the Earth. So sad it turned out otherwise. I gave it 3 stars on IMDB due to the concept only, but the execution is more than awful.\n\nLet me know if there's more movies like this so I can avoid it.",

        "content": "I was scrolling on tiktok and I thought, \u201cYou know what makes TikTok so much fun, is seeing people\u2019s comments and the funny pictures.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be genius if streaming platforms like Netflix had comments on movies/tv shows? I\u2019ll see clips of Squid Game on TikTok and the comments make it so funny and enjoyable. They could also be useful for people to discuss what they are watching, as if you are thinking about watching something but don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth your time, you could just look at the comments. Maybe even timed comments would be great, people could discuss certain scenes while they happen. I\u2019m going to start a steaming service that has a comment section now. I\u2019ll see you guys when it goes out of business\ud83e\udee1",
