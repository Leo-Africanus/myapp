I\u2019ve noticed this pattern for a while now, and I\u2019m genuinely curious if others feel the same way. Netflix has some great concepts and plots\u2014things that should, on paper, make for compelling shows or movies. But somehow, they often manage to stretch the story so much that it becomes boring, even frustrating to watch.Netflix shows are so slow paced.",

        "content": "To be honest, that's where I'm at. And this doesn't just apply to Netflix, but Amazon and other streaming services as well. I'm tired of them pumping out series like candy, some of which in my opinion are really good, only for them to eventually get cancelled often times after just one or two seasons.\n\nIt's annoying. It's a disservice to subscribers. And frankly, I've been reading books of any series I find online now instead anyways because I've been so conditioned to just assume anything I like will eventually get cancelled anyways. \n\nAnd honestly? The books have been offering me a much better experience overall. I feel better, even if I spend all day reading a book or two, than I would've had I spent it binging a show. I also have the added confidence knowing that I'll be able to finish the series without getting pissed off after wasting so much time watching it only to find out it's cancelled later.\n\nSo yeah... books for the win! Depending on how into books I go I may honestly just get rid of my Netflix subscription altogether.",

I don\u2019t think it builds suspense like Netflix thinks, it\u2019s actually just annoying \ud83d\ude02 ",

The language was changed to German today which is what alerted me, but it has probably been going on for a while because I saw that someone has accessed the account from Germany, Greece and Ghana, in the past days/weeks (I normally don't pay attention to these notification emails because it's usually just my siblings).\n\nI used my Netflix profile to watch a show this morning and everything seemed normal, but since then, the profile names have all been changed and the language and suggestions are completely different. This confuses me: how can the algorithm have changed completely in just half a day?\n\nAnyways, I logged into the account, changed the password, logged off from all devices. I enabled PIN verification for all profiles and verified email and phone number. What more can I do to ensure that these people can no longer access our account? Or should we delete the account altogether for safety and create another one with a different email adress?\n\n  \nThank you for your help! Any advice is appreciated.",

        "content": "In an Indian version of Squid Game, the show should definitely introduce many characters of different language groups and religions because India is really diverse with many different languages and religions. Some players can be North, South, East, West and Central Indian. I think it would be interesting if a Northeast Indian character is also in the story. Northeast Indians are Indians with East Asian features because most of them have Chinese ancestry. It would be interesting to see characters from different regions because the show can reveal how diverse India is. They should definitely show some Indian characters who are Hindi, Tamilian, Punjabi and Bengali even Indians with different religions like Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and maybe more Indians with other different religions. They could also show Indians with different skin tones like Indians with light, medium and dark skin tone even they could show some Indians with different ancestry. They can show some Indians with Persian and European ancestry. Some Indians with Portuguese and French ancestry like introduce some characters from Goa and Puducherry. They could introduce a character who is a Singaporean of Indian descent even they could also introduce an American, British or a Canadian of Indian descent. I think introducing a character who is a Malaysian or an Indonesian of Indian descent would also be cool idea. It would be interesting if they introduce a character who is an African university student because India is known to have several African students and they even talk about how they struggle with their lives in India due to their appearance. It would also be interesting if they introduce a Mauritian, Pakistani, Nepali, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Afghan and a Bhutanese character. They could also introduce VIPs of different nationalities like American, Russian, Chinese, Brazilian, South African and Arab (UAE). The mysterious island where the games are held can be located somewhere near and a bit far away from North Sentinel Island.",

If so, what are your thoughts/ favorite episodes? I watched Hoop Schemes (basketball) Gold War (figure skating) and Need for Weed (racing) so far.",
