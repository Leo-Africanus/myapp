She\u2019s the only reason I watched until the end. I hope she gets an Emmy nomination for having to make something out of a Nonsensical script. ",

Although medyo kinabahan ako sa S3 kasi hinaluan nila ng original plot para sa Joker Card which is barely na mention o konti Lang ang details sa manga version. But gladly na manage nila na maayos. \n\nSome characters are great. May mga characters Lang nakakainis lalo na sa S3. Muntik na ako ma disappoint kay usagi sa huli \ud83d\ude06. The best thing is Arisu did a big character development. \n\nThe only plot hole Lang sa akin is pano naka access si Banda sa real world. At di na pinakita kung Ano nangyari kay Yaba sa huli. \n\nOverall rating (s1-3): 9/10",

Since yesterday I cannot find Breaking Bad on the list of available series on the website. Everything was going smooth and fine so far until yesterday. When I was trying to launch BB from a history I got an UI3003 indicating that the product is not available in my country.\n\n\n\n I looked up on the internet and some of the troubleshooting steps involved clearing the browser's history and cache however this didn't work. I launched the Netflix app on my mobile phone with the same issue however when I turned my wi-fi off and switch to mobile data (set to Czech Republic) it reappeared. Does anybody know what may be the reason of this sudden regional exclusion?\n\n  \nThank you.",

(Think Jordan Peele, but with more maple syrup and self-deprecation.)\n\nLet\u2019s be clear from the start. This is not\u00a0***Wayward Pines****.*\u00a0No Shyamalan twists. No forest conspiracy cults. Instead,\u00a0***Wayward***\u00a0feels like what would happen if Ari Aster, yes,\u00a0***Hereditary***\u00a0Ari Aster, was handed a stack of Judy Blume novels and told to make them deeply upsetting. The setting is the suspiciously quaint Tall Pines, a town where everyone knows everyone, and everyone waves, and everyone would probably lend you sugar, before locking you in a basement and asking you to recite scripture backwards. Think Stars Hollow, if Stars Hollow had a headmaster played by Toni Collette and zero coffee shops...",

I imagine even if he fell into a trash can or something from that height, he\u2019d still probably die. I also realize that narratively, his death had to happen and was always going to happen. But Season 2 could follow Jake finding out Vince is alive in another country trying to protect him by faking his death and maybe they make a plea deal with the FBI to catch Mancuso. Wouldn\u2019t make the most sense, but I just love Law and Bateman\u2019s brotherly chemistry and want more of it!",
