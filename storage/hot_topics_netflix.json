Jamie being interviewed by the therapist was something I've never seen before. You can feel the rage and anger the boy is holding inside of himself. The acting was just perfect.\n\nThe final episode blew me away. When Jamie called and said that he's gonna plea guilty I just stopped breathing. The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much. Made me think about my own kids and the world they're living. ",

Either a cop did it or some rich guys with kinks pay them to look the other way\n \nIt's definitely more than one killer in the area. I wouldn't go from burlap sacks to dismemberment to just random dumpings... Rex isn't the only killer. \n\nI thought the documentary would answer big questions like, who are the other victims? Who is the baby? Who was the male? Nope...\n\nAnd if I hear the journalist says she's shocked again... \n\n ",
