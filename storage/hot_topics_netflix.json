If the monster wants to die and Victor wants to kill the monster why didn't the monster let Victor try to kill him? (Through surgery or any other means).",

        "content": "So I saw online a lot of people bashing fate and saying it doesnt compare to winx and how it's not even similar, but the literal show isnt even called winx its called \"Fate\" a winx saga, which i heard people complaining about the name being misinterpreted and how it's a complete different show than what winx club is. Anyway, my views on the show are netrual to good but I think with better writing the potential is very high for succession. When I first watched it, I had watched winx clube a few years prior and while it was alright it had things that I didnt like same as with the Fate saga. But when I first watched fate a few years ago I was very excited to hear about a second season, I do agree with the fact that some of the characters are bad and the storyline could be improved aswell and how the removed flora and replaced her just to bring her back, like wtf. But overall when I went into watching the show I had very little remembrance of the winx club and when watching fate saga I didnt have anything to compare it to, so my raw feedback is that its an entertaining show and the little spin on making it gory and adding more modern stuff really makes the show lore or less watchable. I dont really think nits underrated its just over HATED, plus winx club went to crap after they turned into those believer fairies or whatever and compared to that fate the winx saga is good.",
