        "title": "I did the math regarding the Tyson v Paul lawsuit",
        "content": "So this guy is suing because of the poor streaming quality during the fight. I decided to calculate how much money a subscriber would realistically be entitled to if they win the suit.\n\nA month has 43,800 minutes. The whole 5 hour event totals to 306 minutes. 306 is 0.7% of 43,800, so subs experienced poor streaming quality for 0.7% of the time they're paying for per month. We just find 0.7% of each sub tier to determine how much you're owed;\n\n$7.99: 0.05593, or $0.06\n\n$17.99: 0.12593, or $0.13\n\n$24.99: 0.17493, or $0.17\n\nHow how much money would you get back and what will you do with it? Like, subscribe and leave a comment down below /s\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;Isn\u2019t some also retained by the law firm?\n\n\\-u/dethsesh \n\nFirst of all, fuck you, so jot that down\u00a0\n\nAccording to[ this article,](https://www.txattorneys.com/faqs/what-percentage-do-class-action-lawyers-take/) law firms would get \"25% to 35% of the total settlement amount awarded to the class of plaintiffs.\" We can go with the middle and say 30%, which I'm thinking would be taken out of each individual payout.\n\nSo, if subscribers were to be paid for the amount of service time lost during the fist minus the average fee for a law firm, they'd get:\n\n* $7.99: 0.016779, or $0.02\n* $17.99: 0.037779, or $0.04\n* $24.99: 0.052479, or $0.05\n\nConsiderably worse, lawyers truly are the bane of the average Netflix subscriber's existences.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit is for $50 million. What we can do is subtract 30% to get $35 mil. According to[ this article,](https://www.demandsage.com/netflix-subscribers/) Netflix had a total of 301.6 million active users. 40 million of those were on the ad-free tier and has (to my chagrin) no data on the other two tiers. We can say there are 261.6 million users between the other two tiers and split it in half to get an estimate (damn you, Netflix), which is about 130.8 million apiece. So, the three tiers make up an estimated *x*% of the total user base:\n\n* $7.99: 13.2625995%, or 13%\n* $17.99: 43.3687003%, or 43%\n* $24.99: 43.3687003%, or 43%\n\nI know the rounded values don't add up to 100%, let's just say the lawyers took the rest as part of their fee.\n\nI'm lost here, not sure what to do with this information. I think I need how much money everyone paid, which is *x* (cost) times *y* (number of users) to get *z* (amount each demographic spent).\n\n* $7.99 x 40 million = 319600000, or $319.6 mil\n* $17.99 x 130.8 million = 2.353092 billion, or $2.4 bil\n* $24.99 x 130.8 million = 3.268692 billion, or $3.3 bil\n\nThen, we want *a* (amount paid for the fight). The amount each tier spent to watch the fight is:\n\n* $7.99: 0.7% of $319.6 mil is $223.72 mil\n* $17.99: 0.7% of $2.4 bil is $16.8 mil\n* $24.99: 0.7% of $3.3 bil is $23.1 mil\n\nI added the total amount spent and determined that the tiers are entitled to *a*% of the $35 mil.\n\n* $7.99: 84.92% of $35 million is 29.72200 million, or $29.7 million\n* $17.99: 6.378% of $35 million is 2.2323 million, or $2.2 million\n* $24.99: 8.769% of $35 million is 3.06915 million, or $3.1 million\n\nSo clearly, you're not getting what you're entitled back. Divide $b (total entitled amount per tier) by *y*(the number of users) to get the realistic amount a subscriber would receive.\n\n* $7.99: $29.7 million divided by 40 million is 0.7425, or $0.74\n* $17.99: $2.2 million divided by 130.8 million is 0.01681957186, or $0.02\n* $24.99: $3.1 million divided by 130.8 million is 0.0237003058, or $0.02\n\nI've probably made a fool of myself somewhere along the line with an obvious oversight, but I've run out of steam.

A \"misery loves company\" mentality? Devon spent her life trying to protect and support Simone. Why is she now, all of a sudden, trying to bring her down? Simone was totally justified in not wanting to do a damn thing for her dad. Did Devon feel it was more about helping her than the dad and it was finally time for Simone to start paying her back for all she did for her?\n\nJose!! I thought he was the most mysterious/interesting character! At the end, when he called Simone \"my love\" (I think that was the term)...so creepy and so telling. If anyone was  being \"cultishly\" controlled, it was him!\n\nThe girl in jail. What did she represent?\n\nI really need to watch it again knowing what I know now.

But the show makes it out like no one was around for Simone after, but where was Devon? She didn't go straight to college at 12 years of age.. she would of been like 18 when she went to college right? (I am not from the US, so I don't know the exact age most kids go to college) Which means Simone would have been 13 when Devon left. So why was Simone the one that was neglected, and put into foster care but not Devon!?!? Unless I misheard the ages they said they were when their mum died it doesn't make sense!?

        "content": "This is going to sound like a dumb question but I feel like when I'm watching something on Netflix the video is kinda zoomed in compared to clips of those scenes online. I'm suspecting that it has to do with my plan being on 1080p while those clips come from other people are watching them on 4k. Is this correct? If not, does anyone know why it's zoomed in?",

Generally I like most genres, but specifically enjoy British crime shows/mystery, true story events, a little bit of sci fi (Severance and The OA are as far into that genre I go). A list of the shows I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019m looking more of is below - some of these might not be Netflix I\u2019m not sure. \n\nEdit edit: I started watching Dept Q last night. So far it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. I\u2019ve made a list of other shows to watch as well. Thank you all for your suggestions. \n\n- Broadchurch\n- Unbelievable \n- Unorthodox \n- Queens Gambit\n- Maid\n- Bodyguard\n- Baby Reindeer\n- The Fall\n- Gracepoint \n- Toxic Town\n- Mare of Eastown\n- The Missing \n- Adolescence \n\nEdit to add a show:\n- Bad Sisters (not Netflix show - but I highly recommend)\n- Sirens\n- Residence ",
