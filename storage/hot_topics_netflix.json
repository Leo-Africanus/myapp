I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Like... that\u2019s the concern? Not what the kids went through? And those scenes where the kids are sending messages to Pipper? \u201cIf she ever watch this\u201d they looked super uncomfortable. You can totally tell it was staged. \n\nIt\u2019s just upsetting how lightly the documentary touches on the real impact of putting kids in the spotlight like that and building a whole image around them.

Don West.   \n  \nOk I feel this might be self explanatory, but come on I mean at first I thought he was the annoying, selfish, mechanic in space. Then now he\u2019s my favorite character! My favorite episodes showing this are S2 E10 where Will, Penny and Judy have to board the Jupiter . Knowing Don he probably wasn\u2019t into goodbyes but he showed up for this one cause he didn\u2019t owe any of them money ended hugging penny before she left that\u2019s my favorite scene of the whole show, and I think\u2026 S2 E6 is it where Don saves Penny, Vijay, Dr. Smith and Mr. Jackson from freezing in space \u201cHey, kiddo you alright?\u201d Melted my heart.   \n\n\n2. Dr. Smith \n\nAnother I feel is self explanatory. I wanted her to die for 2 seasons and then I wanted her to thrive! She might\u2019ve been the evil, con artist who stole identities and killed people, but she get better all she really wanted was a fresh start and yes to get that she did have to poison her sister but anyway\u2026I feel if the series continued she would become the weird aunt to the kids.\n\n  \n3. Ben Adler\n\nYasss! He was good all along if you rewatch the series! Like yeees!\n\n  \nWhat do y\u2019all think?\n\n",

I couldn't really relate to any of the characters but with the humour and the chemistry between the cast/characters it didn't really matter.

It was about a serial killer who had effectively retired and a cop who had been hunting the serial killer for some time (possibly retired also). The serial killer was somewhat of a local legend, I believe inspired by Gary Ridgeway (The Green River Killer). I believe the serial killer and the cop are neighbours.\n\nMost of the show involved general family drama and such, while our serial killer, let's call him \"Bob\" struggles to control his \"urges\" after being \"retired\" for some time. \n\nEventually, he gives in, and \"Bob\" commits further murders (I think). The first season ends when the cop, having been hunting \"Bob\" for decades, suddenly concludes that our guy, \"Bob\", his neighbour, is indeed the guy he's been looking for for some time. \n\nIn the final scene, our detective guy whispers in the serial killer's ear, \"I know\" or something like that. Which is basically where the finale ends.  \n\nI'm hoping there was a second conclusive season that I can watch. If not, I would love to watch that first season again. Thanks in advance!",

However, when watching the series, I did notice Justin adjusting the clock several times throughout his interviews. Does anyone have any information about this could possibly mean and if anyone else noticed any other clues hidden in the show? ",

        "title": "Just watched adolescence few days ago. Anyone up for discussion?",
        "content": "I have also watched mind hunter, and comming from there, Adolescence was far less disturbing for me to watch atleast. I think directors did a really good job on making the psychological horror more accessible to general public.\n\nThe boy fking nailed it in third episode. Those bursts of uncontrollable anger, and how slowly his true personality was exfoliating, it was crazy good.\n\nNow here are some opinions I had.\n\nFirst: most online discussion seems distorted because how relavent the topic is today, and a lot of people came in and out without having an open mind. Don't get me wrong, there were depths and nuances which were discussed, but, I think people saw it more like a commentary than a psychological horror. I felt  it was both, but a lot of people viewed it only through lens of commentary.\n\nSecond: the motivation of murder, and this will help me explain my first point further. I read a lot of people calling it unrealistic, and I put some thought into this question, if the portrayal of murder was realistic or not.\n\nJamie was 13. I know he acted way more mature than his age, but dude, 13 is so young! While mind hunter showed how childhood trauma and past shapes a murderer, this is a literal childhood mistake we are talking about.  At that age child likely doesn't realise weight of murder. And this was also reflected upon in the last minutes of third episode, where Jamie was constantly denying of doing anything wrong, he likely didn't grasp the weight of his own actions even by then. He kept saying 'even though I should have' he didn't realise what taking someone's life actually meant. \n\nThird, his father. Even here I saw so many people blaming the father, while he himself said he tried his best. Yes he was flawed, but jamie's actions, in my opinion, was largely his own doing, or more like, doing of whatever he was consuming online. Yes his father had bursts of anger, but internal philosophy of father and son were just so different. His father never justified violence, like Jamie did. His father wasn't controlling in his anger, just aggresive, while Jamie was trying to be controlling with his bursts of anger. \n\nEven friendships, Jamie mostly acknowledged his father's male friends, while his father was clearly shown in 4th episode to interact well with both men and women. His entire lens of worldview had shifted so hard he started seeing his father for things he wasn't, even though how minor.\n\nAdolescence, to me, seemed to be a product of malleability of young minds, and how under right 'or extremely wrong' conditions they can be moulded in worst possible way. How social media, at such young age can so drastically shift someone's internal moral compass, and how due to lack of communication, between parents and child, there was no one to correct him(yeah his father did try his best, but come on, there were still plenty things he did wrong, even his mother).\n\nMost of us are mature enough to ignore toxic content, or at maximum feel disgusted by it, but there are literal children who are also watching it. Children who can't distinguish between right and wrong like we can. The series did a fantastic job at highlighting how vulnerable children are to online content.\n\nThat was my opinion.",
