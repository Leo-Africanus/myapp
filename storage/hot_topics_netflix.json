But the truth is she posted a EBITDA profit of around \u00a32m pounds, but still an operating loss of -\u00a32.9m. This year, she\u2019s had to extend loans of \u00a36.3m to keep it afloat. It\u2019s not successful and hasn\u2019t been, and if you can\u2019t make a company generate a return in 17 years, after that much investment, it\u2019s not going to magically start making a return. And for that \u00a370 million investment to have meant anything, it needs to be able to generate more than that at some point, not just pay it back. Like who in god\u2019s name pumps that much cash into something year after year, as an escalating commitment to failure, and then gets a documentary made about what a big success it is. I\u2019m baffled! I own some of her eyeliners, and now I know David Beckham has partially subsidised them!",

The dynamic between Grace (the President) and Kate (the Ambassador) is fantastic.\n\nThe pacing\u2019s great too. It moves fast but knows when to slow down, like that scene where Kate helps Grace in the bathroom with her shirt. I also love how the show lets the audience in on what\u2019s really happening, even when the truth isn\u2019t said outright... like during the visit with Margaret Roylin.\n\nAnd it\u2019s funny! A political thriller with perfectly timed humor is exactly the escape I needed today.\n",

So a while ago I decided to watch Better call Saul, hence being in the BB universe and shares producers and som of the actors and, here\u2019s my take. It doesn\u2019t have any plot. Is it just me that feels this way. I\u2019m on S1:E7 already but I don\u2019t have any clue what the plot or storyline is, other than random events. BB had one of the strongest scrips in the history of series but \u201cSaul\u201d doesn\u2019t have anything near that. \n\nNow, I do love the actors, production design and the same atmospheric mood and that\u2019s great. Breaking bad probably would be great even without the characters that \u201cSaul\u201d has, but not the other way around. \nTo do a spin off I think the plot has to be at least as good, or even stronger/better to justify its existence. \nWhat would \u201cSaul\u201d be if there were no Breaking bad in the first place?\nFor me, as an avid BB fan I just don\u2019t get YBCS at all. Am I the only one feeling this or am I on my own?",

I know they probably were following the way the books were published (I didn't know it was based off a book) but still, they had Teresa as the love interest when it should have been Brenda, Gally was nice to have but still was a bit out of touch, and then newt dies, terrible, would recommend only to watch the first one and then no more, it's definitely not worth it",

My boyfriend used to live in Brazil, so he was excited to see the landscape, the countryside, city, and hear Portuguese. He could even decipher per accent which locale the actors were from. \n\nThe movie was labeled as \u201cheartwarming\u201d and it certainly started it that way. It was cute and lively, we laughed quite a bit thinking about the mannerisms of our own dog. \n\nHowever shortly into the movie, we learn that the main character has brain cancer, a theme that truly carries the movie. I\u2019ll just say that the final 20 minutes of this movie were really hard to watch and we ended up completely shutting it off at the last 5 minutes. Our dog is 17 years old and I purposefully stay away from any movies where a dog passes away. We have also both lost parents to cancer and have witnessed the horrible effects of chemo and have witnessed their deaths. \n\nCarmelo needs the following themes to warn of triggers:\n\nGrief\nIllness\nDeath\nAnimal death\n\nI think this day and age with all the attention to mental health, this was careless of Netflix to not screen for these important themes before streaming to millions of people. \n",

But last night, it says that it wasn\u2019t part of my household network (yea, cuz I am out of town). \n\nI reached out to the customer service and they said I can just update my household and it will give me 2 weeks while my family at home won\u2019t be affected. I did what he instructed and my partner just called me saying that our netflix is not working at home.\n\nI reached out again and the agent said that I can only log in to tvs on the same network at a time and I should only watch through other media like phone or tablets while I am traveling. Then what\u2019s the point of paying for multiple devices when I can\u2019t even watch comfortably when I am traveling?? Aren\u2019t their slogan watch anything from anywhere?\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to bypass it?\n\nThank you!",

        "content": "**ENDING SPOILERS D:** plz watch it before continuing!!!\n\nI rewatched Creeped Out after a few years, and now just finished watching s1 ep9 \"A Boy called Red\" and in the end, Vincent's aunt gives him a wink and it got me thinking; Did she know Vincent was Red the entire time and that he changed the past? Instead of falling into the well where the ball of light (the portal) was, he teleported back to the future (his timeline) by touching the portal while it was in the garden?\n\n(She told Vincent his dad changed after he saw his childhood friend called Red fall into the well and disappeared forever. She also witnessed it too.)\n\nLike, did she know? Did she know that originally, Red fell into the well, but then decided to change the future by not doing it? Hinting the wink in the ending scene? Or at least she was somehow aware Vincent (Red) changed the future? And also, how did they not notice that Vincent looked exactly like his dads childhood friend? (...they don't know he time travelled and was the same person.) Cuz there's gotta be more than just her believing there was something weird with the house, right?\n\nOr am I just overthinking it over a PG-rated series?\n\nTL;DR I'm wondering if Vincent\u2019s aunt knew he was actually Red and that he changed the past. The wink at the end got me thinking that if she aware of the altered timeline and that Vincent was Red?\n\nIt's all speculations and theories, I wanna hear what you guys think! Gimme your opinions :P",
