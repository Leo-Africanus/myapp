I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

She wasn\u2019t trying to be perfect, and I didn\u2019t find her annoying like a lot of people did. I honestly don\u2019t get why they felt that way. I always thought she was pretty smart, especially since she was a writer and all.\n\nWhen we found out she was catfishing Joe, I won\u2019t lie, I thought that was a little out of place at first. But once it became clear that she actually cared about him, I started liking her again. What bothered me though was how she seemed to lose herself along the way. She started off strong but kind of got lost in the middle, which was a little disappointing.\n\nThat said, I still thought she was the kind of character who kept you curious, like you wanted to know more about her. She knew how to flirt, knew what to say in the right moments. Her dynamic with Joe, especially in the beginning when they first started getting closer, was really intriguing to me. I just wanted to see more of them together. Maybe that\u2019s just me, though.",

I wondered if Steve Carrell already said he wouldn't film any more seasons so they killed him off. What a turn! But I guess his character was a bit messy, an older man leaving his wife for a younger model, and Anne also confirmed in the show that he cheated on her. I didn't feel as though the cheating confirmation was taken seriously enough, and was swept under the rug by the group and not really acknowledged. Just me? \n\nIt was nice to see Steve brought some Michael Scott humour vibes to Nick, if you know you know!\n\nFinally, my favourite was Domingo Coleman, I thought he was so sassy and funny, my favourite little scene was when they were all taking a photo with Ginny, and the photos would sync to Anne's iPad so he told everyone to pose like they aren't having a good time. And he's the only one doing it! \n\nFinally, a shout out to Anne for dealing with so much and trying to not let her hurt feelings turn to hatred towards Ginny and also reminding her and Nicks daughter that Ginny was a person.\n\nSo will they make a new season?\n\n ",

But honestly, I think it should\u2019ve ended with him either getting away and going somewhere else, kinda like an open ending, or just dying. Him going to prison didn\u2019t really make sense to me. But whatever, I can let that go.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t ignore though is how Kate and Bronte survived so unrealistically. There was just no way Kate could\u2019ve made it. She was shot, hit in the head with a hammer, and left in a fire. And we never saw anyone getting out of the fire while Joe was proposing to Bronte. So how would she have survived all the smoke, all that damage? It just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAnd Bronte too. Like yeah, Joe was probably panicking and all, but he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s killed plenty of people. He knows what dead looks like. There\u2019s no way he saw her there, shot in the stomach, underwater for that long, and thought she was dead when she actually wasn\u2019t. That just didn\u2019t make any sense. It kinda ruined the ending for me, to be honest.",

        "content": "I just checked what devices are signed into my profile because I got a notice that I'm not the primary household member. I saw a device labeled as \"Amazon Fire Stick\" that signed in a month ago and hasn't been used since. But I do not have an Amazon Fire Stick and I have never shared my account with anyone. Just use it on laptop and phone. Why would someone log into my account and then not use it for a month?",

        "content": "we've had this netflix subscription for many years now, back when it wasn't limited to one household. since they've changed it, the household has been updated to my address (it was my grandmothers before) and i am the only person that uses it. this has happened multiple times but i'll be in the middle of watching something, get through a few episodes, and then get kicked out because \"your tv isn't part of the netflix household for this account.\" this happened just now and i'm beyond frustrated because i was on the last episode of a limited netflix series. since my grandma created this account years ago, it's still under her email. unfortunately, my grandma is traveling in another country right now so she's unable to fix it at the moment. is there something we can do to prevent this from happening again, and does anyone know why this is happening? the account is tied to my address so i don't understand why this is happening.",

        "content": "I\u2019m trying to remember the title of a series or movie I watched. I remember that it starts with a young woman walking past a park at night and hearing someone scream \u2014 possibly a murder. She goes to check it out. Later, she becomes a suspect herself (i guess?). She had some kind of sexual relationship with a man who lives nearby, and he might be the killer. I remember that at some point she breaks into his apartment to investigate, but he comes home and she has to hide/escape. He lived in an attic apartment.\n\nMaybe someone knows it \u2013 thanks in advance!",
