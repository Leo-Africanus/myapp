It's been around for a few years.\nLoudermilk is an addiction counselor with a motley crew of devotees that attend his regular meetings in a catholic church.\n\nThe cast are mostly men, and there are some gross moments (doll episode).\n\nAnja Savcic is the only regular woman casted. They manage her presence nicely without being overly sexual, which I can appreciate. \n\nThe show also mingles comedy with hard topics such as living with disabilities, misogyny, and failure really well. \n\nI've rewatched it several times, especially when winding down at night or if there's nothing else to watch (skipping the doll episode). \n\nAnyone else find this show oddly comforting?

Not even the gorgeous soundtrack the series boasts and brilliant editing could save the two from being borderline unwatchable.\n\nI hope the Way brothers direct more episodes in the future because they are some of the most talented and exciting filmmakers at the moment.  \n\nJust a personal opinion of course",

Good for him \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut one thing kinda confused me\u2026 why was the whole staff so happy and even playing music when Simone got fired? I mean yeah, she was a little intense and definitely had that boss energy, but I didn\u2019t really catch her being straight-up rude to everyone. Did I miss something? Or was it more subtle? Just felt like there was something I wasn\u2019t picking up on.\n\nAlso, Devon. Man. It felt like she was kinda in love with being miserable? Like her sister chose a life of comfort and happiness, and Devon just could not wrap her head around it. It\u2019s like she couldn\u2019t grasp that maybe not everyone wants to be in the struggle all the time lol.\n\nAnyway, would love to hear what y\u2019all thought. Did I just miss some major cues?",

The cat episode and the alien episode made me appreciate 3 robots and The Drowned Giant so much more. Night of the Mini Dead is fun and hilarious but Close Encounters in season 4 feels like fanfic. \nCompare How Zeke got Religion to The Secret War, or Shape Shifters to Spider Rose or The Screaming Tyrannosaur. \n\nAm I the only one who feels that Netflix exploits the popularity of a show all the way to oblivion?

This is despite the fact that my system and display support much higher quality \u2014 I\u2019m using a **1600p OLED** panel with a **240Hz refresh rate** and **Dolby Vision** support.\n\nJust so you know, my system has an **RTX 4070** GPU and an **Intel Core Ultra 9 185H** processor, and I\u2019m on the **Netflix Premium plan** that supports **Ultra HD playback**.\n\nInterestingly, on **Google Chrome**, the bitrate can reach up to **18,000 kbps** (18 Mbps) and **4K resolution**, even though Chrome itself is capped at 1080p in some cases. Still, the quality and bitrate are noticeably better on Chrome.\n\nHowever, I prefer using Microsoft Edge because **Chrome doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision**, and I\u2019d like to take advantage of that feature while still getting the best possible bitrate and resolution.\n\nCould you help me figure out why Edge is limiting the quality and how I can unlock higher bitrate and resolution when streaming?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

I\u2019ve heard a ton of praise about it over the years, and finally decided to see what the hype is about. So far, it\u2019s definitely got me intrigued.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve watched the whole thing \u2014 how did you find the overall experience? Does it live up to the reputation it has? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts (but please, no spoilers \u2014 I\u2019m going in fresh!).\n\nThanks!",

Seriously to 75-80, where it's normally 45-50. \n\nNot wanting to suffer through the bad sound mix, I \"found\" an .mkv/mp4 version, and surprisingly it had the same problem. Don't know which is chicken and which is egg, I just wanted to watch a version that sounded good and not like pillows are covering my speakers. ",
