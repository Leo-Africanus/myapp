I love how we saw into Alex and Poppy's friendship so clearly with the how many summers ago flashbacks. At first I genuinely thought Poppy and Alex would never date and due to the title, I thought they would go on vacation and then find their significant others, but I was thankfully wrong. In some of the flashbacks we saw **that** look. You know, the \"I love you\" but can never say look. The film was diverse, sexuality wise, we had Alex's brothers gay wedding, which is expected for a film of this year. I mean quite literally every film I've seen released this year has had that diversity. We had a look into both characters different love preferences. That guy with the boat, I think his name was Buck? Don't quote me on it, and his awful \"momento mori\" tattoo. And Poppy's ex, Trey. Very handsy. Alex had Sarah, highschool sweethearts as Poppy says. I don't know what else to say but, Netflix has had some good originals yet this year and you should definitely watch this one. 10/10.",

A terrible story/plot, with horrible dialogue all around and some pretty awful acting. \n\nThe plot.. some high school girls coerce others into the woods in which they get paid to watch girls get abused? One of the girls changes her name and looks and also becomes an anchorwoman at the same place as the main character? She kills her own sister and turns into some sinister person.. Yawn. Lazy, horrible writing. I can go into much more but it\u2019s truly not worth it. \n\nJon Bernthal is great and gives it his best but even he can\u2019t really escape the again, horrible dialogue and plot. \n\nTessa Thompson is objectively horrible. Prior to this she was fine in other things. Not spectacular, not bad. She also is not given help with an awful plot and dialogue but god she was incredibly bad. So many scenes that were laughable and clearly a set of a show with soap opera type acting. \n\nTessa was not the actress to use in this show and well it shows. Nobody could\u2019ve done the story justice sure but she made it a lot worse. \n\nThe climax.. her mom with \u201cdementia\u201d ends up being the killer.. yawn yawn yawn. That whole final act was such a drag and so lame. So many obvious and dumb red herrings all the way across the series. \n\nI typically won\u2019t comment on something that I think is this bad but I\u2019m seeing so much love that I can\u2019t even wrap my head around. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you enjoyed this series, you are easy to please. ",
