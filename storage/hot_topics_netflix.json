They definitely left us on a cliffhanger, and I\u2019m curious if anyone else thinks Netflix will renew it for another season?\n\nI really hope they do. There\u2019s still so much to explore with the characters, and I\u2019d love to see more of Cam\u2019s journey as a gay man in the Marines. His character development has been one of the most interesting parts of the show. That said, Netflix can be unpredictable when it comes to renewals (I\u2019m still not over Mindhunter, The Society, and 1899 being canceled). Plus, with the Pentagon\u2019s criticism of the show, I worry Netflix might shy away from continuing it.\n\nStill, Boots was genuinely excellent and absolutely deserves a season 2. What do you all think?",

Agree Wayward has \u201cwhiffs\u201d of Midsommar as I saw it put in one post but what irked me the most was the inconsistency in talent/character development and the made-for-TV Hallmark Christmas  special feel that was so pervasive. Toni Collette is one of my fav actors (interesting she also starred in Hereditary, another Ari Aster film). \n\nThis was my introduction to Mae Martin and I fell a little in love with them! I read they not only directed the film but it\u2019s based on both personal experience and a young friendship with someone sent to one of these \u201ctroubled teen\u201d institutions. \n\nI would love to see a film length version as the series format felt watered down. More emphasis on Alex and Evelyn\u2019s past could add more depth. Sydney Topliffe was really good but it didn\u2019t feel like she had much to work with. I found Abbie\u2019s story more interesting than Leila\u2019s and if it were further developed, would have added depth to the character. Or maybe, just more character development in general would have made all of the roles more compelling if fleshed out. \n\nI guess it says something about the story itself that my main complaint is that I wanted more! Just felt thin to me which feels inexcusable for an 8 episode series, each around 45 min duration. \n\nHope not too harsh! I really did enjoy it and this is the first review I\u2019ve ever contributed. Curious about similar (or not!) thoughts.  \n\n ",

        "content": "Perhaps some of you have seen Neill Blomkamp\u2019s brilliant experimental \u201cTV Show\u201d called \u201cOats Studios,\u201d airing in 2021. As I suspected, Oats Studios was real and started in 2017 as a way to put together these 15 min long \u201cpitch-videos\u201d to see if they had actually had something. I watched the episodes the day they premiered on Netflix almost 5 years ago and still, to this day, I cannot stop wondering \u201cwhat could\u2019ve been.\u201d \n\nA perfect example is Ep. 1, starring Sigourney Weaver, titled \u201cRakka.\u201d Immediately, Bloomkamp bludgeons the audience over the head with an appropriately dark introduction to a world overrun by (Bloomkamp-esque) disgusting, sadistic, and barbaric race of alien creatures who can control human\u2019s minds, are (in the intro) turning the Earth\u2019s atmosphere into their home planet. Which is this disgustingly toxic shit - for lack of a better word - through the use of these enormous biospheres that literally poke through the earth\u2019s stratosphere. In one line: we\u2019re fucked. And Bloomkamp portrays all of this so profoundly well, it really makes you wonder if this wasn\u2019t an actual premonition he himself had once, head deep in a night terror because it is just that. Terrifying. \n\nBut, there\u2019s hope. Through human sacrifice, grit, determination, etc., and - what appears to be an omnipotent life-form wholly different from our current oppressors - they\u2019ve come to our rescue, along with the help of a twisted machine of a man who\u2018s vile torture involuntarily transformed him into a precognitive, and potentially their best weapon to use to fight these monsters who\u2019ve all but wiped out our entire species. \n\nAnd BOOM. Roll credits\u2026 huh?? \n\nAn even more intriguing \u201cepisode\u201d imo was \u201cFirebase.\u201d Its Platoon meets Hellraiser. And it hits hard. The pace of 17 min film alone is enough to make you want to fight in a war. A seasoned vet in Vietnam is brought to a reclusive military base and is told a story by a CIA opp. (don\u2019t know the actor\u2019s name but wow, he\u2019s phenomenal as the \u201cstraight\u201d man telling the story) who\u2019s high on the pay grade. \n\nThe story is about a man whose myth has taken on a God-like (Devil-like) identity. In fact his colloquial name is only known as \u201cRiver God.\u201d A normal Vietnamese farmer who\u2019s met with such cruelty that his angst, rage, and hatred literally transforms him into something that only war could actually create. It\u2019s an incredible take on the horrors of war and you start to cheer on the River God in a war due to the atrocities he\u2019s faced in his previous life, brought on by the American troops. \n\nAnyway, \u201cFirebase\u201d has stayed with me forever. So I\u2019m wondering if anybody else has MISSED a show they loved that was canceled (cough cough, The OA), or something like this where you wonder to yourself over and over again, \u201cwhy the hell wouldn\u2019t they bring this to fruition??\u201d\n\nThose are just two of mine. I\u2019d love to hear yours\u2026\n",

        "content": "Absolutely powerful. No narration. Just body cam footage acting as a first person account. Incredibly painful to watch. I cried a lot. \n\nThe anger that they didn\u2019t arrest her. That they said \u201cthank you\u201d after she finally stood up to be taken to be charged. America has a big racism problem and it\u2019s not just Susan Lorincz. \n\nIt\u2019s an indictment on the US justice system that I had predicted she\u2019d get away with it or given just a few years in prison. The absolute RELIEF when she got sent down. I hope she\u2019s miserable for the rest of her days. \n\nWhat a beautiful community. I hope the boys and all the neighbours affected are supported through their pain. ",

Some examples of my favorites\nPineapple express\nPaul\nEuphoria, I think it was(with Sam from transformers)\nAmerican pie\nSo I guess more comedy, but I loveeee me a good action movie too",

        "content": "Me and my husband our long haul team truck drivers, we both stay on our truck for a month at a time and when we go \u201chome\u201d we stay with his parents one month and mine the next. We live in our truck. The update that requires you to be in the  \u201csame household\u201d completely stewed up our Netflix and I suppose we are just cancelling it at this point. We had been getting by without an issue until we took hometime and logged into it at my husbands parents, they have their own Netflix account and don\u2019t use ours but now it\u2019s saying we aren\u2019t in the household when we are in the road.\n\nNetflix making this change is just really not traveler friendly, I understand why they made the change (although I think their corporate greed is disgusting). But it just doesn\u2019t work for anyone who has a nomad lifestyle. It\u2019s just a waste of money.",

They find a game within this old video game room and end up playing it together. Eventually they find out that there is a video game tortument and practiced for it. The group of friends end up winning the tortument. \n\nThe school thought about becoming a video game school. \n\nThe school had it to where you had to earn so many points to stay in school. Every month there was video game tortuments. ",
