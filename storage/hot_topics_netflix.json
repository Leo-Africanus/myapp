She's doing well and will be moving into Assisted Living shortly. She started getting the Netflix Household message when trying to watch Netflix on her iPad. I chatted with support and they sent me the instructions that need to be handled from her Roku at home. The problem is none of my siblings are in the same state at the moment. The support rep said that this is the only way to handle this issue. Period. I find it hard to believe they can't override it. Is there really no other way to resolve this? I see that I can add her on my account now, but that would involve her jumping through hoops on her iPad. She's never been very tech savvy so I don't want to ask her to log out and log into my account.",
