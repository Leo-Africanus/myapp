You can pop them like m&amp;ms.\n\nSo the wrong Paris definitely did it's job, it was all of the above and entertaining and some parts had me dealing with a bout of secondhand embarrassment. (Hello mechanical bull, I'm looking at you and one very icky rider)\n\nI also love movies that poke fun at those reality dating shows like the bachelor, so that was a nice topper. Over all I thought it was pretty good for one of those crappy made for Netflix type movies. I like christmas-y ones so this was a nice change. \n\nMy personal favorite is still love hard though and a Christmas prince. \n\n\nThoughts, did you enjoy? \nI don't want to say anything that might spoil it but it's so predictable that I don't think anything could tell you what you'd already figure out. \n",

        "content": "It was great but like another redditor said, I\u2019ve never wished I could unwatch something. Not like \u201coh haha I wish I could watch this again for the first time\u201d no. I wish I had never watched it.\n\nI\u2019m a 17 year old boy. I feel like an awful person saying this, but I relate to Jamie a lot. I unfortunately saw a lot of myself in Jamie. His outbursts, his overall personality and demeanor, the way he seemed to try to use people and shift the narrative in his favor, etc. I used to be a very aggressive and unpredictable person. I was angry, and even violent. When I would get into a rage, I wanted to hurt people. I\u2019ve done a lot of work on myself, trying my hardest to be better. But watching this brought all of these feelings I thought I had overcome back. Feelings of self doubt. Am I a good person? Could that have been me? I was very manipulative, and I still have tendencies to use people to get what I want, even if not out of malice. It\u2019s made me scared of myself. I always thought \u201cI could never actually hurt someone. Kill someone. I have a conscience, I\u2019m not that bad of a person. I\u2019m not that angry.\u201d But now I don\u2019t know. I still have outbursts from time to time, and that makes me scared of what if one day I go too far? Am I capable of hurting someone in a rage? I take medicines, I see a therapist. I do everything I\u2019m supposed to? \n\nBut should I even be thinking this? Is it concerning that these questions even enter my head? That I have to genuinely think about these things? I would like to say I am a kind, decent person, who has a good moral compass, but what if I\u2019m just kidding myself? What if I\u2019m just pretending? \n\nWhat do you think of my conundrum?\n\n(Ps, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to discuss this, but I figured it was adequate as this has to do with a Netflix series.)",

Somehow it's Jake's responsibility to pay it for him\n2) Vince puts his daughter in harm's way because of the loan and guilt trips Jake \"to think about his niece\" when he didn't give two shits about abandoning his daughter in the first place \n3)  Promises to repay the whole amount not communicating with his brother first about where the money has to be allocated first then gets mad about it\n4)  Agreed to watch the waitress around the predator and she ends up ODing, because he got sidetracked \n5)  Guilts his brother for having money after he worked his ass off at the restaurant. Vince just wants the easy way out everytime like a toxic leech\n\n\nIt's like watching a 50 year old toddler. ",

        "title": "Adolescence (groyper, incel)",
        "content": "Okay, I have a few things to say. So, first of all this was a super weird coincidence that I watched this today because I\u2019ve been learning about the alt-right incel groyper pipeline on TikTok literally all week after the you-know-who assassination because I was totally ignorant to all of that, and I watched Adolescence today literally not knowing AT ALL that\u2019s what it is about. I started watching it because that kid was the youngest to ever when an Emmy, and I was like oh must be good. Well it was good, and it was objectively the best time I could\u2019ve watched it and deeply understood it. I need to lie down. \n\nSecond, media literacy is literally dead methinks. I was on a different subreddit and this girl said she didn\u2019t like how the show propped up the killer and diminished the victim and other female characters, but that was LITERALLY the entire point. It even pointed out that the killers are always remembered and the victims are forgotten. Again, maybe if you\u2019re not super familiar with the alt-right incel groyper stuff which I also wasn\u2019t aware of until this week, I can see where you wouldn\u2019t totally fill in all the gaps, but the entire point was to show this normal kid who you could chalk his actions up to bullying when in reality, even if he was bullied (2 things can be true at once) he clearly displayed woman-hating, aggressive, and isolated tendencies that the girls in his class could recognize via his Instagram posts and behavior. Why would a girl want to hang out with someone like that? She also could see right through his little \u201cclever\u201d scheme of asking her out when she was at her weakest when it wasn\u2019t clever, he just thinks women are stupid and sub-humans that are just a means to a sexual end. To incels, they always look outward, never inward. This was also highlighted by the fact this was clearly a cute, not ugly at all little boy saying \u201cI\u2019m ugly\u201d over and over, so his scapegoat was his looks when that wasn\u2019t the problem at all. A lot of these incels who claim they are unattractive are actually attractive on the outside but behave in such a way that their physical appearance doesn\u2019t matter at all which is really the reason they can\u2019t get girls. It has nothing to do with looks at all, but the online chat forums and the rejection by girls reinforces their untrue ideas.\n\nThird, which pretty much I\u2019ve already covered more or less is that there was no twist which ended up actually being the twist because this is simply reality. It\u2019s these kids who are by all means normal at first but then fall into this echo chamber they can\u2019t get out of because their behavior reinforces their perception, and the parents are not sitting down with them and having important conversations about women and sex and simultaneously letting them stay on the computer all the time. The truth is right in front of us, which in this case is a double truth (1. we can clearly see him committing the crime on camera, so there is no plausible deniability at any point even though we want to believe there will be some big twist. 2. we know why young men are growing violent and discontent i.e. groyper chat rooms and unchecked internet use), but we don\u2019t want to see the truth. We the audience and we society. This was covered in the end with the parents pretty well. Tell me your thoughts. ",

But she entered South Korea ten years ago and has been there ever since) and\u00a0**my theory is**\u00a0that this stella young is non other than our Munji (Jun Ji Hyun).\n\nMy few assumptions are - 1) See how Junik in his last mail with Miller says \"that he believes that he knows who Stella is and is trying to sort it out\" and in the first episode when Munji was getting ready for going to the church she asks Juniks what's wrong and he says to her that we will talk after this and sort out everything but he died that day. I believe that he knows who Munji was and he died because she figured out that he knows her.\n\n2) Munji was raised in America and she came back in Korea around 9-10 years back I guess when she got married to Junik? IDK the exact time but she cam to korea around that time too, backing up my Hypothesis a bit.\n\nAnother Assumption- Munji being pregnant - I believe that bastard child of Juniks is actually of Munji and Junik's (as we can see how she was also pregnant 9 years ago and how that child is also about the same age, but something happened and she lost her child, we are yet to know that) but I believe Junik got to know about Munji being Stella around the time when she was pregnant with his child and he purposely stole their child from her so he can keep him safe from Stella.\n\nI may have comprehended something differently or may have missed few bits and pieces. Maybe I am completely wrong about all of this and maybe I guessed it right, only time will tell! Please tell me your theories or if you can also relate with mentioned theories? LMK\n\nThanks for reading\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igjgqs9r23qf1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96749dec26ac81847b7cb8da21a2914c8287c09d\n\n",

        "content": "Hello, Im looking for any suggestions on what to watch next. I have my \u201csafe shows\u201d I always end up going back to but I want something new and I\u2019m struggling to find something. Most of the shows I watch are fantasy, horror, comedy, and drama. My biggest struggle is something I can watch for a while. For example I\u2019ve watched supernatural (15 seasons) or vampire diaries (8 seasons) but all I can find that looks remotely interesting is only between 1-3 seasons with episodes that are like 20 minutes each. I prefer episodes anywhere from 40min to an hour. \n\nSide note: game of thrones is not really for me. I don\u2019t think I could get past the first season but I might give it another shot. If anyone has any recommendations I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nI also enjoyed shows like bojack, Rick and Morty, and inside job so I\u2019m no stranger to more of the cartoony stuff but a lot of the recent stuff I\u2019ve seen just kind of seems boring or stupid.

        "content": "They could have plenty of talent to get the ball rolling, like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, and probably Seth Meyers and John Stewart and John Oliver soon. They could either run them all consecutively each night with maybe a half hour show, or do an hour each of, say, Colbert and Stewart Mondays and Wednesdays, Meyers and Kimmel on Tuesdays and Thursdays. John Oliver could take the Friday slot since he\u2019s used to one show a week anyway, or just have them all stream every night at the same time and folks could just watch the ones they want at their own leisure. Just a thought. ",
