        "title": "Season 2 of Arcane is visually stunning, but both the worldbuilding and storytelling are disappointing.",
        "content": "\\*Unpopular opinion warning\\*\n\nCurrently Arcane is the second most popular TV series on both Netflix and IMDB, with a dazzling IMDB score of 9/10, and I'm struggling to find negative reviews on mainstream forums - which really surprises me as Season 2 feels quite underwhelming to me.\n\nThe visual design and animation are still absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Some of them are even more breathtaking than the best frames in Season 1, which is an incredible achievement since Season 1 is already one of the most each-frame-a-paint shows I've ever watched.\n\nHowever, the disparity between the stunning art and the unconvincing worldbuilding, combined with the poor storytelling (especially in respect of Season 2) is equally staggering.\n\nBelow I'd like to elaborate (in a spoiler-free manner) on the major shortcomings preventing me from enjoying the show, despite its incredible visual achievement:\n\n**1. Mediocre worldbuilding**\n\nArcane's world is a mixture of steampunk and magic. However, the rules governing how this world operates - i.e., when magic comes into play and when normal physics prevail - are extremely unclear. The audience struggles to deduce, based on previous events in the show, whether a character will be severely harmed by an explosion or remain completely unscathed.\n\nAlso, the show fails to adequately depict the scale and operations of the various organizations and political entities that significantly impact the plot. The scheming and conflicts between these groups often feel either meaningless or ludicrous because the audience lacks a reliable way to determine each group's advantages, disadvantages, or the true extent of their capabilities.\n\nThis lack of clear underlying rules often obscures the stakes, making the plot or action scenes far less engaging. The audience cannot confidently assess whether legitimate danger or consequences are at hand, which renders character's survival, death or other development undeserved or unearned.\n\nIf this show were intended solely for a younger audience, then a somewhat disorganized fantacy world might be less of an issue. But it's apparent that the show takes itself very seriously, with ambitions to tackle adult themes and nuanced topics. From an adult's perspective, the most critical aspect of convincing worldbuilding is the presence of clear \"stake\", which must be grounded in a set of explicit or implied rules. Without consistent rules, all the consequences and developments become dubious and unengaging.\n\n**2. Horrendous storytelling**\n\nThere are far too many artificial dramas and tensions. Characters frequently argue with one aother for various nonsensical reasons, refusing to listen to even a single word of explanation from their counterparts. Their communication skills are unrealistically underdeveloped, making any tensions derived from such poor communication initially laughable, but later tiring and infuriating.\n\nIf these dramas were merely filler, they might be more tolerable. Unfortunately, these conflicts - whether infuratingly juvenile or jaw-droppingly asinine - often have a significant impact and major consequences on the plot, making any subsequent story and character developments stemming from these events unconvincing and eye-roll-inducing.\n\nAlso, its quite obvious that the director often priortizes creating visually stunning scenes over crafting a plausible story. Many incredibly well-drawn frames are the direct result of unbelievably foolish decisions or physically impossible manuveur. I frequently find myself quesitoning the integrity of Arcane's story and characters, wondering whether such developments make any sense or if they are simply director's attempt to create yet another wallpaper-worth piece of art.\n\n\\---\n\nWithout spoilers, the overall scale of the major conflict escalates significantly in the later episodes, particularly in the second half of Season 2. Sadly, even at the grand finale of Season 2, I found myself completely unable to care about any of the characters' fate. The issue is that, whenever I try to care, I immediately start questioning all the nonsensical decisions these characters have made to reach the current plot point. Eventually I just stopped caring altogether. Without engaging with the story, those beautiful frames feel meaningless and at times even exhausting.\n\nOverall, my score for this season is 5/10, a far cry from the general sentiment currently shared by most viewers, it seems. I would only recommend this show to those who love League of Legend's universe and are genuinely interested in exploring its lore further, or to those who can be entertained by a show solely for its visual design. The writing of Season 2 should be taught as a cautionary lesson in storytelling classes.",

        "content": "My two siblings who live at home are paying for their Netflix together. They have the version with ads which is like $7?\n\nI asked my brother if I could pay them some money and watch a tv show on the tv when I come home for winter break. He said I'd have to pay $7 and probably more to add a profile? Does it cost money to add a profile? Then I said I could just use one of theirs and he said I couldn't watch it when they're watching it then and I was kinda like ok? Bc I doubt all three of us will watch Netflix at the same time. So idk... help? What would be the best and most cost effective way to share Netflix with two siblings?",

        "title": "Netflix defaults to dub...",
        "content": "How do I set original audio with subtitles to be automatic on netflix? Whenever I have set a show to be in original audio with english subtitles in the past, it always automatically had the subsequent episodes of the show with the same setting. I never had to change it, and other shows would even have the same setting. I have rarely had to touch the language settings after that. \nRecently, I began watching a new show and found that it would be dubbed automatically no matter how many times I change it. The next episode plays and it's back to dub. Is there something that I can do to ensure that the sub will be the default option on every show? I watch all shows in all languages with subtitles as I have trouble understanding just audio, even in languages that I speak, and it's quite annoying if this is something I'm going to have to constantly do for every episode. Any tips or if anyone knows if this is a new thing netflix does? Thanks!",

        "content": "Dorothea Puente: Antisocal Personality - She fits the profile more than any other, especially with the many marriages and different names - her biography also mentioned suicidal behaviour, so she could have had Borderline traits too.\n\nK.C. Joy: Possible Borderline Personality, but I find it more likely that he has Avoidant Personality and was pushed to the end of his rope by socioeconomic status. His temper is something we might attribute to Intermittent Explosive Disorder, making it a complicated stress response, but he is otherwise quite enigmatic without more background info.\n\nYoussef Khater: Narcissistic Personality. It seems clear that most of his crimes were committed in order to uphold his superiority, and he had one hell of a victim complex. He may have antisocial traits, but it\u2019s hard to be sure without more background information.\n\nJamison Bachman: Narcissistic Personality, and possible C-PTSD after having witnessed the murder of his friend. It was a very sad case to me all around.\n\nJanie Lynn Ridd: Avoidant Personality - the only thing that seems amiss about her was the apparent delusion that she was the rightful mother of Ryder, however this may be a manifestation of pathological envy in Avoidant Personality\n\nScott Pettigrew: Paranoid Personality - in my opinion, he could have qualified for the insanity defence if it had been considered. Most likely, Anita also had some dementia because of her gullibility leading up to the murder.\n\nTammy Fritz: Antisocial Personality - without a doubt, Tammy Fritz is the only one on this list to meet the designation of psychopath in the forensics world. Unlikely that her accomplices were ill - just chronic substance abuse.\n\nMichael Dudley: Schizotypal Personality - everything he did seemed to come from paranoid ideation, and he also could have stood a good chance of using the insanity defence if he had tried.\n\nBenjamin Foster: Borderline Personality - possibly the worst case of it I\u2019ve ever seen in a documentary, and because of the things I\u2019ve seen myself in group DBT, it makes me feel sad.\n\nJerry Ramrattan: Narcissistic Personality - again, his primary concern was for his image. His three accomplices were just regular people swayed by money.\n\nRosa Hill and Mei Li: Narcissistic Personality - some may argue that Rosa managed to manipulate Mei into being her accomplice, but I\u2019d argue that Mei had passed those traits on to Rosa and that Mei herself didn\u2019t put people off as much because she had more time to learn how to mask her symptoms.\n\nKevin Lewis: Borderline and Narcissistic Personality, given especially by his vindictiveness and overconfidence. Jerradon Phelps may not be mentally ill at all, but Alexis Hale does undoubtedly have Antisocial and Histrionic Personality, the latter of which led to them being caught.\n\nLet me know what you think. Thanks for reading! ~Sincerely, the hyperfixated autistic forensic psychology student",
