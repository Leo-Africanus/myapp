        "content": "I know Meghan Markle gets a lot of hate, but honestly, I actually liked her show. It feels like people dismiss it because of who she is, rather than judging it fairly. If you actually watch it with an open mind, it\u2019s enjoyable in its own right. As someone who watches lots of lifestyle/ cooking shows, she actually uses lots of good cooking/ home making techniques. She has a warm, calming presence that makes it easy to watch. The cinematography, the food, the storytelling\u2014it\u2019s well-produced and enjoyable. I mean she is exploring something she loves \u2013 She clearly enjoys what she\u2019s doing, and I respect that.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014of course, she\u2019s not filming in her own house. Security risks aside, most food and lifestyle shows aren\u2019t filmed in the host\u2019s actual home. People are just looking for things to criticize.\n\nShe\u2019s trying her hand at something new, something she clearly loves. Why is that such a crime? Not everything has to be groundbreaking\u2014sometimes, it\u2019s just about making something enjoyable.\n\nIf it\u2019s not your thing, that\u2019s totally fine, but hating for the sake of hating is just unnecessary. Anyone else actually like the show?",

        "title": "I wish Sweet Magnolias ended with season 3 because 4 is just terrible",
        "content": "I wish Sweet Magnolias had ended on season 3 because season 4 was incredibly disappointing.\n\n I posted this in sweetmagnoliaNetflix and was declined because the mod said that I was too mean because I was honest that I highly disliked season 4. Granted they said I wasn't mean to anyone (and honestly I wasn't even mean) they just took offense that I didn't say lovely things and didn't like the season, I guess. Which I absolutely did not.\n\nSo, if you still love this show, please just skip ahead because I found season 4 to such a major disappointment with the exception of the fact that Heather Headley, is truly an amazing vocalist. The rest of season 4 though is a dumpster fire. I can't seem to get the spoiler text block out to work so I'm going to do a whole bunch of spaces to make sure that nobody gets inadvertently spoiled and I hope that's okay.\n\nI used to love this show so very much. I looked forward to it more than even Virgin River, and I'm a huge fan of that. I cared deeply about the characters, it was so beautifully filmed and idealized and it just was such a great escape. And tell season 4. I literally had to watch the last two episodes three times because I kept zoning out due to my lack of caring at all. We see more of Cals mom than him and it's annoying. At this point I just hope they don't renew anymore. \n\nSPOILERS BELOW!\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nThat time jump was absolutely stupid and disastrous. Everyone seemed to progress and grow except for Katie who looks exactly the same. And we're supposed to believe that a little kids book demands a book tour? Seriously? All the sudden Maddie and Cal are just engaged and we missed it? And that weird Halloween wedding was just dumb. April and Ty have been in love forever and then he's gone most of the season? And I couldn't care less about Dana Sue and Ronnie's money issues considering they were given a massive amount in an inheritance.\n\nSullivan's isn't Sullivan's anymore without Dana Sue and now she's doing some cooking school which I don't give a flying flip about. I could not care less about Ty being in a band especially since he wanted to do something with his hands and suddenly he's going on tour? Don't even get me started with the idiocy of Ronnie and his motorcycle.\n\nHelen has some government job which no one really knows anything about and just does nothing but detract from the main plot line and I don't even care about her and Eric anymore. When they got engaged I was like meh. This whole show jumped the shark and as far as I'm concerned they should have stopped at season 3. We didn't even get good good payback with Kathy! \n\nAnd even though Bill wasn't the greatest dad ever they did him dirty. He just dies we're left with his narcissistic mother and then he's never mentioned again Other than a Christmas gift to Bexs. The only couple I really like is Noreen and her new man. I know a lot of people don't like her but I do but she didn't have nearly enough screen time. It's just so disappointing. \n\nThe fact that Isaac still hasn't revealed who his mother is is ridiculous and I could not care less about his romance even though I'm all for adding LGBTQ+ romance but I just don't care about these two because they're boring as all get out. I hope with Maddie moving to New York everything just ends. Everything that I used to love about this show is been destroyed in one season. And I'm good if they don't renew it. Even if it gets renewed, I'm not going to watch it.\n\nHopefully the moderators here have less of a hard on for the show and can handle a independent and truth of you for how I see this show. If you loved it though head on over to Sweet Magnolia Netflix subreddit.I'm sure they'd love to post your review.",

I will say the show was not the greatest thing in the world but it was good enough and had SO much potential. The problem with it was they went overboard with side plots, almost every character was the star of their own show within the show and it was getting gratuitous. \n\nShafe\u2019s addiction story wrapped and then he was in limbo. Carmichael they gave way too much agency to and it was not necessary, Emma\u2019s dad and their whole thing went on far too long with he and that wheelchair guy, but it at least had something to do with the Manson Family.  And the Walt situation I think could\u2019ve been worked into the Manson plot and that would\u2019ve been compelling, but we don\u2019t know their vision. They didn\u2019t have a fair shot or didn\u2019t take advantage of the time they had, but to just cancel on that cliffhanger was criminal. \n\nThis is why I hate network television . ",
