Hell I even was on board when they added Psycho as a sort of meta analysis he had on popular culture to add some filler to an otherwise short story. Then it kept going and going and going. It ends with a parody of Mindhunter, Richard Speck's man tits, and Gein catching Ted Bundy, Gein dying, seeing his mother in heaven, what felt like 95 ending scenes later some kids desecrate his grave and are chased off by the movie monsters he inspired, then finally ends on a flashback with his mom again.   More endings than The Return of The King. Absolute trash. ",
