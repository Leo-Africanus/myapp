Those of you, if had watched, Please confirm this{And sorry to rely on reddit for this (and believe you me I am not googling this trivia)}, I have a strong belief the lead is in Pirates of the Caribbean!",

Similar to Amazon\u2019s X-Ray, but instead of showing cast details, it provides backstory snippets or explanations for cryptic or subtle scenes.\n\nFor example, during a rewatch of shows like Dark, The OA, or Black Mirror, key moments could trigger contextual insights\u2014like the backstory of a mysterious item, the significance of a subtle gesture, or how a scene foreshadows later events. These would only appear on a second watch, so the first viewing experience remains unspoiled.\n\nThis would make rewatching feel fresh and rewarding, offering fans new layers of depth while encouraging even more buzz around Netflix originals.\n\nWould this feature enhance your rewatch experience?",
