Nowadays, people are a lot more conscious of not appearing rude, especially in public, and are generally a lot more accepting of people who look different. Let\u2019s say Jacob Elordi\u2019s creature went walking down the street in somewhere like Town Square. As long as he was dressed relatively normally and had his hair grown out, most people would probably assume he had gigantism and some scars from a really bad plastic surgeon.\n\n",

It felt like a juxtaposition of God speaking with man. The arguments, the rejection, and the final acceptance without humiliation reflect the entire lifespan of the relationship between God and humankind.\n\nIt all ends, fittingly, with Nietzsche\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cGod is dead.\u201d\n",
