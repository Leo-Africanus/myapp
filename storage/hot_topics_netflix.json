I don\u2019t need every single thing I hover over for 2 seconds to start playing a preview (I literally mute my tv now when searching for a show). Now Prime does this shit too and it\u2019s just so annoying and unnecessary. If I want to watch a trailer, I\u2019ll watch a trailer. The recent update is even worse, and basically you\u2019re only able to see a few options at a time. I miss the days where I can see dozens of options at once on the screen, without auto previews. \n\nIf anybody knows a way to use Netflix in a \u201cclassic mode\u201d or something, I will love you forever.

        "content": "Here\u2019s my beef with Hightown. It\u2019s an amazing series\u2014messy, dramatic, nonstop entertainment\u2014but that ending? Come on. Starz really did fans dirty. They canceled it, apparently because they couldn\u2019t afford it, even though the show brought in huge viewership numbers. Make it make sense. So many unresolved storylines, it felt like they just walked off set mid-scene. I genuinely hope now that Netflix has picked it up, a 4th season is in the works. It deserves one. We deserve one. I\u2019m honestly kind of mad about it.\n\nNow maybe this is a dumb question, but it\u2019s been bugging me: why did the show seem more focused on who killed Jorge  than on Frankie himself\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, was a full-blown murderer? He\u2019s out of prison again and somehow they still couldn\u2019t charge him with anything? That was beyond frustrating. I get that the writers probably wanted to push Ray to kill him in the end, but still\u2014it felt like everyone was just shrugging off Frankie\u2019s entire rap sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a great show, but man, that ending left me with more questions than closure.",

        "title": "The Residence could had been much better!!",
        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging.   \n  \nEdit: Surprised it got Emmy nomination.",

This one started out strong, the first 30-45 minutes were pretty good, and happy is still a really funny character, but then it completely fell off. For some reason they decided to bring back every single side character from the original and redo every single joke and gag. Some parts of it feel like a remake and I really didn\u2019t like how they kept playing clips from the original. On top of that the villains and the ending were really stupid. I\u2019d probably rate this movie a 5/10, but that\u2019s just my opinion I guess.",

But today, we're both experiencing the weirdest thing. I tried to create a session, but the link is noticeably shorter than usual and doesn't include the show title in it. I thought that would be fine, but when she opened the link, it just played on its own and refuses to sync. Then she tried to create the session, but the same thing happened to her too.\n\nIt's so weird because it shows in the chat log whenever one of us joins or pauses/plays and whatnot, but it's playing two separate instances. If I play, it's still paused for her, and vice versa. It's refusing to sync, and this has never happened before until today. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a possible fix, or maybe it'll just randomly fix itself after a time? Thanks.",

But maybe Rumi can finish her mom's work and figure out how all demons can have a chance at getting their souls back and being free. It would be cool for a sequel to do that kind of \"moral circle expansion\" where people realize that some demons should have a chance too.

        "content": "I think I understand most of Sirens, but one thing I don't understand is whether it means anything that Bruce thinks he knows Kiki.  Is he just projecting onto her?  Is it his dementia and it means nothing more than that?  I thought it was going to add up to something complicated but now that I finished it I'm unsure it meant much.",

        "title": "Shedding some light on the ending of Too Much (Period Era context)",
        "content": "I\u2019m seeing a lot of people confused and disappointed about the ending of Too Much \u2014 \n\nThe ending was a play off of Sense &amp; Sensibility by Jane Austen. It\u2019s supposed to be the kitschy American dream of a quintessential British experience. In the beginning of the show, you see them watching Sense &amp; Sensibility before she leaves for England. She expects to live on a British estate and have a very \u201cBritish\u201d experience. \n\nThe ending is supposed to feel sort of rushed and nonsensical in an inside joke sort of way. Because if you love period era books and film adaptations, it\u2019s sort of an inside joke that EVERY story has to end with the main character getting married. (It\u2019s even a joke in 2019\u2019s Little Women.) \n\nSo at the very end where they flash to her and Felix dressed in period era costumes (at their wedding), it\u2019s an homage to the ending of Sense &amp; Sensibility where Marianne Dashwood and Colonel Brandon get married. That\u2019s also why he throws the coins into the air. ",

        "content": "Seriously. I watch a lot of foreign language content. So I'll be watching something Korean, say... and there's a commercial. After the ad, the caption is completely out of sync and I have to refresh the page. That alone is super-freaking annoying - but THEN: it boots me back to ANOTHER bunch of freaking ads and will STILL be off with its timing afterwards. I have to time it JUST right for it to work. This is too annoying to be sustainable for me. It's been going on for months at this point. If Netflix can't get its act together, it doesn't deserve my money. ",

After some research I\u2019ve learned that this is Netflix\u2019s way to prevent account sharing.  But I\u2019m not account sharing. I\u2019m using my account at my homes. Is this an oversight or is this a legit money grab to make me pay for two accounts?   ",
