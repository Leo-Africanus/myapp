I've never had an issue with Netflix until this past week. \n\nWhen they added the new lineup, which has the tobery Mcguire version of Spiderman among several other movies and shows, Netflix decided to break itself. \n\nSeveral movies and shows simply do not display video. Or it's video displayed like the broken channels on not-so-legal cable boxes back in the day, you know, rainbow lines, video \"noise\" but not much else. It doesn't happen on every movie or show, but enough of them that it's an annoyance. \n\nAnyone had this happen? Or any suggestions on how to fix it? Netflix is on the Xbox, I've already deleted and reinstalled, I've changed hdmi cable and port, nothing fixes it. Is Netflix just bonked? Seriously considering unsubscribing and going to a different service. ",

I enjoyed the back and forth between the vampire focusing on the telling of the story and the interviewer trying cut out the embellishments and go for the stuff he\u2019s leaving out.  In a way it feels like, yes the vampire wants to look good in his story, but also cares more about HOW it sounds something pretty important for stories that last the rest of time.  Whereas the interviewer focusing on hard hitting facts that are cut and dry is something often focused on tonight news.  Something not know for its longevity.  Like each one wants a story but its style of storytelling reflects their age relatively.  I\u2019m used to Netflix being some quick on and done stuff and it\u2019s nice to see something with a little more art and vision.  Like comparing an album to a mixtape.  Can\u2019t wait for part 2",

Is there any way to remove or block certain categories from showing up? Especially 'games'. \n\nThere's also a whole row of live-streaming wrestling matches that can't be thumbs-downed to dissuade the app from trying to suggest similar content. \n\n(Some of the games advertised also have in-app purchases - !!! - and there's no way to block those from going through on the card on record for payment)\n\nThe wrestling content is at least still tv programming; it's just a genre I'd like be to be able to de-prioritize (it should not be at the top, above my list, above continue watching, nor above the category I actually clicked on). \n\nThe games are a cash grab that don't belong, but I know better than to think Netflix will get rid of anything that scrapes them a bit of profit, so I just need to know how to never see 'games' again via my own paid subscription. Especially not as one of the first rows, before I get to the content that I have actively engaged with. \n\n(and of course it's just crap mobile games expy'd, it's not even like we're being offered to demo Echo the Dolphin )\n\nI'm in the USA getting the games spam via Region 1 but I ASSUME they're hawking this to everyone so I also labeled it 'all'.",

We got three former Marines and one former Special Forces soldier. Are soldiers in Korea more likely than other professions to go into debt or financial crisis? Is that why so many of them joined Russia to fight Ukrainians?\n\nAnd where did all the rebellious contestants learn to shoot guns or learn how to fight? Last I checked, gun ownership is illegal in South Kore? Yet they asked specifically for people who know how to shoot and I was surprised they got a number of extras and that artist to volunteer.\n\nLOL the only ones who have any military training besides the named veterans, are probably the pink soldiers, but they were getting shot left and right from a bunch of civilians and a portrait artist. It doesn't speak well about the quality of the Korean army training that a group of mostly untrained civilians and a fucking portrait artist were slaughtering them. But historically it makes sense since the Korean army is said to be poorly trained which is why they needed US help, and right now the Ukrainians are beating them up too today. It's weird it is like watching the Viet Cong beat a professional military all over again.\n\n  \nWhich also means that it doesn't bode well for Gi-hun's hired guns once they find the island. I think Gi-hun's hired guns are all ex-Korean military? Be looking at the poor performance of the pink soldiers, the hired guns won't do well either in the future rescue mission. He should have hired well-trained soldiers from the US or NATO, or soldiers from countries who defeated the US in the past like Vietnam (I have mad respect for the Viet Cong and the Vietnamese, they are great fighters who fear nobody), or Ukrainian mercs who have experienced slaughtering the Korean military in Russia.",

        "content": "Please. I am not a native english speaker but don't want to watch the dubbed version. I know English well enough to understand everything with subtitles but not well enough to understand ALL of it without. Sure, most of it. But maybe there whispering, maybe there are explosions or other loud sounds (I'm looking at you Nolan), maybe there is just one word I don't know, maybe they are using colloquial language I'm not familiar with, maybe there using names I don't understand. But I don't want to see this annoying closed captioning s\\*\\*\\* because... well it is ANNOYING AS HELL. Besides, maybe some native speaker folks want to watch with normal subtitles as well? I imagine watching while eating chips/crisps for example or watching Nolan movies. Or maybe you don't want to turn up the volume too loud.\n\nAlso, why is there stuff included in the CC which one can see? For example there was someone seen spitting on the floor, why would you add \\[spits\\]??? Dude, I see it! It does not happen often but sometimes.\n\nWouldn't it be easy as hell to offer a subtitle-version without CC? All the text is there already anyway, just search and delete everything in square brackets, it can't be that hard for real.\n\nAre they really thinking there is NO ONE who would like subtitles for the original/production language without CC?",
