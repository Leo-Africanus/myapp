Although they all still become instant celebs after premiere.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

While the dialogue may not be great and the plot can be very clich\u00e9d it also had some great humour especially from William Sabka as Johnny Lawrence. The young cast were also very reliable and it had some great recurring characters especially Paul Walter Hauser as Stingray. The fight scenes were well choreographed and it was nice to see so many of the cast from the older movies return. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spinoff too considering how popular it was.",

        "content": "Everyone has talked extensively about how great the acting was, which it was, and how the camera work is superb, which really elevated the quality of the show but one of the things I'm most interested about are the motives, and how they would be interpreted both from a psychological and legal POV.\n\nNow that I've written this paragraph so that people don't get spoiled, let's get into the bread and butter of my post.\n\nWe are told in two instances that Jamie was a victim of bullying, being accused of being an incel, first directly by Adam and secondly in a more indirect way by Jamie himself.\n\nHere's where I start to get some questions:\n\n1. Was he actually an incel though?  The story doesn't spend long developing the motives and whatnot and most information we get about the murder is either indirect or underdeveloped. \n\n\n2. What would a psychologists evaluate him as, with the information that was acquired in EP3. I'm aware psychologists avoid diagnosis below 18 years old, as the brain isn't fully developed, but we see both some concerning signs, such as him kind of admitting he asked her out as a way to exert power over her (by only asking her out when she was vulnerable/undesirable), but also some mitigating factors such as the fact that, again, he was bullied. It was also concerning how he said \"other boys would touch (SA) her in this situation but I didn't\"\n\nIn general, he seemed like a bright boy that made a very big mistake, one that 99.9% of kids don't even ponder when being upset. Could it be narcissism? He seemed to only care about his image and how people perceived him (asking the psychologist if she liked him, for example, or killing someone for not liking him).\n\nCould he be a psychopath? He seems to be very intelligent and know fully well what he was doing.\n\n3. What charges would he face, and how long would his prison sentence be? Would it be a mitigating factor the fact that he was bullied, if that was proven? Would it make it even worse for him that he followed her and had a knife, potentially indicating that he left home to commit premeditated murder?\n\n4. Why? ",
