        "content": "After a quick search I see this documentary has been talked about quite a bit here, but the one thing I haven\u2019t seen mentioned is the fact the documentary is almost entirely filmed on police body cam.\n\nI personally found this fascinating as someone who enjoys seeing live clips, police interviews, especially when tied into a documentary.  (For me it adds an extra layer of \u201crealness\u201d to the documentary.)\n\nI wonder if we will see more true crime documentaries filmed this way with the advancements of technology and body cam footage etc. I think the documentary was beautiful put together and even with majority of the documentary being on body cam footage, it still told a very clear story.\n\nCurious to know anyone\u2019s thoughts on this? Did you think the body cam footage made things \u201ctoo real\u201d? Invasion of privacy? Would you like to see more true crime documentaries that include police body cam footage etc?\n\nTIA! \ud83d\udc8b",

        "content": "The other night, I started watching Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story on Netflix.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting much-- just another royal drama filled with silks, chandeliers, and scandal.\n\nBut one scene caught me off guard.\n\nLady Danbury sends out an invitation for the first ball of the season. Another Lady-- I forget her name -- becomes visibly agitated that the honour had been \u201csnatched\u201d from her.\n\nIt was such a simple moment, yet it reminded me something.\n\nHere were people surrounded by unimaginable wealth and luxury -- yet burning with the same insecurities and jealousies that haunt us all.\n\nThe King and Queen, for all their power, suffer in their own ways.\n\nThe Lords and Ladies suffer for attention, for prestige, for a sense of being seen.\n\nAnd suddenly, it reminded me-- this isn\u2019t just their story. It\u2019s ours.\n\nWe chase new jobs, new relationships, new milestones, believing each next thing will finally make us happy. But it never really does. It\u2019s the same script, just in modern clothes.\n\nThat night, I remembered something Sadhguru once said: If you have tried every possible way to fulfill yourself, and you have realized that nothing really works, it means you have come to the point: \u2018And now, Yoga.\u2019\n\nIt took me years to understand this. Growing up, I was brainwashed to be in constant pursuit of happiness. But Yoga showed me something different. It turned my gaze inward and revealed that what I was chasing was never missing-- it was just within.\n\n\n\n",

When the episode ends it won\u2019t automatically go to the next episode, it\u2019ll say some error code and when I click on it, it says that error code as well.

        "content": "So thing is I enjoy films that contain modern vibes, involves psychology aspects (like Alice in Borderland for example) that also contains a cool side character (kinda like Chishiya for example in AIB). I just enjoy films that involve \"thinking\", involve planning strategic and stuff like that (for example: Money Heist). A bit of fighting aspects are also additional points too (kinda like Bloodhounds or Weak Hero)\n\n\nI'm looking for people with the same interests and give me some recommendations with films that sorta have the same background since I don't know much films with the same vibes lol.\n\nThank you so much!",
