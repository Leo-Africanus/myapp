        "title": "New interface introduced on Roku yesterday - hands down the WORST of all other streaming services I have",
        "content": "As described in the title, I opened Netflix on Roku yesterday to an announcement of the new UI and how wonderful it would be, etc., etc.\n\nDamn, is it ever bad. Of course, the \"worst\" label is 100% subjective and just one person's opinion. But, for me, it is objectively less usable than before. Its cramped design actually gives me a slight sense of clostrophobia to the point where I actively dislike being in the app. I find it very unwelcoming. \n\nWhen I open Netflix, most of the time I'm not going to in to watch anything in particular. I like browsing and hunting for something that, based on the title and/or image, I think might interest me. I've heard a lot of people complain about the quality on Netflix but there are still quite a few gems that I would often stumble on. The Residence and The Gentlemen are perfect examples of this - shows that I liked that I came across while scrolling through the app and hadn't previously heard of. \n\nThe new interface makes this process much more difficult. It's much easier to visually scan a screen with a lot of items and scroll when necessary. When you see something you might like you can choose to explore further and then look at the details.   \n\nNow, you are hit in the face with details of a single show taking up a large part of the screen that, odds are, you don't care anything about with a handful of other shows around the edges. \n\nGiven my typical use of Netflix, it will now take me much longer to find something than it did before. And given how being in the app makes me feel like I'm in a box, I can see my usage dropping significantly. Cancelation is likely right around the corner. \n\nFirst world problem, I know, but I only have so much money to go around. It doesn't make sense to spend it on something that will likely now sit idle most of the time. \n\nOk, rant over. On with my day. \n\nEDIT: I really am curious to hear from people who do like the new UI and what specifically they find better about it. While it's always fun to vent, I would like to hear others' perspectives just in case I'm missing something. ",

I feel like Netflix should consider renewing these shows again as they were originally renewed but the decision was reverted due to the pandemic.  Would love to know the community\u2019s thoughts about this and if Netflix should revive these shows that were originally renewed for at least 1 more season.  One major flaw about this i can think of is casting back the same casts for these shows because they might have projects currently so filming would be difficult to plan and also different looking casts (with them looking older than what their characters are suppose to be, though Stranger Things managed to make that work).

There seemed to be no proper explanation, no clear backstory, and events kept unfolding without much context or coherence. It felt like things were just happening randomly, without offering the viewer a logical thread to follow. Maybe this film appeals more to those who prefer to experience a story emotionally or visually, rather than trying to analyze and make sense of every plot point. As someone who likes to understand the \"why\" behind characters and events, I struggled to connect with it. While I do appreciate the stunning animation and the magical world Hayao Miyazaki created, the storytelling left me feeling lost and unsatisfied.\n",

        "content": "Just finished it. Started it last night and stayed up longer than I should have, but it's hard to stay so pretty when you don't get any sleep, so had to finish it today.\n\nIt is unfortunately a subtitled movie, unless you speak Mandarin, but an excellent movie nonetheless. I don't think it detracted from the movie at all, maybe even made it a tad better.\n\nIt is set in feudal China, where fights were solved with swords and the gap between upper and lower class was substantial. Tons of action, tough guys, some blood, some love interest stuff, even some interesting period stuff that might possibly be made up. \n\nI guess you'd have to like these types of movies to begin with, but I suspect even MrsBadDog would be down if I were to watch it in front of her. \n\ntldr: great movie, will watch a few times. Is in Mandarin- not a deterrent ",
