It feels like just a way to drive traffic to Netflix with hopes that they will just look for something else to watch via Netflix rather than scouring the internet looking the thing they were originally trying to watch.

She made bank off controversy then and she\u2019s making bank off controversy now. I believe her takeaway from ANTM is that controversy sells. I don\u2019t believe she went into this documentary to reclaim her narrative. She went into it knowing she would create controversy and that the world would continue to buzz over her beloved show and that she would make a shit ton of money because of it. She does not care emotionally for anyone involved. I genuinely think she is proud, she feels smart, and she feels in full control. Tyra rage-baited us and is thriving off our continued buzz about her, her show, and this doc about her and her show. I would so badly love to read her deal memo.",

Could be someone sent back in time, to another universe, into a book, whatever (not into the future tho, I prefer fantasy over scifi). Magic or realism is fine, I'd prefer romance B plot but it's not mandatory/could be the A plot. \n\nWhile I do have Netflix and it's easiest, if you have recs that aren't on there or aren't on there anymore I'm definitely desperate enough to go on a lil hunt!",

Save them. \n\nIt could've even been like Shark Tank where some judges are still hardasses. \n\nInstead, she continued the trauma cycle. It's unbelievable. \n\nAnd she's unapologetic. Honestly, I feel like everyone just blamed it on the times and moved forward. So I know everyone is saying that the J's and Nigel were apologetic but I technically don't see that. Where's the direct \"I'm sorry for literally creating a hostile environment in multiple ways\" from any of them? \n\nLook, don't get me wrong, I like the J's and Nigel more than Tyra and I think that they did a little better than her in this doc, but they are not blameless either. \n\nAnd that dude?

How many rounds were shot into the house and outside yet not one call was ever made from any resident. Yeah, they said the homes in the short cul de sac were all stash houses or cartel owned but that kind of machine gun fire and # of rounds would be heard for blocks. Affleck &amp; Damon are the draw for sure but this was a B-movie compared to Affleck's \"The Town\", which was good but not great",

        "content": "I was binge-watching Animal Kingdom and was on Episode 3 of Season 4. About a minute ago I opened Netflix on my Apple TV, and Animal Kingdom was no longer on my homepage. All the episodes are marked as unwatched, even though I am logged in with my account and using my profile.\n\nIt is also not an issue with my Apple TV, because I see the same problem in the Netflix app on my iPhone. \n\nWhat could have caused this? And why is it still not possible to mark episodes or entire seasons and shows as watched?",

I just wanted to ask whether it\u2019s actually true as you imagine it, and if you\u2019re as excited as I am about what\u2019s going to happen. This idea is something that comes from people on the internet worldwide fans of manga and fans of series like Squid Game, Alice in Borderland, etc. I\u2019m eagerly looking forward to your thoughts.",
