What really struck me was how the show captured the pettiness and cruelty of human nature how people would rather cling to the throne and their power than save actual lives. That layer made the story so much more haunting than just the undead.\n\nAnd the acting? Absolutely top notch. Every performance carried so much weight that I found myself invested in every character\u2019s fate, even the ones I hated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been putting this one off like I did, don\u2019t.

They deftly explore the difficult emotions these characters feel with both humor and genuine honesty. From things like self acceptance (Ben) and fear of dating again (Catherine) to the much more serious undertones of missing a parental figure and wanting to have friends (Ester), and family trauma/relationship dynamics (Nathan and Catherine). The characters feel very truthful, their flaws explored with their good intentions and love for each-other ultimately coming through. \n\nThey touch on these topics while still providing room to develop them, leaving the audience not only excited for more world development but also excited to explore these characters on a deeper level. You can feel the passion from the creators in each episode. \n\nI\u2019m so impressed and excited for this show and really hope Netflix invests in it properly. If they do it could absolutely be a classic! I certainly already have it on my rewatch roster and this season alone is one I know will be watched over and over again :) \n\nThank you to everyone who created and worked on this show for giving us such a gem!

        "title": "Black Rabbit is not good.",
        "content": "I miss the old days streaming. There was a time when Netflix was THE place to be for creative filmmakers  and experimental ideas. Now it seems like every new show that comes out is a remake of the last hit show. Netflix has become YouTube. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the latest Jason Bateman Netflix vehicle. Like Ozark, Jason Bateman directed a few episodes of Black Rabbit and even Laura Linney came back to helm an episode. The new series mostly looks great even if the Dolby Vision presentation is too dark at times. The writing however is abysmal. The writer Zach Baylin, wrote Will Smith\u2019s Oscar winner King Richard and The Crow. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the story of two brothers. Jude Law\u2019s character Jake operates a popular NYC restaurant while Jason Bateman portrays Vince, an addict that has a penchant for trouble. Vince is barely scraping by in Reno, NV when things take a horrible turn. Desperate, he calls his brother Jake for help and he secures a ticket to New York. We soon find out this is a habit for the brothers. Things take a turn for the worse when it\u2019s revealed that Vince has an outstanding debt with a local mobster. \n\nOh and I forgot to mention, the show starts with the climax. You know, because there has to be a hook to grab the viewer. I guess competent plotting wasn\u2019t an option here. \n\nOkay, here\u2019s the problem. The characters make the most illogical choices over and over again. Just when you think they\u2019ve got everything under control some new contrivance shows up out of nowhere and the characters make the wrong call yet again as if they do not know how to operate in their own world. Vince is a menace. A tornado destroying everything and everyone in his path, and not only does he take zero responsibility for his actions, but he blames it on the people trying to help him. Most of the characters are unlikable. Much like Ozark but this show is somehow more miserable. \n\nUnfortunately this show feels like a watered down version of Ozark which in itself was a flimsy knockoff of Breaking Bad. It even features the same style of title cards. I feel like I just watched this show. Successful family, seedy underbelly, and a secret. Last time it was called The Waterfront. Or Bloodline 10 years ago. Wait, has Netflix been doing this the entire time?",

Goosebumps. \n\nor when I saw bruno in 2009 the whole place erupting with laughter for the whole film, i'll always remember how I felt in that moment, it really was a magical experience all of which has now firmly become a thing of the past with the introduction of streaming services like netflix &amp; what not. \n\nIt really is a shame how the cinema died off &amp; I miss it greatly.

        "content": "Does anyone find it a lil bit sad to watch? Is it a coincidence that we have a US and UK brothers here? I am currently at ep5 where they're in their mom house and looking at old stuffs. I couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that the house seems to be in good shape, in a great neighborhood but it doesn't seem to be enough for them that they have to break things and move fast. It's sad and surreal at the same time with what's going on with the world. I don't find entertaining but a bit depressing to watch. ",

Can be animated , a documentary but can't be a contest or as anxiety inducing as *The Bear.* ",

        "content": "Sto vedendo Black Rabbit su Netflix, puntata 5, minuto 33 inoltrato, ENG sub ITA. Dopo aver scoperto che la fidanzata lo tradisce, un tipo dice \u201cfuc*ing god\u201d. Che io sappia \u00e8 una bestemmia in inglese (a differenza di \u201coh my fuc*ing god\u201d che invece \u00e8 una sorta di intercalare). Il mio dubbio \u00e8 rafforzato dal fatto che c\u2019\u00e8 anche un errore di post-produzione: si vede palesemente che c\u2019\u00e8 un fermo immagine e poi hanno riattaccato la scena. Come se avessero provato a coprire o a tagliare. Inoltre la frase non \u00e8 sottotitolata :D Sto flashando io? \u00c8 andata in tilt la mia tv? Devo rivedere le mie basi di bestemmia inglese?",

I\u2019m currently watching Billionaires Bunker and the subtitles for the most part are fine but the metric measurements keep getting translated to imperial. \n\nI understand a bit of Spanish so I\u2019m only half relying on the subtitles but it\u2019s annoying when they say things like the water is 38\u00b0c and the subtitles say it\u2019s 100, or the distances being in feet instead of meters. \n\n",

However, there was no account creation/login involved.  \n\nI later realized that Netflix uses Workday and proceeded to find their Workday page and create an account (with the same email as above), thinking I could track my status.  However my application does not appear on my Workday Netflix account. \n\n  \nCan someone offer any insight?  Did my application actually get submitted then?\n\n  \nThanks!\n\n  \n",
