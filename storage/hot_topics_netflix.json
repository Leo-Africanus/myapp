There were representatives from a bunch of different countries that are on a space ship when a bunch of weird things start happening. If I remember correctly it starts happening after they collect some dirt samples.  I think they they're in an alternative universe? I remember a specific scene where someone's limb gets cut off but they're not in pain and there's no bleeding?? \n\nAlso at the same time one on Earth these spaceship/monoliths appear but they don't open until later on in the series. \n\nDoes anyone remember this show?",

I know that a network made a season one of it some years ago, and while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't harry dresden.\nAnother would be The Deed Of Paksenarrion trilogy and books that followed. ",

It centered around this character who lived in a perfect world with a sentient mountain and his monster friend. He then wakes up forward in time and the current world is ruled by an elephant dictator. The world sucks and his friend is working a boring job. He goes on an adventure to wake up the mountain and eventually ends up in a vampire night club. It was a weird series hope that info can help identify it. Thanks!",

She should have went to months of Spanish classes before doing this movie cus when she speaks Spanish it\u2019s like she\u2019s reading off the script word by word idk if I\u2019m explaining it right lol it\u2019s doing flow.\n\nThe musical part wasn\u2019t bad except the English musical part with the doctor it was weird overall i give it a 6.5/10 \nI think it should have been a mini series honestly ",
