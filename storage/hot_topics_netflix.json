        "content": "Season one is possibly one of my favorite shows of all time. It was so engaging and intriguing and the characters felt authentic and well rounded the world building was interesting, and while I didn\u2019t like how they went to real people at the end, I was so excited for season two. \n\nSeason two, we start out extremely confused. It feels like season one was all for nothing, seeing as they are still in the game for some reason. Time passes, the characters keep doing the video game thing, but somethings off. Anyway, long story short, season two doesn\u2019t have the main characters in it at all. These are clones, perfect copies yes but they aren\u2019t the original MCs. The original characters are in the real world. I figured this out on episode three. Unlike with the original season one, I immediately knew what was going on pretty much from the get go. \n\nIesperately want to know what happened from there? But I guess we will never know seeing as it got canceled. Not surprised how bad that season was. I would\u2019ve loved it if we had gotten a take two almost. They are a team are they not? They would play hollow over and over again. I would\u2019ve loved to see the same three characters in a different  game of hollow. perhaps new sides of their characters and dynamics would show in different environments? Starting from scratch, no memories. Alternatively, I would\u2019ve loved to see how their lives continued in the real world after the game. Their relationships, etc, etc. What we got was so boring and low stakes in comparison.\n\n  \napparently, a lot of people loved it. So happy for you. I am not there, I don\u2019t think I will ever be there. please don\u2019t yell at me for having a different opinion.",

        "content": "Apparently paying a monthly fee is no longer enough, they\u2019re charging a supplemental rental fee for so many movies. Netflix never used to be like this. It\u2019s borderline useless. \n\nWasn\u2019t their whole business model to let people watch whatever they want for a monthly fee? These days I find myself scrolling through to find something I want to see, and it\u2019s an extra $5 to watch a movie that came out in 1987. Fuck that. Time to start collecting thrift store DVDs.",
