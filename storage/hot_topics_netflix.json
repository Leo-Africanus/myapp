It made sense in Season 1 since the story revolved around her, but in Season 2? Even FBI agents are unaware of Night Action, yet somehow, this civilian is deeply involved in everything??seriously? If the writers were so intent on keeping her relevant, why not just hire her as a tech? Instead, they throw a civilian into the field like it\u2019s nothing. To top it all off, the actor really cannot act. It was really difficult to finish season 2. I am not even getting to the other issues like poor writting, countlessly irritating character arcs.. S1 was not the greatest but it felt like this had some promise going forward and boy, oh boy, was I wrong.",

Especially the mother. Blaming Shannan for everything. With Gabby, Brian\u2019s mom is also narcissistic. In the same aspect as Brian. Both sons were narcissistic same as their mothers. \n\nThe body cams/story. In both body cams both Brian and Chris have that same smiley expression. They also both blamed the other party on wrong doing. Brian convinced the cops that Gabby was also being the aggressor. With Chris during the start he blamed Shannan stating they were fighting and she could of left with the kids. Also made the story convincing by her \"leaving the ring behind.\" During the interrogation Chris also claimed Shannan was choking one of the daughters and that's what \"made him\" kill Shannan.\n\nI just wanted to state this information because I started noticing the similarities when I saw the Brian body cam happened on August 12 2021. Chris murdered his family August 13 2018. \n\nIf there is anything else that is worth sharing please comment below! I'm sure there is a lot more similarities than my findings! ",

I am only one episode in, but I thought this would be an interesting place to discuss the series.\n\nEdit: I have finished the series and I can say I went through pretty much every emotion while watching this-mostly anger and sadness. Gabby was such a beautiful soul. Feels like we all know someone like her.\n\n It's truly a shame so many people find themselves stuck in relationships with manipulative abusers. It was like Gabby couldn't wrap her mind around leaving him. Even in her final text message, she tells her mom that they aren't breaking up. It's almost like some people feel like if they break up with their partner, they consider *themselves* a failure. Just a really sad and devastating story. Watching the vlog outtakes of them made me so uncomfortable. It makes you think about how the internet is truly a facade.",

The movie and TV space has produced some excellent work with the whole \"AI gone rogue\" as a topic (read: Ex Machina) but Cassandra is one of those that doesn't live up to the hype it creates and can definitely be skipped.\n\nFirst of all, it features some of the dumbest side characters (Samira's family) who genuinely made my blood boil as I was watching this. I get that you need to push the story ahead but definitely not at the cost of making your characters 50 IQ. Juno doesn't tell anyone Cassandra told her where the gun is despite it almost getting her expelled. Fynn doesn't mention what his boyfriend said to him about Cassandra till it's too late and David is honestly so unlikeable and dumb, that already makes this a difficult watch.\n\nThe story starts okay, peaks around episode 4 and doesn't make any coherent sense from that point. The plot twist is not only there for the sake of it but is somehow still extremely predictable. The ending far too rushed, even for a 6 episode series. The whole plot with Samira's sister feels so badly forced in, that I had to skip past most of it in the later episodes to get to the end.\n\nSpent my weekend watching this and retrospectively I could have spent it staring at a painting and come out more content.\n\n1.5/5\n",

        "content": "I just finished watching the Netflix series about this and omg how sad and shocking. These documentaries really put me off relationships these days and make me so skeptical about how people truly are and just what we see online. \n\nIt\u2019s very true that sometimes the people that seem the happiest online are often the saddest sometimes and with the most skeletons. I personally know many couples who would constantly post how in love they are and suddenly the very next day decide to divorce. And others who never post about one another but live a very happy and quiet life.\n\nAnyway this whole case was so sad and she seemed like such a bright and bubbly girl. One thing though, I need the caveat before I say it is that I\u2019m not blaming her parents but just I know if it were me in that situation and I had said those things to my parents about him they absolutely would expect me to come back to them and would not be happy about me continuing. I know everyone has different parenting styles but me coming from an Asian family - they wouldn\u2019t be ok with some of the things the parents already knew.\n\nThat guy seemed really creepy but it\u2019s the kind of creepy that isn\u2019t obvious which makes it more scary and I do wonder just how involved their parents were. None of this matters anymore I guess, sadly she\u2019s dead and I just hope everyone (men and women) are all careful of the kind of people they get involved with. It\u2019s a scary world out there and relationships don\u2019t seem to be what they were. Not saying everyone is a killer, just that\u2026. I think it\u2019s really hard these days ",

As the show does highlight a lot of struggles women go through in that time period so she may empathise with her mother.\n\nidk if this was talked about before if you\u2019ve said any of this sorry!!! \ud83d\ude2d",

It does not happen with YouTube, it does not happen with VLC, Disney, Plex etc.\n\n- If I exit full screen with HDR OFF, the flickering stops entirely.\n- If I enter full screen with HDR OFF, the flickering starts.\n- If I enable HDR via Windows Settings, the flickering stops completely in Netflix in fullscreen.\n\nThe issue is that HDR is bright as hell for me even with my TV set to the darkest setting.\n\nI have tried disabling Chrome hardware acceleration, it didnt work. \n\nThis is not a hardware issue and it is not related to software.\n\nThis is a Netflix issue because it doesnt happen ANYWHERE ELSE.\n\nAny advice? PLEASE. This is driving me insane.\n\nEdit: Some adjustments",
