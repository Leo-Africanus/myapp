Now, Netflix seems to be copying other services rather than the other way around. Why? Does anyone here actually like seeing fewer options on the screen? When you go to your list, rather than seeing multiple rows of all the things you like to watch, not you have to scroll endlessly to make it through what used to be a single screen's worth of content info. I hate this.\n\nSeriously though, does anyone know why? Are there metrics that make this make sense?",

I mean more if there is a coastal or beach town , fisher town or something similar, with a bunch of good looking Teenagers and Young Adults, that all apart from knowing how to drive a car they all know how to drive boats and they all surf and dive and are having their bonfire parties. Does something like that exist? Like a town with strong outer banks vibes? \n\nI know the gossip girl experience actually does exist, its called le rosey, a swiss boarding school. Prerequisite is that ur parents have to be loaded. Pretty much any expensive swiss boarding school.\n\nI know the emily in paris experience actually also does exist. Prerequisite is that 1. You speak french 2. You get a fashion job in paris that does get you invited to all these fashion shows and u live in the 6th and 7th Arrondissement and wear designer and earn good money. Or you can be an influencer or a nepo Baby like all the daughters from Fran\u00e7ois Henri pinault. But the emily in paris experience does def exist in real life. \n\nBut I cant really Wrap my head around, if the Outer Banks experience is purely fictional or there is a town like that sonewhere in the world with such an environment. \n",

        "content": "As described in the title, I opened Netflix on Roku yesterday to an announcement of the new UI and how wonderful it would be, etc., etc.\n\nDamn, is it ever bad. Of course, the \"worst\" label is 100% subjective and just one person's opinion. But, for me, it is objectively less usable than before. Its cramped design actually gives me a slight sense of clostrophobia to the point where I actively dislike being in the app. I find it very unwelcoming. \n\nWhen I open Netflix, most of the time I'm not going to in to watch anything in particular. I like browsing and hunting for something that, based on the title and/or image, I think might interest me. I've heard a lot of people complain about the quality on Netflix but there are still quite a few gems that I would often stumble on. The Residence and The Gentlemen are perfect examples of this - shows that I liked that I came across while scrolling through the app and hadn't previously heard of. \n\nThe new interface makes this process much more difficult. It's much easier to visually scan a screen with a lot of items and scroll when necessary. When you see something you might like you can choose to explore further and then look at the details.   \n\nNow, you are hit in the face with details of a single show taking up a large part of the screen that, odds are, you don't care anything about with a handful of other shows around the edges. \n\nGiven my typical use of Netflix, it will now take me much longer to find something than it did before. And given how being in the app makes me feel like I'm in a box, I can see my usage dropping significantly. Cancelation is likely right around the corner. \n\nFirst world problem, I know, but I only have so much money to go around. It doesn't make sense to spend it on something that will likely now sit idle most of the time. \n\nOk, rant over. On with my day. \n\nEDIT: I really am curious to hear from people who do like the new UI and what specifically they find better about it. While it's always fun to vent, I would like to hear others' perspectives just in case I'm missing something. ",

One major flaw about this i can think of is casting back the same casts for these shows because they might have projects currently so filming would be difficult to plan and also different looking casts (with them looking older than what their characters are suppose to be, though Stranger Things managed to make that work).

        "content": "Is the New and Upcoming category still in the new UI somewhere? Every week I go through what will be released in the next week, and add it to my list if it's interesting. But I couldn't find it last night when I tried using the new UI for the first time. Their recommendations and categories that they show are broken. For example they really want me to watch Korean dramas. I've never shown any interest in any foreign language show, so I don't know why it would be a suggested category. That's why I just use my watchlist. But I can't find anything with the new UI. I need the new and upcoming so I can bookmark shows I want to see.",
