        "content": "*Before BIASY! READ!!!: K-pop Demon Hunters* always draws criticism for its shallow representation of Korean culture, attempting to fuse traditional elements with flashy, Westernized aesthetics without meaningful context. Instead of honoring Korea\u2019s deep-rooted spiritual and folkloric heritage, the series seems more interested in selling a stylized, exportable version of Korean mythology for global consumption. The depiction of demons, hanbok-inspired costumes, and rituals feels more like costume dressing than cultural storytelling\u2014designed to be eye-catching for Western audiences rather than reflective of authentic beliefs or practices.\n\nMoreover, the project reflects a broader trend of cultural dilution, where traditional Korean identity is warped to fit a global pop template\u2014particularly that of Western superhero or fantasy tropes. The characters behave more like Marvel protagonists than figures grounded in Korean mythos, and the narrative prioritizes action and glamour over introspection or spiritual depth. This risks reducing Korea\u2019s rich cultural symbols to aesthetic commodities, stripped of their original meaning, and repackaged through a Western lens to fit mainstream expectations.",

The Shamanists did festivals or sang songs as a traditional ritual. These rituals existed for thousand of years. But in the movie, it shows as if there's only three of these shamans, AND THe K-POP Girls AREN't EVEN SINGING TRADITIONAL KOREAN SONGS. How IS THAT EVEN VALID??!?! The Movie is Just Breaking Korean TRadition and Morphing it into western culture. As a Korean, i am very distraught....",

She knows he\u2019s still using the Netflix she pays for because after he moved our profiles showed up on her Netflix when that hadn\u2019t been there before. She has no idea what the password is. Is there some solution to this?  This POS doesn\u2019t deserve his free Netflix.
