Within days the TV appeared again and on NF advice I changed my password.  Within days they were back and now I find I have to sign them out a couple times a week.

And then in episode 8, I felt like it just didn't deliver. I think it just wasn't good as a limited series. The mystery that was built was too big for the wrap up. I wanted to understand by the end something about the inner world or workings of the townspeople. In general, for a show which centered so much around emotions, the deeper we got into the series the more shallow the characters seemed to become. It was really disappointing. We never were let into the characters internal experience. \n\nI wanted so badly to see Laura and Alex actually TALK about things. Like the relationship was never sold as functional or emotionally intimate. I get if at first they were freaked out but when they got on the same page, why was the most we got was a a couple arguments? No real conversation. Alex is obsessive and won't let things go about work but his wife is obviously going through all this and not  actually planning on leaving town snd he's not bothering her constantly about it? \n\nThe timeline just felt wonky and poorly conceived following the set up. A great concept with poor follow through. I was left wanting more, but not in a good way, but in the way that I felt they would have to undo what they had done to answer things in a satisfying way.

I mean, it's a series based on Monsters and Serial Killers. However, the Menendez Brothers were neither. Also, the Ed Gein one now. He also wasn't a Serial Killer he only had 2 victims confirmed. He did rob graves, which I do think is a lot more monster like, but I fail to see how that can be a thrilling watch.\n\nAlso, I've just seen that the next season is about Lizzie Borden, who ALSO isn't a Serial killer. Does anyone actually think that any of these (aside from Dahmer and maybe Gein) are true to the title given of \"MONSTER?\" Also, does anyone believe that these people stick to the original idea when DAHMER was made. I thought it was gonna be a couple of series based of actual Monstorous Serial killers (Ted Bundy, Polly Bartlett, John Wayne Gavey etc) doesn't anyone have any idea why that idea was abandoned and they stuck to killers that never got the official \"serial killer\" title? It just doesn't quite fit, in my opinion.\n\nIn my opinion, I believe they're avoiding John Wayne Gacey for 1 of 2 reasons. Either because:\n\n1: They can't make him sexy. Orrr\n\n2: They want to avoid showing young children as victims.\n\nI doubt it is the second option as Ryan Murphy has portrayed children and teens dying in many other shows. However, I could be wrong. Also, not many people would watch that, me included. Either way, my point stands, there's thousands of real serial killers to cover.",
