It seems like reviews of non-English shows often get lower ratings or feel less in-depth compared to English-language ones. I wonder if it has to do with the fact that many reviewers aren't used to reading subtitles? It feels like there's a certain disconnect when people aren't accustomed to watching things with subtitles, and it shows in their reviews.\n\nIt seems to me that reviewers who are more familiar with non-English media are able to offer more thoughtful critiques, but those who are less used to subtitles sometimes struggle to engage with the show properly. Does anyone else notice this trend?\nI often see this in Europan non English shows ",
