I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

We have a 4 year old and I am amazed at the ads other services are showing during family shows and even kids shows. Heck even the banner at the top of Disney isn\u2019t appropriate for their kids account\u2026kid shows listed under a scary monster \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnyone unhappy with the ad content their child might see?",

I'm a paying customer and downvoted this low-quality 1999 game already. It's still there and I haven't been getting any recommendations for months now because of this annoying game advertisement. It's so frustrating, I've found NOTHING online on how to deal with this. It's like a Computer Virus. ",
