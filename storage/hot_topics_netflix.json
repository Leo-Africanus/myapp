My favorite podcasts are \"sip and gossip\" (it's a french podcast) where you read anecdotes/stories and there are reactions I think it's really cool but there are no such masses. (PLUS I don't like true crimes, it seems there's only that)\n\nSo as an alternative I put on Netflix series and I listen but usually it's what I already know so I don't need to watch! I'm someone who watches the same series in a loop so it's easy but I want to again but I don't know where to go \n",

If she had been murdered by Jason, why didn't she know already to be afraid of him? Why did she marry someone who she thought had killed her friend?\n\nThere were SO many opportunities here to catch these people up in her lies and to send them to jail forever, and I am just beyond disgusted that there wasn't a bigger push to expose her for the BPD lying fraud she is, and HE is.",

The caption was \u201csharing is caring,\u201d and it showed this app/interface called Artfact Note\u2014basically disguised as an artifact-looking app, but once you enter a specific code, it unlocks access to a bunch of streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, HBO, etc.\n\nI got curious (of course) and tried it out. Been using it for a day and, honestly? It works. I can actually stream shows without the usual login/subscription steps. It really feels too good to be true.\n\nI dug around a bit\u2014checked their privacy policy, user agreement, etc.\u2014and nothing seems immediately sketchy. It explicitly states that it does not collect or store personal data.\n\nStill, I can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s a catch. Either it\u2019s harvesting something quietly, or it\u2019s going to stop working one day and leave everyone hanging. Anyone here tried it or have any idea what the risks might be?\n\nNot trying to promote it, just curious if anyone else has encountered this. Thoughts?",
