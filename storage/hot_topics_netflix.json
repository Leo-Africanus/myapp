What's that about? Where's all the good stuff? Is there a way to game the algorithm so I can see the stuff it's not showing me?

I have watched alot of teen and young adult series on netflix and I realize that most persons look like they are models and they are always well groomed.\nIs this typical of high schoolers and college students in the US? Or is it because these shows are centered around rich areas so the characters are reflective of that? Or is it because they choose the best looking persons to cast and these persons fresh up before filming? The females are always hot and the males look like they go to the gym. \nWhereas from what I have seen in real life, most people are average looking. So is this a rich neighbourhood thing or what with these series. Please answer and be respectful. If this is not the place to have a discussion about this, let me know.",

I understand this has been discussed before, and that the darker image is often a creative choice by the filmmakers rather than a technical limitation\u2014especially with Dolby Vision, which isn\u2019t always used to its full dynamic range. Even in daytime scenes, the average brightness tends to be much lower than standard SDR content.\n\nWhat puzzles me, though, is the contrast between the playback and the scene thumbnails. When scrubbing through scenes, the thumbnails appear much brighter and more vivid\u2014more in line with what I\u2019d expect from HDR content.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is this behaviour down to Netflix, or something to do with how LG handles Dolby Vision?\n\nThank you!",
