I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

It lets you see different strategies from different players.  \n\nThe winner played such a good game, and showed she was strategic in not voting Syd when she had immunity, playing the final round right etc. \n\nI would've been okay with Sam winning too. \n\nCorey...take a shot every time Corey guessed the millionaire incorrectly \ud83d\ude02 he was cool though. \n\nUltimately it was nice to see all of the contestants trying to play strategically.

Sweet I have Netflix - I click the link. It goes to a movie entry on the Netflix site with the poster, details cast etc exactly like any movie on Netflix looks. But it's not real.\n\nI assume the point of this is, if you don't have Netflix there would be some kind of 'watch thousands of great movies on Netflix!' prompt, implying that if you subscribe you'll be able to watch this movie? But Netflix doesn't actually have the movie. This is insanely scummy, and a nice big time waste for people who actually subscribe to the service.\n\n",

To explain the situation: the Netflix account owner is located in the United Kingdom, where the household was originally established and verified on a TV device. I, however, am located in Nepal, and whenever I attempt to log in using a new device or a different Wi-Fi network, Netflix immediately flags the device as being outside of the registered household and requests a verification code.  \n   \n**My Question:**   \n  \nConstantly requesting the account owner for a verification code is impractical and not a sustainable solution in the long term.I have already tried that airplane method and turning off wifi for mobile phone. But I noticed it does not ask code in new device. Since I stream mostly in laptop, so any trick to bypass this as I discovered it does not ask code when I login in to new device as I have access to netflix email and password but not verification code. But for old device it asks the code. Anyway to bypass this so that my laptop thinks it is completely new device.",

Writing, production, acting, casting, costumes, what have you: it\u2019s all on point 90% of the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a gangsters/families, cops and robbers martial arts drama, with the various gangs being fictional, but still feeling plausible in its\u2019 historicity. I treat it as fiction, but made in imitation of real life, at least as far as the broad tensions and power dynamics of that place and time.\n\nThe writing is sharp, the characters are great portrayals of certain archetypes. The action is excellent and stylish. It\u2019s quality top to bottom. And it\u2019s a unique perspective.\n\nThe focus is the Chinese immigrant population of 19th century San Francisco, but also the Irish population and other ancillary forces such as nativist white supremacy, economics, existing political structures, culture barriers, space and resource limitations etc etc. \n\nIf you like historical fiction, martial arts, sopranos style gangster drama\u2026this is for you. \n",

It's only a week after the season hits or some random Tiktoks that i would find out a show is coming up. What happened ? \n\nEdit: I just went through their trailers and like, this entire year is loaded with their highest viewership shows ? How are they not making a big deal out of this year being the year of Netflix coming back with their cult classic shows ? We have Sandman, Love, Death and Robots, Wednesday, as well as Stranger Things (although I did saw Stranger Things being announced this year BUT not because of Netflix bombarding it in my face). ",

        "content": "Hi, i\u2019m currently trying to use my profile but any time I use it or my friends on the same account they cause netflix to bring up the error code tvq-st-149. \nOther profiles on the account don\u2019t cause this. just these two. Both accounts were working fine earlier and I am trying to access them from the netflix household. Signing out and i\u2019m in again/ reloading seems to have no effect. any help is appreciated.",

        "content": "Ok so now that we\u2019ve binge watches the entire season in a single day, IVE GOT QUESTIONS! And I think the director has deliberately kept it that way.\n\nWhen Maddie was put in the cage by Joe, maddie tried to show for a moment that she\u2019s quite strong and doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s a hostage, but soon when Ketoacidosis kicks in, and she gets know about her \u201csuperior\u201d twin learning about the affair\u2026 she just looses it and reveals how she\u2019s such a weak little girl. All throughout the season we see her as impulsive and extraordinarily weak in every minor situation after the cage incidence\u2026 which wasn\u2019t really the case before that!\n\nMy theory is \u2026 when  Reagan was locked in with her\u2026 who just showed moments ago that she can easily beat up Joe, and is quite tough, CAN\u2019T BE KILLED THAT EASILY BY HER WEAKER SISTER , that too by an insulin injection when she\u2019s all awake and athletic!!\n\nAlso, the killing of Reagan scene and the scene when maddie hits her husband unconscious is both not shown on the show\u2026 making perfect sense that Reagan killed maggie and then pretended to be her for the rest of the show!\n\nBut even till the final episode .. it wasn\u2019t shown.. the hallucinations, the - going to jail and still not breaking character were all a big show to make people hooked on when the show will reveal that it\u2019s actually Reagan pretending to be her twin and not the other way around\u2026 but it was never shown!\n\nDid anyone else notice that? I can\u2019t be the only one.",

It's not even the first time they've done something like this. Like why, is there an actual point? Can they only have a certain amount of shows, do they have to pay to keep the license to certain shows and movies? Like if not then Netflix is just ass.",
