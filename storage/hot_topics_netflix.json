        "content": "...was that this could have been any neighbourhood and could happen anywhere. I remember playing out in the village I was raised in as a child, and there was always one weird house where a scary adult would live. You and your friends would all avoid them at all costs, but sometimes a ball would just go into their garden by accident or you'd just be existing and they'd make your life a misery when they came out, etc. I forgot how scary that used to be as a child and this documentary really reminded me of that fear and power imbalance of an adult making you feel that way when you are just playing and having fun outdoors which should be such a magical part of childhood. I knew something horrible was going to happen in this situation of course, but for some reason I didn't think it would be such a cruel and barbaric murder like that for some reason. Yes, the lady is definitely mean, racist, angry and a nasty bully, but for her to take the life of that wonderful lady and mother, and leave those babies motherless just absolutely broke my heart, I just didn't see it coming. All of that loss and hurt over something minor. One minute they had their lovely mother just advocating for her children and defending them like she had every right to do so, and then next minute she was gone. Her life was lost, and those poor children of hers will never feel the same again. All over that evil lady, who had years to just go live somewhere else if she wasn't happy in a family neighbourhood.\n\nI don't know. It's just really broken my heart. It's just so senseless. ",

Some mention that one person may have agreed, and possibly received money for everyone(maybe just a rumors), but even if that\u2019s true, does it justify broadcasting such personal pain?\n \n- What do we know about the consent process for this kind of media?  \n- Do you think it\u2019s ethical to share such footage if only one person agreed?  \n- Where do we draw the line between public interest and exploitation?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching a lot of intense relationship dramas lately, and I\u2019m curious if there are any good movies where the husband actually catches his wife cheating like right in front of his eyes and it really messes him up emotionally afterwards.\n\nI didn\u2019t experience anything like this myself, but I find those kinds of stories really gripping and heartbreaking at the same time. I like seeing how he deal with betrayal, depression, and trying to rebuild his lives afterwards.\n\nAny recommendations for movies like that?",

        "content": "Loved the concept, hated the execution. Here\u2019s why this show had all the potential but ended up being one big missed opportunity. (I am not sure how the rating is so high)\n\n\t\u2022\tIn Season 1, Dodge tells Bode you can go anywhere only if there\u2019s a door, so how\u2019s Gideon using the Anywhere Key to land in the middle of a forest in Season 3? Make it make sense.\n\t\u2022\tThey could\u2019ve easily trapped Gideon inside Gordie\u2019s head, like erin, but nope, they were too busy chasing keys.\n\t\u2022\tKinsey could draw anything to fight Gideon\u2026 and she picks a motorcycle? Really?\n\t\u2022\tChamberlain Locke literally had all the answers and still got treated like background furniture.\n\t\u2022\tTyler\u2019s \u201clove story\u201d in Season 3 was just painful to watch. The girl literally stalks him back his home, forces a date, and somehow we\u2019re meant to root for them? Bring Jackie back with the Shadow Key instead, please.\n\t\u2022\tJosh started out with actual depth, obsessed with the keys and the door and then just fizzled out. Making Gideon his ancestor added nothing.\n\t\u2022\tScot and Kinsey\u2019s reunion after the Gabe mess? Did scot forget she wanted to date both of them and never really chose him.\n\t\u2022\tNina Locke deserved way more energy, more purpose.\n\t\u2022\tHonestly, Gabe, Eden, and Dodge carried the whole show.\n\nBrilliant premise. Terrible writing.\n",
