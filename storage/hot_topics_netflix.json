Between all the different platforms, we keep it low tier just so we can still have access to most stuff.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re chilling on vacation, decide to throw on a movie, and go straight to Netflix \u2014 our usual go-to. And what do we get? A notification saying:\n\u201cYour subscription tier is not available in this region.\u201d\nSo\u2026 basically, we can\u2019t use Netflix at all.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 get this \u2014 it hits us with:\n\u201cYou can change your subscription [here]\u201d with a link to upgrade.\nLike that\u2019s gonna make me go \u201coh yeah sure, let me give Netflix more money just so I can use it on my vacation.\u201d Bro, be serious.\n\nI\u2019ve been paying for Netflix for years. I\u2019m not asking for a free ride \u2014 just some common sense. Would it really kill them to say:\n\u201cThis tier isn\u2019t available in your current region. You have 7 days of access while traveling \u2014 enjoy your vacation!\u201d\nGive me a little grace period. A little respect. I\u2019m not a new user. I\u2019m just out of town for a minute.\n\nSo what now? Am I supposed to pause or cancel my Netflix sub every time I leave the country? Is it even worth paying anymore if I\u2019m gone for part of the month? It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated.\n\nAnd this is why people are done with streaming services. They nickel-and-dime loyal users, and act surprised when people jump ship. It\u2019s like they want to lose us.\n\nNetflix \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 stop punishing your paying customers for traveling. It\u2019s not a good look.

        "content": "Mercy for None\u00a0is a violent South Korean action series that delivers. It follows a former gang enforcer who tried to walk away but is dragged back into a brutal underworld (John Wick vibes).\n\nThe story is solid, but the real star is the action. This show has some of the\u00a0best martial arts scenes ever:  fast, intense, and packed with emotion. Every fight feels like it matters, and the stakes are real.\n\nShot in Seoul, the show is moody, stylish, and totally immersive. If you\u2019re into dark, emotional stories with incredible fight choreography,\u00a0Mercy for None\u00a0is a must-watch.  Enjoy!",

        "title": "All Of Us Are Dead is the most unintentionally funniest show I've seen",
        "content": "I'm aware this finished ages ago but just decided to binge-watch this with a friend in one day. I would say this is the epitome of so bad it's good.\n\n* the detective character who is initially shown as a very serious character when introduced, but quickly turns into a goofy ass character who goes on random side quests because the plot demands he does random shit until the final episode.\n* that bully who is the main antagonist. Pretty much a Looney Tunes character\n* a girl that seemed like she would turn into a second antagonist and play a bigger role but hides in a storage room for 3 episodes (the same classroom the other kids are stuck in as well and no one even thinks to open the storage for supplies or something) and then dies unceremoniously\n* every episode there is **at least** 2 or 3 things that happens in the plot or the characters' actions that will absolutely blow your mind on how every character is a glue sniffer. It's a mystery how any of these characters even survived past childhood without getting run over in traffic or something. There's a scene where the students try to [sneak behind a zombie facing the window](https://youtu.be/EJzu9sCR-Ys?t=250). Of course one character decides to hold onto a pink steel flask when he's literally wearing a bag pack.\n* unintentionally funny scenes like the last episode when the half-zombie girl decides to jump off the building like some superhero. Or when the main character jumps out the window and you see a zoomed out shot of the character doing an inhuman acrobatic movie via cgi.\n* Pointless sideplots, pointless deaths, pointless characters that seemed like the show is setting up something but nothing happens.\n* Least on the nose political themes with the assembly woman character\n\nrecommend watching this while high. I'm also interested in what mind state the writers and showrunners were in while they produced this",

As soon as I realized they're on an island because their plane broke mid flight, I was, yeah, sure lol...\n\nThen the ... whatever eats people on that island. I don't even know and don't care.\n\nAnd the acting is also cringe.\n\nI thought, maybe it's just a sign of the times, and 20 years ago I would have liked it... It's an old series.\n\nHad the same experience with \"24\", first time I saw it I was so hooked! Then wasn't able to rewatch past episode 2 some 15-20 years later, it was the most stupid thing I've ever seen :-/\n\nHm",
