        "title": "RIPLEY",
        "content": "  Netflix\u2019s *Ripley* is a great thriller that leans hard into mood, restraint, and slow-burn suspense. The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

No PiP window appears. It feels like a bug, but *Netflix support confirmed this is intentional on the ad tier so ads remain full screen*.\n\nThis restriction is not clearly disclosed in the app. If Picture in Picture matters to you on iPhone, the Netflix ad tier is not worth it.",

        "title": "Think Best Guess Live is rigged? You're Wrong.",
        "content": "Let's really put this into perspective since there are so many people online complaining that they think it's rigged.\n\nNetflix is projected to have brought in 45 BILLION dollars in 2025. That is earning a revenue of 123 million dollars day. \n\nBest Guess Live gives out $15,000 every weekday, so 260 days out of the year. That adds up to a little under 4 million dollars. With special giveaways let's just pretend it's actually 5 million dollars over the course of the year. Let's pretend it's 10 million even, that's 0.01% of their annual revenue. **It takes Netflix approximately about 2 hours to generate 10 million dollars.**\n\nWhy would a company that makes 123 million dollars a day risk their reputation to save 10 million dollars? It would be like you or me risking a felony charge to save a nickel we found on the sidewalk.\n\n**Netflix is a 500 billion dollar company, you think they're going to risk catching a federal charge over a $15,000 daily trivia game?????**\n\nThey're literally doing this for retention. If someone was going to cancel their account because they don't like the content being carried, maybe having this keeps them around because they have fun playing it.\n\n\"The clues are impossible!\" There's literally 80,000 people making random guesses. On a puzzle they are trying to make impossible on guess 1 and 2 specifically. They go through the answers after to ensure their thought process and why the clue is fair. Why would anyone be giving away money in a game where there are 5 guesses want to make it easy to be figured out on the 1st and 2nd guess? It makes no sense.\n\n**TL;DR:** Netflix makes the prize pool money in the time it takes you to watch one movie. They have zero incentive to rig it and every legal/financial incentive to keep it fair so you keep opening the app every night and don't cancel your membership if you don't like the tv/film options available.",

Are the biggest factors things like new season releases, online hype, or how popular the show already is? Also, do older shows often return to the Top 10 when new seasons come out? Based on trends and current buzz, what do you think the top five Netflix shows this week are likely to be, and why do you think those particular titles are performing so well right now?",

Something fun or easy to watch is ideal, but we\u2019re open to action, comedy, or even a good thriller.\n\nWhat Netflix movies usually work well with a group? Any recent ones you\u2019d recommend that don\u2019t feel slow or boring?",

        "content": "I opened netflix yesterday and noticed only 3 shows are on my continue watching list despite having many more the previous day.\n\nI also had a section called Recovery Mode which I had never seen before.\n\nAny idea what happened? Pretty annoying to have lost the rest of the continue watching list.\n\nIs this common? First time I've had any issues in probably a decade. This was at home, not on the road or anything unusual.\n\nThanks.",

        "content": "Now that the series has ended and we have digested a bit the final season, I am curious to hear everyone's thoughts! On seasons, characters, etc.  \n\nI have put together a poll - sign in is not required and none of your data is saved (besides your answers ofc, which don't trace to you). I really love data and information, and this is the best chance to get a vibe for how the community is feeling right after this whole shebang ended! I really love data stuff like this and always wish this kind of thing existed for other shows I love.  \n\nMost questions don't require an answer, but it only takes a few minutes to go through, so I recommend doing so.  \n  \nIn a couple weeks or so, I will make a post and a video summarizing the results if we get at least a decent number of responses! Share with anyone who has seen the show.  \n\nSuggestions for additional questions? Leave them below and if this is a success we can run another one!  \n\nThere **are** season 5 spoilers in this poll! But only in the final question section.  \n\nLink to the poll, reminder no sign-in required: [Poll Here](https://forms.gle/dBfQrfdMjXNc8Fjc6)",

I\u2019m not too sure. Her point is as a parent of a 13-year-old Old you\u2019re responsible for his actions. I see her point, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s 90%. I definitely think they should be held more accountable than they seem to be in the storyline but maybe 50%. I think there was a definite lack of seeing your son has some sort of problems that should\u2019ve been addressed properly years back. ",
