Those men were pathetic- all it took was a pretty girl with a nice body to show them a little attention and they turned to jelly....(Good for her though.) I wasn't sure if she and Phil had a thing or her and Chris did. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed these three episodes more than the first three. But I liked them all. I'd love to see more seasons of the show. There's still some tweaking for them to do. \n\n***Edited to add-\nThis is by far my favorite podcast I've listened to that talks about this show.  \n\nSo far there are 2 episodes, one of them talks about 1-3 and the next one talks about 4-6.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7eUJyjTkELE2KfbxGHbqkF?si=N_LIduBhTuaX7OB6ws5hjw\n",

        "title": "How is Adolescence about Toxic Masculinity?",
        "content": "I just finished the show last night, and thought it was spectacular. I'm just a bit confused about one thing.\n\nEverywhere, this is hailed as showcasing the problems of toxic masculinity, but Jeremy wasn't a \"believer\" of the Incel stuff and said he looked it up but didn't like it. The only thing he agrees with is the \"80/20\" rule, which is just the Pareto Principle applied to relationships as opposed to land, wealth or other things. His dad wasn't typically 'toxic', if anything it seems like his grand-dad was, and Jeremy's dad was deliberately different to that.\n\nOn top of this, it implies that he confronts the girl specifically because she is calling him an incel on his photos, and using \"manosphere\" emojis to make it seem like he is part of the incel or Andrew tate stuff. But everywhere is saying \"the dangers of toxic masculinity\" as if he's a mini brainwashed Andrew Tate. \"the dangers of repeatedly humiliating and bullying an unhinged child until he stabs you to death\" is a more apt description\n\nI get that there is a lot of nuance in terms of Jeremy's psychology- but to me the show seemed to be about a kid who was bullied until he lost his temper and committed murder. I didn't see anything to suggest that the outcome would have been different if the person bullying him was a boy. I don't see how Andrew Tate or masculinity had any cause/effect here.\n\nPeople seem to collectively agree that he stabbed her because she turned him down - but on the tape he was talking/arguing pretty passively until she pushed him over and he snapped. It appeared that he was basically threatening her to stop - she called his bluff and pushed him over, his pride got hurt and he went psycho mode.\n\nThe show is still fantastic, but I genuinely don't see why all the Andrew tate/manosphere/toxic masculinity stuff was included. You could take it out of the story and have her bullying him online with literally any other emoji. She could have just as easily tried to convince everyone he was a racist, as opposed to an incel - would the show then be all about the dangers of racism?\n\nI'm sure I'm looking at this from the wrong angle since everyone else is on the same page, was just wondering if someone could put it into perspective for me please",

My brothers and my parents all managed to change their icons to Sonic ones, but the option doesn't show up SPECIFICALLY on my profile. Is there a solution to this? Maybe it's age restricted, even though I highly doubt that's the case? I've even tried watching a full episode of it, but they're still not available to me. ",
