        "content": "Just watched the Netflix doc, and here\u2019s what struck me: we\u2019ve been looking at this case completely wrong.\n\nThe doc lays out the usual theories: some random madman, or a corporate cover-up involving J&amp;J. But the details of the crime don\u2019t actually support either. What they show is planning, precision, and restraint.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t some unstable lunatic. This was a disciplined, high-functioning psychopath. Likely a man in his 40s, with a background in chemical engineering, pharma manufacturing, or industrial supply chain. Someone who understood how cyanide worked, how packaging could be tampered with undetected, and how quickly product moves off retail shelves.\n\nHe didn\u2019t guess, it was calculated. Multiple bottles, different stores, narrow time window. He knew people would die, and he knew they wouldn\u2019t trace it back to him. That\u2019s not chaos. That\u2019s a controlled system breach.\n\nIf this was revenge, Tylenol wasn\u2019t random. It was J&amp;J\u2019s flagship product. He may have been fired, humiliated, or quietly discarded. And this was his response: not a manifesto, not a demand, just destruction. That silence wasn\u2019t humility, it was the result of years of feeling invisible. No one ever saw him, so why would he need to speak now?\n\nBut even if it wasn\u2019t about J&amp;J, the profile still holds. The murders may have been the point. A final act of control by someone who felt powerless. Either way, this man was a loner. No family to warn. No friends to confide in. No one close enough to notice. That\u2019s why no one came forward. That\u2019s why no one remembers him.\n\nHe might not have been from Chicago at all, just passed through, executed the plan, and vanished.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part everyone misses: he never did it again. Not because he lost interest. Because it was done. The plan worked. Or maybe because he knew one more move would get him caught.\n\nThis was a smart, self-contained psychopath who saw himself as nothing, and built a crime that finally proved he was something. Then he disappeared the same way he lived: completely unseen.\n\nWe\u2019ve been looking for the wrong kind of monster this whole time. Maybe someone remembers the right one.",

        "content": "Day 1 watcher here! My dad and I have always loved watching shows as a kid together. We watched all the Star Wars shows and movies, marvel movies and shows, stranger things, and a bunch of Netflix/Paramount shows. Sweet Tooth was probably the only show that him and I watched each season on day 1. We were so hooked on S1 that we kept watching on every launch day. Now we weren\u2019t able to find time to watch the last season but the past 2 days we watched a bunch of episodes and I\u2019m going to say this. The ending made me cry. I have never cried for a show before but it just made me feel different about my whole life ahead of me (I\u2019m 15 currently). I just thought that how Gus expressed on how all things have an ending in a beautiful way was so touching and inspirational. I\u2019m not going to spoil it for people who haven\u2019t watched but I\u2019ll give an actor review. I HATED Dr. Singh and Mrs. Zhang. The actors did very well on making me hate them which is actually a great thing as they acted amazing. The guy that Becky killed in the beast also made me pissed off. Overall I loved Sweet Tooth and I suggest you watch it if you haven\u2019t. Best show I\u2019ve watched in a long time.",

        "content": "What the hell Netflix, you cancelled one of the most fun shows ever. Alright, this is no \"White Lotus\" or \"Severance\" or whatever, and the best part is...it never tries to be. This is one of those cheesy, over-the-top, brainless action shows that is sexy, funny and addictive. It's a throwback to shows I watched as a kid, Airwolf, Miami Vice, Knight Rider...the 80s baby. And c'mon, it's better than the shitty movies Netflix puts out like Red Notice, Old Guard, Extraction and those 100 generic Ryan Reynolds movies. The cast is hot, doing hot things, while saving U.S. from a nuclear detonation. What's more American than that? The storyline is cliche, but still decent, Russians are bad (of course), but rather than pitting them against another foreign power, there are rogue U.S. ex-military operatives vying for the bomb. There are some genuine twists (don't expect Sixth Sense/Fight Club level twists), that I found good. There are a lot of zingers in the dialogue, c'mon references to Rambo and Mission Impossible (\"fuck, we've been Ghost Protocol-ed\" had me lmao). There were even some deep philosophical shit, like the Gremlin representing Paul's inner demons, fantastic.  Characters, Ava, McKnight, Trunky, Tech Chick, Haggerty, Paul, Gomez were all likeable af, and the cast really delivered. Does help that everyone is hot, yes even Tech Chick. I didn't want any of them to die (which is unusual, there is normally always that 1 person). And Gremlin, voiced by B-99's Jason Mantzoukas, epic. Some people say this show was too raunchy, but nothing a generation that grew up watching American Pie and Hangover would find shocking. And the action was a blast, there are car chases, car crashes, helicopter chases, guns, physical fights, knife fights hell yeah. So imo, this show has a lot of gas left in the tank, they can make 1 season every couple of years (ala Witcher) set in different locations and different \"missions\". Then I found out it was canned....wtf. I really think the reception of the show would have turned out very differently if:\n\n1. Change the fucking title to something easier to remember. I found this show when I accidentally pressed \"O\" in the search bar. And it took me a while to remember the name.\n2. Have a token A-lister in the cast. Shows like Hangover and Bullet Train would've been duds if it wasn't for Bradley Cooper or Brad Pitt - just sayin'. It's not fair to the cast because they were great, it's just Hollywood economics.\n\nSo...when S2?",

Is really clear though the show that she 1. Is not taking her med and is an emocional mess, 2. Being groomed by Micaela and very vulnerable, 3. In the end, she is just trying to survive and ends up in the worst spot she could: in the hands of a very wealthy older man who has all the power in the relationship and a history of disregard for his wives.\n\nIn the end, Devon actually lets Simone go when she realizes that 1. Simone will be as auto destructive as she was because it\u2019s her life, and Devon will drown with her if she keeps trying to save her, and 2. Devon realizes she doesn\u2019t know Simone that well too. Also, it is very clear Devon has a lot of mental issues and doesn\u2019t got the money for treatment (thus the affairs with a lot of guys, impulsive decisions and emotional outbursts).\n\nAnd yes, she was not right to expect Simone to take care of their father, but it makes sense she did. Devon was not expected to take care of Simone either, she was not responsible for her and yet she took that role. In her mind, at the start of the show, she thought that she was obligated to take care of Simone because they were family, and that\u2019s the same reason she takes care of the dad and why she thinks Simone should too. In the end, she realizes that taking care of family was a choice and one she was very happy and proud to make.\n\nI really liked Devon actually, because by the end she finally finds a \u201clight\u201d and starts to follow a good path. I don\u2019t get the hate.",

        "content": "I was trying to open Netflix, but now it says that my device isn't part of the Netflix household. I used it the other day no problem. I'm a college student but I'm home for summer break and I'm on my house's internet right now. The device limit thing has never seemed to be an issue for me or my family before, and it's always recognized my computer. Most advice I saw about this was to connect to the known network, but I'm on it.  My dad owns the account so I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure we have the standard plan. I'm the only one home, and my dad is working, so I know nobody else is using it right now. I'm just mainly confused as to why this is happening now of all times. Any advice or ways to fix this?",

        "content": "Using the official app from the Microsoft Store. Tried disabling all Edge extensions, didn\u2019t help. Doesn\u2019t happen of Firefox for some reason (no, I don\u2019t wanna use Firefox because it won\u2019t go above 1080p and also no HDR). The glitching stops when I move the mouse and the overlay with controls comes up. It doesn\u2019t seem to happen with every show, just with those who have a 16:9 aspect ratio. It happens even when the show is paused, as long as there isn\u2019t the overlay as I said earlier. Anybody had the same issue?",
