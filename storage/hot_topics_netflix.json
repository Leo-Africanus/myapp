        "content": "This started as a reply to a comment, but after seeing so many threads blaming the \u201cpermissive\u201d parents or portraying Susan as a harassed senior defending her turf, I had to make it a post. The doc shows Susan\u2019s actions were calculated, not reactive self-defense. \n\nI get the parental angle, I\u2019d be extra vigilant too and would keep my kids away from someone like Susan with her cursing, petty aggressions and escalating beef. You never know what people are capable of so you should trust your instincts, but blaming the parents overlooks Susan\u2019s premeditation.\n\nSusan told AJ\u2019s kid to fetch his mom (knowing it\u2019d bring AJ over), called 911 then shot AJ unarmed in under two minutes. Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground might cover perceived threats on your property, but why not wait for cops? Lock the door? Retreat inside? Aim non-lethally? The body cams, timelines and forensics scream intent, not fear.\n\nShe escalated from verbal abuse to physical by throwing skates and swinging umbrellas at AJ\u2019s kid to provoke AJ. That\u2019s baiting, not being \u201cfed up.\u201d Any parent would confront that. The trespassing and door-banging excuses ignore how Susan orchestrated it betting on the law to shield her.\n\nParents could\u2019ve chosen differently in hindsight, but Susan had clear alternatives to killing. Someone that determined would\u2019ve found a way regardless. \n\nAccountability\u2019s on her.",

I loved the score, I loved the tension, and I loved the acting. \n\nI loved that the film was told through different characters point of view\u2026 It definitely was not a chronological narrative so to say which is fine because it\u2019s a different style of story telling\u2026 (Babel). \n\nI know some people didn\u2019t enjoy the ending (cliffhanger) but it\u2019s up for interpretation. I think the Bomb went off and I think the audience not been informed of who launched the bomb also worked quite nicely. \n\nI think it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s okay if you do like it. So let\u2019s stop shitting on other people\u2019s opinions and quit trying to change their mind(s). \n\nI think the way how we watch media has changed. The rise of technology and acquiring information so quickly, has sort of shifted how we view movies. We want conclusions, we want information, we want the plot to be easy to follow, we want to know what exactly what happens. So it makes sense If there are a lot of people who are not really a fan of cliffhangers, which is OK. It\u2019s just a different way of absorbing media.\n\n",

        "content": "So the show really seemed to suggest that Salvatore Vinci was tge monster. He had no alibis for any of the murders, one of 11 guns like the one used in the murders sold in his region belonged to his family member and was unaccounted for, his first wife died suspiciously\u2026 What I\u2019m wondering is how much of his story that the series put forth was actually true/proven? Is there any public knowledge of his family/early life? Was he gay? Did he have a relationship with his first wife\u2019s brother? Did he have a relationship with Stafano? Did he tell Stafano he killed his first wife and did Stefano make a statement to police about that eventually? And then recant that at Salvatore\u2019s trial? Was he really married to someone who left him twice, each time lining up with a murder?\nThere seems to be a strong commentary about the homophobic, machismo, sexist culture at that place and time having fostered the misogyny of this psychopath. Almost like he learned from his father but also everything around him that he must dominate the women around him in order to be able to have relationships with men. As though women were such a threat to him that he hated them, murdered them and literally excised what made them female. The fact that his victims were  heterosexual couples having sex (except the one where they say one of the men was probably mistaken for a woman), further suggests that his motivation was borne of distain for a culture that accepted hetero sex and rejected gay sex. \nIt felt like a really strong assertion of that narrative to me but I wonder how much of it is actually true.",
