My only theory is this is an example of Netflix shows beginning to write for \u201csecond screen viewing\u201d knowing that a lot of people watch shows when on their phone so they have the characters say unnecessary dialogue to explain what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of that in the first episode alone. But the actors also seem to be getting zero direction and not knowing what to bring to their roles. It\u2019s very weird.  ",

What was with all the \u201cmurder\u201d supplies she got Richard to buy\n6. Jack said Alice showed signs of dementia during the year Anna left. Was she premeditating that far in advance?\n\nFinally, how am I supposed to believe an old woman is capable of pulling off gruesome murders that require lots of physical strength as noted in one episode\u2026 I mean 40 stab wounds? Also, how did she get the friendship bracelets? Did Anna have them in her box I.e do we assume they all gave them back to her?\n\nWhat was the side story about the blackmail In Rachel\u2019s phone when it came to their weird shit with Duffie?\n\nLazy ending and the show had more potential.",

        "content": "Idk what happened, i never messed with the settings at all since i started using the app, but for some apparent reason it seems like my brightness is locked at around 70-80% brightness? Everytime i mess with the brightness and move it up and down it seems like theres no difference between 70-100. On my PC it works fine but not for my phone, im using an S24 FE if that helps.\n\nThanks in advance!",
