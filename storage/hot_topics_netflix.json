I never had to change it, and other shows would even have the same setting. I have rarely had to touch the language settings after that. \nRecently, I began watching a new show and found that it would be dubbed automatically no matter how many times I change it. The next episode plays and it's back to dub. Is there something that I can do to ensure that the sub will be the default option on every show? I watch all shows in all languages with subtitles as I have trouble understanding just audio, even in languages that I speak, and it's quite annoying if this is something I'm going to have to constantly do for every episode. Any tips or if anyone knows if this is a new thing netflix does? Thanks!",

        "content": "So an update came out that changed the application to an Edge browser window for both Windows and Xbox consoles. And I have also tested that the old version of the application now has a communication block with the server and behaves as if there is no internet.\n\nWhich is quite funny timing because there is more and more talk about ARM processors for PC, x86-64 are getting energy-efficient cores, a new Win Handheld is announced every year, even Xbox announced its own, and overall it seems that Windows core devices will become more and more mobile.\n\nI am seriously interested in whether movie services like Netflix will ignore this.",
