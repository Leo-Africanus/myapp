The film\u2019s strength lies in its authenticity; every laugh, heartbreak, and quiet moment feels genuine, drawing you into their world. It serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting and impactful those youthful adventures can be.\n\nI really miss road movies like this, where a group of friends embarks on a journey to discover something meaningful.\n\nWhat did you think about this movie? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and feelings after watching it!\n\nAlso, if you have any recommendations for similar movies, please share them below!",

The whole thing about millions of fake accounts being created under people\u2019s names without their knowledge was wild enough, but what got me was how little control regular people had over their own personal information once it was in the system. It makes me think about it, are our systems really that vulnerable nowadays that something like this can just happen to anyone? We spend so much time being told to make stronger passwords and enable 2FA, but if a bank or data broker already has your personal info in their system, what stops it from being misused?",
