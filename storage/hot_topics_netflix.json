They have two **beautiful** films that deserve more eyes and they are not prioritized at all. Instead I get The Circle and whatever other drivel is on there. \n\nMaybe my algorithm (from a sparsely used account) caused it to be buried. Is this the case for anyone else?",

Having his wife appear from inside - it\u2019s like they\u2019re doing everything they can to throw him off his game. This is incredibly anxiety inducing as it is, and it\u2019s like the production team have instructed certain behaviours to make it borderline unbearable. It just feels so performative which is not what his climbs are usually about. \n\nI get it\u2019s fun for the show, and looks cool, but the guy is climbing a skyscraper ffs. \nHe\u2019s doing enough to get you your views, please just let us watch him climb and PLEASE LET US HEAR HIM. I\u2019m so sick of the constant yapping from the panellists; it\u2019s like they\u2019ve been told not to come up for air. Stop doing weird commentary and playing these videos when he\u2019s talking, we want to hear his thoughts, his process, his funny quips. \n\nFeels really irresponsible of Netflix to allow this tbh; like the marvellousness of a free solo climb is just being made a mockery of tbh and this is a real person up there. A huge disservice to climbing, and to Alex. Props to him for absolutely giving the crowd what they\u2019re after though. Couldn\u2019t be me! \n",

Free Solo was an extension of that. When you are high up, you are looking for peace and to leave the heck of it all below you. What we got yesterday was the antithesis of peace. Elle Duncan, Mark Rober, etc., were named, but they were not needed; they don't understand the point of being Free. Sure, you hire these people, but nobody wants them. There is a reason Elle Duncan never worked out on ESPN. If Netflix wanted more respect, they could have gotten Will Smith, Jimmy Chin, Zac Efron, etc. to host. People who actually understand what Alex is doing, people who want to live in the moment and not make it this is my 9/11. This was unacceptable and a masterclass of complete disaster.\n\nObviously, a lot of first-timers in the comments are getting upset, but for somebody who has been watching Alex for a while, it's quite upsetting.",

The actresses in this limited series was amazing! The plot twists and production was so well done. \n\nI was so sad during many scenes (don't worry its not known as a sad show) but others I was smiling, for example when Mo-Mi had found her twin (later on mirrored in her daughter), similar experiences, being treated horrible your whole life because of appearance, and also having plastic surgery and living a life to pursue dreams of being a star, to feel accepted. \n\nALSO CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE GRANDMA ON GRANDMA BATTLE?!?!?!\n\nI have never been more invested in what happened next... I stayed up till 6AM finishing off the ending.\n\nEven though I may not relate as much to her situation, I have my own insecurities about my image, and that had made me so happy seeing a show diving into those themes while making it so comedic at the same time. \n\nI had found this series by a random TikTok with those AI voices narrating clips of episode 6, I couldn't help but think \"What a bad b\\*\\*\\*\\*\". \n\nIf you had a glance or two at the show, CLICK THAT BUTTON and watch it...

I know that the intro (opening credits) is in 16:9 aspect ratio which is occupying all the space, full screen. However, this one particular shot in the final epsiode at the timestamp of 9:14, the aspect ratio became 16:9.\n\nThe black bars on top and below are gone, it's like it went to imax but only full screen 16:9 ratio. Then at the timestamp of 9:19, the top black bar came back but the black bar below didn't until it reached at the timestamp of 9:22 where it all went back to 2:39:1 aspect ratio.\n\nIt's weird that this particular scene was missed in the editing post production or maybe there's a glitch or error that they forgot to fixed. I know some series were shot in different aspect and change it to make it feel like it does.\n\nI felt relieved when I saw that scene in a full screen mode since I'm expecting it to be full screen just like the opening credits, but yeah it was a fun observation.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
