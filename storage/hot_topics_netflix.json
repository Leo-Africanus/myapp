        "content": "As mentioned in the title, I just finished watching it, and I\u2019d say it was worth the wait.kind of. If you haven\u2019t seen the series yet I suggest skipping this  to avoid spoilers\n\nThat said, I\u2019m a bit disappointed. This season focused heavily on homosexual relationships. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s bad, but most of us want to see the main character\u2019s love story, not a side character creating drama in everyone else\u2019s love lives. The story was supposed to center around Kitty discovering more about her mom, which was why she went to KISS in the first place\n\nOn top of that, making Kitty bisexual felt like a misstep. It shifted the focus away from the original premise, leading to unnecessary fights and breakups that dominated the screen time. If you\u2019ve seen the show, you\u2019ll notice that more than half of the relationships are homosexual. It felt like the series lost sight of Kitty\u2019s journey and the charm of the original story\n\nWhat I did enjoy, however, was Kitty finding new love. I genuinely thought she\u2019d end up with the same person(Dae) from season 1, so that twist was refreshing. And seeing Margot and Peter from To All the Boys was so relieving(?) honestly, that was the main reason I watched this season\n\nOverall, I feel like the story doesn\u2019t completely wrap up, leaving me hoping for another season to tie up loose ends\n\n",

And what better way to keep you hanging with Kitty &amp; Min Ho! \n\nWhat was everybody else\u2019s thoughts? I also like how they had a lot of different storylines and situations going on between each character. It made it a lot less boring than a lot of other series like these. I\u2019m waiting for the next season of my life with the Walter boys for instance. That can\u2019t change very much though like this did!",

The way he calls her Covey, the way he saved her from making a fool out of herself to help her with her grandma, their dance, the hot tub scene, and them breathing each others air lol. The way they looked at each other wowoowowowow!!! They really did listen to their audience after season 1 and said let's give them the slow burn. MinHo sees through Kitty and loves her for her, and Kitty loves MinHo for who he is as well. The beauty shines from within is so true in this love and friendship thing they have going. I love them together. Peter Kavinsky guest appearance was so cute and the grandma family story is so touching too. Not MinHO being jealous of Pete like he likes to call him lol!!! They would be perfect brother in laws too!! I can't deal, I think they are both so cute! I loveeee &lt;3 Can't wait for season 3!! &lt;3 ",

        "content": "This is an informative post and update for those that watch Netflix on their Windows PCs. I'm writing this update since I've saw there were few other people experiencing this.\nPrecisely two weeks ago I discovered, out of the blue, that I wasn't able to watch Netflix in 4K/Dolby Vision anymore but only in 1080p SDR at max. After a lot of tampering and reinstalling drivers, apps and extensions (DV would always work outside of netflix) I've finally found the culprit: the current versions of Microsoft Edge.\nStrangely enough, DV/4K streaming are broken and don't seem to work in my system when using the normal version of Edge or the Netflix app (which is not a standalone app anymore but a wrapped version of the Netflix page in the browser).\n\n*Using Edge Dev (which is a stable development version) everything works as intended.* \n\nSo for the time being, I'd suggest to download that version and watch Netflix there. The Netflix app can only use the normal one but it's a workaround in the meantime that it will be updated. \n\nI hope this post of mine can help someone, ofc I dunno if my case can be applied to anyone but it's something at least, especially considering that Netflix/Microsoft customer supports were not useful to say the least.
