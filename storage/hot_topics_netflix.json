They were the only people there who seemed to genuinely care about one another and not have any wandering eyes, even when Freddie left the house Madison stayed loyal. \n\nAD and Ollie were not perfect due to Ollie\u2019s gross actions which definitely would have gone further if not being babysat by AD at the \u2018boys day\u2019. Despite them still being together, on the show alone I don't think they deserved it. Louis and Sandy were also terrible for obvious reasons and Daniel was showing early abusive behaviours towards poor Lucy - I genuinely have NO idea how they won or how people on that show saw that relationship going anywhere. \n\nBut my point stands, Madison and Freddie had the strongest connection - yes, including her \u2018crying\u2019 when Freddie went on his date. Crying is not always manipulation. She wasn't being treated well in the house by the others thanks to Cody\u2019s smear campaign on her, and being upset when someone you like is sent on a date is valid. I almost stopped watching after they lost that final \u2018competition\u2019 and was kicked out of the running to win. Such a disappointment. ",

        "content": "I am on Episode 4 of Season 1. Please no plot spoilers other than whether it gets better in your opinion or not.\n\n\nI really wanted to like it but I cannot get over how bad the writing is. I think it's a mixture of two things:\n\n\n1) It's very clearly a show for children, written with plenty of those comedic gags that only children find funny. This is in contrast to the way that Stranger Things was technically for children but managed to appeal to adults too, by avoiding really non-adult humour. Example from Wednesday: a character puking all of a sudden in someone's face. I can totally see a 8 year old finding this hilarious. Which is fair, but I thought it was also a show that adults would enjoy.\n\n2) The writers assume the viewer is either really dumb or has no memory, with the amount of repeating main facts/plot points in a very unnatural way. A lot of past plot is spelled out by the characters telling each other what happend (where they clearly know) so they the viewer can know, rather than what would be more natural, to imply it for the viewer to figure out.\n\nExample A (paraphrasing, but basically how it went down): Two characters meet after the years. \nCharacter 1: Remember when we met years ago\nCharacter 2: Yes I hid in the coffin during the funeral but I couldn't get out.\nCharacter 1: I found you and saved you in time.\n\nI mean, nobody talks like that about an event they both participated in.\n\n\nExample B.\n\nThere is this school ball called \"The Raven\" which characters talk about going to, from time to time.\nThen cut to a scene of a big ballroom and the school headmistress welcoming the guests saying \"Welcome to this year's raven!\"\nLike who talks like that?\nImagine showing up to your office Christmas party and the organiser saying \"Welcome to this year's Christmas party!\"\nIt's such a weird thing to say. Firstly, it's OBVIOUSLY \"this year's\" since it's happening now. Secondly everyone knows what party it is, that's why we came here.\n\nAdditionally, the characters *constantly* talk to themselves aloud when alone in rooms, to explain what they are thinking of what they are going to do. \n\nLike ok, sometimes people talk to themselves but in this show every character does it in every scene they are alone. It is sooo weird and unnatural",

        "content": "I'm old enough to remember the controversy surrounding \"Fritz the Cat.\" \"Fixed\" is essentially the dog version. If you wouldn't let your children watch \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" with their Saturday morning breakfast, you best hide the clicker so they don't turn on \"Fixed\" in the hope of watching a cartoon about a cute doggy. This is X-rated raunch from beginning to end. \n\nEdit: There should be a warning on the catalog page that has links to the film and additional information. The warning should be something like \"Warning: This cartoon is inappropriate for viewing. Unless you're extremely high or you enjoy looking at dogs' genitals, avoid watching this cartoon unless you want to be offended.\"",
