I understand why it's so successful. I think it's meant to be watched back-to-back without waiting two years between seasons. It's not the same! And during season 5, I really felt something. It's off to a great start!\n\nIn any case, I've rarely seen people satisfied with the ending of a popular masterpiece. Whether it's a series or an anime, people are always disappointed with the ending. It's not easy to conclude a long adventure and satisfy everyone.",

        "content": "I watched Members Only: Palm Beach and the whole time I had a very odd feeling, like something was off. Visually everything checks out: luxury cars, massive mansions, yachts, ocean views, etc.\n\nAt the same time, the people in the show feel strange. The outfits look cringe and overloaded, kinda Chinese market-style. The overall vibe comes off as kitschy. In Europe this aesthetic disappeared a long time ago. In Italy if someone dressed like this showed up at a high-end event here, the reaction would be\u2026 complicated. Real wealth here usually shows through restraint, quality, and taste. Loud luxury feels outdated by decades.\n\nBecause of that, the show feels staged. Expensive scenery, dramatic behavior, exaggerated styling.\n\nAmericans, is this an accurate reflection of how wealthy elites in the US actually look and behave, especially in places like Palm Beach? Or is this more of a dressed-up TV version made for drama?",

        "content": "I\u2019m just here to hate for a second and just see what everyone thinks. I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

I turned it off twenty minutes in without cracking as much as a smile.\n\nEdit: Some of y'all are so far up Dave Chappelle's ass that you're sending me Reddit Care alerts.

        "title": "Questions about Stranger Things",
        "content": "1. Why does Vecna need to open four gates in Season 4, but then in Season 5 he changes his plan and needs twelve children instead?\n\n2. Why does Vecna need twelve children on his side to bring the Abyss to Earth?\n\n3. Why does Vecna wait years before acting directly?\n\n4. Why, in the Abyss during the final showdown, are there no other creatures present (demogorgons, demodogs, demobats, etc.) besides the Mind Flayer? Did they join him spontaneously (as if that were a good strategy\u2026)? Were they all in the Upside Down? Were they all dead? Who knows!\n\n5. Why is Mike\u2019s mother able to move freely around the hospital with a gas tank and hide it inside one of the dryers without any demogorgon noticing?\n\n6. Why do the military, once they become aware of the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan, do nothing to stop it?\n\n7. Why does Vecna, once he learns about the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan (through Kali\u2019s memories), do nothing to stop it?\n\n8. Why, inside Henry\u2019s mind, does Holly need to pull out the \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d move, with binoculars?\n\n9. Why, once Eleven disappears, do the military decide to abandon the town and all the protagonists as if nothing had happened? Nancy and Hopper should end up in prison for at least manslaughter. Instead, Hopper regains his job as sheriff and even considers a career advancement.\n\n10. Why is a huge creature like the Mind Flayer unable to kill the protagonists in the final battle (with legs as big as an apartment building, which everyone easily dodges with a somersault)? And how do the protagonists manage to climb to the top of a canyon so quickly?\n\n11. Why, all of a sudden, can everyone enter and exit the Upside Down without needing an oxygen mask anymore?\n\n12. Why isn\u2019t Max blind after coming out of her coma?\n\n13. Why is Joyce involved in extremely dangerous missions and plans, despite often having no real active role and providing no significant contribution?\n\n14. Why do the characters think it\u2019s a good idea to stop and talk and deepen their relationships in the middle of very intense action scenes?\n\n15. Why do gravity, air, sound, etc. work normally in the Abyss just like on Earth? Very convenient for playing \u201cspace explorers\u201d!\n\n16. Why is Vecna able to activate long-distance mind control over Hopper?\n\n17. Why does Vecna kill following \u201critualistic\u201d patterns instead of attacking en masse?\n\n18. Why is Eleven able to defeat 001 as a child but not as an adult (at least initially)?\n\n19. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna kill Eleven immediately when he has the chance?\n\n20. Why are Jonathan and Nancy not even slightly injured by the slimy substance that forms after they attack the shield generator?\n\n21. Why does Henry receive an interdimensional stone with black dust and turn into a murderous madman?\n\n22. Why does the Mind Flayer change form and strategy every season? If his goal is to infest Earth, he had countless opportunities to do so (and couldn\u2019t he have the demogorgons carry stones with black dust to possess other people, as he did with Henry)?\n\n23. Why does no one in Hawkins, besides the protagonists, wonder what is happening? No one comes up with conspiracy theories?\n\n24. Why does no one outside Hawkins take an interest in this town? Does no one have friends or relatives outside the city? What is the government doing? No external journalists investigate?\n\n25. Why do a bunch of kids always manage to figure everything out before scientists and the military?\n\n26. Why do parents tolerate such prolonged absences and/or so easily accept absurd or incomplete explanations?\n\n27. Why is the Abyss \u201cfrozen\u201d on the day Will disappeared?\n\n28. Why does Will, despite having survived, attract no interest from the military? (There must be surveillance footage showing him fighting off demogorgons.)\n\n29. Why don\u2019t the demogorgons in the laundry room hear the music Lucas plays to save Max?\n\n30. Why does no one seem to notice the gigantic walls surrounding the Upside Down before Season 5? Excluding Dr. Brenner\u2014judging by the notes he wrote and then forgot in the Upside Down lab\u2014when did he produce them? And why is there no trace of this information in the real Hawkins lab?\n\n31. Why is Eleven even capable of generating wormholes? It has been confirmed that she accidentally created the Upside Down in 1983.\n\n32. Why is Eleven able to hurl people into other dimensions? She is the one who threw Henry/001 into Dimension X / the Abyss.\n\n33. Who or what created the shield generator in the lab that keeps the Upside Down intact? Was it Eleven when she created the bridge?\n\n34. Why is Dimension X / the Abyss the only dimension trying to interfere with Hawkins?\n\n35. Why is Suzie no longer mentioned? Why aren\u2019t Robin and Vickie included in the finale? Why are unresolved subplots left hanging?\n\n36. Why does the fate of characters like Dr. Kay remain ambiguous?\n\n37. Why does Nancy suddenly appear skilled with weapons, without any explanation or prior training?\n\n38. Why do demogorgons switch from being intelligent predators to almost stupid monsters, depending on the circumstances and the characters involved in a given scene?\n\n39. Why do the disappearance of dozens of people, numerous deaths, and the presence of giant monsters not lead to serious investigations or intervention by the press or the FBI?\n\n40. Why, in Season 5, do the vines no longer have any significance, when up until Season 4 simply touching them disturbed the hive mind?\n\n41. Why do the characters constantly seem on the verge of death but then survive (after a few seconds, a few episodes, or from one season to the next: Hopper, Nancy and Jonathan, Steve, Eleven)?\n\n42. Why did Vecna specifically take control of Will in Season 1 and not other kids?\n\n43. Why does the wormhole show only Hawkins in the Upside Down?\n\n44. Why do the Russians disappear entirely? Why do they no longer spy on operations in Hawkins, considering that even kids manage to do so with the help of a high school physics teacher?\n\n45. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna maintain a constant army, and why doesn\u2019t he fully exploit it?\n\n46. Why is Max able to graduate despite having missed almost two years of school?\n\n47. Why do Joyce and Hopper never talk about Henry, even though they went to school with him?\n\n48. Why does every season have to \u201creset\u201d the world as if nothing had happened before?\n\n49. Why is Vecna not mentioned at all in the early seasons?\n\n50. Why does this series handle certain narrative turning points in such a sloppy way (\"good enough, let\u2019s go!\")?\n\n",

The only good thing is that each subsequent show was much better than the last (I liked AIB3 and ST5- would rate them 6 and 7-8/10 respectively). In fact, it seemed like they left out crucial plot points on purpose just to milk them out further- Squid Game and AIB USA.  The lack of Junho and Inho\u2019s development. Mind Flayer only being revealed to possess Henry on the last episode + reveal of spin-offs shortly after.",

A lot of new shows feel rushed or forgettable, even if the idea sounds good on paper. I still watch Netflix, but the excitement isn\u2019t the same.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, or do you think the quality really changed?

        "title": "Stranger Things 5: My (Hot) Take (spoiler alert)",
        "content": "Like many of you, I was left with complicated feelings after the long-awaited finale of Stranger Things. Not only is it the end of an era, a decade-long series that helped usher many of us through difficult moments in our lives, but there\u2019s also something about that finale that was not satisfactory. I\u2019ve thought about it consistently since watching the finale, and there are a few elements my thoughts boil down to: playing it safe (plot armor), too much death-teasing, and a rushed final confrontation. Playing it safe and death-teasing go hand in hand. It\u2019s not that I wanted a main character to die; I just didn\u2019t want to see the plot bending to ensure their survival. As a viewer, I don\u2019t need to be coddled; I need to be trusted to endure the danger and loss the story demands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll start with Karen. I loved Karen\u2019s confrontation with the Demogorgon, from her bravery with the wine bottle to being struck down, it made sense, and it had a great emotional impact that is doubled when Nancy arrives to find her mother blood-soaked on the ground. To our relief, Karen survives and even returns to kick Demo-butt one last time in the hospital despite her severe injuries, when Lucas, Max, Robin, and Vickie are in trouble. I can suspend my disbelief here, but I won\u2019t deny that I was enticed by the possibility of Karen dying because of what it would mean for Nancy and Mike. The loss of their mother would be an interesting emotional obstacle that could\u2019ve made the stakes higher (they\u2019ve lost their mother, they can\u2019t lose their sister too) and their journey more challenging. However, this would make Nancy the new matriarch of the family, thus trapping her in the domestic role she\u2019s never wanted. Nancy would likely stay in Hawkins to care for Holly and miss out on her independent and unconventional life, which is what she wants. So, I understand the decision to keep Mrs. Wheeler alive from a writing and characterization perspective. The problem arises as the season progresses and we continue to experience close calls, each one diminishing the impact of the previous one. When characters are consistently placed at death\u2019s door only to be saved, danger doesn\u2019t feel like danger anymore; it\u2019s like the illusion of danger to ensure excitement without consequence. There are few consequences to major dangerous actions, which leads me to my next death-tease: \n\n\n\nNancy and Jonathan trapped in what I\u2019m calling the slime room.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Nancy shoots what she thinks is a shield generator, but is actually exotic matter holding the walls of the Upside Down together, her and Jonathan are knocked unconscious. The ground beneath them melts, and they fall into a room where the levels of melted material are quickly rising. When they wake up and realize they may soon die, both confess their true feelings, acknowledging their shared love but also that their relationship has been over for a while. This was one of my favorite decisions in the season, having Nancy choose herself, not Jonathan or Steve; this is consistent with her characterization and a beautiful reflection of how some relationships fizzle out without any specific cause. With this resolved, they can at least die in peace. But then, suddenly, Nancy notices the building has stopped melting and that the slime has stopped rising and has solidified; they're saved! Why did everything stop melting, and why did everything solidify? We don\u2019t know, we just have to accept it. To me, this is the plot bending to ensure the survival of two important characters. After Nancy and Jonathan got out of this so easily, I figured no one important would be in any serious danger because either the plot or another character would rush in to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is applicable to Eleven\u2019s ambiguous ending. Instead of allowing the audience to sit with her sacrifice and loss, the Duffer Brothers, using Mike, give us an alternate ending for Eleven that seems just plausible enough to give viewers hope that Eleven could be alive somewhere. I\u2019ve heard convincing arguments for Eleven\u2019s survival and death; there is evidence to support both. The theory of Eleven surviving depends on Kali having lived long enough after being shot to create the illusion of El vanishing with the Upside Down. The theory of Eleven dying rests on our assumption that Kali is already dead when Hopper finds her and Eleven. There is also the \u201ckryptonite\u201d to consider, which is active when Eleven pulls Mike into her head for their final goodbye; another possible indicator of Eleven staging her death. Regardless, I don\u2019t think whether Eleven died is important; what matters is that she\u2019s gone for good. I agree with the Duffer Brothers that Eleven had to go to end this story. \u00a0If she\u2019s alive in a remote town with two, not three, waterfalls (make of that what you will), I consider this a great ending for her character. Yes, she\u2019s forced to never see her chosen family again, but she gets the one thing she\u2019s never had and has always craved: freedom, which can only come with a fresh start away from everything tied to her trauma. If she\u2019s dead, that\u2019s satisfactory as well; she created the Upside Down, so she goes down with it, genuinely ensuring the whole debacle can never happen again, because, let\u2019s be honest, as long as she\u2019s alive, there is a risk that it can start all over again. The important thing is, and I applaud the Duffer Brothers for this, that Eleven is gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d like to discuss is the final confrontation between the gang and Vecna and the Mind Flayer; it was too easy, considering the build-up. There are some snafus and death-teases, namely Eleven \u201cgetting shot\u201d by Hopper and Steve almost falling off the radio tower, but as mentioned before, these had no impact in creating tension because, at this point, I had been conditioned to characters surviving every brush with death; the true surprise would\u2019ve been to kill one of their darlings, unequivocally. The placement of these death-teases also made me assume they were just that, a tease. Steve dangles off the tower in the first 25 minutes of a two-hour episode, and Hopper is tricked by Vecna into supposedly shooting Eleven in the tank within the first 35. My immediate thought was \u201cthey\u2019re not dying this soon,\u201d and I was right. \u00a0\n\n\n\nNonetheless, I did enjoy the finale and agree that, regardless of the form it took, Eleven had to leave in order for this story to end properly. As she says to Mike, it\u2019ll never end as long as she is there . . . unless she loses her powers for good? Just kidding, just kidding. Dr. Kay and others like her and Papa would\u2019ve probably kept experimenting on her anyway, trying to bring them back. Speaking of the military/government presence, I don't believe we've seen the last of them. Hopper's line about taking the position of Chief of Police in Montauk, New York is enough for me to believe there will be a spin-off series that delves deeper into what inspired ST and that will carry the original title of ST, Montauk.",
