Everyone talks about the Tylenol poisonings but the way the doc weaves in Ray's disappearance from 1978 is seriously haunting.\n\nHe was this retired truck driver who knew James Lewis and then just\u2026 vanished. What they eventually found in his house is wild. And the connection to Lewis is super sketchy.\n\nHonestly feels like this should\u2019ve raised way more red flags back then. Makes the Tylenol case even creepier in hindsight.\n\nAnyone else still thinking about that part? Curious what others make of it, coincidence or something bigger?",

The last scene shows Janiyah in the bank with the bank manager, and finally the FBI have turned her phone back on. She receives a call from her mother who is at home and the FBI are with her. She proceeds to tell Janiyah that her daughter has passed away. \n\nThis is followed by a series of what I assumed were flashbacks, but could have been hallucinations showing that she went to the school (because they asked her to come in) but the teacher tells her they didn\u2019t call her. She then turns to look for her daughter and the hallway is empty with no sign of her daughter. (Was that real or hallucination?!) \n\nAlso she turns to the bank manager to tell her the news, and the bank manager says she already knew because she had been informed earlier. \n\nSo my questions are; did Janiyah\u2019s daughter die a while back, hence causing her break down and the narrative about the school calling her in/ lunch money etc was a hallucination? Was the bank manager just playing along when she agreed to look after her daughter (in the event that Janiyah goes to jail)? \n\nOr did Janiyah\u2019s daughter actually die the night before the hold up at the bank, and losing her job etc etc\u2026  and she was not aware until that moment? \n\nJaniyah also hallucinates that the FBI throw a bomb into the bank and surround her and shoot her to death. But then back in reality she walks out with the bank manager in a state of trauma. \n\nThoughts? :-) any other views \u2026 ? ",
