        "content": "But I can't deny the criticisms are justified.\n\nFor starter's, the \"too many main character's\" critcism 100% becomes clear in this episode. WHY are we now making Holly Wheeler a major character? Girl was like 3-4 in the first season but now she's been clearly aged up to be a part to be part of the main cast. It almost feels like there was no point of her and Max's story since she ended up getting caught anyways.\n\nAnd the lack of stakes, holy cow are they embarassing. \"Its gonna be a dark Christmas\" says the Duffers. \"Episodes 6 and 7 are emotional and always make us cry!\" meanwhile, not a single relevant character has died. \"But its not Games of Thrones\" I'm fine with no main character dying but the Nancy and Mike's parents surviving is just the icing on the cake. Ted has done NOTHING all season, he honestly could've just died and nothing would change.\n\nIts pretty cheap how they honestly do the same tatic every single season. Introduce likable character (Bob, Alexei, Eddie). Get th audience attached to them. Kill them in emotional scene. \n\nAnd the way how the Duffers need to come in confirming everything is so much worse. \"Yes, that was actually a break-up scene between Nancy and Jonathan\". \"Yes, that was actually Will coming out and Mike knew he was his crush\". Like the writing shouldn't leave this needing to be clarified.\n\nAnd what's the point of The Shadow Play and making Vecna \"actually a victim of the Mind Flayer, who's the real big bad\" and then the Mind Flayer doesn't even make a single apperance or do anyhting throughout the season? The ending for episode 8 of season actually had me tense and nervous. The ending for episode 7 of this season had no such reation from me.",

Hell I even was on board when they added Psycho as a sort of meta analysis he had on popular culture to add some filler to an otherwise short story. Then it kept going and going and going. It ends with a parody of Mindhunter, Richard Speck's man tits, and Gein catching Ted Bundy, Gein dying, seeing his mother in heaven, what felt like 95 ending scenes later some kids desecrate his grave and are chased off by the movie monsters he inspired, then finally ends on a flashback with his mom again.   More endings than The Return of The King. Absolute trash. ",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI want to raise an accessibility issue on Netflix. In Stranger Things Season 5, Episode 7, the Turkish audio description option is missing. I am a visually impaired viewer, and I have been watching the entire series with Turkish audio description from the beginning. Since all the previous episodes include it, this seems like a technical issue specific to this episode. However, the result is that I cannot follow this part of the story and I am forced to stop watching the series midway.\n\nAudio description is not an \u201cextra\u201d for visually impaired people, it is the only way we can access visual storytelling. Without audio description, key elements such as character actions, facial expressions, scene changes, and silent visual cues are completely lost. When even one episode is missing audio description, it breaks the entire narrative and creates a serious sense of inequality in access.\n\nI have already reported this issue to Netflix customer support, and I wanted to share it here as well because collective awareness really matters. If you would like to support this, submitting feedback to Netflix can make a real difference.\n\nI also want to emphasize something important: compared to many other streaming platforms, Netflix is by far the most attentive and inclusive when it comes to providing Turkish audio descriptions for visually impaired users. I genuinely appreciate this effort. That is exactly why I believe this issue does not reflect Netflix\u2019s usual standards and hope it will be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are willing to help, please consider sending feedback to Netflix requesting Turkish audio description for this episode. What may seem like a small detail is, for us, the only way to fully experience the story.\n\nThank you for reading and for your support.",
