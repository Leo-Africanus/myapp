She should have went to months of Spanish classes before doing this movie cus when she speaks Spanish it\u2019s like she\u2019s reading off the script word by word idk if I\u2019m explaining it right lol it\u2019s doing flow.\n\nThe musical part wasn\u2019t bad except the English musical part with the doctor it was weird overall i give it a 6.5/10 \nI think it should have been a mini series honestly ",

It centered around this character who lived in a perfect world with a sentient mountain and his monster friend. He then wakes up forward in time and the current world is ruled by an elephant dictator. The world sucks and his friend is working a boring job. He goes on an adventure to wake up the mountain and eventually ends up in a vampire night club. It was a weird series hope that info can help identify it. Thanks!",

Either have a rule that all first seasons have a closed story arc or give shows time to build viewership.\n\nGood example - dead boy detectives = I'm devastated there's no season 2, but it was a closed arc, all major ploy points resolved and I don't feel that netflix stole 8 hours of my life.\n\nBad example - the midnight club, or a whole bunch of others that I had on a watch list and then removed when I found out they were cancelled but left on a cliff hanger. I have no incentive to watch them now. \n\nAt least where there is a closed arc, I may still go and watch a cancelled show.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

She meets some other girl and they try to befriend each other. At some point in the show the girl goes to some meeting and finds out her mother never hugged her/ did the skin to skin contact move with her after birth and thinks that's why she is the way she is. Some of this may be wrong but it's driving me crazy. If anyone knows what this could be plz lmk ! Thanks in Advance ! ",
