        "content": "Alice in Borderland has some... pretty crazy plot armor. ESPECIALLY in season 2 episode 7, where we had Heiya straight up take a full mag of a machine gun and survive HOURS later (while funnily enough, Ann \"died\" from two shots).\n\nNiragi was by far the craziest example. Dude got lit on fire, fell off the building into the pool, tackled into a burning building, was coughing up blood all of seaosn 2 and then took a shotgun blast, ALL of which he survived.\n\nWhat I love so much is that the show ACTUALLY has an explination for such insane plot armor; the will to live. The Borderland's are a test of how much each character wants to survive (the games). The stronger your will, the more likely you are to live. That's why someone like Heiya can take so much punishment, because she's made it clear she does NOT intend to die\n\nIt makes moments when you're on rewatch hit different, like when Usagi tells Arisu in episode 2 \"I know I'll do anything to stay alive\".",

        "title": "Catch Me If You Can, would a Frank Abagnale style con work today or would tech stop it?",
        "content": "Just finished rewatching Catch Me If You Can and I keep getting stuck on how much of Abagnale\u2019s success relied on people trusting a confident story and paper records. He forges checks, pretends to be pilots and doctors, and basically wins on smooth talk, timing, and exploiting gaps in how institutions verified things back then. Looking at 2025, there are two clear directions. Modern banks, airlines, and employers have more automation, KYC checks, instant database lookups, and cross-referenced ID services that can flag fakes in seconds. A fake resume or a paper letter seems much harder to use to fool those systems. Digital trails and audit logs make it easier to trace and stop suspicious activity.  \n  \nBut there\u2019s also a huge amount of real personal data out there from breaches and data brokers, and that can be stitched together to build very believable identities. Deepfakes and AI can clone voices or make convincing video snippets. Human trust is still a major vulnerability: social engineering works because people rush, want to help, or assume an authority figure is legitimate. A modern operator could combine old-school charm with new tech  build an online persona first, then use carefully timed phone or in-person moves to close the deal. Some targets would be harder today and others are still shockingly soft. Big finance, enterprise HR, and major airlines are much tighter. Small hospitals, local businesses, and customer-support teams at smaller services often rely on phone calls and quick checks, which feels like low-hanging fruit. Logistics and delivery systems can also be manipulated if you know the right touchpoints.  \n  \nMy mental image of a 2025 Abagnale is someone who layers things: scraped data to bootstrap a backstory, polished social media and LinkedIn history, AI-generated voice clips for cold calls, and then a confident in-person moment where people fill in the blanks. Or it could be less theatrical and more distributed: exploit gaps in onboarding flows, trick CS systems, and collect many small wins across dozens of targets instead of one big caper.  \nWould a charismatic impersonator still pull it off today, or has tech made that kind of con obsolete? If someone tried something like this now, where would you expect them to succeed first and where would modern verification stop them quickly? Any examples of modern scams that felt like a Catch Me If You Can remake but for the internet age?",

Am glad I did as we both loved the show! \n\nThe  late 80s/early 90s setting feels so right for the show and what it's about (a school for wayward kids).\n\nYes it's light entertainment, and just so entertaining all the way through. So impressed that Mae Martin conceived the story, wrote it, produced it, directed it, was a co-show runner AND starred in Wayward. Incredible.\n\nI have rarely seen teenage girls depicted the coming-of-age way they are in Wayward. It's almost always boys who are given those kinds of roles, while the girls play the sensible roles and act as \"prizes\" for the boys once the boys either \"win\" or learn to tame themselves.\n\nAnd wonderful to have Mae playing the part of a trans man in a relationship with a woman, and it's just accepted without question in the show. I loved her in this. And then you have all the strong female roles in the show. Toni Collette is amazing (as always) as the one who runs the school.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I was skeptical after seeing the promotional photos and the fact that they seemed to depict Ed Gein in some sort of romantic scenario because I didn't ever remember that being part of the story, but man, was I way more disappointed than I had anticipated. Ryan Murphy has a tendency to bring a lot of camp to his work and jump the shark often, so in general I don't expect much from him. That being said, the Dahmer series was incredible. They told a 95% accurate story and it felt like they introduced creative liberties only when necessary (i.e. the glorious Niecy Nash) and they even found creative ways to show a different narrative, like the POV of Tony Hughes. I don't know why they didn't do that for the Ed Gein. I get that they wanted the audience to know how much of an impact his crimes had on the horror genre, but the whole thing was completely ham-fisted. Not to mention the mixture of fact (which allotted to about 5% of the show) and fiction adds confusion to what his influence actually was. Plus all of the jumping around was just confusing. My boyfriend doesn't even care about true crime and he hated it. \n\nI know some people liked it for the creative take on the story and that part of it reflected his mental state as he was doing these things, fine, but in my opinion it was TOO creative a take. The true story of Ed Gein is fascinating and horrifying enough without all of the liberties they took (damn you, Ian Brennan), and to me it was just a wasted opportunity to tell a good story. It definitely makes me hesitant to watch further Monsters.   \n  \nThat being said, Charlie did an amazing job. Yes, at times he sounded like the Abominable Snow-Rabbit from Looney Tunes, but overall he really stepped into the role. I just wish he had been able to showcase his talent with something more worthwhile. ",

        "content": "When Dahmer first came out I remember thinking wow this is probably one of the best limited series I\u2019ve watched (coming from someone who never knew who he was) and was not shocked when it won so many awards. Then by the end of the series with them teasing John Wayne gacy I was thrilled to see that this trilogy wasn\u2019t over and that another serial killer who this time I knew would be the next story they focus on. When the news was confirmed that the next season would be about the Menendez brothers who this time I knew a lot about I was kind of disappointed not because of them personally but because I think the Segway from Dahmer to JWG especially since they were active during the same time would have made an awesome season 2.  Why didn\u2019t Netflix decide to go ahead with JWG is beyond me. Now with season 3 being Ed gein, who mind you barely has any video or audio recording to base the series off with most of it being inaccurate and dramatised, has Netflix missed the potential to make a record breaking trilogy series beyond Dahmer? Especially considering already the ratings for Ed gein aren\u2019t merely as high as the Menendez brothers yet alone Dahmer. \n\nNow again, with the teasers for season 4 being Lizzie Borden? I mean seriously, Ed Geins evidence to base season 3 off was dry to nothing and now they want to focus on someone way before Ed geins time? I don\u2019t think the ratings will be going up anytime soon if they don\u2019t plan to start focusing on newer stories with some evidential backup. \n\n(Also when I say seasons I knew they\u2019re separate shows it\u2019s just to help the timeline ) \n",

        "content": "If you could pick the subject of the next Monster season, who would it be? And what makes it unique or fascinating enough for the eight episodes?\n\nI\u2019d love to see one on Jerry Sandusky, examine the Monster facet from that angle. Plus there are so many stories/perspectives that could be told alongside it for commentary: Aaron Fisher and his mom (self-identified victim and mother), the red-haired assistant whistleblower, Paterno, Dottie Sandusky.\n\nI have to admit I haven\u2019t enjoyed the most recent seasons of Monster but Dahmer remains some of the best television I\u2019ve ever seen. And all three have been great with their social commentary. I just wish Ryan Murphy was more interested in facts and less interested in shocking sex scenes. \n\n",

        "content": "As someone with Irish ancestry I came into this with a lot of hope to learn about apart of me I haven\u2019t got the chance to explore.. but House of Guinness quite literally just looks like Bridgerton in Ireland. It\u2019s full of stereotypes. \n\nTo kick it off, I loved Arthur\u2019s story line but it could have been expanded on a little bit more in a sexual sense. Like during that dual scene Benjamin and his love interest were full on doing THE DEED and then you see Arthur getting a blowie\u2026 \n\nit just isn\u2019t realistic, there was plenty of room to add more. Otherwise it just feels like *you\u2019re adding too many useless concepts you don\u2019t expand on. Especially when you only have 8 episodes.*\n\nFurthermore I feel as though Annie\u2019s character DEVELOPMENT could have been expanded on as well. Maybe flashbacks from her childhood or even simply more insight on her mental disorders not just \u201cthe doctors having a look\u201d *never speaks about it again*\n\nAnd Samuel could have easily been turned into an anti-hero or even one of the main antagonists because he was left on the side to deal with his debt and drinking issues with zero of his families fortune. \n\nPS: *These are all the negatives I really did enjoy the show but the take away is sometimes less is more and more is less. This is the issue with 8 episode seasons.*",

Apparently my gf loves her shows so much that I start to hear \u201eomg this and this show is soooo good you gonna love it, just trust me\u201c etc. \n\nSo I thought I\u2018ll give them a try again. \n\nI once watched The Walking dead back then, it was good but not that good that it motivated me to watch any more shows. \n\nThese are the shows I got recommended, let me know what you guys think I should start with:\n\n- mindhunter\n- dark \n- midnight mass\n- beef\n- the 100\n- black summer \n- Eternauta\n\nIf in your opinion there are better shows than what I got recommended let me know.
