I haven\u2019t binged something this fast in a while.\n\nAnyone else get Haunting of Hill House vibes but darker and more vicious? Curious if I should go for Midnight Mass next.\n\nWould love to hear your Flanagan rankings or any hidden gems on Netflix that are equally mind-blowing.\n",

(plus they look nothing like the saja boys if thats what they did look like bc they would look the same still, kinda like how jinu still has the same face and body as before and same hair!!) Abby, Romance, Mystery and Baby are all demons who Jinu turned into hot guys, they literally show us that. So idk whyyyy people are speculating that they are humans when they literally show them being turned into hot guys bc they were Ugly demons before. I just wanna say that bc i keep hearing ppl speculate they were human like no they show us they werent.",

        "content": "Think about a game that's like Hogwarts Legacy but it takes place at Nevermore Academy in the Wednesday universe. You could pick the power, gender and appearance of your character where the things you could do would be decided by your power.\n\nYou could have friendships and romantic relationships, you could date the other students/outcasts at Nevermore according to your gender preference.\n\nYou would be assigned your dorm hall, dorm and roommate which would be part of the games story. Your roommate would be the same as the gender yours so if you picked to be a guy your roommate would be a guy and it would be the same if you picked to be a girl, your roommate would be a girl. Your roommate would always be the same in the story every time you play the story so they could actually be part of the story.\n\nThe story would make sense with what happens in the show and would contain things from the show like the Poe Cup and The Nightshades.\n\nThe game would contain side quests where some of them would correlate to the power you chose.\n\nAfter the story is done you could walk around the campus and still do classes like learning about carnivorous plants and fencing. There would be extracurricular activities like choir or archery. You could still talk to NPC's after the story is over and make relationships with them.\n\nThe game would have other locations outside Nevermore like Jericho, The Weathervane, Crackstones Crypt or even the Gates family mansion.\n\nAfter The Wednesday Series ends I think this game could work, the only problems would be the amount of powers in Wednesday, the useless powers in Wednesday, the useful ones that become useless after the story ends like the visions or if the game would be possible after the Wednesday Series ends because we don't even know what will happen in the show but yet again the game could take place before the show takes place.\n\nSo yeah that was my game idea if Netflix would make a Nevermore game, I wanna hear your thoughts on it so feel free to comment anything or ask anything.",

The characters are terrible people. \n\nBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode. It\u2019s got everything a good summer binge should have for me. Like a trashy beach read. A mystery, sex, lies, and twists. It\u2019s a super fun romp. \n\nAlso: I see some comments stating that Brad and Jamie are underage, thus making some scenes uncomfortable. Idk about the book, but they are 18 years of age on the show. Still taboo because he is a student, but I did want to mention that. Malin did an interview on it recently. \n\nAll in all, if you want a quick and breezy watch with some bonkers moments, take a watch. ",
