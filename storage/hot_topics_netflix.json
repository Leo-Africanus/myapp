Her starting the relationship the entire time knowing others would think she slept with her boss to win. She just stayed on that and literally didn\u2019t do anything about it.

Then got mad/upset/freaking out at Phillips for getting the attending position when that\u2019s literally what he was trying for the entire time??? I don\u2019t know I just really didn\u2019t like her the entire time I watched this show \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI LOVED Camilla\u2019s and Sophie\u2019s arc though.
