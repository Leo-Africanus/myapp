        "content": "What\u2019s up r/netflix! I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

But going into Havoc, my expectations were reset, and I was ready to watch a mindless action movie. \n\nThe intro made me realize what I was in for: was I watching a movie or a video game intro? Everything looked fake, this is a movie that doesn't know how to act like a movie. And that's when Tom Hardy stepped in. An actor that isn't sure how a real human acts. \n\nYes, this movie is stylized and over the top. It's not trying to be realistic, but I think it's supposed to be a video game movie. From the hijacker's neon LED masks to the impossible camera action, this is a video game movie. \n\nBut at the heart is Hardy, whom I'd love to see him play an average Joe, who works as an electrician, but doesn't have a weird accent, a bizarre walk, or looks like he's acting. Because that's all I see now after Capone, Venom, and now Havoc: Tom Hardy is ACTING. But not like real human being. ",

        "title": "Race for the Crown",
        "content": "Heya!\n\nBinged the series last night and was pleasantly surprised with what I've watched. I am not into horse racing, and generally speaking, do not approve of gambling. That being said I approached the first episode with an open mindset and that if the first 10-20 minutes suck, then I'll just turn it off.\n\nIt started off a bit slow on the horses side and pretty fast on the glamour and glitz side, with lots of great personalities larger than life. The dapper jockey, the self-proclaimed race horse investor, the billionaire (there were a few actually) and a colorful and multi-national cast from the stables. Man, the show runners narrative building game was spot on! I felt like I was right there and then despite knowing nothing about horses, like I mentioned already.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much, so I'm gonna stop talking about what happened in the show, but will leave some notes to compare.\n\n- **Biggest surprise of the season**: Kenny McPeek. Whoa. What a man. What a rock. I did not expect to like him as much as I did by the end of the season. The way he was nonchalantly introduced and the part he played later was astonishing. Kudos to the show runners again.\n\n- **Biggest disappointment of the season**: Michael Iavarone and Frankie Dettori, not because they disappointed me, but because I was very disappointed along them as their endeavors didn't exactly go as planned. Michael grew on me, although the dude is all show.\n\n- **Katie Davis** was adorable. Watch her rip her heart out on camera. \n\n- **Umberto Rispoli** had the most normal/sane and lovely family and I just couldn't help but feel happy for them. It's nice to see someone doing it right in these *interesting* times.\n\n- **Michael Repole**... yeah.\n\n- **Dornoch's team** were so so great and genuine. Loved every single person in there, but especially Jayson Werth's crew (that's how I am referring to his family). I honestly didn't expect to see such a healthy and functional unit until I read that he and his wife go way back to highschool, which explains a lot.\n\nAs a conclusion, I think for me, this show is on par with Full Swing in terms of immersion into the sport, and Tiger King in terms of suspense (just don't look up the results for 2024) and character/narrative building. Really loved it and hoping to see season 2!",

Writing, production, acting, casting, costumes, what have you: it\u2019s all on point 90% of the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a gangsters/families, cops and robbers martial arts drama, with the various gangs being fictional, but still feeling plausible in its\u2019 historicity. I treat it as fiction, but made in imitation of real life, at least as far as the broad tensions and power dynamics of that place and time.\n\nThe writing is sharp, the characters are great portrayals of certain archetypes. The action is excellent and stylish. It\u2019s quality top to bottom. And it\u2019s a unique perspective.\n\nThe focus is the Chinese immigrant population of 19th century San Francisco, but also the Irish population and other ancillary forces such as nativist white supremacy, economics, existing political structures, culture barriers, space and resource limitations etc etc. \n\nIf you like historical fiction, martial arts, sopranos style gangster drama\u2026this is for you. \n",

        "content": "This year, I got back into rewatching a few old shows from Netflix only to realise that there was a new season of Black Mirror. That's weird I thought to myself cause Netflix usually would promote their shows leading up to the release. \n\nAnd now with You season 5 being released, I realised that Netflix hasn't done any promos for their old shows for a while for the past 2 years ? It's only a week after the season hits or some random Tiktoks that i would find out a show is coming up. What happened ? \n\nEdit: I just went through their trailers and like, this entire year is loaded with their highest viewership shows ? How are they not making a big deal out of this year being the year of Netflix coming back with their cult classic shows ? We have Sandman, Love, Death and Robots, Wednesday, as well as Stranger Things (although I did saw Stranger Things being announced this year BUT not because of Netflix bombarding it in my face). ",
