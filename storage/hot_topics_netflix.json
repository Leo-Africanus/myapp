She was pretty, fun, an amazing girl and available and liked him so they got together. When Gabby finally realized that she deserved better and got the courage to leave him, he lost it. Being rejected by the girl he liked and now by the girl that he was together with was the last straw. \nI don\u2019t think it was a \u201cif I can\u2019t have you no one can\u201d type of situation, I think he was getting his \u201crevenge\u201d because he was a sick person. \nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably wrong but this is just something that crossed my mind.\n\n",

Over Christmas when I was at her house, I used the method where I watch a show on my phone on her wifi and netflix account and then watch a show on the same account from my house on the same device. It worked and re-enabled netflix on my TV at my place.\n\nShe came to visit me for my birthday earlier this month and I had her use the same method (watch on her phone at her house, then connect to my wifi and watch on her phone at my house) to keep it working. However as of midnight today I am once again unable to access it on my wifi.\n\nDoes anyone know why this might be? She followed the same steps as me but it doesn't seem to have worked? This is already super annoying :(",

English remains the only option despite adding other languages in the settings.

I thought maybe it's just not available in the desired language so I tried Spanish but nothing was in Spanish either. I am almost certain that all these movies should have a Spanish dub. Not only is there no dub but also no subtitles in Spanish, only English. So something has to be wrong here I just don't know what. I tried deleting cookies and cache but that did nothing.

Maybe by removing that command somehow? I'd rather not have to reset all of my browser settings if I can avoid it. Thank you :)",
