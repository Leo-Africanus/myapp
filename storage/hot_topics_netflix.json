        "content": "This new season made me compelled to write this : I do hope he is a good person IRL, but wow, watching this show makes me feel really touched by the small gestures he does throughout the trips to these different countries. \n\nYes, the family connection is there with his wife, his kids, his brother, and previously his parents (RIP). He's been able to pivot to \"Jokes for Max\" in a really heartwarming way. \n\nBut there are two points I want to emphasize:\n\n1). How in recent seasons when he is traveling he is very conscious to discuss the societal issues and humanitarian efforts going on in all of these countries/cities. It might feel heavy handed at times, but it is the minimum he can do to raise awareness for good causes.\n\n2). How he treats the people he works with and the people he cares about. Almost always in each episode he has a scene where he's having the camera crew getting in on trying the food, too. He will typically treat the local fixers to meals which reinforces this as well. But most of all what I thought was touching this season were his personal stories with his dad's Filipino nurse and his Guatemalan nanny - how he went out of his way to honor them during these journeys. \n\nCombined to me shows someone who cares for his staff no matter how long you worked for him. Feeling like the Everybody Loves Raymond royalties are doing a bit of good in their afterlife. \n\nPhil if you see this, I love ya. \n\n",

        "title": "My overall thoughts on squid game s3 and why it didn't resonate with me",
        "content": "\n\nIt kinda felt off.\n\nFirst of all, Gi-hun killing Dae-ho made no sense, him not even regretting it and then going back to his \u201cI\u2019m not evil like them\u201d persona when he was tested on whether he would kill the other contestants before the final game. Like obviously, he is kinda like them. He just killed a dude who literally did nothing wrong and who was crying and saying \u201csorry\u201d. Literally killed him with his bare hands. Bye. And then he refuses to kill the front man or the other players before the final game (who are actually bad people and did commit clod blooded murder multiple times and were planning on killing a BABY). no instead he goes after the one guy who actually wanted to help him but physically and mentally couldn't anymore. I get that Gi Hun wasnt really in the right state of mind but them attempting to go back to: oh gi hun you're actually a good person your not evil and you have principles'?? Like no he doesn't, it just felt so hypocritical to me. \n\nThis show keeps killing every character, and too many characters too soon, where just the most useless characters were left (I\u2019m looking at you, Player 100). So the last episode didn't really have any high stakes in my opinion and didn't feel that intense. \n\n\nAlso, Player 333\u2014what happened there? I know he was a shitty person, and I was okay with exploring that side of him, but we never really got an explanation or build-up to why he\u2019s actually this psychotic, to the point that he was willing to sacrifice his own baby. Like what? That came out of nowhere?? Needed better writing so we could understand what was even happening.\n\nI liked Gi-hun\u2019s last words, but that\u2019s about it in terms of what I liked about the ending. So many things didn\u2019t make sense\u2014 Jun ho literally circling the island for what felt like an eternity just to shout \u201cWHY\u201d to his brother and watch him go up and down a platform (not gonna lie, that was kinda funny). Like what was the point of that storyline? I\u2019m just so confused. The Front Man is still out there thriving, but In ho just doesn\u2019t care anymore? Bro moved on\u2014maybe he got sea sick \n\nThe Front Man literally had no screen time and wasn\u2019t affected by ANYTHING that happened. He was just so nonchalant about it, like it\u2019s a regular workday (probably is). But like, come on, dude.\nAlso literally no confrontation between front man and Gi hun?? What was all that build up in s2 for? Why wasn't there any conversation? Gi Hun literally just walked it off lmao he wasn't even mad about the betrayal he was like alright fine bye. \n\nDo we really have any indication that the games actually stopped in South Korea? 'Cause I don\u2019t think so. The VIPs left unaffected. Sure, the whole place burned down, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from just finding another location or building it up again. We got no real indication that this was the end of the games in SK.\n\nGi-hun sacrificing himself for a CGI baby (okay\u2026). I get it\u2014this is supposed to feel realistic and mirror corruption in real life, etc.\u2014but it just didn\u2019t feel well-executed. The build-up was weird and disjointed. Players acted way too out of character, and it just didn\u2019t feel satisfying. It felt rushed, like they just flipped a light switch\u2014\u201cokay, games are over, moral of the story is corruption will always win, and bye.\u201d",

        "content": "I just want to throw this out there as someone who grew up dancing and performing since I was a child. And this is not to take any sides in this tragedy that had failed planning, logistics, security, contingency plans and destructive humans. I see a lot of people saying \"Travis Scott was on stage looking right at everything!\" \"He saw!\" \"He knew!\" Here are the facts: when you are on a stage with no lights (even when it's daytime), you cannot see or hear everything that is going on. You could be looking in one direction and someone in the audience will think you were looking right at them. But you don't see them. You can't make out their face or what they were wearing. You also cannot hear. All you hear is the music in your earpiece. \n\nWhen the two people went up to the cameraman to notify him, the concert should've stopped. Police should've had authority to stop it. When someone from Live Nation spoke directly to the engineer backstage and told him about the 4 active CPRs, the concert should've stopped. We watched this unfold in real time on Twitter and I knew it would be chaos when they were jumping the gates once doors opened. I am disappointed to see how much was left out of this documentary. Hopefully Prime Video, HBO or Hulu do a deeper dive (if the families agree to it). I know reliving this is traumatizing.\n\n  \nSpeaking on people in general, there was just a party here in NYC where the crowd pushed their way through security. One girl said her purse was snatched right off of her shoulder, others lost their shoes. It is possible\\* that tickets were over sold - I do not know. Security was not prepared for the chaos. But HUMANS, we HAVE to do a better job at how we treat others and how we conduct ourselves, ESPECIALLY at outdoor events. It is dangerous and it is so easy to get trampled, have a panic attack, asthma attack, heart attack, anything. One of the last music festivals that I went to was Made In America in 2013 and the worst parts were either the long food lines, the sun, or my back pain from standing. But thankfully I did not experience pushing or overcrowding. We have to do better with planning AND our behavior. \n\nI went to Utopia in December 2023, sat close to the stage and pit and it was surprisingly tame. If Travis Scott takes this as a lesson, prioritizes safety, no longer encourages wild behavior and makes sure his team has contingency plans (outside of Live Nation), hopefully the energy of his fans worldwide will calm down. \n\nRIP to those that were hurt, lost their lives and are grieving that experience.

        "content": "What sense does it make to discontinue airplay ?So I\u2019m trying to airplay a show on Netflix to my smart tv and it keeps giving me an error, but other apps like hbo seem to have no problem, Netflix gives me an error every time. So I googled the problem and it tells me Netflix doesn\u2019t support airplay anymore. Why is this even a thing, smart tv apps are junk and thanks to Netflix no longer updating their app on my tv it causes it to freeze and skip. ",

        "content": "I have been having issues for some time now watching WWE, where I end up having each show restart mid replay, it could be 30, 44, 120min in, but at some point the broadcast will start from the beginning again and it's only been happening for about a month now, even though the remaining time is showing as not being at the start of the timeline. Reinstalling the app doesn't seem to work and clearing all data doesn't do anything either.\n\nIt's stopping me from watching multiple segments, as it just replays the opening segment again. This is on android. Has anyone else encountered this?",

Like, they are not \u201cregular people trying to be funny because they will appear on tv\u201d, they are actors acting and  reciting scripted jokes like The Office or something.\n\nI realized that maybe it was a mockumentary, so I googled the ship and it really happened. So is this a comedy about a real life thing? Or it\u2019s a documentary but with actors playing the part of regular people that really were there?\n\nIt\u2019s awful because I feel like I can\u2019t enjoy it because it\u2019s not clear if I should be taking it up as a real story or as fiction.",

        "content": "Title. I noticed after seeing a few clips and thought itd be better after the official ones were released, but no. The biggest parts where I see it is the background 'rely on' when Jinu is singing \"i can be the star you rely on\" being much louder on youtube, and the other saja boys sound different during the bridge with the \"living in your mind now\" part. It also feels oddly like for youtube they made the instrumental a bit more quiet. Has anyone else noticed this? If not please compare it to when you actually see the scene in the movie or to the sountrack version!",

        "content": "I\u2019m sorry it felt there was like 3 deleted scenes that felt crucial. Like Rumi was saying maybe this isn\u2019t a world worth saving, but then legit the next scene of her she\u2019s full hero mode. And the film was making it seem like demons may be misunderstood. But the ending It made it seem like everything but jinu is just a monster. Wouldn\u2019t the rest of the boy band members probably be in the same boat? Or am I missing something? They didn\u2019t even explain how she\u2019s half demon. Which now the ending makes it seem like her father was pure evil?",
