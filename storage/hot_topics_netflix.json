The pupils not listening to teachers who are emotionally and physically absent towards all of the children plus the children's refusals to take part/ care about the lessons or authority at all. This is even shown after Jamies  dad confronts the teens who vandalised his car laughing at his genuine struggle and emotion. Jamies behaviour towards women such as the psychologist and his mum and his immediate switches in attitude towards any male figures. The obsessive lying such as about pickles, marshmallows and his small ways of putting the psychologist down like calling her old or being rude about her sandwich as well as his mum where he says shes good at nothing but cooking roast. the obsession with media shown through his isolation into his bedroom after receiving a gaming set up. its not explicitly said he was watch the red pill andrew tate type media however its inferred. the detective who cannot connect with his son in the slightest due to his isolation and even the detective (I believe) viewing him as less than (due to his former popularity and the son not being popular). the way real society has received this media as well many people denying Jamie did it after CCTV showed explicitly what happened or justifying it due to Katies \"bullying\" which was just calling Jamie out on his genuine misogynistic views towards katie and girls in general. Believing he's better than other men as he didn't SA katie even thought he \"had the chance\" and after his guilt was discovered he less regularly said \"i didn't do it\" but switches to \"i didn't do anything wrong\" showing his rationalisation of his actions due to his veiws on women. This show is amazing i've never seen anything so real and so accurate of our society ever. I could write an essay about this show and these are just SOME of the tiny details in the show that i missed at first but its crazly well written and has a scarily accurate depiction of the disheartening youth culture currently so well. \n",

        "content": "I know there\u2019s a lot of discussion on whether Katie was bullying Jamie, or was he calling him out on his behaviour and attitudes towards women. That\u2019s a whole other convo and one I\u2019ve had with a few people over the last few days but something that seems to have been overlooked a lot..\n\nIn the first episode when Jamie is being questioned by the cops, they show screenshots of the Instagram profile with the model and in the cop\u2019s own words, Jamie had left \u201caggressive\u201d comments on her photos. He\u2019d also reposted her photos on to his own insta account, meaning his classmates would\u2019ve seen it. \n\ntake away all the other factors (Katie having her n*des shared, Jamie\u2019s blatant terrible  attitudes towards women, him trying to \u2018get\u2019 Katie at her weakest) wouldn\u2019t just her seeing his aggressive comments be \u201cjustification\u201d enough for leaving the emojis on his photos? \n\nWould it be a mature way to handle the situation? No. But she\u2019s 13. And comments/ messaging on social media is their language. But I can\u2019t help but think if a kid had made openly racist or homophobic comments on someone\u2019s photos which was seen my a classmate, then said classmate posted some emojis reflecting this\u2026. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbullying\u201d it would be calling a spade a spade. ",

        "content": "In the second episode, DS Frank talks about how what messes with her is that after all is said and done, they\u2018re here for Jamie, and people will remember Jamie as opposed to Katie. I thought this was a great jab at true crime and the fascination with killers who gain some sort of almost celebrity status that lasts even way after they\u2018re dead, while their victims often fall into obscurity.\nAnd yet, didn\u2018t adolescence end up doing the same? It\u2018s another show about another killer who remains centred. We are again trying to understand the killer and trying to figure out why he did what he did. On the other hand, we only see pictures of Katie and get some scenes with her best friend, but we never see her family, we never see what Jamie\u2018s act did to them. We don\u2018t learn anything about Katie except that she called Jamie an incel, which again is about him. We don\u2018t know what she liked, what her childhood was like, what she was like as a person, what her hopes and dreams were. Another girl fading into obscurity.\n\nDon\u2018t get me wrong, it\u2018s an excellent show from the craftsmanship perspective. Those one shot episodes are wild, and it\u2018s so impressive from all the actors as well. I just thought it was interesting they brought up that point in the second episode just to then end up doing the same. I know Bascombe replies to this that they\u2018re there for Katie, to get justice for her, but I just don\u2018t fully buy it. They wanted the understanding of Jamie\u2018s understanding. \n\nI\u2018d be very curious to hear other people\u2018s opinion on this because I may have missed the point, but this is just my interpretation of it ",

They actually kinda reminded me of my family being just me (daughter) and my parents, they felt so real and relatable in a way. \n\nThe acting was phenomenal from all the actors, main and background characters. \n\nIt was a really gripping drama that honestly had me thinking quite deeply about a lot of stuff, which I love to do. The message behind it is so important and the fact that it\u2019s about such realistic topics makes me sad, but it\u2019s important that we\u2019re talking about these things.

Check out the soundtrack by Aaron May and David Ridley. Stephen Graham is a mad actor! The other actors have done a great job and the overall production is a beautiful piece of art. They shot entire episodes in a single take! \n\nThe finale of the episode will tug at your heart strings. You can't stop from feeling the dread of the family. Stephen really outdid himself in this episode, he better have an Emmy or at least a nomination. I nearly cried, he portrays the emotion in such a devastating way that you may have to look away. \n\nI found the series highly engrossing. It draws you in and let's you do the work of filling in the gaps as a viewer, really makes you think. Most Netflix shows have been mid for me for the past couple of years, I haven't loved a Netlix show as much as this one in a long while. Do give it a watch.\n",

        "content": "Just finished Castlevania and S2 of Nocturne. I loved Castlevania and pretty much every aspect of it from the plot, animation, action, characters, just everything. \n\nNocturne is a little disappointing this far. The plot doesn't really seem very cohesive and not as much time is spent on character development. My biggest gripe is everything involving Edouard. First off i was under the impression that soul forging took damned souls from hell and used dead bodies as a vessel to house them. But now apparently it's just the soul of the person who had the body? Not a fan of that. Also why on earth did no villains kill the night creature who betrayed them multiple times?? Ridiculous to keep him alive. Same with Drolta like it really ruins any death when they can just be brought back to live essentially perfectly themselves with no downside. I don't get why the Abbot didn't have control over them at all. \n\nThen there is the Abbot himself. What was his thought process? \"OH I should be the worst forgemaster ever and use demons to fight for god\" Then after everyone realizes that the Abbot is doing this they are just all to chill with that discovery. Father of my child or not I don't think I'm just chatting with him in my house after that. \n\nI also don't understand what Olrox was really doing there. He never seemed into the vampire messiah thing so why go there in the first place. \n\nFinally all the non main vampires crumbled like paper as well as the night creatures really. Then suddenly forest during the day=absolutely no sun reaches the ground and vampires get there safely somehow. \n\nThe animation, action scenes, and creature designs were top notch though. Let me know if others agree. ",

I\u2019m down for a thriller that keeps me on my toes or a drama that hits right in the feels. As long as it\u2019s a banger, I\u2019m in. Old, new, whatever, just gimme the good stuff. What are your go-to British series?",

        "content": "This was one of the best comedy series I've seen in quite some time. I hope all the actors get other acting jobs because they all did an amazing job.\nSanjiv Mehta was my favorite character. He was hilarious \nSucks that it got canceled because It leaves a lot of topics unresolved.\nLike did Janet's photography career ever take off or did Jung and Appa ever resolve their issues. Also, it never really gives a lot of detail as to why they didn't get along in the first place.\n",

        "content": "With the upcoming season five I decided to see if I could rewatch you.  I started watching season one, and what I\u2019m finding is that I don\u2019t like it as much as I liked it the first time. I mean, I really loved it\u2026 and also I didn\u2019t really see the dark humor in it the first time and not really sure why\u2026 but anyway, it just was not as interesting to me in a huge way, as it was the first time. I mean, Beck was an insufferable character, the first time around, and this time more so. The whole show just bothered me, but I kept waiting for it to get better for me. Mostly it was just funnier, but also something I didn\u2019t want to commit my time too. I made it to season two, and then oh yeah, I remembered \u2013 even though  i still liked the show \u2013 I remembered how much I was starting to dislike it the first time around! With all of this said, I\u2019m disappointed on how I feel about the show \u2013 I mean, as I said, I really liked it that first time! Who was I? I\u2019m also remembering season four and the first time around with that. I really didn\u2019t like it \u2013 all the characters bugged the crap out of me. Even so I\u2019m still curious about season five, and curious about other thoughts on this as well!   Edit: talk texting mistake \u2013 so sorry! I\u2019m referring to the TV show, \u201cYou\u201d!!! And even since I posted this, I\u2019m really on the fence about the show \u2013 I\u2019m still questioning on what I liked about it in the first place \u2013 just not sure\u2026\n\n",

Cupp complaining about the male majority in the house  was pretty obvious and then the senator offering to abolish all education made me chuckle. ",

Here\u2019s what I remember:\n\n* The show was **3D animated**.\n* The main characters were **short adults**, kind of like action hero types (they wore vests like Rex Dangervest from *The Lego Movie 2*).\n* The humor was **gross-out** (think boogers, poop, slime, that kind of thing).\n* They didn\u2019t really act as detectives, but they fought **gross creatures**, like weird, nasty monsters or creatures made of slime and other gross stuff.\n* The tone was **funny and over-the-top gross**, not serious at all.\n* I\u2019m almost positive it was on **Netflix**, and it aired around **2017 or 2018**.",
