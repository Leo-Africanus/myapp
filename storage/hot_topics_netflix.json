        "content": "I don't feel like this show gets talked about enough, it's honestly one of my favorite sci-fi/futuristic offerings on the platform. I enjoy every storyline, which I can't say about a lot of shows where each character is off doing their own thing. They really managed to connect everything in a way that I found satisfying. And while it has a pretty run-of-the-mill take on life in the future, with some sillier elements like transparent smart phones, I do like that it takes place in the NEAR future (2029,) as opposed to 2058 or 2082 or something like that. And you can't mention Better Than Us without mentioning Arisa, the main character of the show who, despite being a robot, ends up being one of the most likeable and emotionally complex characters out of everyone.  \n  \nI'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're into sci-fi or robots. The story is definitely more of a slow burn, so if that isn't your thing you may not like it. There was never a season 2 unfortunately (but the first season has quite a few episodes). I heard something about another company renewing it for a second season but I'm not sure if anything ever came of that.",
