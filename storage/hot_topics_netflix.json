They canceled it, apparently because they couldn\u2019t afford it, even though the show brought in huge viewership numbers. Make it make sense. So many unresolved storylines, it felt like they just walked off set mid-scene. I genuinely hope now that Netflix has picked it up, a 4th season is in the works. It deserves one. We deserve one. I\u2019m honestly kind of mad about it.\n\nNow maybe this is a dumb question, but it\u2019s been bugging me: why did the show seem more focused on who killed Jorge  than on Frankie himself\u2014who, let\u2019s be real, was a full-blown murderer? He\u2019s out of prison again and somehow they still couldn\u2019t charge him with anything? That was beyond frustrating. I get that the writers probably wanted to push Ray to kill him in the end, but still\u2014it felt like everyone was just shrugging off Frankie\u2019s entire rap sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s such a great show, but man, that ending left me with more questions than closure.",

        "title": "The Residence could had been much better!!",
        "content": "I binge-watched *The Residence* last night\u2014well, kind of binge-watched. I went through episodes 1\u20134 and then skipped straight to the final episode (I'll explain why in a bit).\n\nThe first episode setup was great: a murder in the White House during a chaotic state dinner, and the best detective is brought in to solve the case. With so many characters, each with different responsibilities and motives, the plot seemed like it had potential for some interesting twists.\n\nBut as I watched the next few episodes, there were a few things I couldn't get out of my head:\n\n1. There\u2019s a subtle jabs from Mrs. Cupps about how it\u2019s all men everywhere, etc throughout. I enjoy watching shows and movies with strong female characters\u2014but lines like that feel like they\u2019re just pandering to the audience. Minor thing, but it stood out.\n2. The obsession with birds. I get that someone can be fixated on certain things (I am too), but there\u2019s a bird analogy for *everything*. For every new discovery, there is a bird analogy being made. I mean after a while, it started feeling more like a way to stretch out the runtime than meaningful symbolism.\n3. Pacing. This is my biggest gripe. Things really dragged. Honestly, after episode 4, I jumped straight to the final episode\u2014and I still understood what happened and how the investigation played out, since it all gets recapped in that last 1.5-hour episode.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll say this: the characters and the subtle humor were genuinely great. But if the pacing had been tighter, and each episode trimmed down to around 30\u201340 minutes, the whole 8-episode series would\u2019ve felt a lot more coherent and engaging.   \n  \nEdit: Surprised it got Emmy nomination.",

But today, we're both experiencing the weirdest thing. I tried to create a session, but the link is noticeably shorter than usual and doesn't include the show title in it. I thought that would be fine, but when she opened the link, it just played on its own and refuses to sync. Then she tried to create the session, but the same thing happened to her too.\n\nIt's so weird because it shows in the chat log whenever one of us joins or pauses/plays and whatnot, but it's playing two separate instances. If I play, it's still paused for her, and vice versa. It's refusing to sync, and this has never happened before until today. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a possible fix, or maybe it'll just randomly fix itself after a time? Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people in the replies experiencing the same thing, so hopefully they fix it soon.",

This one started out strong, the first 30-45 minutes were pretty good, and happy is still a really funny character, but then it completely fell off. For some reason they decided to bring back every single side character from the original and redo every single joke and gag. Some parts of it feel like a remake and I really didn\u2019t like how they kept playing clips from the original. On top of that the villains and the ending were really stupid. I\u2019d probably rate this movie a 5/10, but that\u2019s just my opinion I guess.",

But maybe Rumi can finish her mom's work and figure out how all demons can have a chance at getting their souls back and being free. It would be cool for a sequel to do that kind of \"moral circle expansion\" where people realize that some demons should have a chance too.

        "content": "I just resubscribed to Netflix for the first time in a year. Whenever I am browsing the app on my iPad, audio clips of various shows (this appears to be shows that are in My List) will randomly play. There is no video to go along with the audio, and the audio is completely unrelated to anything on the screen. I\u2019m not sure if this is a bug or a feature of the app?",

        "title": "Glass Dome - A slow march to an unsatisfying end",
        "content": "By now I think everyone is familiar with the 'who-done-it' murder mystery. A crime happens. A series of hints are dropped. Some hints point to one suspect. Other hints point to other suspects. And finally the big reveal and the 'how-done-it': Somebody heretofore not suspected yet, turns out to have done the deed, and all the hints are tied together neatly at the end by the big reveal.  How good the show is, is a factor of how well the big reveal explained all those observed clues.\n\nThe Glass Dome on the other hand, tossed out a bunch of clues, and then swept aside all those dangling clues, and then reveals the real killer, which was a surprise to the audience. But unfortunately that surprising revelation doesn't explain any of the previous hints. So there is no 'a-ha moment' type of satisfaction. And the crimes were just completely out of character for the killer, as well as being highly implausible. And on top of that, the show's pacing was way too slow. Not recommended. ",

Is it his dementia and it means nothing more than that?  I thought it was going to add up to something complicated but now that I finished it I'm unsure it meant much.",
