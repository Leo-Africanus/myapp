Yes, it was trashy, misogynistic reality tv, exploiting naive young women by forcing them into humiliating situations or into having emotional reactions. But you know who was the absolute king of exploiting women in the 90s/00s, and who has never had a documentary made about him, or had his disgusting reality radio/tv shows exposed to the younger generation? Howard Stern. Anyone who was alive back then knows exactly what I'm talking about. I don't even want to describe the misogynistic filth that man did to young women on his shows. If Tyra Banks is going to be raked over the coals for her middling at best reality tv show, which actually wasn't even the worst of the lot, then someone really needs to take a hard look at the biggest offender of them all: HS.  This man should have been called to account YEARS ago. Netflix, please make this your next documentary.",

        "content": "So I\u2019m on a PS5, and when a movie ends, it plays the credits for 20 seconds before a pop up takes over the entire screen and tells you the title. You then have 3 seconds to quickly select watch credits for the movie credits to just play out as normal, otherwise the entire bottom half of the screen will then be filled with titles of other titles. If you try to find the watch credits option after that, it will just kick you out to the movie title.\n\nThis is such an annoying feature to me. Maybe I\u2019m one of the 5% who actually care about the credits and want them to play normally, but they serve as a good outro to a film and let you relax and decompress after an intense film. I already have autoplay turned off, but is there another option to just turn off the pop ups altogether? I just want a movie to play from beginning to the end of the credits.",

She is smug and fake and just completely full of bullsh\\*t. And while she thought she was redeeming herself, all people around her just outed her for who she truly is. And I really love that for all of them to get the truth out. ",

It feels like the discovery process is totally broken now.\nSince that button is gone, what are you guys using to break the loop?

        "content": "In general, I like Gordon and have eaten at two of his restaurants in London. The food was very good. He can cook, he is a competent chef no doubt.\n\nHe is also a brand rather than a chef these days, and he works with media very well.\n\nThis whole documentary could have been half its length very easily. A lot of it felt very repetitive.\n\nYes, there are always some growing pains when opening a new restaurant. Yes, the food looks fabulous and influencers are gonna love it. Is it sustainable? Is it nutritious?! What about the overall environmental impact of serving this kind of food during the winter in London. Nobody asks these questions that matter more and more.\n\nWhat honestly bothered me was his empty-eyed wife having so much space where she didn\u2019t really say anything too interesting. If you cut her bits out nothing of substance would be missing.\n\nHe brings up the wedding of his daughter so many times yet it is not a part of this documentary so we don\u2019t even get to see the dress, flowers or food. Just an engagement party that feels a bit forced as the cameras are there.\n\nIt is an ad for his new restaurant in London, and the bits about him being a family man felt incredibly disingenuous and staged. He does a lot of cuddling with the kids but very little parenting. He doesn\u2019t even cook for them in the show.\n\nHe says he loves his kids so much yet is gone easily six weeks at a time. His whole arrival in a helicopter to their country house in Cornwall was just silly and wasteful. He honestly comes across an absent father no matter the editing.\n\nHim talking about fitness? Bro I was a volunteer at London Marathon in 2009 and you didn\u2019t even make it past 10 km. I was waiting to snap your photo yet you never made it to my mark (mile 15). Like give me a break. You travel, take photos with fans, shake hands, make TV shows, you have zero time for fitness or your kids so you\u2019re in no position to lecture anyone about buying iPads for their kids.\n\nOverall, there was very little food shown, too much disingenuous family moments that weren\u2019t even interesting, too much talking by his wife saying absotely nothing, and all those emotional reveals were spoken about many times before.\n\nA total meh for me",

This is one of the few reality dating shows that exists that is devoid of unethical and exploitative producers stringing together narratives and creating storylines to stir drama and boost ratings. It's also so raw and real in a way that can make some people maybe feel uncomfortable. There is a lot of silence and pauses in the episodes something that I think more closely mirrors reality than most of \"reality tv.\" Everyone is sohonest on the show in a way that makes you \"awww\" instead of cringe!",

My mobile plan offers unlimited 5G data and I prefer to use that rather than home wifi because coverage is spotty in some parts of the house. So if I theoretically cancel my broadband will Netflix one day stop working since there will not be any home wifi to connect to? I don't really understand the logic behind this. ",
