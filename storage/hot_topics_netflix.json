It all consists of telling stories about psychosis actors, the Texas massacre, film producers who were inspired by him, and above all, romances they have had and experiences that are not real or are still theories.\nI thought I was going to see how Ed Gein acted, the things he did, what he did with corpses, everything. But instead I find that shit. \nI had a lot of hype for this season, I thought it would be good and above all that it would be the creepiest of all. But it feels pretty bad. It's morbid of me to want to see more of what the crimes were like and how he really acted, but damn, that's better than wanting to see stories that never happened about his life.",

        "content": "I just finished watching The OA and honestly I cannot stop thinking about it. I had heard about it years ago but never got around to watching it until now. And wow. It was so different from anything I have seen before. Strange, emotional, and full of mystery. The way the story was told kept pulling me in. I kept wondering what would happen next.\n\nAfter I finished I looked it up and saw it had a lot of praise but was cancelled after only two seasons. That made me kind of sad because I really feel like it could have gone somewhere even bigger if it had more time. Netflix has so many shows that end up disappearing under the radar, even when they are really good.\n\nSo I wanted to throw this out to the community. What is a Netflix show you think deserved way more attention? Not the big ones everyone talks about, but those hidden gems that maybe only a small group of people know about.\n\nFor me The OA will stick with me for a long time. I keep thinking about its ending and the questions it leaves open. I wish more people had seen it so we could talk about it.\n\nI would love to hear your picks. Is there a show you watched on Netflix that surprised you and deserved more love? Something you wish had gotten more seasons or more people watching? I feel like this could turn into a great list of hidden gems we all need to check out.\n\n",

        "title": "Wayward and Mae\u2019s acting (spoilers)",
        "content": "I literally spent the whole first episode repeatedly questioning who would cast Mae for a role in this show, and a lead role none the less, just for the episode to end and Mae\u2019s name being cited as the creator and (sometimes) writer. Their acting was so incredibly horrible, it felt like a self insert fan fiction where they could be the \u201cgood\u201d guy and wear tank tops that show off their biceps, and then occasionally take it off to show their tattoos and muscles. They\u2019re so flat and lack any genuine emotion or expressions and should have never been given a lead role, even if they created it, was the director not doing their job? Why\u2019re they being out acted by literally EVERY character and child in the show. Even that little cute kid that won the mountain episode was amazing despite barely having any speaking lines. I think they were out of their depth and should\u2019ve stayed as a creator but had the self awareness to understand that they weren\u2019t fit for this job.\n\nThe show itself was really interesting and had a lot of potential, however, there were some confusing plot lines. Honestly, for the most part, it seems like the \u201ctherapy\u201d they do actually helps the kids confront their issues in a way? But then Abbie told Leila that it was just Evelyn messing with her head and that her original memories were actually true. This was kind of confusing because it seemed like blocked trauma coming out but if they meant for it to be just a manipulation of Evelyn then I think it didn\u2019t translate fully for me. Of course this isn\u2019t to say that everything happening at the school wasn\u2019t fully insane. The ending also didn\u2019t sit right, specifically Alex\u2019s character arc. How does the character who is constantly trying to do good end up staying through that? Is it because he keeps violently hurting people over and over again so now he feels connected to her because \u201cawe babe we\u2019re both murderers &lt;3)? He pissed me off so much every time he would hurt someone because, for example, with that one dad whose house he went to, he could\u2019ve fully stopped him and told him that he wasn\u2019t a spy, but he chose to beat his ass till he was half dead? If they meant to show that Evelyn was right because he repeated the patterns of his fathers violence even while actively trying to be different then that would make sense, but I think the way they wrote the story, and once again, Mae\u2019s HORRENDOUS acting, it didn\u2019t translate well. I suppose it would also make sense why he chose to stay given Evelyn\u2019s scene telling them that he doesn\u2019t love his wife and he just loves the idea of the family she can give him, but I think these thoughts and emotions should\u2019ve been expressed in a better way, because with Alex\u2019s constant flat tone and facial expressions regardless of what\u2019s happening in the scene, you\u2019d think there were pebbles up there.\n\nAlso, a little note of appreciation for the actress who played Evelyn, she was AMAZING, her character deserved a bigger, better show.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I think writing all of this down helped me understand some decisions that I hadn\u2019t considered.",

Mae\u2019s character Alex even hinted at it when talking to one of Laura\u2019s ex classmates. \n\nI wonder if this was a choice by Mae because they were planning to play the main character? So it would be normalized in the show and it wouldn\u2019t be odd that the town just accepted and respected a transman? \n\nIt just feels disingenuous to the time, but I was a kid and living in the bible belt so maybe my memory is skewed. \n\nI think it should have been a plot point to be honest, it would add more to the story.

        "title": "Ed Gein - Thoughts",
        "content": "I binged this show within a day of its release and wanted to voice my thoughts somewhere so please forgive the potential ramblings here. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s morbidly curious, Gein was the first figure I had a fascination with going back as young as 10 years old having seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre far too young. I like many others fell into the online rabbit hole and have a decent understanding of his story. When this season was announced I was slightly hesitant as I felt the first season \u2018Dahmer\u2019 was a perfect encapsulation of him. His portrayal was how I imagined him and liked that it took place in black and white to emphasise the older time period. The way his crimes were showcased felt short and concise so was more than happy if they left things there along with Gacy who I felt they sensationalised with the whole murdering in his Pogo the clown getup. Regardless, I was on board and when Hunnam was cast I was looking forward to him hopefully changing my mind on how I rate him as an actor. (not the biggest fan)\n\nWith Hunnam I thought his portrayal was decent but a lot of the time I was frustrated with some of the choices that were made. To start, his voice just didn\u2019t work for me, his accent sounded Irish at times and I found it too distracting. He took a big swing and I would have to disagree with the people saying that\u2019s how he sounded. I\u2019ve listened to the audio tapes and wholeheartedly disagree. Perhaps he decided to do it to further emphasise his creepiness but instead I thought it contributed toward another issue I had with how simple they made him seem. From what I gather, while Gein wasn\u2019t the brightest bulb, he wasn\u2019t Simple Jack levels of stupid which he came across as in the series. The constant \u2018Mother\u2019 that Hunnam was repeating throughout the show just reminded me of Freddie Highmore in Bates Motel. I wish this season didn\u2019t come across at times like it was influenced by media like Psycho, when in fact Gein was meant to be the one that was the inspiration behind it.\n\nI didn\u2019t think they emphasised the loneliness Gein experienced due to the inclusion of Adeline. I was hoping they\u2019d pull a Joker and have her be a figment of his imagination but unfortunately not. I wish they used her sparingly or just didn\u2019t include her at all, at times it felt like they were leaning too far into a romantic subplot instead of focussing on Gein\u2019s isolation after the death of his mother.\n\nThe deaths of both his brother and mother happened far too quickly for an 8 episode series. They needed to establish these relationships better especially with his brother who gets murdered almost as soon as he appears. With his death being suspicious and not as a confirmed kill by Ed they really should\u2019ve focussed on how the narrative we follow isn\u2019t necessarily a reliable one due to his mental illness. They could\u2019ve portrayed two outcomes and not make clear which one was real. The same applies to the sequences with Evelyn Hartley. Instead they frame it as if he definitely murdered them. I thought it was especially distasteful in the portrayal of Bernice Worden and the consensual relationship they had in the show which I don\u2019t believe ever took place.\n\nA lot of my gripes fall into how they exaggerated Geins story, I understand a lot of things are up in the air and some parts undocumented but it\u2019s a dangerous path potentially feeding wider audiences with false narratives.\n\nThe final episode was a massive eyeroll from me. Seeing Murphy basically do a serial killer MCU and even including knockoff Mindhunter characters just made my worst fears for this series come true. Having been a fan of early American Horror Story, every season felt like diminishing returns to the point it felt cringey and almost like a parody with the inclusion of actual real life serial killers in later seasons. Unfortunately the finale of Gein just reminded me of this. Each person that Gein comes face to face with in this weird glorification segment of famous killers just felt so tacky with dialogue written by some edgy fanfic writer. Atleast with Dahmer, while you could argue wasn\u2019t a correct account atleast attempted to be somewhat accurate. With Gein it\u2019s like they gave up midway after prematurely glazing over key moments in his story that they then decided to shift focus onto things that never happened. If there wasn\u2019t enough documented material to make 8 episodes then just make it shorter instead of painting Gein out as some Hannibal Lecter type who helped catch killers like Bundy. From what I gather this is so far from the truth.\n\nTo end I just want to say that I rate the production design and enjoyed seeing the recreation of iconic movie sets and scenes that Gein inspired but this series overall was a complete mess and exactly the kind of thing I had reservations about. Atleast with next seasons Lizzie Borden it takes place in a time slightly more distant from ours so it allows for more artistic interpretation. I really wanted to enjoy this and was hoping it would rival Dahmer which I rewatch and think is solid. I even thought this would leap frog the Menendez series which I found a chore to get through but I can\u2019t even say that this was better than that.\n\nIf you managed to read this all then thanks for your time and if you wanna comment I\u2019d love to have discourse about the show as I don\u2019t have anyone really to discuss my thoughts with. Thanks.\n\n",
