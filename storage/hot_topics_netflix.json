I\u2019m not judging her for having work done to her face but I do feel like there should be rules in long term series about having a large amount of plastic surgery. Her top lip is huge and barely moves and there\u2019s  minimal expression on her face due to Botox. Some dramatic scenes are ruined from the lack of movement &amp; expression in her face.\n\nOverall I\u2019m a little disappointed",

We have the premium 4K package, a newer 4K TV with full HDR etc etc. Netflix has the highest subscription price of the major streaming services and the video quality - \\*even of their own in-house produced films/shows\\* - is a total, complete compressed mess. We watched Weapons on Crave immediately after and the quality was 1000% better. It was insane the difference. \n\nI remember during the Covid pandemic, they sent out a notice saying they were further compressing the streams to conserve bandwidth under high demand, but it\u2019s never come back. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the fence about even keeping my subscription, and I think this is the final straw.

        "content": "I get that Stranger Things: The First Shadow (Broadway / West End) is meant to deepen the lore, but honestly it feels like it introduces major information that should not be locked behind a stage play that most fans will never see.\n\nThere are things in the show that already felt like loose threads, and now it turns out they are \u201cexplained\u201d in the play:\n\n1. Henry\u2019s cave memory in Season 5, where he\u2019s clearly interacting with / absorbing Mind Flayer-like particles. In the show, this is presented as something mysterious and significant\u2026 but never really followed up on in a satisfying way. Apparently the play adds context, but the series itself doesn\u2019t.\n\n2. The Oklahoma poster in Max\u2019s hand during one of Henry\u2019s memories strongly suggests Joyce, Hopper, and Henry all went to school together. That\u2019s a huge implication; yet across four seasons, Joyce and Hop never say a single word about knowing Henry Creel? Not even a hint?\n\n3. Henry\u2019s early connection to the Upside Down, Brenner\u2019s involvement, and the timeline of how everything starts are apparently much clearer in the play but on screen, it still feels incomplete or oddly rushed.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t expanded lore. It\u2019s that the main TV series feels like it\u2019s missing chapters unless you\u2019ve seen a West End/ Broadway show that:\n\nA. isn\u2019t accessible worldwide,\n\nB. isn\u2019t cheap,\n\nC. and won\u2019t be seen by the vast majority of viewers.\n\nAt this point, it feels like they should\u2019ve done a limited prequel season or special between Season 4 and 5 to properly set this up. Relying on a stage production to carry essential canon just makes Season 4 feel retroactively unfinished.\n\nWith only one episode left, I\u2019m worried the finale will have too much ground to cover, and that casual viewers will never even realize why certain things don\u2019t quite add up.\n\nEnd rant. Curious if this bugs anyone else or if I\u2019m just overthinking it. ",

Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

Plus, we\u2019ve seen so much of Vecna already and defeated him once, so a new, final enemy could've really upped the tension.\n\nThe final season could've had a nice twist if they just focused on the Mind Flayer and made it a true battle for survival.

        "content": "i have an OLED LG C5 TV, and was using Netflix TV app for a few months. Recently (a week ago) Dolby Vision playback stopped working in all titles. Plan is premium, all titles show 4K/Dolby Vision support but it only shows Dolby Atmos when you start playing. Other apps and videos from external drives work in DV as usual. Tried logging out, deleting app, everything that\u2019s possible. Internet connection is also fine, playback quality set to high in settings, HDR is on.\nHas anyone got the same problem?\nAlso i\u2019ve got a \u201cyou\u2019re not a part of household\u201d notification recently but chose to override it via travelling option. \nCould it be the cause?\nupd: just checked, for unknown reason playback is stuck on 1080p, 1-2 mbps.",

Different browsers, clearing my cache, updating my laptop and browsers, and it still won't work. I tried chatting with an employee to fix the issue but I was disconnected before he could even figure out why it isn't working. Does anyone else have this issue? I'm just really stumped and can't figure out what's causing this issue :/",

        "content": "My user is the main one that controls the account and we have 4 other profiles 1 for the wife and 3 for the kids. I noticed my account wouldn't go above 0.5mbps and thought everyones was the same, BOY was i wrong my wives profile goes to 18mbps and so do all the other profiles. So I've been watching shows basically at 720p on a 4k TV whilst my my children can watch the same show at 18 mbps on their profiles ON THE SAME TV!!!!! I've tested it on every device in house and it's the same everywhere, I've checked the account settings but there isnt a single option to nerf the quality. I did not change anything other than the profiles it was signed into and I'm majorly disappointed, I also tried changing my son's profile to an adult one and that immediately bricked that profile, I moved one of my daughters to age rating 15 and her quality wasn't effected.\n\nIve watched countless Netflix series squinting for no reason.",
