WEDNESDAY was the same.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nObviously, just give me the entire season all at once. The premise is that they \\*DONT\\* do that anymore. And honestly, splitting up the seasons of these shows a few episodes MONTHS apart is so much worse than week-by-week episodes for a few months sraight.\n\nAlso, people tend not to give a @#$% anymore after binge watching half the season and then having to wait another month for the rest. Am I only in this way of thinking?",
