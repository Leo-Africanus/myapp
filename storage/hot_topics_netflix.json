        "content": "So I watched Thirteen on Netflix recently and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. It might be the darkest movie I\u2019ve ever watched and it\u2019s not even classified as horror. That\u2019s how heavy it is. It\u2019s disturbing because it\u2019s real. There\u2019s no supernatural force, no jump scares or anything like that. Just raw, spiraling human behavior, especially from young girls trying to find their place.\n\nWatching Tracy\u2019s downfall was infuriating. The way she gets pulled into Evie\u2019s world. It\u2019s such a gut-punch because deep down, you can see how much of it is her trying to find validation. It\u2019s not just rebellion for rebellion\u2019s sake. These are kids. They don\u2019t know right from wrong, they don\u2019t understand long-term consequences. They only know what\u2019s cool, what gets them attention, and what numbs the pain they\u2019re carrying.\n\nWhat made me the angriest was the parenting, or the lack of it. Tracy\u2019s mom just stood there so often. Blank-faced. Passive. She\u2019d watch her daughter scream at her, curse at her, break down in front of her and she\u2019d just exist there, like she didn\u2019t know how to act. She said at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s not how I raised you,\u201d which shows she had tried before, but once Tracy spiraled, it was like the mother was too scared or emotionally paralyzed to intervene. And the father? Barely even there. Useless.\n\nThere\u2019s also this eerie transformation that happens with Tracy. At the beginning, she\u2019s just this sweet, insecure girl. But by the end? Her face, her body language \u2026. it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a completely different person. There\u2019s a moment where she doesn\u2019t even look human anymore. Her pain and trauma show up physically on her face. She looked evil. Terrifying, even.\n\nAnd Evie,  I have a lot of thoughts. She\u2019s manipulative, yes, but also clearly broken herself. And somehow, she hides it behind that innocent, \u201ccute\u201d look. But she absolutely destroyed Tracy's life and enabled everything terrible that happened.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an easy watch. In fact, it was painful to sit through. But it\u2019s one of those movies that sticks with you. It\u2019s a reminder that adolescence is fragile, and if adults around don\u2019t step in, don\u2019t really parent, then kids are going to fall into dangerous hands.",

        "content": "I honestly blame TikTok's hype culture for how movies are turning out these days. One of my favorite genres has always been romcoms, but over the years, the quality has noticeably dropped. If you look back, there are so many classic romcoms that still hold up BECAUSE that was the standard for the genre back in the day. Nowadays, it feels like movies are being made with specific actors or tropes just so they can get the TikTok treatment. People know some influencer is going to make a reaction video with exaggerated expressions and fake gasps to hype it up. So they continue spitting out shitty films because this group is so easy to satiate. I see the same exact thing happening with books. Anyone can become a writer these days. All it takes is a few edits and slideshows. \n\nA perfect example of this is My Oxford Year that came out recently. Honestly, that movie was a mess. Sofia Carson's acting was so cringey that I had to pause the film. Yet, all over TikTok, I keep seeing posts about how \u201camazing\u201d it was and how people \u201ccried so much.\u201d I couldn't even muster up any emotional response because the film felt rushed, and the acting was just... not it. I just miss the days when movies were good BECAUSE they were good, not because they were trending on a platform. Thankfully, I was never really one to watch movies or shows when I was younger so there\u2019s tons of classics I haven\u2019t watched. It\u2019s just bothersome that I never see criticism for these terrible movies. ",

        "content": "I thought the first season was sensational. Admittedly I\u2019m late to the party on this season only three episodes in.  I like this platform giving way to somewhat getting to better familiarizing ourselves with the QB even if he\u2019s not on my team or one of my fav teams or gets the pub like a Mahomes. I have followed Burrow (and Chase) since their time at LSU. Burrow appears to be rather level headed and philosophical in his approach to football. I\u2019m not usually one to care that much or at all for a player\u2019s style (fashion wise) off the field or the game-day tunnel runway\u2026 but I\u2019ve always thought Burrow had a real swagger about him. I feel I got a real glimpse as to why that might be. I like this kid. I hope he ultimately gets his comeuppance aka a ring.\n\nI\u2019m happy to learn a bit more about Goff. Seems like a down to earth Bro. Seems to really want to improve and has a genuine love for the game and role as QB. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been much of a Big DL fan but certainly saw last season glimpses of the Lions\u2019 playing at a high level and could grab the golden ring. Like so many I do like a good underdog prevails narrative. I\u2019ll continue to keep a look out for Goff and the Lions!  It\u2019s cool how Detroit has embraced him.\n\nI don\u2019t have too much -good or bad-to say about Cousins. I appreciate he\u2019s a man of faith. Not sure why he is being featured again? I just now had to google to see if he was still in Atlanta? Could be an interesting season for the Falcons OG QB??? Bro is definitely vanilla. lol For whatever reason my wife doesn\u2019t think she could or would be friends with Mrs. Cousins but I\u2019m just going to leave that alone. We are both excited with the on-set of the 2025 Season. Looking forward to catching the next few episodes and Hard Knocks.\n",

That\u2019s exactly what she felt like. \n\nEvery single moment her facial expression was seductive and flirty, literally every second she talked. There\u2019s a scene where she\u2019s asking how someone died and her face looks exactly the same as when she was flirting with the love interest. Like what. It\u2019s like she\u2019s always trying to keep herself pretty, if that makes sense. But this is not an ad or a beauty campaign. A good movie doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re watching a movie, but this was the exact opposite whenever Sofia was on screen. \n\nAlso she made zero effort to have any sort of chemistry with Corey. You could see in his eyes, the passion and the longing, but nothing from her. \n\nThe movie is honestly pretty good but Sofia Carson\u2019s acting really ruined it for me. ",
