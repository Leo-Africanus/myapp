I cannot think of anything I\u2019ve ever watched where the dialogue was both written and delivered by the actors in a way that felt so natural and hyper-realistic. Incredible work by the camera crew as well to get each episode in a single shot. Also I\u2019m a social worker, and I cannot get over the scene with Jamie and the psychologist. It felt like a masterclass in appropriate/effective methods in evaluation and talk therapy. I am blown away by this show. I hope it gets many accolades come the next awards season.",

They could have tried to find out where this lady is actually from. Find other victims of hers throughout the years. It could have been multiple episodes about how vile this woman was. It seems to me that they found out about grahams story online somehow. And just found ppl that were scammed at the same time as he was. I just felt they could have done more work to show us who this horrible lady really was. I mean it seems like grahams wife did more research on her than the filmmakers. \n\nIs this just me and my weird self? Or does anybody else feel like this?",

After we return to the hearing, we learn that the committee members are still completely in the dark about the culprit(s) and have even written down their own wrong guesses. But how can this be?

        "content": "Firstly I don't understand why some people are so fixated on the bullying storyline, when it's a story of all the different forces that create violence in teens. Stephen Graham's explanation that he thought about the phrase \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and therefore we've all failed (in the face of rising teen knife crime in the UK) is so clear.\n\nBut did others think it was clear that Jamie made worse comments to Katie than what we learn?\n\nWhat we know is that Jamie received nude photos of Katie, asked her out, she said \"I'm not that desperate\" (this part rang true and I think was meant to feel that way) and then she left comments on his IG implying he's an incel.\n\nTo me, it felt obvious that when Jamie was talking to the psychologist, he left out part of the conversation. He praises himself for being nice to Katie but admits he thought she was at a weak and vulnerable moment. My interpretation was that when she turned him down, he most likely said something about how no-one else would want her now her nudes had been shared. Especially since we know about his anger outbursts. It was these comments that made her post the emojis on his Insta. I thought it was important that her comments aren't about him being ugly or unpopular - which he sees as his biggest issue - but they specifically call out his attitude to women. And DI Bascombe misses the point a second time when his conclusion is \"So Katie was bullying Jamie?\"\n\nAs a fairly online woman, that was where my mind instantly went. It's such a common pattern: misogynist shows woman positive attention, woman turns him down (politely, kindly or not), misogynist shows his true colours. \n\n",

It was one of the most unexpected elements of the entire document yet I felt like it wasn\u2019t explored enough. \n\nI\u2019m assuming the mom voluntarily got her swabs taken by Graham\u2019s request (as opposed to being taken secretly behind her back) so I can\u2019t help but wonder: if the mom was pro enough to fake or befriend real bankers and lawyers and pull off her tricks, I don\u2019t see faking DNA lab results very difficult. In fact, that was my very first thought. Any thoughts or theories on this?   ",
