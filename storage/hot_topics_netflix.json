I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

        "content": "I have 2 available devices, with others being smartphones. My awol ltv 3500 provides clear vibrant visuals, whatever I am watching. On the other hand, I have been having issues with my Lg.                                                                        The settings are all off, can you tell me how to get similar visuals? The Lg in question is a bit old, like I got it back in 2016. Could that be the reason that I am not getting good visuals?",

        "title": "Netflix double charged me for 3 months",
        "content": "This admittedly happened around about 18 months ago but wanted to let people know if you were looking into Netflix, and or vent incase this happened to you as well.\n\nMy PayPal notified me that my Netflix subscription charge had gone through and I was surprised cuz my card had been charged earlier that week for the same subscription.  I looked over my PayPal account to realize they had been charging me for 3 months previously while also charging my card days before. I called Netflix to ask why this had happened. Got nowhere. Basically they told me that couldn\u2019t have possibly happened because they could see only one account under my information and that account charged my card not PayPal.\n\nI admittedly was not in the best mood and told them to cancel my account. They did and then discovered the second account and the reason I was being overcharged. The CSA admitted that they had never seen a double account with the same information including the same login but told me that I had to get refunded by my card and or PayPal.\n\nI laughed and said \u201cI\u2019m not hanging up with you until you tell me both accounts are canceled.\u201d They canceled the second account while trying to convince me to stay with the service. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if you give me 3 months of free Netflix\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry miss that\u2019s not something we are authorized to do\u201d\n\nAs you can imagine I have not given Netflix a $1 since then but exactly one year later I see a charge on my card for Netflix and I call my bank they saw the charge and also the immediate refund of that charge that hadn\u2019t been processed yet when I started the call to them. They asked if there was something else they could do for me and I said yes \u201chave any other Netflix charges on the account that may come after this flagged as fraud please.\u201d They were more than happy to do that.\n\nSo here I am 18 months later with no Netflix and happier for it. Till they give me 3 free months I won\u2019t be coming back.",
