        "content": "I haven\u2019t gotten around to watching Season 4 yet, but having seen everything up to Season 3, I genuinely believe Jibaro is the most perfect episode in the entire Love, Death &amp; Robots anthology.\n\nYes, I know that\u2019s a bold claim considering the heavy competition \u2014 Bad Travelling, Beyond the Aquila Rift, Zima Blue, and The Witness are all incredible in their own right. Everyone has their personal favorites depending on what they value most: hard sci-fi, suspense, animation style, or raw emotion.\n\nBut Jibaro hits different. For me, it\u2019s one of the best modern folklore interpretations ever put on screen. It tells a deeply compelling, emotionally charged story \u2014 without a single word of dialogue \u2014 and still manages to feel more complete and immersive than most dialogue-heavy shorts. The animation is chaotic in the best way, the sound design is absolutely haunting, and the symbolism runs deep.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful, brutal, tragic, and strangely mesmerizing \u2014 a true S+ tier episode in my book. A masterclass in visual storytelling.\n\nCurious to know \u2014 where does Jibaro rank in your list?",

I mean more if there is a coastal or beach town , fisher town or something similar, with a bunch of good looking Teenagers and Young Adults, that all apart from knowing how to drive a car they all know how to drive boats and they all surf and dive and are having their bonfire parties. Does something like that exist? Like a town with strong outer banks vibes? \n\nI know the gossip girl experience actually does exist, its called le rosey, a swiss boarding school. Prerequisite is that ur parents have to be loaded. Pretty much any expensive swiss boarding school.\n\nI know the emily in paris experience actually also does exist. Prerequisite is that 1. You speak french 2. You get a fashion job in paris that does get you invited to all these fashion shows and u live in the 6th and 7th Arrondissement and wear designer and earn good money. Or you can be an influencer or a nepo Baby like all the daughters from Fran\u00e7ois Henri pinault. But the emily in paris experience does def exist in real life. \n\nBut I cant really Wrap my head around, if the Outer Banks experience is purely fictional or there is a town like that sonewhere in the world with such an environment. \n\nEdit: maybe somewhere in Australia? Or a little beach town in the south of france? Nizza? Monaco? LA? Malibu? Hawaii? Denmark?",

        "content": "As described in the title, I opened Netflix on Roku yesterday to an announcement of the new UI and how wonderful it would be, etc., etc.\n\nDamn, is it ever bad. Of course, the \"worst\" label is 100% subjective and just one person's opinion. But, for me, it is objectively less usable than before. Its cramped design actually gives me a slight sense of clostrophobia to the point where I actively dislike being in the app. I find it very unwelcoming. \n\nWhen I open Netflix, most of the time I'm not going to in to watch anything in particular. I like browsing and hunting for something that, based on the title and/or image, I think might interest me. I've heard a lot of people complain about the quality on Netflix but there are still quite a few gems that I would often stumble on. The Residence and The Gentlemen are perfect examples of this - shows that I liked that I came across while scrolling through the app and hadn't previously heard of. \n\nThe new interface makes this process much more difficult. It's much easier to visually scan a screen with a lot of items and scroll when necessary. When you see something you might like you can choose to explore further and then look at the details.   \n\nNow, you are hit in the face with details of a single show taking up a large part of the screen that, odds are, you don't care anything about with a handful of other shows around the edges. \n\nGiven my typical use of Netflix, it will now take me much longer to find something than it did before. And given how being in the app makes me feel like I'm in a box, I can see my usage dropping significantly. Cancelation is likely right around the corner. \n\nFirst world problem, I know, but I only have so much money to go around. It doesn't make sense to spend it on something that will likely now sit idle most of the time. \n\nOk, rant over. On with my day. \n\nEDIT: I really am curious to hear from people who do like the new UI and what specifically they find better about it. While it's always fun to vent, I would like to hear others' perspectives just in case I'm missing something. ",

        "content": "So I\u2019ve watched a few interviews involving her, and I don\u2019t believe her reasons for revealing/outing Belle are at all altruistic. \n\nI could be wrong but there is something about Chanelle that has always felt off, in every interview her body language just seems to \u2026. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know - I think there is more there, I feel like something else or some other events happened that ended with her revealing Belle. \n\nI dunno, could be completely wrong, but my behavioural background is shooting up flags and I can\u2019t put my finger on it\u2026. But she certainly comes across completely insincere. ",
