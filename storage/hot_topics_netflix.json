While it is super rare that we watch on even 2 devices simultaneously, I often have been traveling to my parents house (as they are elderly and I take turns caring for them), and I recently tried to login there. I updated my household to there because it prompted me to do so, but it kicked my husband out at our residence. It prompted him the same, but then it kicked me out. Is it not possible to watch on 2 different WiFi sources at the same time? Is there not a travel option? I swear there used to be, but again, I haven't been in this situation for many months. What do you suggest? Do I need a second email for my husband? Can I have 2 profiles on my account? Should I downgrade to Standard since I obviously don't make use of Premium? Thanks for your advice.

You don't care about most of them because meh I barely know them.

Got virtually nothing out of them. After the North Korean girl becomes a worker, every second with her felt so pointless.\n\n\nI'm pretty disappointed. Feel like the show didn't get into the nitty gritty of the interesting questions at all. First episode was good fun if nothing else but I really didn't like the direction it went in at all. Maybe would've been better to just release season 2 and 3 in 1 go but this felt like a lot of filler again.\n\n(Also, the insurrection at the end was dumb as shit. Why would they go along with that? And the whole time Gi Hun is iffy about 001 but never suspects it might be the same as last time? Wtf?)",

        "content": "Started watching La Palma with my wife, mainly because we've been on holiday to Tenerife a few years back and the culture interested us. So we were curious about this show. The first 3 episodes were pretty solid. I personally didn't care that much for the family and think they could easily have been kept out and it would've been a good series. But let's ignore that. The build up from a fun family vacation to a absolute hell was very good I have to admit! I like it when movies or series do stuff like that.\n\nWhat kills it for me was the unrealism, and this is going to be a rant! Never before has the final episode of a show killed my mood so much! Firstly, how did the dad and the girl who's brother got killed (I suck at names) outrun a tsunami in a dinghy? A tsunami can reach speeds up to 800 km/h (500 miles per hour) and somehow they were fast enough to make it to safe land?\n\nWhich brings me to my second point. How was that small beach NOT hit by a Tsunami that, according to the scientists in the series, would reach Southern Europe and even parts of South America? Seconds after they reached the beach the ocean behind them was calm. Like nothing happened.\n\nAnd now the straw that broke the camels back. The daughter and her girlfriend getting hit by the tsunami while in the plane. They survived that?! Absolutely ridiculous! If you would be hit by a tsunami like that your body would turn to shreds! The impact alone would kill you. And even if you somehow survived that you would drown. There's no way the water inside that plane would have been gone before people inside would have run out of breath. Nope, they just walked it off like nothing happened.\n\n\nI was really excited to watch this series and I did enjoy the first 3 episodes. But that last episode.... man. My initial thought was that this was a \"realistic\" series. More like a \"what if\" series. But that last episode makes it feel more like a Micheal Bay series in which such unrealistic things happen you start to wonder what's real and what's not. Things that make you say \"Nah now they're overdoing it, that's unrealistic...\". Not every movie needs an \"and they lived happily ever after\". And even if they wanted the movie to have such an ending make it a bittersweet ending...",

Of course not, but how would it be? It's not possible since we know what it's about. Not many possible inventions appart from the few we saw, and yet to be seen that made and can make the show keep being great.\n\nBut was it awesome? Yes it was, I watched it in 7 hours. As many others did as well.\n\nIt starts of very captivating.\n\nThe main participants (some annoying, not in a good way, but do get better) are introduced well.\n\nThe games are not repetitive.\n\nThe story makes you question what the plottwist will be because of taunts. Some of them not forseeable.\n\nAnd overall the ending makes you feel exactly what you (don't) want to feel, which is a good thing if you ask me!\n\nGreat job!",

It was an indie film festival type film on Netflix around 2014-2016, the main characters father was in the police force. The main character took his dad's pistol and met up with his friends. In one scene they were firing it off a bridge and a nearby man chased them down. They spirited to be Marian rappers. Another one of the teens had a girlfriend to which in one scene he climbed through her window and she was using a webcam to stream. In another scene I remember there was a water gun fight and towards the end of the movie they were at a house party where the gun was pulled on a bully.

I tried poking it to feed the flame and it only pressed the television behind the dresser. Of course I ran to grab the water hose to put out the flame as my wife called the fire department. We could hear the fire continue to crackle and see the light behind the dresser. Don\u2019t yall think it\u2019s strange that your fire smelled like cat pee only after the \u201cfireplace\u201d fell? It didn\u2019t even have any aroma before\u2026 we\u2019re hoping the pine smells better. We soaked the flame until the sparks finally put the light out from the flames just as the fire department arrived. The gentleman were so happy we took care of the job that they were laughing with us as they left. I would think yall can update the fire to a safer, more aromatic pine for next year. ",
