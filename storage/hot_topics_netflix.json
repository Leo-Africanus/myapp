        "title": "\"Hot Frosty\" (2024) | Movie Discussion",
        "content": "It feels like **\"Hot Frosty\"** officially kicked off Netflix's *pseudo-Hallmark Christmas Movies* onslaught this year.  It's kind of a high-concept rom-com Christmas movie, basically \"what if *Frosty the Snowman* happened for a widower + Frosty is mad chiseled?\".\n\nOverall, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I thought I would, so if you haven't seen it yet, temper your expectations.  Easily, Dustin Milligan is the standout.  I always liked him from Schitt's Creek, but he was just great in this role, balancing sweet/fish-out-of-water with sincere while pulling off the comedy aspects.  His interaction with Joe Lo Truglio was maybe my favorite part of the movie (probably tied with the 'pushing the woman's car' bit while shirtless + following scenes with the ladies friends were up there).\n\nMy biggest issue with the movie is unfortunately Lacey Chabert (as \"Kathy\").  I'll be honest, I haven't watched most of her Hallmark releases, but here, I just found her to be a surprisingly weak lead for what was a decently stacked cast.  The major problem is that for a movie called \"Hot Frosty\", I didn't feel any *heat* between Kathy and \"Jack\" (the snowman come to life).  Their lack of chemistry really sunk what could have been a much stronger rom-com (*see* **Nobody Wants This** for an example of rom-com leads with both romantic and comedic chemistry).  As a result, I found that my favorite parts of the movie were all scenes *without* her and I was never rooting for them to get together.\n\nNot as big a problem, but I really didn't like what they did for Craig Robinson as the antagonist sheriff.  He just came off as way too unlikable and not all that funny.  I think the character could have been written in a different way to still fulfill that role, but in a funnier/more enjoyable way.\n\nOn the other end of things, it took me a second to recognize Lauren Holly (I don't think I've seen her in much since the *Dumb and Dumber* days).  I was hoping for a reveal that &gt;!her husband also started out as a snowman!&lt;, but that never happened.  It's still my head-canon though.\n\nWhat we got was still enjoyable to a degree, but can't help feeling like this was a missed opportunity.  That said, I'm a 40+ dude, so not sure I'm the target audience haha.  Next on the list, hoping Lindsay Lohan's upcoming **\"Our Little Secret\"** ends up being a lot more fun!",

Anyone else able to join it? \n\nEDIT: Found this on a crappy news site \"The preliminary card begins tonight (November 15) at 5:30 p.m. ET on\u00a0Tudum, the\u00a0Netflix Sports YouTube page, and the\u00a0Most Valuable Promotions\u2019 YouTube page.\"\nSo basically, gotta go to YouTube for some ridiculous reason.",
