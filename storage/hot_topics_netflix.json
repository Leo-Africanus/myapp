It's like they are deliberately downplaying the darkest part of this story and perpetuating Kendra's misdirection/manipulation.",

But she was also obsessed with the boyfriend! And then we learn that she lied about having a job! And then we hear her skirt accountability blaming it on her trauma, and then we see how manipulative she is at every level. Like\u2026 I have questions. Weigh in on any:\n\n1. WTF did we just watch?\n2. What mentally illness do you think she has? And what makes you think that?\n3. Why was she fired?? We need a follow up on this.
