Theres no illegal account sharing, I live at my house. Like, bro, I get it they really needed to save those few bucks they lost from people sharing accounts, but now every time i access netflix, whether at home or not, I have to call my mother to get that stupid confirmation code to confirm I actually live at my house.\nThat's ridiculous, we pay such a high price for a service we supposedly can use at any time, anywhere, but as soon as someone decides to watch netflix away from home they will annoy you into leaving the platform and getting a membership from one of their competitors.

        "title": "Sirens explained from my POV - a show about mental illness",
        "content": "If you see the story from the point of view of Devon and Simone you can understand better that they were struggling with mental illness (both their parents did - pretty sure they both had psychosis, their parents showed symptoms of bipolar; schizophrenia, severe depression). These disorders are genetical so it makes sense that Devon and Simone struggled with mental health and they were also showing symptoms - remember that Devon also said to Simone that she is not taking her medication. At the end of the movie you see how Simone got very triggered by the fact that Kiki found out about the \"kiss\" and she got fired...Simone started to switch and got into a mixed, mania episode...\n\nKiki and her husband showed signs of Narcissim, manipulation etc\n\nI think this show is about mental illness and how mania, psychosis looks - a lot of people don't understand at all how bipolar, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders are like ( I am commenting as someone who has schizoaffective bipolar disorder). throughout the all episodes you can see hallucinations, the struggles etc. Even Devon thinking that Kiki has a cult...Devon gets very paranoid about Kiki and starts to have all this stories about cults, how she is killing people etc...when in reality Kiki is not an evil monster...she is just a woman with lots of money, and probably a bit narcissistic and manipulative.\n\nI think the show is also about trauma bonding between people whith mental illness like bipolar/schizophrenia with people who has narcissistic tendencies. It's well known that people on schizophrenia spectrum can be very easy to manipulate and usually are the victims. It's interesting to view the show as a person who has the disorder because throughout the whole show no one time is mentioned a disorder name. It is only mentioned that Simone and their Dad are taking medication or they should; Simone's and Devon's mom tried to kill them and then killed herself and that Devon struggles with addiction and now she is sober.  Throughout the whole show it has this feeling of everything being a hallucination, a mesmerizing or paranoia vibe ...seeing something that is not real...like a Siren - is how psychosis or mania can feel like, very good depiction. \n\nAs someone who experiences mania, depression it looks very similar with how Simone was. You can see her behavior throughout the show but especially in the end. She was shocked when she was fired and after that she got triggered when her dad said \"it will be us 2 again and we try again to be good\" she was so scared that she went back and this could also trigger a mania episode in her (mania can be triggered by high stress) and then she immediately and impulsively jumps into Peter's arms. Then the scene where she is all dressed up and she talks with her sister Devon - look at that scene where she appears like she is on drugs, like it is not real, everything moved so fast to her being the new wife, giving up her loyalty to Kiki so quickly, her being showed on that hill with the big house in her background, everything being so grandiose, quick, mesmerizing - this how mania feels",
