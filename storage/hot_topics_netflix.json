And I'd get something similar all previous years for the past like 5 years. But there have been zero deals this go around, and I'm now at a point where I'll be cancelling a couple other streaming services that are lacking or cheaper trials ending (i.e. apple 3 month trial). \n\nAnyway, the 4k plan is now $25 which is pretty insane to me. I did get a quality tv and sound system back in 2020 and am used to 4k on every other service. So I'm deciding if I want to do $25 a few months a year, or do $8/mo continuously for 1080p. Since netflix releases all episodes at once, it doesn't really create the weekly discussions the way a show like severance, last of us, white lotus, etc do. So I'm heavily leaning towards just subscribing for a month at $25, immediately cancel it so it ends that month, and rejoin when theres at least a few more new shows/seasons that actually appeal to me. Wondering how many other people just subscribe occassionally throughout the year. ",

I felt shocked at the first episode, because it felt absolutely real, no act cuttings, just a camera filming the entire interactions... at some point it felt like it's boring to watch something so long from one perspective (don't blame me, i'm in gen z lol) but the subject is the most attractive thing that kept me watching. This series has rolled the effect of this masculine toxicity and it's a masterpiece because it's real and current. As Jamie said, when he was playing football and had a bad time, his dad didn't want to look him in the eye, so that I think he felt like he had no help and developped some defender conversa\u021bional behaviour (episode 3). An important lesson is that parents should be more involved in their children lives (ending of episode 4). Nothing can motivate what Jamie did, but he also lied about it! Jamie's parents thought that he can be safe when he is in his room. One of the most hard things that shocked me was the dad's suffering. He thought he failed as a parent and it's destroying him. As a future parent and husband, I want to raise my boy in order to respect women, protect them and not to make fun of them and not beating them! I am very curious to hear your thoughts guys!
