Was trying to kill some time watching La Palma, and I noticed the actors mouths just seemed to look... wrong. Half the time it tracked with the english spoken word, then sometimes it didn't. When I switched back to Norwegian with subtitles, the actors' mouths and teeth looked VERY different.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be an option to turn this \"feature\" off... Netflix, if you're listening, please add the option to remove this cuz it's just extremely off-putting... we already lose a ton of emotion and context with dubs, but at least the physicality of an actor's face would make up for it somewhat. But now... we've even lost those minute facial expressions from actors with this terrible AI replacement feature... please make it an option and not a forced (bug) feature.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm a bit baffled by a situation that is happening. I've had Netflix for over a decade with the same e-mail address. \n\nA few days ago I noticed I couldn't get into an the old e-mail that was tied to the netflix account due to too many attempts at logging in with the wrong password. I did a reset on the e-mail and moved on. Later I tried watching Netflix and I couldn't log in because of a wrong password, again I reset my Netflix password and logged in. Someone probably got that old email and attempted to log in most popular platforms. \n\nHowever when logging in it forces me to pay before I can access any of my account information, payment history, etc. I can't edit my profiles or anything. They took a payment 4 days ago on the same day they normally do so I don't want to re-enter my credit card info just yet. \n\nHere's the part that makes no sense to me, I went on the Netflix support site. (help.netflix.com) and the certificate appears valid. However when I connect with an agent they ask me for my name and e-mail (I'm already logged in but ok weird) and then they send be a form, directly on the chat that asks me to enter my credit card number and it even says on there that the agent will not be able to see what I type.....\n\nAm I going insane or is that like the most common type of scam ever? Obviously I did not enter anything and ended the chat, I mean, I can't believe that a company would ever identify  their customers through their credit card numbers but everything on the site appears to be valid otherwise I'm completely lost. \n\n",

        "content": "We watch shows, we either like them or hated them, but either way, we are done with the show and don't want to see the show again. This could be done by setting a \"Hide\" flag attached to the entire show, it would apply to all shows in the series. For example, we watched all of \"Monk\", so we could set the \"Hide\" flag and we'd never see \"Monk\" again in any search, except a search for \"Hidden\" shows. The thumbs up and down would indicate why the show was hidden.\n\nThere are other shows that we start watching and do not like, will never like, and don't watch to be bothered with ever again. Usually, these are Hallmark movies, but could be anything for anybody. We would mark these as thumbs down and Hidden. Then we are never bothered again with the show. Again, if we change our minds, we can go to the \"Hidden Shows\" page and unhide anything we want.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Some people seem to misunderstand. First - this is a completely optional feature, if you don't mark something as \"hidden\", you would never know the feature exists. Second - filtering out \"hidden\" shows is the default, but can be disabled (un-checked) so all shows would appear if you are looking for something that might be hidden.\n\nOn Netflix's side, this is more data to evaluate user preferences. It will also reduce network data by reducing the results of any report, so should be cost savings after implentation.",

        "content": "I remember a tv show (I think) that's in Spanish (again, I think) I saw years ago on Netflix (possibly around 2018/19). It was a girl who was poor or bullied went to this school where a lot of them were rich. This guy (pretty sure he was blonde) secretly likes her, takes her on dates, etc... but doesn't want anyone to know. I wanna say she was a brunette if that helps.\nHe is insanely popular and rich (possibly royal) invites her to a vacation with his friends. But he rents out a separate place for her to sleep because he was to be able to secretly sneak in at night to stay with her. There was also a scene where she stops by his house to drop off a bag of candy or something and meets his family and realizes he's insanely rich or royal and eats dinner with his family.\nI can't find anything. It's also not Elite since that's the first thing that pops up every time.",

When I'm trying to read about a movie or TV series, Netflix will auto start the show and remove the content I'm reading. It's very annoying. I have turned off the auto preview and auto start next episode. How do I turn off the auto show start? Thanks",

I just finished watching a good Anime on the Netflix website and decided to scroll to see what else to watch and there is a giant list of games I could play. I checked out the \"Manage profile and preferences\" and couldn't find a setting for it. I would very much appreciate to not have to scroll past Games and then again past \"Popular Mobile Games for You\" every time I am looking for a good TV show or movie to watch, since I'll never click on any of them. That list is definitely not for me. Am I missing seeing the setting somewhere?",
