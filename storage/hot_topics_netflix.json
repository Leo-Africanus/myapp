It's still unsolved, but the wild part is they got James Lewis, the only official suspect for decades, to finally talk on camera before he died. He was never charged for the murders, but did serve time for sending a ransom letter. He had refused every major interview, but he agreed to do this one. They gave him the space to talk about his side of the story.\n\nIt is sooo strange how no one thought about approaching him like this before. And if they did, why didn't he talk? It's so bizzare. ",

She knew there was no chance of reconciliation with Kiki and she wanted to remain at the house using whatever means necessary. (She's young and attractive and Peter is over his wife and probably high so he goes along with it.) Simone looks like the victim, but she's really the one in control. Thoughts??",

She leaned on it as he opened it, and she gave him that decent look, like how he looks at her when he always interrupted her interviews. However, it was a bit more with higher eyebrows and felt like there's a question in her eyes, \"what's this supposed to be about?\" She utter in her mind. \n\nThey were at the airport, and Mr. Park asked her, \"Don't you have a suitcase?\" \"What am I, on vacation?\" She replied. \"Right, okay. Bye... have a good flight? Good... morning? See you, bye, bye now, for now.\" \n\nShe gave him that look and turned around and walked away. After three steps, she went to him and smiled while her hands were in her pockets. \"That's a bit off. Why is she smiling?\" He thought.\n\n \"I had a really great time solving this case,\" she said and added, \"Not with you, by the way.\" He smiled. After that, she slowly came closer to him, not being sure how she would do it, but she gave him a peck on his cheek and said, \"Goodbye.\" For her, it was just a kiss of gratitude, saying that she really had a great time with him, not all the time, perhaps. \n\nBut for him, it was a bit off, and felt like she's not herself. \"That's a bit off, why is she smiling?\"",
