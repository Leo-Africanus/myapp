One reason that I found it so entertaining was that the first two episodes set up such a satisfying twist in the last episode.\n\nKC and Everett are hysterical foils of each other, not to mention they're both absolutely fucked as individuals. Everyone interviewed are such good storytellers, having a certain southern style humor/charm that doesn't get old quickly. The ending is so good too; there's a feeling of a hero's redemption with KC which ties the story very nicely. All in all, super impressed and grateful to see Netflix invest in this show.

He just has trouble expressing himself to them becuase he has a lot of emotions and was abused by his mother and father while growing up, who taught him to suppress his emotions. He is completely relatable and it's baffling to me that some people's takeaway from the show is that he's a terrible person. These people missed the point of the show. Bojack is not your abusive ex. Bojack is YOU. And YOU are SECRETARIAT.\n\nTodd, on the other hand is smart but gets distracted easily because of his mental health condition. He has synesthesia, which sometimes becomes so overwhelming that he is often mistaken for being psychotic when he is actually just trying to express his own personal experience. From my perspective as someone who has gone through misdiagnosis, he is struggling with coming to terms with having been diagnosed with a mental health condition that he doesn't believe he has. In short, he is absolutely not as relatable as people seem to think he is.\n\nWhile studying at Bard College, Todd Chavez went through an identity crisis and changed his name to William. Then he changed his name to Timo. I know this becuase he's based on me. Timothy. I went to school at the same time as this show was being written. I am the same age as Todd. I dated a man with a last name that started with H and ended with Man.\n\nAnd I am absolutely not making ANY of this up.\n\n\nNetflix and/or Raphael Bob-Waksberg, you've got some mothereffing 'splaining to do.\n\n\nAnd anyone who wishes to argue about the validity of this or attempt to silence me, stop telling Todd to shut up.

I luckily forgot it for some time but since there are these buttons now in the windows app ui that literally have the numbers \"10\" on them it is even more ridiculous. The rewind is something random between around 10 and 15 seconds. The forward does forward something between 6 and 10 seconds. Unbelievable. Not sure if this is the case on all operating systems, on windows you can easily test it this out with hitting rewind and forward alternately for 5 times each while not playing. What should be the result is that you end up at the same time stamp (I think??), however, you're gonna end up around 30 seconds behind of where you started. ",
