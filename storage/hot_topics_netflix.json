HOW many movies are you able to find that are in 4K available on Netflix? Just find some spare time to search throughout the genres and movies and series and try to do some math and calculation. For an example, search through random 100 movies and write in the comment section the actual result of 4k movies that you find.\n\nI mean, this cannot be serious. I pay 14-15 EURO a month so I can watch movies in 4K and actually there are only a few out of hundreds. How is this possible?\n\nWhose idea was to put Interstellar on Netflix with that trashy resolution? What is it? FHD? Where's 4K? Where's the IMAX 4K version so I can enjoy that?
