        "content": "I know some people get kind of dismissive or annoyed about trigger warnings in movies, but a few months ago I watched my boyfriend die gruesomely in front of me so now I have some ptsd triggers which make me really upset. I'd like to watch Netflix, but not only is it difficult to filter out content warnings, they don't necessarily cover everything or are vague. I'll probably do exposure therapy, but it'll probably be a while and in the meantime I need really gentle things. I don't want to just limit myself to kid's movies though.\n\nList of triggers: asphyxiation, asthma attacks/shortness of breath/wheezing, choking, coughing fits, EMTs, CPR, weird blue/purple skin coloration(confusing sorry) and cerebral palsy (sorry, also hard to explain but it was kind of part of the process), lung issues in general,  and to a lesser extent funerals, grief, dying. Ironically I could watch Sweeney Todd no problem, so I guess unrealistic bloody deaths are okay, plus that one was actually kind of validating in a weird way.\n\nMaybe I can find a list somewhere, and I know it's hard to remember what movies do and don't have these things without having those triggers yourself. My current comfort movie is Napoleon Dynamite which I could technically watch over and over, but I'd like some other options.\n\n\\*edit: I'd also like to stay away from romantic movies for now\n\nThank you!!",
