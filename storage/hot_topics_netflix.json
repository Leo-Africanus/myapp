I love that (it seems at least) she has not done any fillers, botox, or other procedures. I love that she can be fully expressive, she can fully emote, and be comfortable as a woman who is growing and aging. No shade to actresses who do get cosmetic work, the pressure to look young and beautiful all the time must be immense. I was wondering if you noticed how expressive she is as Aggie Wiggs, and if you too felt it refreshing to see a woman in all of her glory take space with her aging face in this show.",

No changes on my end.\n\nFeels like either a Netflix app issue on Chromecast or some kind of profile/handshake bug on Netflix\u2019s side.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this? Any recent Netflix app updates on Chromecast that could explain it?",

I also love Swedish noir.\n\nI feel like it would be popular if David Fincher directed the sequels with the original cast, yes it\u2019s 14 years old but I think everyone in the cast looks good and it could be cool to have them back. \n\nThey could film the second and third books back to back. The two books are basically one story instead of separate story like the first book. All the books after the third are not written by Stieg Larsson. \n\nNetflix could promote the first movie on their main page for two weeks before the other sequels come out for people new to the story. \n\nThe 2011 version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo earned a worldwide box office gross of approximately $239.4 million against a $90 million budget. The film grossed $102.5 million domestically and $136.9 million internationally\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86% \nImdb 7.8\n\n",

Want to download a bunch of content in case the inflight entertainment doesn\u2019t hold up. I\u2019m pretty open to all genres except true crime - I get kind of spooked. Thanks! ",

        "content": "Don't you think the 'supposedly' ideal and small-town setting is getting too monotonous for crime thrillers these days? Same closely knit society and a crime that disrupts its 'harmony'. I have just started watching The Beast in Me but the Oyster Bay setting feels too similar and overdone!\n\n  \n[https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/where-the-beast-me-take-place-setting-netflix-series-explored](https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/where-the-beast-me-take-place-setting-netflix-series-explored)",

        "content": "I just binged all the episodes of The Beast in Me and I loved it. Claire Danes did an amazing job and Matthew Rhys's faces scared the shit outta me. I love a show that has me yelling at my TV. I would like to take this opportunity to list a few of the people in this show who pissed me off.\n\n1. Abbott - Why would you approach someone who you know is a pysopath and serial killer pretty much, all alone, with one weapon? I knew as soon as he followed him he was gonna die, smh. It was so upsetting.\n\n2. Marvin - I completely understand him wanting to help his son and being in denial about how sick he really was, but he was constantly having to clean up Nile's messes. His legacy was also constantly at risk because of Nile's recklessness, but he just kept helping him over and over again. I know that's his son, but I would have called the police on him asap.\n\n3. Shelley - Was anyone else annoyed by Shelley? Why would you be mad at your ex wife for not being able to forgive the man who was driving drunk and caused a crash that killed your child?? And then to blame Aggie for his suicide to her face when she came to you telling you that she thinks Teddy was murdered. Obviously Aggie wasn't 100% in the right for doing things like throwing the brick through his window, but I can understand her anger. Also, having to see him constantly, knowing that he was never punished must have been hell. It's like they all made her out to be the crazy one for being angry.\n\nNile - Obviously he pissed me off cuz his impulse control was dog shit, and he was a terrible person all around, but he made a really good villain. I think a good villain makes the best stories.\n\nHow did ya'll feel?",
