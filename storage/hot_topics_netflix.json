        "content": "\nMy family has been Netflix members since 2018. We live internationally, where I work in education. Like many expat families, we travel frequently - we\u2019ve lived across multiple countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nLast week, my wife traveled overseas to care for her sick mother. Meanwhile, our children and I stayed home for school. We continued using Netflix on our various devices as we always have.\n\nNetflix\u2019s automated system flagged this as \u201cunusual activity\u201d and permanently cancelled our account. When I contacted customer service, I was told:\n\n\u274c There is no appeals process\n\u274c There is no formal complaint procedure  \n\u274c The decision cannot be reversed\n\u274c Seven years of customer history means nothing\n\nThe representative literally said: \u201cOnce the system detected the issue, then there\u2019s no option to recover it.\u201d\n\nSo Netflix\u2019s algorithm is judge, jury, and executioner. No human review. No consideration of our account history. No recognition that international families exist. No way to appeal an automated decision.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fraud prevention - it\u2019s punishing legitimate customers for living globally.\n\n@Netflix - Is this really how you treat long-term international subscribers? Where\u2019s the humanity in your customer service?",

That time has been replaced as of recent by some pretty big misses.\n\nEven the shows I can think of from this year like Untamed, Wayward, Waterfront, Hunting Wives, Black Rabbit etc are all lacking a lot. It feels like the only shows Netflix sometimes hit on are British dramas. \n\nSo if you are reluctant to check it out, don\u2019t be. (In my opinion of course) ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a growing rise in discussions around malicious prosecution, defamation, and misuse of criminal provisions\u2014especially in cases where individuals (mostly men, but not only men) get trapped in false rape allegations.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about undermining genuine survivors. It\u2019s about addressing the *other* reality that no one talks about: people whose lives, careers, families, and reputations get destroyed overnight due to fabricated accusations.\n\nImagine a Netflix-style documentary series that:\n\n* Breaks down **how false cases are usually set up**\n* Shares **real stories** of those acquitted after years of battle\n* Explains **legal rights**, what to do *immediately* after being accused, and how to secure evidence\n* Covers **digital safety**, consensual relationship proof, chats, call logs, and how they\u2019re interpreted in court\n* Includes **lawyers, psychologists, cops, cyber forensics**, and even social commentators\n* Talks about **reform**, misuse, and the balance between protecting victims *and* preventing the weaponisation of criminal law\n\nThis could genuinely help people understand both sides of the system instead of the one-sided narrative we usually get.\n\nWould you watch such a documentary? And what topics do you think it should cover?",
