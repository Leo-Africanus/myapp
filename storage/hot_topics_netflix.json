Hence English dubbing has less effort in it?\n\nAlso English dubbing also has such heavvvyyy American accents. Sometimes I wish that if it's a Spanish show they'd dub with Spanish English accents to keep it more authentic?\n\nWhat do people think? I literally can't listen to English dubbing as it's sooooo bad.",

What they eventually found in his house is wild. And the connection to Lewis is super sketchy.\n\nHonestly feels like this should\u2019ve raised way more red flags back then.
