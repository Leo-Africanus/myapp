        "content": "I just finished The Great Hack on Netflix and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The way the documentary lays out the Cambridge Analytica scandal feels like a thriller more than a history lesson. They follow people who were directly involved  journalists, former employees, even people who had their data pulled into the whole thing  and it shows how personal information became a weapon during elections.\n\nThe film does a really good job of making you see data as more than just numbers on a screen. They literally call it the most valuable resource in the world now, even more than oil, and watching how easily it was collected and sold was pretty disturbing.\n\nI think the scariest part was how much of it happened quietly. Most people had no idea their Facebook likes or quiz answers were being used to build psychological profiles on them. By the time they realized it, the damage had already been done.  It made me think about how much info we all give away without even noticing and it makes you a little sacred or at least made me a little scared. \n\n  \nWhat did you people think, did you like the premise? And also what are some movies like it that I can watch to feed my paranoia lol",

I get that from an entertainment standpoint they did this to increase the shock factor when it\u2019s revealed that she was the catfish but I don\u2019t think they did enough to explain other people\u2019s perspectives of her behavior.\n\nOwen says that he felt she gave him extra attention in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. And the examples he gives probably would have been hard for other adults to pick up on as they would likely just seem like Kendra being somewhat maternal towards him.\n\nBut then Khloe\u2019s dad said that he thought early on that it was Kendra and even mentioned it to the sheriff. But then Netflix completely failed to dive into the reasons WHY he would think that. This makes me think that she was probably doing other strange things if other adults suspected her, whether it\u2019s a history of manic behaviors or inappropriate behavior towards minors it would have made sense to touch on that more rather than trying to stick to this story that she was some completely normal mom who just happened to wake up one day and start tormenting and sexually harassing teenagers out of the blue ",

LADY, no one else has stalked minors and adults with sexual content texts for 22 months as an OOPSIE. Did this make anyone else want to scream at the TV!?\n\n\\-She lies that she started doing this to find out who sent the original texts. She started off aggressive with those texts out of the gate and they escalated. Did anyone else believe her?\n\n\\-She was absolutely obsessed with Owen, and I believe she was hoping to push her daughter, Owen, Khloe or someone to snap and do something.\n\n\\-I think she got off way too easy in this documentary. I am sure they had to make some agreement with her so she'd appear, but man I wish they would've pushed back.\n\n\\-Can anyone answer why she didn't get charged with anything as far as the sexual content to minors went? I mean her texts to Owen and Lauryn were beyond disgusting for 14 year olds. Why was it only stalking and nothing in the substance of the texts? Genuinely asking anyone who knows the law why this would be the case.\n\n\\-I can't imagine all these people living in the small town together after this all went down. I genuinely feel awful for this poor girl Lauryn. You can tell the difference in her after she had gotten some space from her mother's grip and had time to process. Those interviews she was different. She also says \"I hope that my mom gets the help she needs so it doesn't go back to the way it was before.\" I don't think she's just referring to the texts. She's probably been awful on other things.  \n  \nThose are my thoughts / questions. No one I know has watched it yet and dying to hear people's thoughts!!\n\n",

So this whole time you have Elizabeth, this former MI6 agent investigating four murders, and then she finally cracks them, and despite their morally ambiguous nature she takes them to the police anyway. Like Penny killed a man for a woman who would never get justice in the courts. Totally valid in my opinion! There was no justice for women in that day. And then you have Penny\u2019s husband killing a piece of trash businessman to protect his wife. Again, I personally wouldn\u2019t complain. But instead of understanding and saying \u201chm maybe we should not pursue this mystery\u201d she confronts the husband which leads him to killing himself and his wife. And of course this is expected, because jail at that age?? Meanwhile, she lets a crime boss who cut off people\u2019s fingers, steals people\u2019s passports, and is essentially facilitating modern slavery live his life as a floralist because she wants the retirement home to stay open. Talk about double standards?! She has a moral superiority complex for sure. And the Polish guy, Bogdan, was literally just trying to escape what was essentially slavery to see his dying mother, and yet his story is ended when he\u2019s arrested as well. It left such a sour taste in my mouth. These people, who had good reasons to do what they did, got arrested and a crime lord didn\u2019t? And that\u2019s just the end of the movie and Elizabeth gets to dance and pretend like she didn\u2019t ruin three peoples lives? Like WTF??\n\nAlso what is it with everyone confessing to their crimes?? There was no evidence to prove Penny and her husband did anything, but he just admits to it with the slightest pressure. He would\u2019ve been fine otherwise. And Bogdan telling Elizabeth\u2019s husband even though he also had no evidence? Come on, lazy way to conclude the story.\n\nAnyway, TLDR it had so much potential but the ending ruined it",

        "content": "Stranger things last season is coming soon and there hasn't been a season for years, no more shows as good as Dark, Archive 81, Narcos, shows they have like Fear St aren't nearly as good as they use to be, Wednesday Season 2 was pretty boring. I see so many new shows getting scores of 5's and 6's on IMDB when they use to easily get 8's and 9's. ",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t used Netflix in awhile I went on to see there are now ads. That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and all streaming services are starting to do it and now charging more if you want it to be ad free as if they weren\u2019t making enough money already. Unreal Amazon Netflix and also them withholding episodes and stuff instead of releasing the season. Thanks to people complaining about others binge watching. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault you didn\u2019t watch it avoid social media and groups if you don\u2019t want spoilers. People watch shows and discuss them that\u2019s the point.",

        "content": "When I watched L.A. Confidential movie, I couldn't help but feel that Lynn and Exley had this incredible chemistry than what she had with Bud. The way they looked at each other throughout the film made it seem like there were real feelings brewing between them. I\u2019ve never seen her gaze at Bud like that; it was something else entirely when her eyes met Exley\u2019s at the end during their goodbye.\n\nDo you think by the end of the movie, Lynn had developed some feelings for Exley? And maybe he felt something for her too, especially after that night they spent together.\n\nWhat do you think would have happened if Lynn had met Ed before Bud on Christmas Eve? Do you think she would have fallen for him? And what if Exley had been in Bud's shoes during their first encounter? \n\nWere the things Lynn said to Ed while trying to charm him actually true?\n\nWho do you all ship? I can\u2019t help but imagine that after she gets to Arizona and finds out she\u2019s pregnant, it could be Exley\u2019s baby. Just a thought, haha!\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and opinions on all of this!",

Dahmer remains some of the greatest television I\u2019ve ever seen but I was a bit disappointed by the Menendez brothers season. I think the less I know going into the season, the better. Murphy\u2019s storytelling has its misses but is largely impeccable. Can\u2019t wait for season three. ",

What I don't understand is how cheating is becoming normalised, which I find really weird. What do you guys think?",
