But I don't want to see this annoying closed captioning s\\*\\*\\* because... well it is ANNOYING AS HELL. Besides, maybe some native speaker folks want to watch with normal subtitles as well? I imagine watching while eating chips/crisps for example or watching Nolan movies. Or maybe you don't want to turn up the volume too loud.\n\nAlso, why is there stuff included in the CC which one can see? For example there was someone seen spitting on the floor, why would you add \\[spits\\]??? Dude, I see it! It does not happen often but sometimes.\n\nWouldn't it be easy as hell to offer a subtitle-version without CC? All the text is there already anyway, just search and delete everything in square brackets, it can't be that hard for real.\n\nAre they really thinking there is NO ONE who would like subtitles for the original/production language without CC?",

It seems like reviews of non-English shows often get lower ratings or feel less in-depth compared to English-language ones.

It feels like there's a certain disconnect when people aren't accustomed to watching things with subtitles, and it shows in their reviews.\n\nIt seems to me that reviewers who are more familiar with non-English media are able to offer more thoughtful critiques, but those who are less used to subtitles sometimes struggle to engage with the show properly.

        "content": "This is something I've felt strongly for a long time. I am a 22-year-old woman. Ever since I was young, I have always hated the fact that many movies and TV series have sex and nudity scenes. They are not necessary at all, and I think it is very misogynistic for women to have to strip on camera to have these big roles. And no, I do not need to see men naked either. I don't want to see anyone naked, I just want to see a good story.\n\nIt's not comfortable for us to watch, whether I am alone or with family. In fact, even kissing scenes can be uncomfortable when you are watching with your family. They don't need to show us two people kissing to show they are a couple, like we get it.\n\nI've switched to watching Asian, Arabian, and Turkish dramas. No kissing, sex, or nudity required, the plots and acting are much better. Why can't we have that in the West?\n\nA lot of Gen Z feel the same way. We're just gonna boycott more and more movies and series that have sex and nudity.
