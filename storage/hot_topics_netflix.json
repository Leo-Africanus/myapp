        "content": "I just finished the documentary and I was pretty disappointed in the quality of this documentary.\n\nGenerally, it seems like an interesting topic, and something that I remember happening but don't really know the details of; and I feel like the events leading up to and the cause of the outage were covered pretty well. And that's kind of where my compliments on this doc stops.\n\nThe crew they interviewed were somewhat interesting.The lady who was the voice of the ship was had some great detail of the event because she was where the action and decisions were happening. The chef had some funny anecdotes. The Russian lady was solely there to be horny and call Americans stupid.\n\nThey seemingly found the absolute worst passengers to comment on their experiences. There was little more relayed than it was gross and upsetting. The bachelorette party was insufferable and somehow 12 years later hasn't changed a bit. They acted like such stereotypical bachelorette \"woo girls\" that I can't tell if they were putting on an act or if that's genuinely how they are. \n\nThe entirety of the father-daughter footage can be summed up in, \"I was scared and this experience was not what we paid for.\"\n\nI don't know if this was just the interviewees in particular or maybe it's a true cross section of the type of people who go on cruises, but all the passengers acted like pooping in the red biohazard bags was the absolute end of the world. The son in law seemed to care for little else except that. His grand victory was finding a working toilet. That's might have been the highlight of his life. I've shit into wag bags before and carried it out with me. It's not the most pleasant thing but you do what you gotta do. And they didn't even have to pack it out, they could put it in garbage cans around the ship.\n\nAdditionally all the passengers acted like they were alone on a raft weathering the elements, forced to hand deliver their turds into red bags. Let's be real, they say on their asses while the crew did actual work amidst spoiled people on their worst behavior.\n\nI would have loved to hear what the crew was doing to help passengers day to day, and they did a bit here and there, but it was never really covered. And I would have loved to hear what went on interpersonally on the ship between passengers. People were doing shitty things like hoarding and claiming territory, was there bartering? Did people form loose alliances? This could have been an interesting study on human behavior and instead the biggest takeaway was poop lasagna.\n\nAlso, there's a tie for biggest piece of shit between the Carnival Marketing guy and the Cruise Lawyer.  \n\n3/10 - Still not as bad as Untold: The Liver King",
