I went in expecting a typical zombie drama with mindless gore, but wow this was something else entirely.\n\nIt felt like Game of Thrones collided with the zombieverse: the political intrigue, the scheming, the betrayals\u2026 all of it was just as gripping as the horror itself. What really struck me was how the show captured the pettiness and cruelty of human nature how people would rather cling to the throne and their power than save actual lives. That layer made the story so much more haunting than just the undead.\n\nAnd the acting? Absolutely top notch. Every performance carried so much weight that I found myself invested in every character\u2019s fate, even the ones I hated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been putting this one off like I did, don\u2019t.

Goosebumps. \n\nor when I saw bruno in 2009 the whole place erupting with laughter for the whole film, i'll always remember how I felt in that moment, it really was a magical experience all of which has now firmly become a thing of the past with the introduction of streaming services like netflix &amp; what not. \n\nIt really is a shame how the cinema died off &amp; I miss it greatly.

        "title": "Black Rabbit is not good.",
        "content": "I miss the old days streaming. There was a time when Netflix was THE place to be for creative filmmakers  and experimental ideas. Now it seems like every new show that comes out is a remake of the last hit show. Netflix has become YouTube. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the latest Jason Bateman Netflix vehicle. Like Ozark, Jason Bateman directed a few episodes of Black Rabbit and even Laura Linney came back to helm an episode. The new series mostly looks great even if the Dolby Vision presentation is too dark at times. The writing however is abysmal. The writer Zach Baylin, wrote Will Smith\u2019s Oscar winner King Richard and The Crow. \n\nBlack Rabbit is the story of two brothers. Jude Law\u2019s character Jake operates a popular NYC restaurant while Jason Bateman portrays Vince, an addict that has a penchant for trouble. Vince is barely scraping by in Reno, NV when things take a horrible turn. Desperate, he calls his brother Jake for help and he secures a ticket to New York. We soon find out this is a habit for the brothers. Things take a turn for the worse when it\u2019s revealed that Vince has an outstanding debt with a local mobster. \n\nOh and I forgot to mention, the show starts with the climax. You know, because there has to be a hook to grab the viewer. I guess competent plotting wasn\u2019t an option here. \n\nOkay, here\u2019s the problem. The characters make the most illogical choices over and over again. Just when you think they\u2019ve got everything under control some new contrivance shows up out of nowhere and the characters make the wrong call yet again as if they do not know how to operate in their own world. Vince is a menace. A tornado destroying everything and everyone in his path, and not only does he take zero responsibility for his actions, but he blames it on the people trying to help him. Most of the characters are unlikable. Much like Ozark but this show is somehow more miserable. \n\nUnfortunately this show feels like a watered down version of Ozark which in itself was a flimsy knockoff of Breaking Bad. It even features the same style of title cards. I feel like I just watched this show. Successful family, seedy underbelly, and a secret. Last time it was called The Waterfront. Or Bloodline 10 years ago. Wait, has Netflix been doing this the entire time?",

They deftly explore the difficult emotions these characters feel with both humor and genuine honesty. From things like self acceptance (Ben) and fear of dating again (Catherine) to the much more serious undertones of missing a parental figure and wanting to have friends (Ester), and family trauma/relationship dynamics (Nathan and Catherine). The characters feel very truthful, their flaws explored with their good intentions and love for each-other ultimately coming through. \n\nThey touch on these topics while still providing room to develop them, leaving the audience not only excited for more world development but also excited to explore these characters on a deeper level. You can feel the passion from the creators in each episode. \n\nI\u2019m so impressed and excited for this show and really hope Netflix invests in it properly. If they do it could absolutely be a classic! I certainly already have it on my rewatch roster and this season alone is one I know will be watched over and over again :) \n\nThank you to everyone who created and worked on this show for giving us such a gem!

It. Looks. Terrible. Turns out the movie was deliberately shot on a low resolution digital camera to create a raw, gritty quality. Unfortunately the movie looks awful on modern 4K televisions. \n\nThe story begins with the animal to human transmission of a virus which immediately turns the infected into rabid monsters. 28 days later our protagonist Jim, played by a young Cillian Murphy, awakens from a coma to find that society has collapsed, his loved ones are gone, and his life no longer has meaning. His adventure leads to a batshit insane third act that almost seems to switch genres. I liked it, but not as much as I did two decades ago. \n\nA new creative team made a sequel in 2007 but it\u2019s not on Netflix so I didn\u2019t rewatch it. \n\nDirector Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, the original creative team, return to helm the latest in the franchise. In the 23 years since the original, the pair have made great films including Boyle\u2019s Slumdog Millionaire, and Alex Garland\u2019s Ex Machina.\n\n28 Years Later is absolutely GORGEOUS! The lush green hills of England (or Scotland?) are a sight to behold and a much needed contrast from the first film. I watched it in Dolby Vision on an LG OLED and it looks like a tech demo. \n\nA father played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson is teaching his son how to survive in this dangerous world. They live on a tidal island in a peaceful village with its own post fall culture. I enjoyed watching the two movies back to back because it increased my investment in this world. The added lore was fantastic, but they didn\u2019t make the usual mistake of over explaining, and ruining the tension. The new threats are terrifying and succeed at keeping things interesting. Like the first film, 28 Years Later is an adventure that takes a turn in the third act but this time finishes with an even more batshit ending. I am usually not a fan of legacy sequels but 28 Days Later is excellent. With that said, there are strange Terrence Malick-esque dream sequences and images juxtaposed during the first act that confused the hell out of me. Initially perplexing these stylistic choices made sense over time. I think. During some scenes the cinematography looks and feels like a certain video game but that did not detract from my experience. I really like this movie! Check it out and let me know what you think. \n",

        "content": "It was great but like another redditor said, I\u2019ve never wished I could unwatch something. Not like \u201coh haha I wish I could watch this again for the first time\u201d no. I wish I had never watched it.\n\nI\u2019m a 17 year old boy. I feel like an awful person saying this, but I relate to Jamie a lot. I unfortunately saw a lot of myself in Jamie. His outbursts, his overall personality and demeanor, the way he seemed to try to use people and shift the narrative in his favor, etc. I used to be a very aggressive and unpredictable person. I was angry, and even violent. When I would get into a rage, I wanted to hurt people. I\u2019ve done a lot of work on myself, trying my hardest to be better. But watching this brought all of these feelings I thought I had overcome back. Feelings of self doubt. Am I a good person? Could that have been me? I was very manipulative, and I still have tendencies to use people to get what I want, even if not out of malice. It\u2019s made me scared of myself. I always thought \u201cI could never actually hurt someone. Kill someone. I have a conscience, I\u2019m not that bad of a person. I\u2019m not that angry.\u201d But now I don\u2019t know. I still have outbursts from time to time, and that makes me scared of what if one day I go too far? Am I capable of hurting someone in a rage? I take medicines, I see a therapist. I do everything I\u2019m supposed to? \n\nBut should I even be thinking this? Is it concerning that these questions even enter my head? That I have to genuinely think about these things? I would like to say I am a kind, decent person, who has a good moral compass, but what if I\u2019m just kidding myself? What if I\u2019m just pretending? \n\nWhat do you think of my conundrum?\n\n(Ps, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to discuss this, but I figured it was adequate as this has to do with a Netflix series.)",

        "content": "I finished my binge of Black Rabbit and Vince's character irritates me so much. He's the older brother who takes no accountability for anything. It's somehow his brother's responsibility to fix everything he touches.  Jake allows him to do it, which is equally irritating. \n\n1) Vince takes out a lien on his mom's house with loansharks and doesn't pay it back. Somehow it's Jake's responsibility to pay it for him\n2) Vince puts his daughter in harm's way because of the loan and guilt trips Jake \"to think about his niece\" when he didn't give two shits about abandoning his daughter in the first place \n3)  Promises to repay the whole amount not communicating with his brother first about where the money has to be allocated first then gets mad about it\n4)  Agreed to watch the waitress around the predator and she ends up ODing, because he got sidetracked \n5)  Guilts his brother for having money after he worked his ass off at the restaurant. Vince just wants the easy way out everytime like a toxic leech\n\n\nIt's like watching a 50 year old toddler. ",
