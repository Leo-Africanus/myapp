I am so sad because Netflix, in my opinion, does this with so many shows. I wish they would at least commit and do less shows for production. They have so much junk on the platform that is no good, but this was, it really was! Tell me what you ladies and gentleman think below. Am I the only one? I would love to hear your thoughts. ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching Building the Band on Netflix, still on EPISODE ONE LOL and I noticed something that feels a little off. Each contestant performs one by one in to the group of 50, and people are eliminated as the performances go on.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question: doesn\u2019t this give an unfair advantage to contestants who perform later?\n\nFor example, if contestant #3 performs, they\u2019re being judged while all 50 people are still technically in the running. But by the time contestant #40 goes up, a bunch of contestants have already been eliminated, so there are fewer people to compete with or be compared to. That feels like an uneven playing field.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Is there something I\u2019m missing in how the voting or eliminations work that makes it fair? Curious what others think.\n\nOr should I just wait and it will seems clearer later?",

It almost reminded me of one direction when they came together they blended amazingly together for their first performance. Id love to hear others thoughts on the current bands. \n\nBand 2: Landon, Shade, Malik, and Bradley could be an amazing soul/R&amp;B group and I see the potential, loved their auditions and could definitely see them going far!! \n\nBand 1: Donzell, Aaliyah, Cameron, and Katie I dont have too many thoughts on this first group but they had have a lot of powerful voices here and im interested in seeing what direction this group heads in\n\nBand 3: Nori, Wennley, and Brianna \nI think this group needs a fourth, but were quick to rush and form a three piece. It feels like something is missing or out of place to blend all their voices together\n\nOne more band is currently forming but Id love to hear everyones opinions so far! ",

        "title": "UNPOPULAR OPINION: I don't like Rumi and Jinu (also the ship)/Other opinions",
        "content": "Introduction: I originally had a very high expectations for this movie but it turned out just to be kinda boring like what I have thought. These are just my opinions not rage bait. You guys can tell me yours in the comments section.\n\n\nRumi: I originally thought that Rumi would be a level-headed leader. But sadly, after I have rewatched the movie over and over again, Rumi became kinda lovesick after meeting Jinu? At first, she hated Jinu like she hates all demons including herself. She wanted to kill him multiple times, e.g the fight in the bathhouse, the first meeting on the rooftop. But I don't know why she immediately felt so sympathetic towards Jinu. Because Jinu is working for Gwi-Ma and we don't know if he's tricking her or being truthful. \n\nAnother reason that I don't really like Rumi is because of how she treats her friends. I know she has her reasons of not telling her friends about her demon marks. However, I honestly think that Mira and Zoey won't even think it's a big deal. Because during the conversation, Rumi couldn't explain herself and Mira said \"You were hiding this from us? The whole time?\" According to this sentence, I think she was just disappointed and hurt because as we all know Mira wants honesty from her friends because of her insecurities. And when Rumi revealed that she was working with Jinu, Zoey said \"Jinu? You're working with him?\". I think this is just normal reaction as everyone will react this way when they find out their close friend is literally hanging out with their enemy.\n\nThe writers didn't include how the girls met and how they were selected to be demon hunters. And we also don't know anything about their dynamic. So it's really hard for me to sympathize with Rumi as if Mira and Zoey are friends with Rumj for years, I don't think they would mind.\n\nJinu: I know many people will defend him maybe because of his good looks. But in reality, he's the BIGGEST Red Flag in all animation. First, he abandoned his own family to escape his miserable life. And after watching the Korean Comic video, it's even more stupid. Jinu knew he doesn't have the talent of performing music. Then, why would he do so? And his face is literally his biggest advantage and I think he could use this to lure rich women to marry him. I know this is quite evil but I think this is more reasonable. \n\nSecond, he tricked Rumi and lied to her. He used Rumi's fear to his advantage and exposed her secret to her friends and humiliated her in front of her fans. And the saddest thing is how Rumi still thought what they had was real and Jinu told her all that was a lie and just to gain her trust. \n\nSo that's why I am the only one who didn't cry when Jinu sacrificed himself for Rumi as I think it's the bare minimum to fix all his mistakes. And I think logically, Rumi wouldn't still love him. But after I see a lot of reels of this ship, I became hopeless.\n\nMira and Zoey: These two girls are my absolutely favorite besides from Bobby. They have interesting backstories, like Mira was born into a wealthy family but couldn't fit in, Zoey is a people pleaser and thinks she's too much. I think these two girls are more relatable so I enjoy them being on screen, even though they are there for a few minutes.\n\nBobby: Bobby is a absolute sweetheart and very kind to three of the girls. And it's interesting to go deeper of why he became the manager of Huntrix and why he was so insecure of failing the expectations of fans.\n\nSuggestions for a possible sequel: I know millions of fans still want Saja Boys and want Jinu to come back. But I personally think that this will ruin the possible development for all the characters. We need to go deeper to find different clues from characters like how they acted that way and the relationships between each other, not just focusing on a forced \"enemies to lovers\" romance. And I think this can be more interesting and maybe bring some good morals to inspire others.",

        "title": "The story of kpop demon hunters was really weird (SPOILERS)",
        "content": "KPop Demon Hunters is an extremely fun movie, with banger songs, amazing vocal performances, and godly animation (sony is so good at this style). Yes, i loved the movie, but the story just left me confused at the end.\n\nWhile watching the movie, I thought that the movie was about how no one is truly evil, and everyone deserves a second chance. The evidence of this being the girls not wanting to use a diss track to make the golden honmoon because they didn't want to do it with hate, and also Jinu's whole backstory. Yes Jinu did leave his child but Rumi said in the movie that that's not all he is, which led me to believe that this would serve as a signal that demons can also be good. Also, Gwi Ma was the one who used the demons fears to take control over them, so they couldn't be completely at fault.\n\nDespite all this, Gwi Ma dies (which is expected), but every demon dies as well. Are we to believe that all of them deserved that death? Because that's not the message the movie was hinting at earlier. Jinu dies, and yes it could be argued that he paid the price for his sins, but I'd argue that 400 years of tormenting voices of his family was enough torture for the character. I feel like it would've been more interesting if they'd explored the idea of Gwi Ma being evil, and demons the humans who made mistakes and are now paying the price.\n\nThe plot point of Rumi being a half demon was interesting, and led to the actual message of the movie, of not being ashamed of you are, but it could've been explored more. The same applies to her relationship with Celine, which was just served to us through flashbacks.\n\nAlso, not a real criticism, but just a side note, what happened to the missing persons cases, cause their souls are just gone? Was the identity of Gwi Ma and Saja being demons now known to everyone? Did everyone just accept that fact?\n\nTLDR; fucking amazing animation, songs, voice acting (glad they didn't do chris pratt as jinu), and an extremely fun movie, but the plot left more to be desired\n\n  \n(Also, the sort of romance between jinu and rumi was weird, it's literally the 1000 year old anime girl that looks like she's 9 years old, but a little better)",
