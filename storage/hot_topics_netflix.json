        "content": "I just finished Black Rabbit and honestly, I think it\u2019s one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen in a long while.\n\nExciting and unpredictable \u2013 Every episode had me hooked. There\u2019s this constant tension and unease that made me lean in, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\nEmotionally provoking \u2013 It\u2019s rare for a show to hit so many emotional notes; anger, sadness, empathy, anxiety and dread. All in the same arc. I found myself genuinely caring about what happened to the characters.\n\nCharacters you invest in \u2013 Even when they\u2019re flawed or making questionable choices, I couldn\u2019t help but root for them or at least understand them. That level of writing and acting is what kept me so engaged.\n\nActing \u2013 Top-tier. The performances felt layered, raw, and real, like you\u2019re watching people rather than actors.\n\nCinematography \u2013 The dark, grey tones of NYC were such a perfect backdrop. It wasn\u2019t just filmed in New York; the city itself felt like a character. That moody aesthetic pulled me in even deeper.\n\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand at all is why The Guardian gave it a negative review. Honestly, did we even watch the same show? For me, it delivered on every front; storytelling, visuals, acting, and atmosphere.\nEdited to add the music matched the dark and gritty theme so well also!\n\nOverall, Black Rabbit just worked. It\u2019s one of those rare shows that stays with you long after the credits roll.\n\n\nAnyone else feel the same way, or equally baffled by the negative takes?\n\n",

I mean, in season 2 he spent the whole time basically volunteering his services for another PD lol. Meanwhile, Detective Frost is more realistically part of a department and has an amusing relationship with a boss who actually makes professional demands of him. There\u2019s pretty good running jokes about the growing piles of unfinished paperwork associated with cases backing up. Lastly, he takes mentoring younger members of the department seriously and that\u2019s pretty sweet to see. \n\n",

Designed by a top-tier architect and her genius engineer of a brother, but beaten by a blockhead with a prison formation to be electrician. And for their super AI (that is CRUCIAL to the plan) not to have a back-up source of power was a bit too much for me.\n\nAaaaand, the CEO's associate's whole arc was basically useless. The dude had a perfect love story (orchestrated by the gang to serve the plan) but got a random info that made him doubt everything. And when we thought he was about to make the whole thing fail..... the gang just offs him. One pushed him into the other's arms, the latter breaking his neck just likmke that, on the street. Unless this death plays an important part in a potential second season, this arc was pointlessly focused upon.\n\n\nAnd tge final problem I have with how mister blockhead \"Muh, my dad's pathetic and my mom's a psycho that regrets I was born\" managed to get out. The command center just needed to cut the power to stop the final elevator. This would have given their staff ten times the time to, idk, release the elevator and off the guy. But no, they all watch him reach the exit (I know he had a tablet, but that wasn't gonna do jack if  the power was cut)",

        "content": "I like to really explore Netflix and find any kind of show that\u2019s fantasy, mythological-romance, with a hint of morale thinking of humanities nature. The shahmaran is that show and it\u2019s sooooooo good! Like so good I need to come on here and tell more people about it so a 3rd season can be made!!. It\u2019s in Turkish and I think watching it in its original language but with subtitles is the best way to go. I don\u2019t understand Turkish but having the English voice overs just doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m watching the same show. And sheesh, the chemistry of the main characters \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 anyways, can I spread this love to my American peeps and any other country that doesn\u2019t know about the show shahmaran??Please please watch it, get the views up, so I can get more seasons haha \ud83e\udd23 ",

        "content": "We watch Netflix through a BenQ projector. If we watch Netflix through our AppleTV or Sony DVD player, every 5-15 minutes, the episode info box pops up from the bottom of the screen. When you click \"back\" on the remote, it goes away but then the progress bar remains. If we watch Netflix through the Android TV that came with the projector, we don't have this problem but the AndroidTV often doesn't boot up or has some other problem so we prefer not to use it.\n\nI've done factory resets on the AppleTV, the DVD player and the AndroidTV and downloaded all the updates for the projector. We've tested disabling remotes in case one of them is faulty. None of these things work.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? And if so, how did you solve it?",
