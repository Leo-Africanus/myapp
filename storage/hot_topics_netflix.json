        "content": "A Deadly American Marriage\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m missing something\u2026 but it seems like Molly and her dad are absolutely guilty ? The only basis of an argument her lawyer can make for the retrial is the fact that Jason had mentioned to a counselor that he was more angry, and the secret voice recordings. But I feel like 1) if someone who doesn\u2019t even have guardianship of your own kids is actively trying to separate you from your kids, you\u2019re going to be very stressed ? Also, the secret voice recordings don\u2019t even show any abuse IMO ? They are arguing, and they both raise their voices, but Jason does NOT seem as aggressive as they are trying to paint him as. And the fact that they called it a threat that he was threatening Molly about taking the kids away\u2026 THEY ARNET EVEN HER KIDS ? Legally or biologically !! She never adopted them !! The other argument was regarding Jason\u2019s first wife. But professionals from Ireland who worked with the autopsy said that it still was not strangulation that caused Mags death. It could\u2019ve been a different medical condition that appeared to be an asthma attack at the time, but that does not warrant that Jason strangled her. Am I on the wrong side? Do people seriously think Mollys innocent ?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, starting a new thread because the current one is under joe Rogan and that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. For anyone who watched this doc and thought that something didn\u2019t feel right about these kids and their situation-you\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s what I saw-children who are in, essentially, an isolated cult where they have to think like their parents and abide by some insane rules or they\u2019ll be rejected. They have to eat raw liver, raw testicles, raw innards, and apparently 15 raw eggs a day. Didn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any additional food in the house or in their diet. Sleeping on wood slats, not allowed to wear proper clothing or shoes. When they were pretending to kill a cow (because it had already been shot) the men who weren\u2019t part of the family and out there were in LAYERS-coats and warm clothing while the children were barefoot and in shorts and T shirts. The mom admitted that the son had a compound fracture in one of his legs that didn\u2019t get medical attention for at least 24 hours because \u201cpain won\u2019t kill you\u201d. She framed it\nLike he didn\u2019t ask but that\u2019s a lie. That child was either too afraid to ask for help or she told him \u201cpain won\u2019t kill you\u201d. The whole thing smacks of child abuse-physical and psychological. Clearly CPS has already been involved because he brought it up but then lied and said they got there, saw the kids and said \u201cwhat am I doing here? These kids are fine and left two minutes later\u201d. That\u2019s what a pathological liar would say-he\u2019s making up stories. Kind of like the rest of his entire life-his wife might be even worse as an enabler and someone who supports the lies and admits that she\u2019d never come clean on the lies. Those children seem extremely isolated and forced to live in this insane reality their mentally ill but extremely rich father is enforcing. I called CPS and filed a report. I\nEncourage anyone who shares these concerns to do the same. Yes, it\u2019s wild to file a report based on a Netflix doc but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen child abuse from content creators-far from it. These people think they\u2019re gods and they\u2019re sick. And ultimately the children suffer. Yes, I realize it also could be totally fake. But let CPS determine that. 1-800-252-5400 here\u2019s their phone number, apparently his home address is 13876 longwood drive, Willis, Texas. This is public information already available online. \n",

        "content": "I just finished the new American Manhunt series for Osama Bin Laden. It was very interesting to hear the perspective of the CIA including the analysts and see the tense atmosphere inside the White House. \n\nI watched Zero Dark Thirty when it originally came out and I am now rewatching it. What do you feel like was left out of the movie or changed or just felt different in the movie versus the documentary? ",

        "content": "A Prophet (2009), directed by Jacques Audiard, is a gripping French crime drama that follows Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French-Algerian sentenced to six years in a brutal prison. Illiterate and alone, Malik, played by Tahar Rahim, navigates a dangerous world divided by Corsican and Muslim gangs. Initially vulnerable, he\u2019s coerced by Corsican mob leader C\u00e9sar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to kill a Muslim prisoner, earning protection but entangling him in the gang\u2019s power structure. As Malik learns to read and secretly studies Corsican, he gains cunning and ambition, balancing loyalty to C\u00e9sar with covert alliances, including with Muslim inmate Ryad.Through gritty realism and intense performances, the film charts Malik\u2019s transformation from naive outsider to calculating player, orchestrating drug deals and manipulating rival factions. Haunted by visions of his victim, Malik grapples with guilt and identity while seizing opportunities during prison leaves to build his own criminal network. The story explores themes of survival, power, and cultural tension in a claustrophobic prison setting. As Malik outmaneuvers C\u00e9sar, he emerges as a new kind of leader, blending ruthlessness with strategic brilliance, setting the stage for his inevitable rise in the criminal underworld upon release.",
