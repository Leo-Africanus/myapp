The part where she said she had a library fetish and the faces she was making when saying professor\u2026..I paused the movie several times because of her. I also noticed she acts the same in every movie? I\u2019m so upset because the book was actually good. The movie was just rushed honestly would\u2019ve made more sense to put it in a show. Though im not sure I could sit through an entire series with Sofia\u2026. ",

My problem is that Netflix appears to base where i am off of which tv I sign into, which is causing me problems. I get a week or so where everything is fine, then it starts telling me the tv isn't part of my home account. Is there any way I can possibly watch Netflix on a multitude of different tv's without adding every single one of them to my \"home account\"?! ",

Many people have to say no to sandwiches and cake or they gain weight very easily. If they gain weight and are fat do you think the two main characters would date them? Hell no! They wouldn't be attracted to them. Many people would have to starve all day to get to eat 1/4 of that sandwich or cake and not gain weight, especially doing it often. It is not worth it to be miserable all day hungry just to eat a sandwich because a hot guy wants you to. I'm not saying don't treat yourself, but the way they portrayed people making healthier choices to stay thin compared to thin people getting to eat what they want were kinda disgusting!\n\nAlso, how are you going to just let yourself into someone's house because you know the code? The audacity! ",
