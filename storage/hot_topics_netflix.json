You can also choose to **hide** watched stuff (though fair warning: hiding is kinda glitchy right now lol) You can click the extension icon to open a full list of what you\u2019ve marked, jump straight to those shows, or remove stuff from the list. It\u2019s been super helpful for me since Netflix doesn\u2019t have anything like this. Its completely open source and safe.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to improve the extension just send me a dm or comment here, I will try to improve it by your feedback.

After that he started posting about how ugly she is,  but he never upload the picture of mask girl identity.\n\nAfter that scene, that jerk died and Kim mo mi killed Mr jo in her apartment. Mr jo never released any identification of mask girl in public.\n\nThey how the hell everyone all of a sudden knows who the real mask girl is? \n\nI know, Mr jo and Mo mi both disappeared from their office. But it doesn't highlight that Mo mi is mask girl! \nYes Mr jo's computer if full of mask girl pictures but he also have many other girls picture in different folder.\n\nIf a person disappeared, nobody gonna suspect the idol or actors they followed, it's stupid.\n\nAm I missing out something or it's just a plot hole?\n*NO SPOILER PLEASE*",

        "content": "I adore Love &amp; Anarchy, especially Sophie\u2019s character, she\u2019s unapologetically trying to be herself while navigating all the chaos in her life, and I relate to that. I\u2019ve already watched the series almost four times, and I\u2019m craving something with a similar quirky, emotional, and slightly unconventional vibe. \n\nAny recommendations for shows with complex, bold female leads and that mix of humor, romance, and depth? Open to both international and English-language series!",
