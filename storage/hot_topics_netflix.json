        "content": "My first example is from the new show Trigger. A man nearly rapes a woman, and the main character (an officer) arrives just in time to stop it. He checks the perimeter and leaves his partner to look at the man\u2019s ankle monitor. The man then tries to kill the partner, but the MC stops him just in time. And guess what happens next? The MC slams him to the ground, then he and his partner just walk away\u2014leaving a man who just attempted sexual assault and murder completely free.\n\nAnother example is in Alice in Borderland. There\u2019s a recurring character who repeatedly tries to rape people, and the group has multiple chances to get rid of him. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but one scene had the main character strangling this guy after he tried to assault what seemed to be his love interest. Yet, instead of finishing it, he just lets him live\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get what kind of message the writers are trying to send here, but it feels like it completely falls flat. Why are they portraying rape like it\u2019s something that can just go unpunished?\n",

I cancelled my Netflix at 630am, by 930 I somehow had upgraded. The funny thing is the cancelation was put in during the weekday when everyone was at either school or work. Netflix of course had no answer for me other than I made the mistake. I suggest anyone trying to cancel, call the customer service number and have them delete your payment method. ",

        "content": "Disclaimer - I don't expect 100% realism in fiction. That's what documentaries are supposed to be for. I'm also a big sci-fi fan, so I can enjoy watching fantastical and implausible scenarios.\n\nBut I just don't see the point of setting a TV show in a real-world setting if you are going to completely distort that setting. That just makes it annoying, not fun.\n\nThis brings me to Hostage, the new political thriller about a British Prime Minister's husband being kidnapped, starring Suranne Jones and Julie Delpy. The sheer number of inaccuracies in the show are too numerous to point out (Oldham FC, anyone?). Mostly, they are the result of sloppy shortcuts in the writing.\n\nSo I'll just focus on the big one. The premise itself is simply not viable. There's absolutely no point in a kidnapper demanding that a British PM resign, because they can resign and then be reinstated almost immediately after the victim is released. Even if the kidnapper insisted on them resigning as a Member of Parliament, this presents only a minor technical hurdle to them being re-appointed.\n\nI can forgive shows taking liberties with reality if they're getting to the heart of an emotional issue. But this show doesn't do that because the whole family vs country dilemma doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Yet again I despair at the TV industry spending millions of pounds bringing together a huge agglomeration for talent for something that doesn't make the slightest sense.",

If the fight scenes are half as good as in S1 they will still be better than those of 95% ofcall other series. \nIf they can keep the theme's of alienation, racisme, sexisme and discrimination in the Edo period, something Anime often overlooks, and the amazing sounddesign from S1 Blue eye Samurai S2 can become a instant classic like Arcane.\nCan't wait.",

        "content": "I saw a clip of&gt;! AB Wynter jumping out of a window !&lt;and I cannot find it. I saw it as a meme under a caption unrelated, but I have no idea where and what it was from. Maybe it was a trailer or something. Help me find it please. \n\n  \nSide note, I thought it was a phenomenal show. Just binged the last couple episodes with my lady. Top Notch production and very great casting. Great pacing. A little drawn out during certain moments, however the writing was phenomenal. Maybe I haven't watched a very very good murder mystery, but this was really good. I dont know what the general consensus is, It was a netflix show I took a shot on and it was a good shot. ",
