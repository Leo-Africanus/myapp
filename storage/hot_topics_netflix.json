        "content": "I just rewatched Dash &amp; Lily after having a pretty rough week, and I\u2019m kind of emotional about it.\n\nI first watched it when I was 14, and I don\u2019t think I realized at the time how much it shaped my idea of what love should be. That show genuinely formed the way I see romance, as something pure, intentional, and almost\u2026 perfect in its imperfection.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most spectacular or dramatic series ever. It\u2019s not trying to shock you or overwhelm you. It\u2019s just balanced. A little humor, a little sadness, a little awkwardness, a little magic. But somehow it all comes together in a way that feels so safe and warm.\n\nThe whole notebook concept, two people connecting through words before really knowing each other  it just feels so sincere. Like love doesn\u2019t have to start with fireworks or chaos. It can start with understanding. With curiosity. With vulnerability.\n\nAnd the atmosphere?? The Christmas vibe in New York City, the bookstores, the quiet moments, the soundtrack it creates this world that feels softer than real life. Like there\u2019s space to breathe.\n\nWatching it again now, after feeling kind of suffocated by the world lately, it still gives me that same healing feeling. Like maybe out there, somewhere, there really is someone who fits you in that almost poetic way. The right timing. The right dynamic. The \u201cthis makes sense\u201d kind of connection.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t rewatch it sooner. I think I\u2019m going to make it a thing now anytime life feels heavy, I\u2019m putting it on.\n\nIt might not be the most complex show ever made. But to me? It\u2019s perfect. And I kind of owe it for shaping the part of me that still believes love can be something pure.",

I\u2019ve read complaints about the poor acting, but I couldn't care less because I actually enjoy a bit of trashy love triangle drama. However, one thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between the sisters, Adriana and Elise. They literally went from loving each other to being die-hard enemies wishing the worst on each other within five minutes. It didn't just happen once, it felt like it happened every single episode. It was laughable and made zero sense. Another thing that bothered me was how unrealistic the money situation was. Being 30k in debt is laughable if ALL of your pro athletes are going to the World Finals. I don't know exactly what figure skaters make, but I do know what sponsorships pay for a whole roster of World Champs. It made the debt plot point feel really weird. Also, why was there no winning party at the end? That felt like a huge missed opportunity!",

        "content": "I think some words got changed or missed in the translation, but as far as I could understand, simon's mom lied about kitty's grandma having an affair with simon's dad, but I don't get why she did so? I mean it looked like she loved her little sister a lot but why did she lie about them having an affair or was it a lie or just she revealed the truth in front of the family which caused the disownment ?",

Then at the house they find a frozen Chinese family and he shouts, \"mom!\" Was it his family, did he take them to his house instead? I didn't get it",

        "content": "I wanted to watch Dhurandhar because it was so hyped, but there was no English dubbing available. I checked some other Indian movies and it seems most are the same. Why is there no English audio track available?\n\nEdit: for all the subtitles commenters - yes, I know they exist geez I watched the movie with subtitles!! The question I asked was about dubbing specifically. How do you ppl even read subtitles when it is such a challenge to read a simple question here lol",
