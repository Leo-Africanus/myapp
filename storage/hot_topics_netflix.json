It is rare that I stop endlessly trying to find something good and binge a show like I did here. 2 days, binged Kaos. I was so damn invested. Canceled. Guess I will go back to watching 20 minutes and clicking off of all the garbage they seem to love spending money on. They fumbled the Witcher real hard as well. I hope to hell they don't snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with One Piece too. I do not have high hopes for netflix in the long term with such blind idiots pulling the strings.

Every scene felt like a TED Talk no one asked for \u2014 dripping with self-righteousness, emotional manipulation, and smug therapist energy.\n\nShe didn\u2019t help Simone out of love. She helped so she could own it. So she could parade around as the long-suffering savior. That wasn\u2019t compassion. That was martyrdom weaponized.\n\nThe way she guilt-tripped, overstepped, and then had the audacity to call Simone \u201ctoxic\u201d? Nah. She was the emotional vampire of the show \u2014 draining everyone with her need to be seen as \u201cthe good one.\u201d And when Simone stopped giving her the validation she fed on, she suddenly flip-flopped from hating Michaela to loving her? Girl. That was jealousy, not healing.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t handle not being the center of Simone\u2019s emotional world. So she punished her. Classic narcissist behavior in a wellness cape.\n\nEven when she had a point, she was so smug about it that I found myself rooting against her just on principle. And that cruise? Please. She stayed behind with their dad just so she could get gold stars for suffering. It wasn\u2019t selfless \u2014 it was performative.\n\nJustice for Simone. And prayers up for anyone who\u2019s had to survive a Devon in real life.",

        "content": "Many of us love a good procedural. Adolescence was unique in many ways. The single shot experience is amazing. But contrasted with Dept Q, it really showcases a slowed down, normal way of talking that is rare in tv. I'm very much into the story of Dept Q, but far too often the characters are slinging witticisms, even normal ideas, back and forth clearly faster than normal cognition allows. Nothing too wrong with it, its exciting and fun. In early Guy Ritchie movies its amazing. When Jeremey Brett does it as Sherlock Holmes you believe it. But in this show, for me at least, it kinda breaks the spell. Adolescence told a great story in four episodes, and every character was understandably too busy digesting the situation and processing their emotions to be pumping us with dialogue - that is great tv! Fast pace high level dialogue is a choice, a gamble, and ultimately a hard sell, especially for a 'procedural.' ",

If you notice Raymond said that she slept with her college professor and ended his career. I also think a highschool boyfriend too. I think her meds keep her functioning normally, but as she got off them her \u201csiren\u201d ways came out. I think her dad saying it would just be them and touching her was a trigger and going to take Michaela\u2019s role as Mrs. Kell was her response. A trauma response for survival. So interesting!

Could they have restarted it and are pretending it's a child who guessed our details?",

        "content": "If I ignore the origonal anime's existence is Bet enjoyable? My parents quite enjoyed Alice in Borderland so i'm on the search for other live action adaptations of manga to watch with them as its nice to share my intrests with them and sadly my mum hates anime so they have to be live action. I LOVE kakeguri and I have a feeling based on the trailer of Bet that if I go into it wanting an even slightly faithful adaptation of Kakegurui i'll hate it, but if I go in ignoreing the anime is it a good show on its own?",
