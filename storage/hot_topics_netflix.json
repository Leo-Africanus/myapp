It doesn\u2019t even consider the app to have been opened, as I cannot force close it like you can other apps. \n\nI\u2019ve watched it on my phone within the last week, and for some reason it has now decided to no longer work. I\u2019ve deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, neither have worked. I can\u2019t even watch it on the internet browser as it just goes to a page that forces you to go to the app or manage account info. After even more troubleshooting, I have deleted the app and restarted my phone, no fix. Restarted my phone and left it off for ~5 minutes, no fix.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know any fixes? Help would be much appreciated. \n\nEdit: after dealing with 3 agents, no amount of troubleshooting has resolved the issue. Clearing cookies from my browser, cookies from Netflix itself, nothing will work. I\u2019m going to open a ticket tomorrow and will keep this post up in case anyone has a similar issue\n\nEdit 2: there\u2019s an update for Netflix now, fixed the issue. Guess it was a bug. ",

        "content": "Recently built a new PC, added a 4K display to my existing 2K one and saw the only way to get 4k Netflix on PC was with the Microsoft Store windows app. Downloaded this, used the Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q trick to see the stats and was excited to see it streaming at beautiful 4K. Once I went full screen I then noticed consistent stuttering, but strangely if I come out of fullscreen and play it in window (even maximised) it doesn't stutter at all.\n\nEndless reddit/googling has lead me to try the following, none of which worked:\n\n\\- Disabled HAGS (made no difference)  \n\\- Disabled AMD Freesync (wasn't enabled in the first place, tried enabling, disabling, no difference)  \n\\- Referenced against other programs, YouTube 4K stream no issue, VLC 4K media playback no issue. Issue seems isolated to Netflix alone.\n\nFor reference specs are 9800X3D, 9070XT, 32GB DDR5, 2TB M.2. This is literally a fresh build with all latest drivers installed, thinking possibly:\n\n\\- As the GPU only launched a couple days ago maybe the drivers are so new this is a bug?  \n\\- I run a 4K 60Hz (on HDMI) and a 2K 165Hz (on DP) as my monitors (the 2k being my primary for gaming etc) I've read there's issue with windows and different Hz monitors, but I feel like I've gone down an endless rabbit hole of things it could be related too including HDCP? Any other ideas? I can watch maximised as a workaround for now, just really strange that the stutter only happens when it's fullscreened (as I understand it the windows app is built on edge so maybe related to that too?)",

        "content": "It seems we have been having a lot of talk about AI Agents and Manus just got released by a Chinese Startup.\n\n It made me think about the many conversations with people I have had and even own family members that find online streaming service content itself can throw people off balance because it is so much. Netflix was vocal about making a TV channel that was cultivated for people to offset the enormity some find with the catalogue, and as it keeps on expanding, it might become worse for people who have this feeling.\n\n  \nWhich then means an AI Agent would be perfect for the streaming services because you could just tell it to find the best movies of an actress or whatever genre you were feeling, and then it could go and search through the huge catalogue for you :D",

        "content": "I know Meghan Markle gets a lot of hate, but honestly, I actually liked her show. It feels like people dismiss it because of who she is, rather than judging it fairly. If you actually watch it with an open mind, it\u2019s enjoyable in its own right. As someone who watches lots of lifestyle/ cooking shows, she actually uses lots of good cooking/ home making techniques. She has a warm, calming presence that makes it easy to watch. The cinematography, the food, the storytelling\u2014it\u2019s well-produced and enjoyable. I mean she is exploring something she loves \u2013 She clearly enjoys what she\u2019s doing, and I respect that.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014of course, she\u2019s not filming in her own house. Security risks aside, most food and lifestyle shows aren\u2019t filmed in the host\u2019s actual home. People are just looking for things to criticize.\n\nShe\u2019s trying her hand at something new, something she clearly loves. Why is that such a crime? Not everything has to be groundbreaking\u2014sometimes, it\u2019s just about making something enjoyable.\n\nIf it\u2019s not your thing, that\u2019s totally fine, but hating for the sake of hating is just unnecessary. Anyone else actually like the show?",

        "content": "I am watching episode one of this horrible story \ud83d\ude14 there are so many mistakes made on all accounts. Just to start with in the first episode when the police stopped them and spent time with them to figure out what was going on. Why would they put Him in the Hotel room and have the young girl (Gabby) sleep in her car? I know this is a minor question considering this being a horrible story but it just shocked me? Anyone have any ideas on this?",
