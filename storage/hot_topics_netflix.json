Which means if I need to access them after having scrolled down a few rows of content, I have to scroll all the way up again one row at a time to get to them. Alternatively the \u201cBack\u201d button can take you there but that\u2019s not intuitive at all?!\n2. The content cards should be zoomed out at least 2x to see more content in one screen, right now on a 55 inch screen I can see only 3.5 content cards in one view which seems quite restrictive and way more no. Of clicks than required when I\u2019m browsing through content to find something to watch.\n\u2014-\nDoes anyone know if there is an option for users to revert to the older version? :(",

It\u2019s a proper amount of mysterious but powering through  and are more reflective of real life where everyone has their own struggle.  The main plot was great.  Ending was awesome.\n\nThere needs to be a season 2.  I need more of this.  Netflix - are you listening?  Season 2.",

        "content": "Just watched K-Pop Demon Hunters and honestly, I LOVED it. The concept, the animation, the music, the action \u2013 it was such a fun ride with way more emotional depth than I expected. But I really hope this isn\u2019t the end and they continue the story, either with a sequel or (fingers crossed) a full series.\n\nThere\u2019s just so much more they could explore. Like, we never got the full story of how Rumi's mom fell in love with a demon?? That could be an entire arc on its own. Also, how did the girls even meet and form the band? The dynamic is so strong, and I\u2019d love to see those early days \u2013 both as idols and as demon hunters.\n\nPlus, the demon threat is definitely not over. At the end, the new Honmoon wasn\u2019t gold, which I\u2019m sure means demons can still escape into the human world. That feels like a huge open door for future stories.\n\nAnd okay, can we talk about Jinu?? I know he died, but he gave his soul to Rumi \u2013 what if that means he could come back? Maybe not as a human, but as an angel or some kind of spirit warrior? I feel like his story isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just hoping enough people support the movie so the creators get the green light to keep building this world. There\u2019s so much potential!\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

And that's kind of where my compliments on this doc stops.\n\nThe crew they interviewed were somewhat interesting.The lady who was the voice of the ship was had some great detail of the event because she was where the action and decisions were happening. The chef had some funny anecdotes. The Russian lady was solely there to be horny and call Americans stupid.\n\nThey seemingly found the absolute worst passengers to comment on their experiences. There was little more relayed than it was gross and upsetting. The bachelorette party was insufferable and somehow 12 years later hasn't changed a bit. They acted like such stereotypical bachelorette \"woo girls\" that I can't tell if they were putting on an act or if that's genuinely how they are. \n\nThe entirety of the father-daughter footage can be summed up in, \"I was scared and this experience was not what we paid for.\"\n\nI don't know if this was just the interviewees in particular or maybe it's a true cross section of the type of people who go on cruises, but all the passengers acted like pooping in the red biohazard bags was the absolute end of the world. The son in law seemed to care for little else except that. His grand victory was finding a working toilet. That's might have been the highlight of his life. I've shit into wag bags before and carried it out with me. It's not the most pleasant thing but you do what you gotta do. And they didn't even have to pack it out, they could put it in garbage cans around the ship.\n\nAdditionally all the passengers acted like they were alone on a raft weathering the elements, forced to hand deliver their turds into red bags. Let's be real, they say on their asses while the crew did actual work amidst spoiled people on their worst behavior.\n\nI would have loved to hear what the crew was doing to help passengers day to day, and they did a bit here and there, but it was never really covered. And I would have loved to hear what went on interpersonally on the ship between passengers. People were doing shitty things like hoarding and claiming territory, was there bartering? Did people form loose alliances? This could have been an interesting study on human behavior and instead the biggest takeaway was poop lasagna.\n\nAlso, there's a tie for biggest piece of shit between the Carnival Marketing guy and the Cruise Lawyer.  \n\n3/10 - Still not as bad as Untold: The Liver King",

Just wanted to hear other people's opinion on this bc I haven't been able to see any discourse about this anywhere else but I finished watching KDH and I felt the ending fell a bit flat for me.\n\nSpoilers ahead, if you haven't seen it.\n\n\nThe entire setup was rooted on how Rumi's double identity potentially changes the perspective of hunters' roles and what demons are. I thought Rumi coming into terms with her identity and who Jinu was, making a new Honmoon meant accepting that demons were just manipulated by Gwi-Ma.\n\nInstead, though, we get Jinu as the only redeemable demon who sacrifices himself, and the rest of the Saja Boys getting killed together with other demons. \n\nSo my question really is, how is the new honmoon any different for the demons ? Is it only different for Rumi?",
