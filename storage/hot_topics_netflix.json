A few years back, things like Stranger Things, Narcos, and Mindhunter felt bigger, more original, and easier to get hooked on. I actually looked forward to new seasons dropping.\n\nNow I open Netflix and spend way too long scrolling, adding things to my list but never pressing play. A lot of new shows feel rushed or forgettable, even if the idea sounds good on paper. I still watch Netflix, but the excitement isn\u2019t the same.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way, or do you think the quality really changed? Are there any newer shows that gave you that old Netflix feeling again?",

        "content": "I\u2019m just here to hate for a second and just see what everyone thinks. I\u2019ve never really watched Emily in Paris, so I do not have in depth analysis nor do I know the correct terms for screenwriting or cinematography techniques. Anyways, my family has been watching the latest season during the holidays so I\u2019ve seen a few clips here and there and just sat down to watch a full episode with my mom \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that this show is like in ultra HD. Everything is so detailed and at the same time layered in a thick coat of matte that it literally hurts my eyes. The world is just too spotless and it\u2019s uncanny to watch. \n\nWhy does the world seem to exclusively revolve around Emily? Almost every scene is structured in a way that seems like the other characters only react when Emily walks in or does something. It gave me the feeling of playing a video game and getting a dialogue prompt. Also, multiple times in the episode Emily would effortlessly just resolve issues or make the correct decision and everything just works out for her (minus the main drama with her best friend sleeping with the guy I assume is her ex). Is no one else capable of having a good idea or an original thought? \n\nThe writing and staging is just horrendous. Every scene is like 30 seconds long because the characters just say what needs to be said in order to continue dragging the decaying corpse the show calls a plot. In the last scene of this episode Emily is firing this intern or whatever (because her boss can\u2019t?) and this girl rebuttals by telling her that her best friend and possibly ex are sleeping together and that everyone knows except her. Meanwhile Julian is unnaturally standing in the background just looking at this conversation unfold. He only reacts once Emily looks at him and his response is literally to ignore the betrayal on Emily\u2019s face and to escort the intern out of the building because Mindy is queued in for the \u2018big reveal\u2019. Mindy literally just walks in while Emily is visibly distraught and just starts talking\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\n\nWhy are these characters so one dimensional? Why is the dialogue so stale? Why does Emily feel so unnatural? How on earth did this show get popular enough to warrant a (fifth?) season? \n\nI obviously know that I am not the target demographic for this kind of show, but common? I would expect everyone to hold their favorite genres to a high standard. This show just seems so poorly done and I hate that  this is the state our shows are in, baffling. ",

In Italy if someone dressed like this showed up at a high-end event here, the reaction would be\u2026 complicated. Real wealth here usually shows through restraint, quality, and taste. Loud luxury feels outdated by decades.\n\nBecause of that, the show feels staged. Expensive scenery, dramatic behavior, exaggerated styling.\n\nAmericans, is this an accurate reflection of how wealthy elites in the US actually look and behave, especially in places like Palm Beach?

Not angry, not impressed, just oddly underwhelmed. \n\nFeels like there was so much build-up for something that didn\u2019t fully hit emotionally.\n\nAm I alone in this or did it leave you feeling the same way?\n\nHere's a detailed review -\nhttps://medium.com/@fbgmb/i-watched-the-stranger-things-finale-and-wait-thats-it-3ebde2924f9e",

        "title": "Questions about Stranger Things",
        "content": "1. Why does Vecna need to open four gates in Season 4, but then in Season 5 he changes his plan and needs twelve children instead?\n\n2. Why does Vecna need twelve children on his side to bring the Abyss to Earth?\n\n3. Why does Vecna wait years before acting directly?\n\n4. Why, in the Abyss during the final showdown, are there no other creatures present (demogorgons, demodogs, demobats, etc.) besides the Mind Flayer? Did they join him spontaneously (as if that were a good strategy\u2026)? Were they all in the Upside Down? Were they all dead? Who knows!\n\n5. Why is Mike\u2019s mother able to move freely around the hospital with a gas tank and hide it inside one of the dryers without any demogorgon noticing?\n\n6. Why do the military, once they become aware of the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan, do nothing to stop it?\n\n7. Why does Vecna, once he learns about the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan (through Kali\u2019s memories), do nothing to stop it?\n\n8. Why, inside Henry\u2019s mind, does Holly need to pull out the \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d move, with binoculars?\n\n9. Why, once Eleven disappears, do the military decide to abandon the town and all the protagonists as if nothing had happened? Nancy and Hopper should end up in prison for at least manslaughter. Instead, Hopper regains his job as sheriff and even considers a career advancement.\n\n10. Why is a huge creature like the Mind Flayer unable to kill the protagonists in the final battle (with legs as big as an apartment building, which everyone easily dodges with a somersault)? And how do the protagonists manage to climb to the top of a canyon so quickly?\n\n11. Why, all of a sudden, can everyone enter and exit the Upside Down without needing an oxygen mask anymore?\n\n12. Why isn\u2019t Max blind after coming out of her coma?\n\n13. Why is Joyce involved in extremely dangerous missions and plans, despite often having no real active role and providing no significant contribution?\n\n14. Why do the characters think it\u2019s a good idea to stop and talk and deepen their relationships in the middle of very intense action scenes?\n\n15. Why do gravity, air, sound, etc. work normally in the Abyss just like on Earth? Very convenient for playing \u201cspace explorers\u201d!\n\n16. Why is Vecna able to activate long-distance mind control over Hopper?\n\n17. Why does Vecna kill following \u201critualistic\u201d patterns instead of attacking en masse?\n\n18. Why is Eleven able to defeat 001 as a child but not as an adult (at least initially)?\n\n19. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna kill Eleven immediately when he has the chance?\n\n20. Why are Jonathan and Nancy not even slightly injured by the slimy substance that forms after they attack the shield generator?\n\n21. Why does Henry receive an interdimensional stone with black dust and turn into a murderous madman?\n\n22. Why does the Mind Flayer change form and strategy every season? If his goal is to infest Earth, he had countless opportunities to do so (and couldn\u2019t he have the demogorgons carry stones with black dust to possess other people, as he did with Henry)?\n\n23. Why does no one in Hawkins, besides the protagonists, wonder what is happening? No one comes up with conspiracy theories?\n\n24. Why does no one outside Hawkins take an interest in this town? Does no one have friends or relatives outside the city? What is the government doing? No external journalists investigate?\n\n25. Why do a bunch of kids always manage to figure everything out before scientists and the military?\n\n26. Why do parents tolerate such prolonged absences and/or so easily accept absurd or incomplete explanations?\n\n27. Why is the Abyss \u201cfrozen\u201d on the day Will disappeared?\n\n28. Why does Will, despite having survived, attract no interest from the military? (There must be surveillance footage showing him fighting off demogorgons.)\n\n29. Why don\u2019t the demogorgons in the laundry room hear the music Lucas plays to save Max?\n\n30. Why does no one seem to notice the gigantic walls surrounding the Upside Down before Season 5? Excluding Dr. Brenner\u2014judging by the notes he wrote and then forgot in the Upside Down lab\u2014when did he produce them? And why is there no trace of this information in the real Hawkins lab?\n\n31. Why is Eleven even capable of generating wormholes? It has been confirmed that she accidentally created the Upside Down in 1983.\n\n32. Why is Eleven able to hurl people into other dimensions? She is the one who threw Henry/001 into Dimension X / the Abyss.\n\n33. Who or what created the shield generator in the lab that keeps the Upside Down intact? Was it Eleven when she created the bridge?\n\n34. Why is Dimension X / the Abyss the only dimension trying to interfere with Hawkins?\n\n35. Why is Suzie no longer mentioned? Why aren\u2019t Robin and Vickie included in the finale? Why are unresolved subplots left hanging?\n\n36. Why does the fate of characters like Dr. Kay remain ambiguous?\n\n37. Why does Nancy suddenly appear skilled with weapons, without any explanation or prior training?\n\n38. Why do demogorgons switch from being intelligent predators to almost stupid monsters, depending on the circumstances and the characters involved in a given scene?\n\n39. Why do the disappearance of dozens of people, numerous deaths, and the presence of giant monsters not lead to serious investigations or intervention by the press or the FBI?\n\n40. Why, in Season 5, do the vines no longer have any significance, when up until Season 4 simply touching them disturbed the hive mind?\n\n41. Why do the characters constantly seem on the verge of death but then survive (after a few seconds, a few episodes, or from one season to the next: Hopper, Nancy and Jonathan, Steve, Eleven)?\n\n42. Why did Vecna specifically take control of Will in Season 1 and not other kids?\n\n43. Why does the wormhole show only Hawkins in the Upside Down?\n\n44. Why do the Russians disappear entirely? Why do they no longer spy on operations in Hawkins, considering that even kids manage to do so with the help of a high school physics teacher?\n\n45. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna maintain a constant army, and why doesn\u2019t he fully exploit it?\n\n46. Why is Max able to graduate despite having missed almost two years of school?\n\n47. Why do Joyce and Hopper never talk about Henry, even though they went to school with him?\n\n48. Why does every season have to \u201creset\u201d the world as if nothing had happened before?\n\n49. Why is Vecna not mentioned at all in the early seasons?\n\n50. Why does this series handle certain narrative turning points in such a sloppy way (\"good enough, let\u2019s go!\")?\n\n",

I saw it first in the actual theater (Tara Atlanta) that Lucas and Max were at in the montage at the end of the episode. There, it appeared to be a 2K projection. I also saw it in a standard Regal theater which appeared to be a 4K projection.",
