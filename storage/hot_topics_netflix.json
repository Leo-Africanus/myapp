This is the reason you guys fucking raised subscription fees in the US, etc? To waste money on games? *1899?  The OA?  Inside Job?  Mindhunter? GLOW?*\n\nInstead of blowing millions on bloody games nobody plays, Netflix could\u2019ve **invested in shows that might\u2019ve become legendary IPs**. Imagine if *Breaking Bad* got canceled after Season 2 because it wasn\u2019t an instant *Squid Game*.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on their **lack of classic prestige shows**. Where\u2019s *Succession*? *Entourage*? *Sex and the City*? (I am UK based), Invest money in onboarding them, I pay for Netflix, not a scavenger hunt across 12 streaming services.\n\nFor gaming we have Rockstar, Activision, etc, we don't need you.",

Some points I didn't like were Farhad, Rose (she was off icel), and Tomas specifically what annoyed me was the fact that no one could lie to save their life. BUT I loved the action I think it was 10x better than S1 kinda felt repetitive with the mole or whatever but I still enjoyed it. I'm not no film critic or wtv i'm actually employed but I'm hoping for a S3 with the last scene with Peter and Catherine seemed promising.",

Her performance reminds me of a kid trying out for a position in a high school play that DOESNT end up getting the part.\n\nWhat are we missing here? Anyone else share these thoughts?!

Then comes the murder of Malva while everyone accusing Claire of the murder without any evidence or proof. Then comes the arrest of Claire for her murder and attack just an excuse for a revenge where his brother was at fault and done the worse to Claire and deserved what he got . I am done, this feels so personal because thats exactly what happens in reality. People you trust and feel they are family will go against you just to ruin your entire life nomatter what the truth is. Thats the nature of human kind, people are ungrateful b!tches, you do good for them but they'll turn against you because they want what you have and they wnat it all for themselves. Something very similar recently happened to me and it has laft me with thoughts of never ever trying to build a family who are not blood.

        "content": "In a bold industry move that could reshape the entertainment landscape, Netflix is reportedly planning to launch its own music streaming platform by 2025. Industry experts and insiders suggest that the streaming giant, already a dominant force in video content, is looking to expand its reach into the music industry, challenging established players like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.\n\n**The Vision:** Netflix has long been synonymous with video streaming, but its foray into music streaming signals a strategic shift toward becoming a one-stop entertainment hub. According to reports, the platform will integrate music streaming with its existing video content, offering users a seamless experience that combines movies, TV shows, and music.\n\nThe move aligns with Netflix's broader strategy of diversifying its offerings and retaining subscribers in an increasingly competitive market. By adding music to its portfolio, Netflix aims to create a more immersive ecosystem where users can enjoy curated playlists tied to their favorite shows, exclusive soundtracks, and even live performances by artists featured in Netflix originals.\n\n**The Netflix Plan:** The music streaming industry is already crowded with heavyweights like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. However, Netflix's entry could disrupt the market in several ways:\n\n1. **Integration with Video Content**: Netflix's unique advantage lies in its vast library of original content. The platform could leverage its popular shows and movies to create exclusive music experiences, such as curated playlists inspired by hit series like\u00a0*Stranger Things*\u00a0or\u00a0*The Witcher*. This integration could attract fans who want a deeper connection to the content they love.\n2. **Exclusive Partnerships and Original Music**: Industry experts speculate that Netflix may partner with artists to produce exclusive music or host live-streamed concerts. Given Netflix's track record of investing in original content, it could also venture into producing music documentaries, biopics, and reality shows centered around musicians.\n3. **Competitive Pricing and Bundling**: To lure users away from established platforms, Netflix might offer competitive pricing or bundle its music streaming service with its existing video subscription. This approach could appeal to cost-conscious consumers looking for an all-in-one entertainment solution.\n4. **Personalization and AI-Driven Recommendations**: Netflix's expertise in data analytics and personalized recommendations could give it an edge in music streaming. By leveraging user data, the platform could offer highly tailored playlists and music suggestions, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nWhile Netflix's entry into the music streaming market is exciting, it won't be without challenges:\n\n* **Licensing and Royalties**: Securing licensing deals with record labels and artists will be a complex and costly process. Netflix will need to navigate the intricacies of music rights to build a comprehensive library.\n* **Competition**: Established players like Spotify and Apple Music have a stronghold on the market, with loyal user bases and extensive music catalogs. Netflix will need to offer something truly unique to carve out its niche.\n* **User Adoption**: Convincing users to switch from their preferred music streaming platforms won't be easy. Netflix will need to demonstrate clear value to attract and retain subscribers.\n\nThe news of Netflix's music streaming platform has sparked mixed reactions within the industry. Some experts believe that Netflix's brand recognition and global reach give it a strong foundation to succeed. Others caution that the company's lack of experience in the music industry could pose significant hurdles.\n\nArtists and record labels, meanwhile, are cautiously optimistic. Many see Netflix's entry as an opportunity to reach new audiences and explore innovative ways to monetize their work. However, concerns remain about how Netflix will handle artist compensation and copyright issues.\n\nFor consumers, Netflix's music streaming platform could mean more choices and a more integrated entertainment experience. Imagine watching a Netflix original series and instantly accessing its soundtrack, or discovering new artists through exclusive content. If executed well, the platform could redefine how we consume music and video.",
