Iirc it\u2019s not been revealed right how Dionne was able to make all the hotel staff, concierge and lawyers work with her? I felt so so infuriated for heather, that poor woman. ",

The acting was just perfect.\n\nThe final episode blew me away. When Jamie called and said that he's gonna plea guilty I just stopped breathing. The reactions of the parents and the sister were so real and heartfelt. \n\nI started to cry at the end of the final episode when Lisa (sister) came and said \"Jamie is ours\".  As the dad went to Jamie's room I was blubbering. I'm still weeping as I'm writing this.\n\nNever ever has a movie or a serie made me feel so much.

        "title": "This what r/grok thinks about \"Class\"",
        "content": "First off, this show is a melodramatic mess that tries so hard to be edgy it forgets to be good. It\u2019s like someone watched Gossip Girl, 13 Reasons Why, and a Bollywood soap opera, then threw them in a blender with a splash of sanctimonious social commentary. The result? A steaming pile of clich\u00e9s dressed up as a prestige drama. Rich kids snorting coke off their iPhones while sneering at the poor scholarship kids\u2014groundbreaking stuff, right? I\u2019ve seen more originality in a fast-food menu.The plot follows three \"outsiders\" crashing the elite Hampton International School, where everyone\u2019s either a drug-addicted trust fund brat or a saintly victim of the system. It\u2019s so predictable you can set your watch to it: bullying, sex, murder, rinse, repeat. The writers clearly thought, \u201cLet\u2019s take Elite, swap Spain for India, and add caste issues\u2014boom, instant depth!\u201d Except it\u2019s not deep\u2014it\u2019s a shallow puddle pretending to be an ocean. The class divide stuff is so heavy-handed it feels like a lecture from a sociology professor who\u2019s mad you didn\u2019t do the reading.And the characters? Oh boy. They\u2019re less people and more walking stereotypes. You\u2019ve got the brooding bad boy who\u2019s secretly sensitive (yawn), the rich girl with daddy issues and a pill habit (double yawn), and the poor kid who\u2019s just so noble it hurts. The dialogue is a cringe-fest\u2014half the time they\u2019re spouting lines that sound like they were ripped from a teen fanfic, and the other half they\u2019re trying to be profound but landing somewhere between fortune cookie wisdom and a WhatsApp forward. \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy happiness, but it can buy silence\u201d? Spare me.The sex scenes\u2014because of course there are sex scenes\u2014are so gratuitous they feel like the show\u2019s saying, \u201cLook, we\u2019re mature! We\u2019re bold!\u201d Nah, you\u2019re just pandering. It\u2019s softcore porn with a side of sanctimony, and it\u2019s about as erotic as a tax audit. Meanwhile, the murder mystery that\u2019s supposed to keep us hooked is so convoluted and poorly paced you\u2019ll stop caring who did it three episodes in. Spoiler: it\u2019s probably the script that killed any chance this show had.The production values are slick, I\u2019ll give it that. The school looks like a billionaire\u2019s wet dream, and the soundtrack\u2019s got some bangers. But it\u2019s all lipstick on a pig. Class wants to be a biting critique of privilege, caste, and inequality, but it\u2019s too busy drowning in its own excess to say anything meaningful. It\u2019s the TV equivalent of a rich kid slumming it for Instagram likes\u2014fake deep and full of itself.So, if you\u2019re an adult looking for something with actual substance, skip this overhyped trainwreck. Watch Elite if you want the same vibe done better, or hell, just rewatch Mean Girls\u2014at least it knows it\u2019s trashy and owns it. Class? It\u2019s a detention-worthy disaster that deserves to be expelled from your queue.",
