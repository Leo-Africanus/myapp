And the prosecutors was presenting is as if Janson had strangled her, with no marks on her neck. It's crazy because strangulation can be seen on the outside and not be seen on the outside but have a full on  impact from inside the neck. But what makes this whole case a mystery is that Tom ( the father) and Molly hade bearly any scratches or woundes on them. But parts of Jansons brain was out. If Molly really had been struggled there would have been injuries from inside the neck.He was much bigger and stronger. \n\n I don't believe ether that she was unconscious. Every woman pees while being nervous or it's something she looked up for her story.   \n\nI believe that it was all pre planned. She read about the first wife and made up a story that would fit. Intoxicated him weak and begun hitting him with the bat. Then shouted out so that the father could come up and help her finish the story. Why was there a whole brick in their bedroom?  And why was it so easy for the to hit him with it? Why was blood splattered on the backside of the door ? Was  Mollys mother on the other side the door, preventing him from running out? \n\nIf Tom was there while Janson was alive... he could have them stop the altercation and calm things down, run or even right then call 911 ? \n\nNOOOO ! Tom was an ex FBI agent. He knew how to save his daughter and work around the crime she hade committed. Tom was educating students on investigation after his job at FBI.  \n\nI feel sorry for them kids. Me, myself and I have also been manipulated as a child and used as a spokes person. I understand. They are grown now and can recall memory better.",

It barely had time to breathe before Netflix pulled the plug.\n\nThis is exactly why people are losing faith in Netflix. You finally make something with original IP, solid cast, great atmosphere, smart writing, and instead of giving it time to grow, you kill it off faster than a ghost hunt in episode one.\n\nMeanwhile, the most mind-numbing reality shows get renewed before the first season even finishes airing. Why? Because they\u2019re cheap and easy and someone in a boardroom thinks short-term numbers matter more than actual storytelling.\n\nPeople keep asking why fans don\u2019t get invested anymore. This is why. You give us something promising, with real potential, then yank it away like it never mattered.\n\nLockwood and Co deserved better. The actors deserved better. And honestly, the fans who actually stuck around and told people to watch it deserved better too.\n\nSo yeah, maybe it didn\u2019t bring in Stranger Things numbers overnight, but maybe if you let your shows breathe instead of canceling everything that isn\u2019t a viral hit in 24 hours, you\u2019d have more to show for it.\n\nNetflix is out here ghosting its own content. Fitting for a ghost hunting show, I guess.",

Was Cupcake really the only compromised one? Did Serena just get over her dad dying and Nico being her step dad? The DA was shot in the head and nbgaf? Logan, his brother and the governor's wife crash a plane and we can't see the aftermath? I know they live happily ever after, with a picnic in the forest they all almost died in but come on. \n\nEDIT: I know the whole fate thing, somebody had to die for one to live but HELLA people died. Logan said he'd kill himself before facing consequences, and he gets to die. Danny loses 10 years of his life, but Logan can't spend 1 day in a cell? ",

Zoe doesn't understand shit, Roque even less and Cristian sucks.\n\nOlympo is almost a Russian mafia, when it's a copy of Adidas. The three enlightened Olympo think they are mafia bosses when you can see eighty kilometers away that they are scumbags, and the viewer knows it and has to see how all the characters wonder \u201cwhat's going on\u201d. Hell, we all know it except the main characters. It's a fucking tracksuit brand, not a multimillionaire company that's getting its ass licked so much (yes, I know that in real life sponsorships are key, but it's not that bad).\n\nThe performances themselves are decent (the best for me is Clara, she comes with experience and I'm glad she didn't stick with what she did in Through My Window), the cinematography is perfect and the soundtrack is meh. You can tell they tried to make another \u00c9lite and let's see how it turns out.\n\n",

        "content": "TLDR: Cool concept, great visuals, but everything else needed more time\n\nDISCLAIMER: Slight spoilers, honestly tho we guessed every single \"plot twist\" so do with that what ya will\n\nHi everyone,\nme and my housemates really wanted to love K-Pop Demon Hunters but..well, we didn't.\n\n(Background: I like Kpop, looove certain groups and songs, but I'm not a fan the way most ppl are, one of my housemates is definitely more of a fan, and the other is a big fan, but not to the extreme degrees that some get to)\n\nBelow is a review that covers all of our critiques:\n\nThe concept is super fun, a K-pop girl group who secretly hunt demons? Dope, make a whole series out of it and I'll eat it up. The animation is honestly amazing, sick character designs (although some stuff feels a bit dated but hey, still nice) and a cool overall vibe. The idea of having a demon boy band as their rivals was clever, and the music had solid beats (though the lyrics were a bit meh).\n\nBut beyond the surface, things kind of fall apart.\n\nThe story moves way too fast. There\u2019s barely any time to get to know the characters, their pasts, or why they even care about each other. The relationships felt really shallow, and that goes for the &gt;!central romance!&lt; too. &gt;!It tried to do the enemies-to-lovers thing, but it didn\u2019t land, mostly because sure, they \"hated\" each other but it didn't feel real, and the shift to romance felt rushed and bland.!&lt; No tension, no buildup, just...there.\n\n&gt;!The big sacrifice scene was supposed to be emotional!&lt; We found it kinda predictable and it didn\u2019t hit at all. It felt like a forced \u201csad moment\u201d the movie thought it needed, but there wasn\u2019t enough character depth/story development to make it actually feel sad.\n\nOverall, the writing just didn\u2019t do the concept justice. Dialogue was pretty basic, nothing that really stuck with us or made us feel something. And with how quickly everything moved, there just wasn\u2019t enough time to explore the world, background stories, or the themes properly.\n\nSo yeah, awesome animation, great aesthetic, but the story needed way more time and heart. Had all the ingredients, just didn\u2019t quite mix them quite right and was, honestly, undercooked and rushed.\n\nYet, going online, I see mostly super positive reviews, and it just feels like we're the only ones having much negative stuff to say.\n\nSo redditors, are we just haters?",

I am maxing out at 1080p with a premium account. Is there a solution to this? What's the deal? \n\nI run 4k 144hz on Windows 10 (soon to be 11, forever)",

        "content": "Ok well im gonna post this again since over 1k people looked at it but said nothing. There were even some down votes for no reason. I'm just asking a question and need a little help\n\nSo here is what I am using. LG C1 Oled smart TV. Got Netflix downloaded on it. And for audio, I have a pair of Sony Wireless Headphones connected through bluetooth to my tv\n\nMy issue is, everytime I watch Netflix with this exact set up, the audio always cuts out while whatever im watching keeps playing. Ive looked it up before and something about turning off 5.1 surround or something, but thats not even an option. the only options are subtitles and audio language. Thats all. I need to know why this is happening and if there is a fix please \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude2d",
