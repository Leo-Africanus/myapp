        "content": "I literally wrapped this show up 20 minutes ago and WOW. I have some strong emotions on this one.\n\nSide note: I am by no means a critic. I just wanted to share my thoughts in case you were on the edge.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast from your typical detective show, mixing in lust, hatred, romance, and love into a twisted story. It was refreshing! Throughout the show I drew sharp comparisons between titles like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, with a distinct splash of the traditional detective themed Hollywood blockbuster. However, even then it was entirely different. \n\nThere is definitely something to be said about the predictability throughout this show. With modern day crime films, I often feel I have a solid grasp of when or how an event is going to take place or come forth, but not with this. This was entirely fresh and entirely unpredictable. The director does a fantastic job of steering the viewers mind; Pushing us to a prejudice and bias that even the most experienced crime thriller fanatics try to avoid. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and its many twists and turns.\n\nI say all this with some slight criticism. In order to accomplish such a rollercoaster of a plot line, I did feel there was a certain loss of realism. The general structure of the plot is gripping, but the actual substance of it can be slightly off putting. I felt as if some of the reasonings were a slight bit of a reach for my tastes, but could be well within the palettes of most viewers.\n\nFrom a cinematographic point of view, the show was well made. The scenery, the mood, and the pacing, was attractive to your typical crime thriller junkie. I have little to complain about aside from the pacing in the last episode. I felt as if there could have been a slight bit more to explore concerning the main protagonist and his trauma, but it was brushed off for the jaw dropping peak of the show (absolutely 100% unexpected). So yes, I will say the cinematography was well done. It\u2019s no Lord of the Rings or Interstellar, but it has more than enough to make the viewing experience pleasurable. \n\nAlso, there were so many morals and lessons put into this story. Maybe it\u2019s just me being impressionable, but I definitely felt there was some moving moments throughout. \n\nI strongly recommend this series and look forward to more similar work in the future. \n\n\n TLDR: Great series. It was a nail biter that had me constantly questioning my theories. There\u2019s some minor misgivings but they are made up for by other plot twists and so on. 8.2/10. Strongly recommend!\n",

Is it India's just another effort to promote nationalistic, jingoism? To show that Pakistan will sell the atomic bomb and give it to terrorists. Like how stupid do you have to be to make losing points like \"sambhaal nahi payenge, secure nahi rakh payenge.\" Seriously, why is Indian media so obsessed with Pakistan?",

        "content": "I was watching star trek and like 15 minutes in it cut to the 'cannotnplay this title at this time' or whatever it is. it has now disappeared from my list and my continue watching, and when I search for it it doesn't come up.\n\ndoes this mean they happened to remove it right as I was watching it? I'm confused cuz usually it says in the blurb if something is leaving soon but I didnt have any such message, but everything else plays fine so idk what else it could be.\n\nsorry if this has been asked before, I couldn't find an FAQ anywhere or see it while quickly scrolling.",
