There are numerous silly subplots that go literally nowhere.\n\nI fell like I'm watching random scenes from kids movies about summer camp and school, except the dialogue was better in the shows that focused on 7-year olds.\n\nThe dialogue is terrible, it's convoluted and everyone talks like a try-hard emo.\n\nNot to mention the constant exposition, is the target audience persons suffering from loss of short-term memory?\n\nIt is atrocious, I want to like it but it is a burning file of poo.",

Watching it again last night it feels way less like science fiction and way more like a Tuesday.  \n  \nThe wild part is we don\u2019t even need spy satellites anymore. We hand over our locations to apps 24/7, leave microphones in our homes, and carry around devices that log everywhere we\u2019ve been. Add in data brokers, security cameras on every corner, and facial recognition in half the apps we use, and you\u2019ve basically got the same surveillance net the movie warned about. Made me super anxious last night about my own data, I don't get spam calls much but I get lots of promotional offers in my mail from places I haven't even heard of. Data gets sold online all the time and it's probably in the subscription agreement if anyone ever read it but is there a way to take these off for sure? It's the internet and nothing truly gets deleted but at least make it less visible. Would appreciate anyone knowing more than I do to tell me how I could try and track and maybe delete my data online.",

Not heavy on plotline but animations, colours, music was pretty awesome.\n\nLooking into the history and BTS of the film was what really caught me (hence sharing article). So much respect for the teamwork, thought and intention.\n\nFelt like it's a milestone for many of us who didn't make it in something but the alternative path brought us towards something we'd never imagined. Overcoming our battles and demons and bringing in a new version of ourselves.\n\nSo glad for this film's success and everyone involved \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nP.s. yes you should watch this masterpiece \ud83d\udc4c",

David (Michael Douglas) is married to Emily (Gwyneth). David\u2019s business is in financial trouble and he has big money problems. Gwyneth is from old money and their lifestyle seems to be mostly propped up by her money.\n\nDavid wants her dead because then he will get all of her money, she\u2019s also been cheating on him. In the film they say because David and Emily DO NOT have a prenup then upon Emily\u2019s death David inherits everything- motive.\n\nBut, given she was having an affair, why didn\u2019t David just get a divorce and get half of her money anyway? Emily states they don\u2019t have a prenup. Divorce is a lot easier than hiring a hit man.\n\nAny insights?\n\n",

Is this how life after fifty goes? \nFirst,  we have Nick leave his very sweet, pretty wife so he can relive his youth. I wasn\u2019t  hoping for a Betty Broderick type reaction from Ann but the whole situation seemed very unrealistic. That divorce would drag on and on and she wouldn\u2019t have carte blanch to his credit cards. So Nick, who doesn\u2019t seem that rich, attracts the young girl and what does he do? He gets her pregnant. Is midnight feedings more fun than Ann\u2019s midnight video games?\nMaybe I just liked Ann too much because here is Nick with this attractive young blond and who does Ann attract? Not the hot surf instructor but instead a bald, wrinkled up weirdo. This is when I said you know I don\u2019t think I really like where this show is headed. \nNow Nick dies, the show is finally picking up in the karma department and surprise, surprise, poor Ann is saddled with planning his funeral. Why doesn\u2019t his adult daughter, who is falling all over new girl friend within six hours of knowing her, plan the funeral. \nEvery time young girlfriend Ginny fiddled with her necklace I was furious. It\u2019s not like it was an engagement ring. I really disliked how easy breezy these May December romances can be. \nI guess Liz Lemon\u2019s character was the most realistic but the frumpy bathing suit was annoying. Come on Liz, we know there\u2019s a great body under there and you don\u2019t need to wear long sleeve suits. Fine you don\u2019t want sun burn but juxtaposed next to Ginny\u2019s matching bikini, the message seemed to be, over fifty women need to cover up their bodies. More evidence of this was poor Ann\u2019s beach outfit choices and she looked pretty hot in that wedding dress so what gives with the caftan? \nSo I don\u2019t think I will be watching season two, especially if it includes poor Ann babysitting Nicks love child. \ud83e\udd2e\n",

Top menu (and no easy way to get to it instantly), tiles that change side, and previews that \\*still\\* freakin\u2019 autoplay with no way to disable it.\n\nAdd in that it continues to show the same limited number of shows/movies in all the various categories, created new \u2018categories\u2019 that are just full of garbage, and have abandoned the built-in video player for their own code, and it\u2019s clear that they view the AppleTV as a necessary evil.\n\nI won\u2019t even get into their refusal to play well with the overall ecosystem (that one I could deal with, if the app itself was usable, but it\u2019s not).",

Went back in and it just vanished before my eyes from my watch list and can't be found at all in search. Another show on my list, Inspector George Gently, has also mysteriously vanished and isn't in search. Can anyone shed any light on this? It was so sudden - one second they were both on my watch list as usual, the next they'd vanished.",

        "content": "People think dark comedy is just \u201cedgy jokes,\u201d but honestly it\u2019s way more than that.\n\nNormal comedy = you laugh at something dumb.\nDark comedy = you laugh at something painful.\n\nThat\u2019s the magic. The moment you can laugh at shame or taboo stuff, it doesn\u2019t crush you the same way anymore.\n\nShows like BoJack Horseman, Big Mouth, After Life (Ricky Gervais), Sex Education, Dead to Me, or The End of the F*ing World \u2014 they don\u2019t just make you laugh, they sneak in permission to breathe. Like, \u201chey, the world isn\u2019t gonna end if this embarrassing thing exists.\u201d\n\nAnd Netflix has nailed this: some of their best comedies are hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time, showing how humor can live right next to grief, awkwardness, or chaos.\n\nSo yeah, call it what you want, but for some of us, dark comedy is therapy in disguise.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR: Laughing at pain makes it lighter. Dark comedy = free antidepressants.",
