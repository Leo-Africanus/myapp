It's too bad because the lead actor could  have easily carried the series without the other character helping him. ",

I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

        "content": "I haven\u2019t had Netflix for an extremely long time. Like a decade or more. Recently I finished reading All The Light We Cannot See. It\u2019s an outstanding story that deserves the Pulitzer Prize it was awarded. I learned that Netflix made a 4 episode mini series and couldn\u2019t want to watch it. So I actually subbed for a month JUST to watch this. \n\nVery early into episode 1 and I was already saying \u201cuh oh\u201d. It\u2019s got some pretty cheesy acting. The actress that plays Marie looks nothing like how she\u2019s described in the book. Nobody has an accent that makes sense. I know people say Mark Ruffalo had the worse accent, but ignoring that I thought he actually played the role decently well. All of that is stuff I can ignore, though. \n\nThe real issue is half the story didn\u2019t end up in the show. Like minimum half the story. Probably more is missing in reality. And with it, half the characters are gone, too. The story that did manage to make it into the show had nearly every aspect of it changed. I can\u2019t think of anything original from the book that made its way into the show. Characters who never met in the book have screen time together. Who lives and dies is changed. Characters who don\u2019t kill anybody are suddenly gunning people down. The ending is changed. I mean it\u2019s seriously almost an entirely different story. Which is frustrating when you know the amazing story that this was sourced from. \n\nHad I never read the book, I\u2019d probably have watched it and thought \u201cmeh\u201d. But knowing what they did to butcher this, I have to call it a complete failure. It doesn\u2019t manage to capture anything about the original story it\u2019s supposed to represent. \n",

        "content": "This is a long shot, but does anybody recall a show that was on Netflix called \"Freaks\"? I was going through my to watch list and I had written down \"Freaks\" but when I type in \"Freaks\", all I get are two movies, but no TV show. I tried searching on Google and all I find are the movies and Freaks and Geeks, except for one wiki which says that it was an HBO show about people with powers, but I can't find anything else about it. If anybody has any info, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time :)\n\n  \nEdit: [https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Freaks\\_(TV\\_Series)#Antagonists](https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Freaks_(TV_Series)#Antagonists) This seems similar to what I saw but I cannot find this credited on the IMDB page of any of the cast members mentioned on the Wiki. And there are some big names on that list. It makes no sense. What a mystery. ",
