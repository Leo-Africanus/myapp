Netflix and a few other platforms seem to be getting better at detecting and blocking VPNs.\n\nNow there\u2019s talk about Netflix possibly landing the UEFA Champions League, which sounds exciting, but it also makes me wonder: if streaming services can reliably block encrypted or rerouted traffic, what does that mean for online privacy in general?\n\nAre we heading toward a future where it\u2019s basically impossible to browse or stream without being fully visible to providers? Or will users and tech keep finding new workarounds like they always have?\n\nCurious where people think this is heading. Is it a losing battle, or just another round in the back-and-forth between privacy advocates and big streaming companies?",

Within days the TV appeared again and on NF advice I changed my password.  Within days they were back and now I find I have to sign them out a couple times a week.  NF seemed flummoxed and then suggested maybe my email had been hacked.  They suggested perhaps I should get a new email.  Does this make any sense?

And then in episode 8, I felt like it just didn't deliver. I think it just wasn't good as a limited series. The mystery that was built was too big for the wrap up. I wanted to understand by the end something about the inner world or workings of the townspeople. In general, for a show which centered so much around emotions, the deeper we got into the series the more shallow the characters seemed to become. It was really disappointing. We never were let into the characters internal experience. \n\nI wanted so badly to see Laura and Alex actually TALK about things. Like the relationship was never sold as functional or emotionally intimate. I get if at first they were freaked out but when they got on the same page, why was the most we got was a a couple arguments? No real conversation. Alex is obsessive and won't let things go about work but his wife is obviously going through all this and not  actually planning on leaving town snd he's not bothering her constantly about it? \n\nThe timeline just felt wonky and poorly conceived following the set up. A great concept with poor follow through. I was left wanting more, but not in a good way, but in the way that I felt they would have to undo what they had done to answer things in a satisfying way.
