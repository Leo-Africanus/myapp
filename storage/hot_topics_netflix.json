Both the main characters were unappealing to me and I feel like their relationship wasn\u2019t explored enough, we were never shown actually WHY they liked each other so much. \n\nFelix was okay but I couldn\u2019t care for him. The ep about his family and SA was touching and really sad, but he had nothing else going on for him. He wasn\u2019t particularly affectionate to Jessica, wasn\u2019t shown to like her as a person rather then just being with her because she liked him, his relapse because of her was never even addressed, him still being friends and inappropriate with his exes was never resolved (I think there should\u2019ve been at least one scene where Jessica confronts him and he genuinely reassures her, since she clearly had insecurities and an \u201cother woman\u201d issue from her past relationship). He even cheats on her, NEVER apologises, and expects Jessica to give HIM a break after HER dog died a day later\u2026? UH??? A good looking bum overall. \n\nI was always on the brink of liking Jessica until she did anything. First of all I don\u2019t think the actress was a good choice, her way of acting is whiny in a really annoying way and when she was crying it felt like there was something I was supposed to find funny, but there wasn\u2019t? Her character was supposed to be weird and whimsy in an appealing and alluring way but she came off as just weird for no reason. Again I don\u2019t understand why she liked Felix first of all, I really thought he would be her \u201cI just moved to London and need a British guy to get over my evil ex\u201d who she\u2019d get over with after a bit, since she clearly didn\u2019t love him? Like, being on your phone while watching Paddington with him, saying I love you after like two days of dating,  being clearly upset at how he still interacts with so many of his exes, leaving him alone at her boss\u2019s house party, almost cheating on him on a work trip and never telling him, not wanting him to move in, accusing him of having no ambition? How were we supposed to be glad they get married in the end, they objectively aren\u2019t a good couple?\nEdit: I did love her family dynamic. It was very realistic and heartwarming coming from a family like hers.\n\nDid I get the show all wrong? Why does everyone else seem to love it?",

        "content": "hey hey, just wanted to drop some opinions because i'm bursting to talk about this show and barely anyone i know has seen it yet\n\n1. omggg, from the time we got to hear the first round of singers, i was rooting for aaliyah, denzel, cameron, and katie to join together because their voices are all so rich and evocative. so when they eventually teamed up, i was SCREAMING !!\n\n2. the work ethic and unity of all the groups has been a major influence in how i view them. szn4 are my faves just because of how much time and effort they've put in, not just as a band, but as a group. i really wanted to love m2m because they're the most alternative of the bunch, but right off the bat they were all flakey \u2013 the other three just seem a lot more hard-working because conor is there to juxtapose was **bad** workmanship is. this is also the reason i'm obsessed with soulidified and why siren society are my current underdogs. both of these bands just feel like long-time friends starting a project together for the sheer enjoyment.\n\n3. the group names are KILLING me. the only one i sort of like is midnight 'til morning, but even that is lacklustre. 3quency, siren society, and soulidified are taking me out tho haha.\n\n4. not gonna get into it because the discourse around these two is already super negative. but obviously conor and alison have soured the show for me. i get showbiz and drama but the show works perfectly for all the other bands without them needing constant negativity surrounding them.\n\n5. conor's \"punk\" look had me rooting for him in the beginning, but now it kinda feels forced and performative. the \"punk\" aesthetic has no politics or morals behind it, it feels fake in a lil huddy, mgk, landon barker kinda way. and alison is really giving tess tyler from camp rock. i love a mean girl archetype but it just feels cruel, especially the digs at haley during practices, and the confrontation with erica in the booth.\n\n6. while i really felt horrible during the alison-erica confrontation, the editors really did not paint erica in a great light. the amount of scenes of this girl crying is over the top, which sucks because she has so many strong, leadership moments that get overshadowed by this framing.\n\n7. i absolutely fell in love with soulidifed. they feel so light and airy and fun. you can tell there is not toxic masculinity that side and it's so refreshing. they FEEL like how a boyband should feel, just in a modernised fashion. i'm so hopeful to see what happens with them once the show has aired and they come out with what they're doing with the band.\n\n8. what is up with the judge's commentary? for the most part, i agreed. but the criticism for siren society way outweight the compliments (def feel like that's foreshadowing their demise on the show), when i felt like their performance was the ideal girlgroup. i know nicole was probably harsher because it was her song, and i did see ehat she was saying about the sexiness feeling outdated, but what they did felt authentic and real to what i envision as a girlgroup. i've been using katseye as a litmus test during the performance episodes, and i genuinely see siren society as being the most alike to what the world wants to see.\n\n9. i can't with 3quency. i tried to like them, especially since they each had such strong solos in the booth scenes. but nori really sticks out since her voice is very youthful and unique. nori definitely has the least amount of skill and it shows. brianna sings beautifully, but the rich soulful tone feels like it would be better fitted in szn4 honestly. omg but wennely? she is just amazing. her voice blends well for a group, i just wish she was in a group that didn't feel so fragmented.\n\n10. why was the show so religious in the booth episodes lol? i feel like every second word in the booth chats was about growing up in the church, learning to sing in church choirs, pre-performance prayers, etc. it just felt so out of place for a singing reality tv show. \n\n11. the band forming mechanics were sloppy. by having the bands be allowed to be formed before all the contestants had the opportunity to perform didn't sit right. and having only 6 bands be the outcome made it feel like a race to who can slap together a band the fasted, which kinda took away from the organic ethos (which was super evident in the forming of band 6). i'm hoping it was just an editing thing, but if it wasn't, it's definitely an aspect that needs to be worked on.\n\n12. idk if there was a cap on how many members a band could have, but i don't get why alison couldn't have formed a group with elise, haley, cece, and mandy? that's 5 members which we've seen in so many bands. ig it may have been the same reasoning as 3quency where they wanted bigger roles/parts in the songs and felt their voices were strong enough to carry and full out a song? still sucks that the show seemed to put drama ahead of talent and skill.\n\n13. i love how the editors made sure to constantly remind us of people's names and what songs were being sung. if not, i would have totally forgot/glossed over major players in the show.\n\n14. not everyone who has watched this has seen popstar/dream academy. but my queen karlee was an absolutely legend in that show/project. she was in this show super briefly, and i'm so mad i didn't get to see anything of her, not a performance and no booth chats. it was nice seeing the little clips of her. anyway, she makes solo music now which is amazing (go stream), but it would've loved to see what she looked like in this setting, and hearing her compare it to dream academy.\n\nall-in-all, this show has a lot of kinks to work out. but i am rooting for this to take off because, with a little work, this show could easily be a great contender for modern day reality tv. the experiment played out exactly as it was intended, unlike other netflix reality shows, so i was super happy about that. the idea of a group of unlikely candidates coming together to make magic was brilliant, and is working well for me. what are your thoughts about the show thus far?",

        "content": "Okay, I need to let this out because I\u2019m beyond frustrated.\n\nI pay \u20b9650/month for Netflix\u2019s 4K Ultra HD plan. I have a flagship device \u2014 the Samsung Galaxy S24, not some outdated entry-level phone. I\u2019ve gone through every possible setting. My download quality is set to \"High\", streaming quality is on \"Maximum\", and yet\u2026 when I download a 57-minute episode, it's just 172 MB.\n\n172 MB?! Are you kidding me?\nEven an average 720p video would be at least 500\u2013600 MB for that length. This is barely 144p or 240p level bitrate. The quality looks like it came out of a potato.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not expecting full 4K on a phone \u2014 I get that mobile devices may not stream or download true 4K, especially to save bandwidth or battery. But not even 1080p?!\nI\u2019d be fine with a clean 1080p download \u2014 heck, even a solid 720p \u2014 but this? This is straight up bad. Like watching a YouTube video from 2010 on a poor connection.\n\nWhy is Netflix compressing downloads like this, even when I\u2019m paying for the highest tier and using a top-tier device? And yes \u2014 before you ask \u2014 I have plenty of storage, great Wi-Fi, the latest app version, and I\u2019ve cleared the cache. Still the same result.\n\nSo, what's the deal?\n\nIs this a device restriction?\n\nIs Netflix throttling download quality for mobile deliberately, even on premium plans?\n\nIs there any workaround to actually get at least 1080p downloads?\n\n\nIf anyone else is going through this \u2014 please let me know. I seriously don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m paying premium and getting substandard content quality. Might as well downgrade the plan at this point. What\u2019s the point of \u201cUltra HD\u201d if it looks like SD?\n\nNetflix, please do better.",
