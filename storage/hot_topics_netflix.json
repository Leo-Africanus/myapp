        "title": "Netflix Has Gone Downhill",
        "content": "I\u2019m bracing for downvotes, but hear me out: Netflix has gone down. Not crash-and-burn down, but a steady slide from must-have to \u201cI\u2019ll resub when there\u2019s a buzzy release.\u201d I get that plenty of people still love it, but what used to feel like discovery now feels like searching, and that shift matters.\n\nThe biggest crack is trust. Too many promising shows get axed after a season or two, so viewers stop investing. It\u2019s hard to recommend something when you might be setting a friend up for a cliffhanger that never gets resolved. Netflix still lands hits, but fewer cut through the noise, and the middle tier\u2014the quirky, mid-budget series that built the brand\u2014has thinned out. What\u2019s left is an awkward mix of glossy tentpoles and disposable reality.\n\nPricing and policies haven\u2019t helped. Between tier reshuffles, an ad-supported option, and the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix asks for more while delivering less certainty. If I\u2019m paying premium, I want premium clarity: finished stories, a strong middle class of originals, and an interface that helps me find them. Instead, the algorithm cycles the same tiles, autoplay shouts at me, and the Top 10 often reads like a marketing strip rather than a reliable compass.\n\nThe binge model, once Netflix\u2019s superpower, is showing its limits. A full-season drop creates a weekend of hype and a Monday of amnesia. Competitors that pace releases weekly keep conversation alive longer, which builds community and anticipation. Netflix\u2019s experiments with split seasons feel more like damage control than a coherent strategy for keeping shows in the zeitgeist.\n\nI know the counterpoint: scale demands broad bets. Serving the whole world means optimizing for averages, and averages don\u2019t produce many cult classics. There are still gems\u2014especially international series\u2014but they\u2019re buried under repetition and generic thumbnails. Personalization should feel like a path that widens as you walk it, not a carousel that loops you back to the same five options.\n\nWhat would winning look like? Start with a renewed commitment to finishing stories\u2014greenlight responsibly and communicate clearly about endpoints. Reinvest in the mid-tier that keeps people engaged between megahits. Rethink curation beyond raw engagement: elevate human-programmed shelves, surface more staff picks, and rotate true discovery rows weekly. On product, make autoplay opt-in, expand \u201cbecause you watched\u201d with smarter, transparent explanations, and let users pin interests so the home screen adapts to them, not the other way around.\n\nAnd if you disagree, that\u2019s fine. I expect pushback, maybe even a pile-on. But the criticism comes from a place of former love. Netflix made streaming exciting because it felt bold and curious. Lately, it feels cautious and crowded. The audience is still here, willing to be surprised. The question is whether Netflix wants to be surprising again.\n\nIf you\u2019re still all-in on Netflix, tell me what I\u2019m missing and what\u2019s genuinely great right now. I\u2019d love to be convinced to stay subscribed year-round instead of hopping in and out for the next shiny release.\n\n",

        "content": "IMO\n\nAdeline Watkins was in his mind; she wasn\u2019t real. It was his imagination that created her.\n\nMy arguments:\n\t\u2022\tHe had schizophrenia, so he imagined many things that weren\u2019t there or forgot things.\n\t\u2022\tWhen Adeline came into his house and said she was going to clean up, she started doing that. But when the police arrived, you could see how filthy the place really was and that nothing had been cleaned.\n\t\u2022\tThe psychologist in the series even said that he hears other voices encouraging him, when in reality, it\u2019s his own thoughts. You can also hear Adeline saying, \u201cHave sex with a corpse,\u201d to Ed Gein. That was what he was thinking at the moment, but he thought she was the one saying it.\n\t\u2022\tIn the last episode, it\u2019s mentioned that the asylum has to make budget cuts, so it\u2019s possible he wasn\u2019t getting his full medication anymore. His schizophrenia might have partially come back, which is why Adeline Watkins appeared in his mind again.\n\t\u2022\tIn the last episode, we see that she\u2019s the same age as when Ed was arrested, so in his mind, she never aged.\n\t\u2022\tBefore anyone argues that she had separate scenes without Ed Gein \u2014 like when she went to New York \u2014 Ilse Koch, the Nazi, also had scenes where Ed wasn\u2019t present. He just wanted to make it seem real in his mind.\n\nI think they wanted to show us by him saying. Don\u2019t kill people to her. He grew as a person and was saying to himself. I\u2019m not going to kill people again. Because it is wrong \n\nI know she really existed; she said she had a relationship with him, but later she took it back.\n\nI think Ryan Murphy wants us to decide whether it was real or not since many people believe she actually had a relationship with him, while others say she was a liar.\n\nJust like in The Menendez Brothers, you also see the parents\u2019 side \u2014 that they\u2019re proud of their kids. Ryan Murphy does this to make us decide which side is real. That\u2019s exactly what happens in this series \u2014 he wants us to decide whether she was real or not.\n\nLet me know if you disagree \u2014 I\u2019m curious to hear your opinion on my theory.",

He's too hot and can't do an american accent and accounting for the strangest voice choice of all time, it just comes off silly and \"simple jack-y\".\n\n  \nAnd the TONE??? The show so far plays less like an upclose look at a monster like dahmer and has been this hypersexual tease of teenage girls talking about bras, flashes of nazi BDSM imagery and concentration camps cut together in an exciting way. he gets the images from a girl who looks so sweet she's bound to be his first victim. \n\nGein is portrayed as a hot and muscular horny weirdo with a terrible voice, who fails to bring life to a character with the same kind of tv-watchability as Evan Peters's  cold, scary, planning, broken, psychopathic predator \n\nI'm writing this after watching the ridiculous scene at the Nazi BDSM party where Jewish prisoners are sexually humiliated against their will. And again- it's just the tone. It was off. And this show so fare seems kinda sexploitation-y and bad acting and bad casting and idk if i can keep going. \n\nThoughts?",

She was an older woman, so the mother figure he needed along with the comfort of being a female companion.\n\nIt's such a shame he went back and spoke to 'mother' and then did what he did to Bernice. \n\nBut I can't seem to figure out if she actually did have venereal disease or not.. was it just a hallucination after the years of his mother talking him into a crazed state? \n\nEDIT - After watching the rest of the episode, my question is still unanswered, but Adeline is just as crazy as Eddie... she's super twisted. \nShe's the reason why Eddie is as crazy as he is, but does anyone think if she hadn't shown him the photos in episode 1, he would have still become the crazed killer he was? In episode 4, she took a photo of Bernice after being hung and mutilated and didn't even flinch, I mean most people would see photos and be like 'woah' but seeing in real life, would have reacted abit more freaked than she was... is she hoping to shape up to be the next 'Weegee'? Where he's fictional or not?",

        "content": "I know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s crazy that I\u2019m saying this about an NBC show, and I don\u2019t know if anyone will read this or care but I gotta get the words out. This show was beyond amazing. Say what you want about the filler, the repetitiveness, whatever. But Blindspot has arguably the most impressive full circle story, beginning to end, staying true to its core in ways that I feel like you don\u2019t see in a lot of shows anymore. I couldn\u2019t help but feel so deeply connected to the characters and their lives, and getting to see familiar faces through flashbacks/hallucinations was so comforting. Yes, the show is wildly farcical in literally every episode, but what\u2019s the difference between accepting the realities of a sci-fi show and embracing strange realities in a show that takes place in \u201creal life?\u201d This show was extremely clear from the first 5 minutes that nothing it presented was going to be normal, and by god it wasn\u2019t. But dammit I LOVE that about it. The creators and the cast cared so much about the depth of the plot and it really shows, and I am genuinely really sad that I have run out of episodes to watch and that the ending was so damn bittersweet. I really hope that any past or current watchers who saw it all the way through - because quitting at any point before the 100th episode is robbing yourself of the beautifully closed loop, complex and heartbreaking character arcs, and also knowing the truth that the story really does continue, but maybe not in the way you want - feel as touched as I do by the story, it\u2019s amazing characters, and what it all meant in the end. It\u2019s an isolated, hidden gem, that other amazing shows (like Lost - despite it\u2019s brilliance) just cannot replicate in the same way. Or if they have, I haven\u2019t seen them. \n\nThe craziest part of all this for me is that this show had been recommended to me by netflix for MONTHS, and I skipped over it because the poster looked too NBC and my assumptions got the better of me. What a fool I am. Never judge a show by it\u2019s poster, you may be missing out on a truly touching experience. ",
