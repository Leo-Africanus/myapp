        "content": "What\u2019s up r/netflix! I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

She wasn\u2019t trying to be perfect, and I didn\u2019t find her annoying like a lot of people did. I honestly don\u2019t get why they felt that way. I always thought she was pretty smart, especially since she was a writer and all.\n\nWhen we found out she was catfishing Joe, I won\u2019t lie, I thought that was a little out of place at first. But once it became clear that she actually cared about him, I started liking her again. What bothered me though was how she seemed to lose herself along the way. She started off strong but kind of got lost in the middle, which was a little disappointing.\n\nThat said, I still thought she was the kind of character who kept you curious, like you wanted to know more about her. She knew how to flirt, knew what to say in the right moments. Her dynamic with Joe, especially in the beginning when they first started getting closer, was really intriguing to me. I just wanted to see more of them together. Maybe that\u2019s just me, though.",

        "content": "I found it a really easy, light hearted, comedy show about a group of friends. It's not my usual style but I thought it was refreshing and nice to see lots of cool actors in one show.\n\nIt all got a bit dark when Nick died, OMG? I wondered if Steve Carrell already said he wouldn't film any more seasons so they killed him off. What a turn! But I guess his character was a bit messy, an older man leaving his wife for a younger model, and Anne also confirmed in the show that he cheated on her. I didn't feel as though the cheating confirmation was taken seriously enough, and was swept under the rug by the group and not really acknowledged. Just me? \n\nIt was nice to see Steve brought some Michael Scott humour vibes to Nick, if you know you know!\n\nFinally, my favourite was Domingo Coleman, I thought he was so sassy and funny, my favourite little scene was when they were all taking a photo with Ginny, and the photos would sync to Anne's iPad so he told everyone to pose like they aren't having a good time. And he's the only one doing it! \n\nFinally, a shout out to Anne for dealing with so much and trying to not let her hurt feelings turn to hatred towards Ginny and also reminding her and Nicks daughter that Ginny was a person.\n\nSo will they make a new season?\n\n ",

        "content": "I get that they made the ending like that to make it seem morally right, you know? To keep people happy, the ones who care about this whole thing of it being the \u201cright\u201d ending. But honestly, I think it should\u2019ve ended with him either getting away and going somewhere else, kinda like an open ending, or just dying. Him going to prison didn\u2019t really make sense to me. But whatever, I can let that go.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t ignore though is how Kate and Bronte survived so unrealistically. There was just no way Kate could\u2019ve made it. She was shot, hit in the head with a hammer, and left in a fire. And we never saw anyone getting out of the fire while Joe was proposing to Bronte. So how would she have survived all the smoke, all that damage? It just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAnd Bronte too. Like yeah, Joe was probably panicking and all, but he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s killed plenty of people. He knows what dead looks like. There\u2019s no way he saw her there, shot in the stomach, underwater for that long, and thought she was dead when she actually wasn\u2019t. That just didn\u2019t make any sense. It kinda ruined the ending for me, to be honest.",

They say they\u2019re sharing their story \u201cso no other kids go through this,\u201d but the whole thing was settled out of court for $1.8M and never really held anyone accountable. And even now, they still have their kids all over social media\u2014then wonder how to protect them from \u201call those hate comments\u201d\n\nWhat really got me was when they left the Squad and were mostly worried that their views were tanking. Like... that\u2019s the concern? Not what the kids went through? And those scenes where the kids are sending messages to Pipper? \u201cIf she ever watch this\u201d they looked super uncomfortable. You can totally tell it was staged. \n\nIt\u2019s just upsetting how lightly the documentary touches on the real impact of putting kids in the spotlight like that and building a whole image around them. It\u2019s honestly disturbing.\n\n",

For example, Battle Camp and Perfect Match are comprised of individuals who have already been on at least one other Netflix show. So I am wondering who do you never want to see again &amp; why?",

I was completely sucked into the universe when i discovered the show last year and rewatched it like 2 months after with a family member. I bought the books. I\u2019m currently reading book one. I still watch part of the episodes often on netflix or listen to the show\u2019s themes songs.\n\nI want to find another show that will leave me feeling as passionate and obsessed with it. I\u2019m big on love stories but it\u2019s okay if there isn\u2019t one. Can someone recommend me a show?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI had the Netflix app on my iPhone and uninstalled it about two days ago. Today, I decided to reinstall it, and to my surprise, it automatically logged me back into my account! I didn't have to enter my email or password at all.\n\nThis was unexpected because I *don't* use iCloud Keychain or any kind of password backup feature on my iPhone. I always manually enter my passwords for apps.\n\nSo, I'm really curious if this is a normal thing, especially since I'm not using the usual iOS password management tools. I figured uninstalling the app would completely remove all my login information from the device.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this, especially if you don't use iCloud Keychain? What could be causing this automatic login? Is it some other form of caching or device-level storage that persists even after an uninstall?",

        "content": "recently watched the new Netflix series Bad Boy, and I was deeply disturbed by a scene in the first few minutes where a hijabi woman is immediately shown as a terrorist. This portrayal plays into harmful stereotypes and Islamophobic narratives, especially given how Muslim women are often unfairly depicted in the media.\n\nAs someone who cares about representation and the impact media can have on perceptions of minority groups, I wanted to bring attention to this issue. While the show may not intend to harm, this kind of content reinforces a dangerous narrative and can negatively affect how viewers perceive Muslim communities, particularly hijabi women.",
