I have had this Netflix account in my email, phone number, and paid by me for years, and all he had to do was ask, and they did it. I called to ask them how I can prevent this from happening, and their solution - Change it to an email that no one knows. I asked why they can't just set up verification before it is changed, or make a note that only I am the one that can make changes to my account. They didn't have an answer for me. Two-step verification or some kind of added security should be the right solution for this.",

        "content": "I know a lot of people are gonna come for me, but it's just my opinion. And don't get me wrong, this show will *always* have a special place in my heart, but it's clear that it's outgrown itself.\n\nThe 80s appeal no longer really has its charm, the kids are no longer kids, and most importantly, the stranger things aren't strange anymore. The unknown is what makes something unsettling. When you begin to spell out all the aspects, it doesn't have that eerie feeling anymore. This show has over-explained its lore to the point where it's very convoluted and no longer uncanny. The whole point of the Upside Down was the unknown, another world that's beyond human comprehension. All of that goes away when you reveal that it's just some guy who's been pulling the strings since the first season. Not only is it overly detailed, but it's also been the same thing for nearly a decade now. The monsters were creepy at first, but now we've seen it a hundred times, so it doesn't have that effect anymore.\n\nI rewatched seasons 1 and 2, and it's honestly crazy how much the show has detached from itself. If somebody watches season 1 and then watches the first episode of season 5 right after, they would be completely baffled. Remember when this show was just about a boy who went missing? And the characters have so much plot armor. I love how the demogorgon slaughters the background characters almost instantly, but when it comes to our protagonists, it stands and screams, so they always run away. Not to mention, the dialogue is also really bizarre, lots of exposition dumps, etc.\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but I don't want this to be too long. I just needed to voice my thoughts somewhere cause anytime you complain on TikTok or the ST subreddit, you just get attacked lol. But I'm glad others are enjoying it. I wonder if it will be one of those shows with an ending that's divisive among fans.",
