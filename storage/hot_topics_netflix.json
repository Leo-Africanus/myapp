        "title": "Another Post about the new Horrible UI change ... with suggestions",
        "content": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!!\u00a0**That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

        "content": "Okay so I know Bloody Mary by Gaga has basically taken over every Wednesday dance edit on the internet. I get it\u2014it\u2019s catchy, moody, and fits Jenna Ortega\u2019s moves really well. And I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve vibed to those edits more times than I can count.\n\nBUT.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the actual song used in the show is Goo Goo Muck by The Cramps. That offbeat, punky, slightly weird 80s vibe? It matches Wednesday\u2019s oddball, vintage aesthetic perfectly. It\u2019s quirky in the exact way her character is. And the fact that Jenna choreographed the dance herself to that track just makes it feel more raw and authentic.\n\nI honestly like Goo Goo Muck more than the sped-up Bloody Mary remix. Not saying the Gaga version isn\u2019t fire, but there\u2019s something about the original song choice that feels way more unique and true to the tone of the show. It has that creepy-cool energy that makes the scene unforgettable.\n\nAnyone else feel like Goo Goo Muck deserves more credit for how iconic that scene became? Or are y\u2019all team Bloody Mary all the way?",

I get that she was protecting herself and her kids, but it\u2019s such a morally gray area. And don\u2019t even get me started on Ginny\u2019s treatment of Austin\u2014that felt so unfair.\nWhat do you all think? Was Georgia justified, or was there a better way? And am I the only one who wanted to shake Ginny sometimes?\nAlso Max, God acc to me what she's feeling is quite understandable, she gave everything to her friendships, to feel left out at the end.",

I also have started to enjoy romance, especially when it is kind of forbidden or unique, like the film 'The Tearsmith' I thought that was amazing. Maybe drop some of your favourite movies and series and let me know why you liked it!  I'll list some stuff that I have watched and enjoyed. \n\n\\- Vampire Diaries\n\n\\- Stranger Things \n\n\\- Heartstopper\n\n\\- Lost \n\n\\- I enjoy Harlan Coben's limited series\n\n\\- All of us are dead\n\n\\- Alice in borderland\n\n\\- Young royals\n\n\\- You\n\n\\- The summer I turnt pretty\n\n\\- Big fan of the Texas Chainsaw massacre franchise\n\nThanks in advance! :) ",

        "content": "If anybody has ever done this before, or something like this, I'd appreciate the advice. \n\nI've just purchased an Amazon Fire tablet, basically with the express purpose of watching Netflix on-the-go. The only reason I have a Netflix account is so I can use a specific extension in conjunction with Netflix (Lingopie). This extension works just fine when watching on my desktop.\n\nJust so you can understand the limitations I'm trying to work around, I'll list them out here.\n\n1. I have to use a tablet (or other mobile form-factor) so I can use it while travelling\n2. I cannot use the Netflix app, it doesn't allow extensions at all\n3. I cannot use Chrome, it doesn't allow extensions while on mobile/tablet\n4. I cannot use Firefox, my extension isn't available as an add-on\n5. I'm using Lemur browser. I haven't tried other browsers such as Kiwi, Brave, etc but I'm like 90% sure the issue isn't the browser.\n\nWhile using Lemur browser, I've gotten to the point where I've logged in to the desktop site, and I have the extension downloaded and seemingly working just fine alongside the site. I can browse my shows and I can see the extension the same way it works on my desktop. \n\nHowever, once I press play on a show, I get an error:\n\n    This title is not available to watch instantly. Please try another title.\n    \n    Error Code E100\n\nI've tried everything on the Help Page, but nothing has worked. I'm open to whatever can allow me to use my Netflix extension while travelling, even if it means going back to the drawing board.",
