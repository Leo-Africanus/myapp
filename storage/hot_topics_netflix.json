I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

I couldn't really relate to any of the characters but with the humour and the chemistry between the cast/characters it didn't really matter. The fact that the episodes were 30 minutes or so helps, I'm not sure if it could've been 45-50 minutes each. I had no problem binging it within a day. Highly recommended.\n",

        "content": "I've been racking my brain and would love to watch it again. Of course, it was on Netflix. It was about a serial killer who had effectively retired and a cop who had been hunting the serial killer for some time (possibly retired also). The serial killer was somewhat of a local legend, I believe inspired by Gary Ridgeway (The Green River Killer). I believe the serial killer and the cop are neighbours.\n\nMost of the show involved general family drama and such, while our serial killer, let's call him \"Bob\" struggles to control his \"urges\" after being \"retired\" for some time. \n\nEventually, he gives in, and \"Bob\" commits further murders (I think). The first season ends when the cop, having been hunting \"Bob\" for decades, suddenly concludes that our guy, \"Bob\", his neighbour, is indeed the guy he's been looking for for some time. \n\nIn the final scene, our detective guy whispers in the serial killer's ear, \"I know\" or something like that. Which is basically where the finale ends.  \n\nI'm hoping there was a second conclusive season that I can watch. If not, I would love to watch that first season again. Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "The new\u00a0*Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight*\u00a0mini-series on Netflix is a real treat. It\u2019s a five-part animated adaptation of the classic comic, directed by Alain Chabat, what he's done with this series is genius!\n\nThis version stays true to the heart of the original while adding a fresh, modern touch. The humor is sharp, the animation is beautifully done, and the voice cast fits perfectly. The story follows Asterix and Obelix as they stand against the Roman forces, while their druid Getafix finds himself in trouble, struggling with memory loss that causes him to forget the magic potion recipe. Naturally, chaos follows.\n\nWatching this took me straight back to afternoons spent in the Hornsby library, pouring over Asterix comics, getting lost in their sharp wit and playful satire. Those stories always had a way of making the world seem a little brighter, balancing clever historical nods with lighthearted humor. No matter how many times I read them, they were a source of comfort and a guaranteed laugh.\n\nThis adaptation captures that timeless comic feel, and the jokes remain packed with satirical charm and modern pop culture references. Whether you\u2019re revisiting a childhood favorite or discovering Asterix for the first time, this is well worth a watch\u2014Alain and Netflix have done a fantastic job bringing these characters to life!\n\nNaturally, I think they've done a bangup job but these are just my thoughts but I'd love to hear what you think of the mini-series and if you think they should they bring out more. What do\u00a0**you**\u00a0think?\n\n[Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight - Season 1 Promo poster](https://preview.redd.it/9fzt5g5x7bye1.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddae755e30e15e3da7f6110fc554f0e287e26ee)\n\n  \n",

However, there was a group of people with certain helmets that prevented this control and fought against these creatures with weapons.

        "content": "No real spoilers:\n\nThis is typically my favorite genre, but I just can\u2019t get into this show\u2014despite really wanting to.\n\nCupp feels like such a flat character. She\u2019s deadpan the entire time, shows little depth, and it\u2019s hard to connect with her emotionally. She mostly just snaps at others and loves birds. She\u2019s essentially the main character of the show and is just boring, bland, and rude the entire time. The trailer made her seem almost goofy, which would have been great. If she was goofy and ditsy but also a brilliant genius detective. But that is not at all how she is portrayed in the show. \n\nThe storyline drags from episode to episode without much happening. I got a few laughs\u2014Harry Hollins was funny early on\u2014but overall it just feels bland, and I\u2019m losing interest fast. Watching the show feels like a chore at this point. \n\nThat said, the White House set is incredible. Huge credit to the production team on that. Just mind blowing on the amount of work that must have taken.\n\nIf you\u2019re into this type of show, The Afterparty on Apple TV is a way better execution of the concept. It\u2019s funnier, better written, and the storytelling is on another level. Highly recommend. Two seasons and both impossible not to binge through. ",

If Netflix produces the series this time, I think it would be a huge success. With promotions the same as their other shows, such Bridgerton\u2019s, people would go wild!",
