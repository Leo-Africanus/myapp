Don\u2019t even get me started on their original movies, they\u2019re even more awful. Why can\u2019t they hire good writers for their scripts , because they end by being totally bland and repetitive. Why would they spend so much on actors and production but cheap out on hiring competent writers. ",

        "content": "New to the forum.\n\nI was always told I would like West Wing, but I have only recently started binging it on Netflix.\n\nI just finished the episode \"In Excelsis Deo\" and it moved me to take the time to share this recommendation.\n\nThe episode can stand alone but there are multiple threads happening in the arc that you will miss...but the main story is about military service, and loss and the honor due and so often unpaid for their service.\n\nI'm 57 - never served myself, but my life was influenced by my father's Vietnam service, which has been a scar on his soul that also wounded us all.\n\nMy father had never seen the Vietnam Memorial and DC - he always wanted to but only got to see the small traveling version some years ago when it passed through his town.\n\nBoth my parents are getting near the end of their lives. I took my parents to DC so he could see it before it is too late. It was a dream of his since it was built.\n\nIt was powerful moment and life event for us all.\n\nI had been to DC but never seen the Korean memorial somehow. Didn't even know it existed which is a shame as it is very powerful.\n\nAfter we spent some time at the Vietnam Wall, we wandered through the park with no particular plan. We approached the Korean memorial without knowing it was there, and as we came up through the trees, the soldier statues appeared like phantoms emerging from the shade cast by the trees we walked through.\n\nIt was a powerful and eerie experience. Like ghosts emerging from the dark I was very impressed and now see that memorial as probably the most powerful in DC. I mention it because the episode features it in the story.\n\nAnyway, I have not often been moved to share something like this, but I thought it was worthy. I found the story moving and beautiful, and my friends were right - so far, it is an excellent show...made only more engaging and honestly, frustrating by the current state of the country.\n\nIt is hard to see a dramatic representation of the presidency and government that is at least somewhat reminiscent - and even, to some degree - honorific - compared to the current permanently stained version of the office. The contrast is actually quite sad, while also giving me some much-needed hope - if only a little bit - hope that maybe in the future we might see something closer to what we once thought of it.",

And while it has a pretty run-of-the-mill take on life in the future, with some sillier elements like transparent smart phones, I do like that it takes place in the NEAR future (2029,) as opposed to 2058 or 2082 or something like that. And you can't mention Better Than Us without mentioning Arisa, the main character of the show who, despite being a robot, ends up being one of the most likeable and emotionally complex characters out of everyone.  \n  \nI'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're into sci-fi or robots. The story is definitely more of a slow burn, so if that isn't your thing you may not like it. There was never a season 2 unfortunately (but the first season has quite a few episodes). I heard something about another company renewing it for a second season but I'm not sure if anything ever came of that.",

        "content": "I rewatched it and honestly the production value was insane. Mongol Empire politics, brutal battles, massive sets. But it got cancelled after 2 seasons. With how well historical epics are doing now (like Sh\u014dgun), do you think Marco Polo would survive if it dropped today? Or was it just not that good? Curious what people think did it deserve to be cancelled? ",
