I get that from an entertainment standpoint they did this to increase the shock factor when it\u2019s revealed that she was the catfish but I don\u2019t think they did enough to explain other people\u2019s perspectives of her behavior.\n\nOwen says that he felt she gave him extra attention in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. And the examples he gives probably would have been hard for other adults to pick up on as they would likely just seem like Kendra being somewhat maternal towards him.\n\nBut then Khloe\u2019s dad said that he thought early on that it was Kendra and even mentioned it to the sheriff. But then Netflix completely failed to dive into the reasons WHY he would think that. This makes me think that she was probably doing other strange things if other adults suspected her, whether it\u2019s a history of manic behaviors or inappropriate behavior towards minors it would have made sense to touch on that more rather than trying to stick to this story that she was some completely normal mom who just happened to wake up one day and start tormenting and sexually harassing teenagers out of the blue ",

LADY, no one else has stalked minors and adults with sexual content texts for 22 months as an OOPSIE. Did this make anyone else want to scream at the TV!?\n\n\\-She lies that she started doing this to find out who sent the original texts. She started off aggressive with those texts out of the gate and they escalated. Did anyone else believe her?\n\n\\-She was absolutely obsessed with Owen, and I believe she was hoping to push her daughter, Owen, Khloe or someone to snap and do something.\n\n\\-I think she got off way too easy in this documentary. I am sure they had to make some agreement with her so she'd appear, but man I wish they would've pushed back.\n\n\\-Can anyone answer why she didn't get charged with anything as far as the sexual content to minors went? I mean her texts to Owen and Lauryn were beyond disgusting for 14 year olds. Why was it only stalking and nothing in the substance of the texts? Genuinely asking anyone who knows the law why this would be the case.\n\n\\-I can't imagine all these people living in the small town together after this all went down. I genuinely feel awful for this poor girl Lauryn. You can tell the difference in her after she had gotten some space from her mother's grip and had time to process. Those interviews she was different. She also says \"I hope that my mom gets the help she needs so it doesn't go back to the way it was before.\" I don't think she's just referring to the texts. She's probably been awful on other things.  \n  \nThose are my thoughts / questions. No one I know has watched it yet and dying to hear people's thoughts!!\n\n",

Like Penny killed a man for a woman who would never get justice in the courts. Totally valid in my opinion! There was no justice for women in that day.

But instead of understanding and saying \u201chm maybe we should not pursue this mystery\u201d she confronts the husband which leads him to killing himself and his wife. And of course this is expected, because jail at that age?? Meanwhile, she lets a crime boss who cut off people\u2019s fingers, steals people\u2019s passports, and is essentially facilitating modern slavery live his life as a floralist because she wants the retirement home to stay open. Talk about double standards?! She has a moral superiority complex for sure. And the Polish guy, Bogdan, was literally just trying to escape what was essentially slavery to see his dying mother, and yet his story is ended when he\u2019s arrested as well. It left such a sour taste in my mouth. These people, who had good reasons to do what they did, got arrested and a crime lord didn\u2019t? And that\u2019s just the end of the movie and Elizabeth gets to dance and pretend like she didn\u2019t ruin three peoples lives? Like WTF??\n\nAlso what is it with everyone confessing to their crimes?? There was no evidence to prove Penny and her husband did anything, but he just admits to it with the slightest pressure. He would\u2019ve been fine otherwise. And Bogdan telling Elizabeth\u2019s husband even though he also had no evidence? Come on, lazy way to conclude the story.\n\nAnyway, TLDR it had so much potential but the ending ruined it",

        "content": "Okay i don\u2019t know why this has been bothering me but why did the girls mom make a groupchat with her daughter and her bf?? she claims to have wanted to protect her daughter so why not message her daughter or the bf separately? the groupchat thing seems off. she was obsessed with the bf so why not just message him? i cannot wrap my head around this.\n\nthe groupchat thankfully led to the bfs mom to find out and really push push push to get this figured out. i think if the messages were being sent directly to just her daughter nothing would have been done to stop them since the daughters mom kept telling her to just ignore it and it wasn\u2019t until the bfs mom got involved did things escalate.

        "content": "When I watched L.A. Confidential movie, I couldn't help but feel that Lynn and Exley had this incredible chemistry than what she had with Bud. The way they looked at each other throughout the film made it seem like there were real feelings brewing between them. I\u2019ve never seen her gaze at Bud like that; it was something else entirely when her eyes met Exley\u2019s at the end during their goodbye.\n\nDo you think by the end of the movie, Lynn had developed some feelings for Exley? And maybe he felt something for her too, especially after that night they spent together.\n\nWhat do you think would have happened if Lynn had met Ed before Bud on Christmas Eve? Do you think she would have fallen for him? And what if Exley had been in Bud's shoes during their first encounter? \n\nWere the things Lynn said to Ed while trying to charm him actually true?\n\nWho do you all ship? I can\u2019t help but imagine that after she gets to Arizona and finds out she\u2019s pregnant, it could be Exley\u2019s baby. Just a thought, haha!\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and opinions on all of this!",

        "content": "So, I have 2 Nvidia Shields running Netflix in separate rooms of the house. Suddenly today, the main profile cannot select any title from the \"home\" menu, on either device. The craziest part is I can still select titles directly from the other menus (Shows or Movies etc.). Only the primary profile is affected, every other profile works just fine. There's no PIN, rating content is set properly. I signed out of all devices through the website etc. Basically, I tried everything. It's just super weird and I wonder if it's happened to anyone else. It was fine yesterday. ",
