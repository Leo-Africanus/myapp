If you do find something decent, congrats \u2014 it\u2019ll probably be gone next month due to \u201clicensing issues.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n\t\u2022\tPrices keep going up\n\n\t\u2022\tPassword sharing gets cracked down on\n\n\t\u2022\tAds are creeping in like we didn\u2019t specifically pay to avoid cable\n\nAt this point Netflix feels less like a premium streaming service and more like cable TV with an app and worse content.\n\nI honestly miss when Netflix felt fun instead of frustrating. Now I spend more time scrolling than actually watching anything \u2014 and half the time I just close the app.\n\nIs it just me, or did Netflix completely lose what made it great in the first place?",

Some of my opinions may be slightly biased here BUT I don\u2019t think she did it\u2026 or at least for the most part. I do believe that nursing wards can be quite a cliquey area like mentioned earlier in the documentary. You\u2019d be surprised but I do feel clinical and laboratory environments can be more toxic than you\u2019d imagine. The stress, the grief and maybe the overall mental work these staff perform brings out the worst in them. I believe the ward may have been understaffed, there may have been mistakes made by other nurses in the unit and ultimately Lucy was the scapegoat for them.\n\nOn top of this, I think the documentary also had A LOT of loopholes. Where was CCTV evidence in all of this? Were there not other staff and nurses present during these cases? If so where are their interviews or testimonies? I don\u2019t know, I felt there was a lot missing to really analyse this properly as a viewer as well. I do think Lucy is a bit sketch, some of her comments and her behaviour is odd but I also believe nurse units can be extremely toxic and there is a very good chance they used her as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone\u2019s thoughts?",

Ended up finishing it pretty quickly. I enjoyed that not everything was told  right away so there was actual mystery throughout the show. \n\nI feel like a lot of stuff nowadays has no mystery and every scene goes by so fast. I liked that the show didn\u2019t feel rushed, but ended up finishing on a high note with more questions. \n\nA few things were kinda weird , but I think in some ways it\u2019s what made it a great show for me.

        "content": "spend a lot of time on YouTube, and honestly, I often enjoy reading the comments as much as watching the video. Seeing what others think, catching details I missed, and discussing specific moments makes the whole experience more engaging.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like Netflix (and other streaming platforms) should have a similar feature? Imagine being able to comment on scenes with timestamps, discuss theories, react to plot twists in real time, or see what others noticed at the exact moment you\u2019re watching.\n\nI know there\u2019s always the risk of spoilers, but maybe it could be optional or filtered.",
