        "content": "I think Netflix kinda cracked the code into the world of espionage/political/action thrillers with these three.\n\nThese three shows might not be the best and may not be to everyone's liking, but they do extremely well with the masses. Hence, the quick renewals for The Night Agent and The Diplomat. I'm sure The Recruit will also be renewed very soon.\n\nApart from Slow Horses, which is top-tier, there are only a few good ones in this genre, and they don\u2019t get much visibility due to their platforms.\n\nThe shows I've mentioned are short, quick, and straight to the point, no delays. This helps a lot in the world of binge-watching. People crave shows like Homeland, 24, and The Americans, and Netflix has the means to satisfy that craving.\n\nSo, I think these shows are going to be around for a long time. What do you guys think?",

But because her mom works for the White House she\u2019s able to make a call and the CIA is just giving a civilian intel on an operation? Then she follows him all the way to Germany just to tell him he\u2019s moving out??? What a wasste of a character. Absolutely enraging. \n\nOne of the worst characters I\u2019ve ever watched.
