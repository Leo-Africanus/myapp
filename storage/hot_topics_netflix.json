        "title": "A Wrong Paris (2025) - review",
        "content": "The Wrong Paris - it has everything, but something seems to be missing.\n\n\nThe brand new romantic comedy from the most famous digital streamer debuted recently and has already achieved great success. Starring former Nickelodeon teen star Miranda Cosgrove, in her second original work on Netflix (her first original work on the streamer was \u201cA M\u00e3e da Noiva\u201d, another big recent success on the platform) and Pierson Fod\u00e9 (The Perfect Date).\n\nSummary\nDawn (Miranda Cosgrove), a metallurgical artist, lives in the interior of the US state of Texas with her grandmother Bird and her sisters, dreaming of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming a real artist. Dawn, responsible, dedicated herself to working at a local caf\u00e9 for a long time due to her private financial funds to study art in Paris. She actually manages to pass university, however, without the full scholarship, her savings are insufficient.\n\nOne of her sisters, a fan of reality shows, suggests that she sign up for the current production, the \u201cHoneypot\u201d or \u201cHoney Pot\u201d, a competition between women with 20 thousand dollars guaranteed to those selected for the great contest in search of the keys to the heart of a rich single man, which conveniently would take place in the City of Lights \u2014 or that's what the participants thought.\n\nSelected and gaining the affection of one of the show's producers, Dawn finds herself ready to reach the Eiffel Tower house. However, she is surprised by the production's prank, and the primary cause of the film's name, which lands her in Paris, Texas, less than 100 km from her home. Remaining in the dispute only for contractual reasons, she soon arouses the interest of the millionaire of the moment, Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fod\u00e9), a handsome cowboy, initially determined to be eliminated immediately. Throughout the dispute, between tests and intrigues typical of reality shows in confinement and some extra game moments, she will allow herself to live this passion.\n\nComments and opinion\nHome to many successful relationship reality shows, Netflix ironizes its own productions. From the beginning, Honeypot is presented as a self-criticism, properly a parody of the reality television genre. The entire structure and characters involved in the dispute are stereotypes of the most common human types to expose themselves in front of the cameras: the rich and spoiled influencer, the old school biker, the nerd, the free lover, the forgotten celebrity, the alternative girl, etc.\n\nThe film was directed by Janeen Damian, who has experience in the romantic comedy genre. He has already directed two other Netflix productions in the same style: Christmas Eve and Irish Wish. In The Wrong Paris, she inserts all the common and pleasant elements of romantic comedies, being quite predictable, which is no demerit. After all, when watching films or series of this type, we want an escape valve from the chaotic everyday life, where we have little or no control over what is going on around us. The constant presence of Dawn's family is an especially pleasant difference, constituting the viewer's voice within the film.\n\nEspecially her grandmother Bird, an emotional component of the plot, frequently advises her granddaughter and encourages her. Sometimes he interferes in the story that the most anxious audience would like to do for themselves. Miranda brings beauty and humanity to the film; It is perfectly possible to be indignant with her regarding the \u201cvillainess\u201d's far from discreet advances on the handsome millionaire. She conveys the character's insecurities well and definitely makes us fall in love with her too \u2014 an essential element for any self-respecting romantic comedy. Pierson fulfilled what his character needed: he delivers someone who is attentive, concerned, handsome and very passionate about the protagonist. There could be a slight touch more chemistry between the two characters (annoying me? Maybe).\n\nFeaturing beautiful landscapes and an interesting cast, the film also stands out for the quality of its production, ideal for the romantic comedy genre. Despite this, the story could have been better worked on. At 1h45 long, the extremely light plot (a good sign) goes by too quickly. There could be better development of the \"villain\" and the protagonist's confidant, through dialogues between them and the main character. In my opinion, there could have been more frank dialogues between the protagonist couple, giving a more solid basis for the passion between them. Some moments between Paris, Texas, and Paris, France, appear to occur with an expressed passion, without much emotional basis. Maybe 15 more minutes of film wouldn't hurt the production.\n\nWith an insightful critique in the background of the futility of influencers and the world of reality shows, limited to the formulas of the genre, it could have promised more than just a light and pleasant romantic comedy for a late afternoon when you just want to turn off your brain and disconnect from the busy routine, with cute moments starring passionate characters. I would have easily given that away. I think it was designed to be a single film, but there could be a sequel expanding this wonderful universe, especially Dawn's relationship with her family, especially her sisters.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4.5 STARS",

        "title": "Love Con Revenge is honestly the most amateur, misleading, defamatory, insulting to our intelligence \"documentary\" I've ever watched.",
        "content": "I honestly don't know where to start with this. The primary host is presented as some expert \u2014 even speaking about psychology she clearly has no understanding of \u2014 when in reality she's just someone who fell for a scam. The private investigator? She doesn't seem to understand the law at all, calls up people and says *\"I'm investigating this person\"* with zero clue if the recipient of the call is friends with the target (which could expose her), and tails cars by following them in U-turns, parking lots, etc while wondering \"Do you think he spotted us?\"\n\nSeveral guys on the show are clearly unpredictable criminals. Which also makes it nuts that they're taking these women to confront them face to face when they should be calling the police. They tracked a guy who was a fugitive from justice, and instead of calling the cops, they went to yell at him (tipping their hand and potentially giving the target time to flee). Even worse? It's the misleading crap and leaving information out. \n\nThroughout the series, the show presents claims that are in no way verified. It's like they took *every* \"case\" that came their way, and when stuff started to look sus, they kept going and just left out info. For instance, [another Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/s/tymYcHrKzg) looked up the clinic from the Dr. Wilkerson episode and discovered that the victim was *heavily* involved in the practice \u2014 with many of the complaints over the years specifically mentioning her behavior. \n\nAnd while we're on that episode, the \"victim\" dropped her civil suit? And she's facing charges for filing a false police report? And even though there's a claim that the guy opened fake accounts in the daughter's name (a clear crime that would result in arrest), there's been no charges filed? And Netflix didn't feel like showing us evidence of those alleged fraudulent accounts? Even worse, the \"after story\" text at the end of the episode was up for mere seconds. I'm not into conspiracies, but it's almost like they *didn't want us* to read the additional info that cast doubt onto the entire story. \n\nLeading up to the Dr Wilkerson episode, I was already a little irked by the show. Even when it was established that there was no evidence of crimes, the hosts would say things like \"At least he's been exposed.\" Been exposed about what? That an ex partner is saying negative stuff about them? Stuff you completely didn't prove, not even enough to support a civil lawsuit (which isn't a high evidentiary standard)?\n\nBut yeah, the episode with the doctor is going to be it for me. By marrying his \"victim,\" he ensured that any debt would be his responsibility too. Great con artist, right? The episode clearly left out all information that showed the \"victim\" might be lying. And while earlier episodes *clearly* showcased real con artists, the way in which they were handled was dangerous, amateur, and is very likely to result in defamation lawsuits against Netflix. \n\nThis show idea was great, but the execution is absolutely pathetic. Did these two ladies just go out filming stuff on their own and then show up to Netflix like, *\"You should show this\"*? The \"private investigator\" is essentially using Google and hiring others to find info for her, and Cecilie Fjellh\u00f8y's only place in the show should be in a \"this is what happened to me\" role rather than speaking as if she's a subject matter expert (she's clearly not). Even worse, they're pushing unverified claims that will ruin people even if they end up not being true. \n\nAnd by the way, repeatedly badmouthing the police *is not* a smart way to ensure the police keep discussing cases with you in future seasons. This is worse than amateur hour. It's amateurs manufacturing anger for ratings \u2014 because they know a large portion of folks won't care about pesky little things like a lack of facts while treating real scam incidents and jilted ex scenarios as if they're equivalent. \n\nNetflix, do better.

        "content": "I was surprised to see how affordable Netflix is in India compared to what friends abroad pay. Here, the cheapest option is the mobile plan at \u20b9149 per month (around $1.75 USD). I\u2019m curious to know what the lowest Netflix subscription costs in your country, and whether it\u2019s a mobile-only or a full plan. Please share your location and the price, it\u2019ll be interesting to compare worldwide differences.",

But it doesn't have to be that light hearted, as long as it has good writing, and not traumatizing like baby reindeer or Orange is the new black then I'll take it.\n\nShows I've seen: \nThe good place (I want something like this, even tho it was 4 seasons, it was so well written and i loved the lightness of it.) \n\nArcane (loved the animation, and the writing, season 2 sorta flopped but its ok) \n\nBojack horseman (\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2di fucking love this show) \n\nAvatar the last Airbender (i would sell a kidney to experience it for the first time again) \n\nQueens gambit (10/10) \n\nMaid (\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb) \n\nThe last kingdom (AMAZING) \n\nCrazy ex girlfriend (it was insane that i randomly found this show and it became my FAV SHOW ever.) \n\nBlack mirror (i loved the way the episodes made me think. One of my favs, perfect level of disturbing)\n\nDark (\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd27\u2728\ufe0f) \n\nbridgerton (its good... but a bit cringe, not the most amazing writing, QUEEN CHARLOTTE however was amaziinggg) \n\nWednesday (kinda felt like it wasted my time) \n\nBlue eye samurai (loved it) \n\nDerry girls (\ud83d\ude0d) \n\nBaby reindeer (it was rlh good..., it was so triggering\ud83d\ude30) \n\nHeartstopper (THIS SHIT IS ADORABLE UGH idc if its not the most amazing wtiting, the characters chemistry is adorable)\n\nBEEF (it was good....) \n\nOrange is the new black (its a good show but i 100% regret watching it. It was way too dark for me. I still get flashbacks to it like it was traumatizing)\n\nMO (haha funny) \n\n\nSex education (fun, later seasons a bit ass) \nThe end of the fucking world (loved it) \n\nOne day (\ud83d\ude10) \n\nYou (i have no idea how to feel about this show. I wouldn't recommend it to ppl but i wouldn't call it a waste of time) \n\nDead to me (i liked it.., cliche but still..) \n\nSquid games (darn)\n\n\n\n\n",

If they were not, air mouse would be a standard by now and my remote wouldn't look like it came out when I was born. And Android TV OS will probably never make sense. But then app makers figured it out. If we can not make the ui or a remote be usable, lets add a voice search. And Netflix said, naaaah... We love when they tire out their little thumbs. Get a grip Netflix. Add voice search... And sorry everyone for the rant \u270c\ufe0f",
