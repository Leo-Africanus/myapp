Why did they even do this? Did they think it would be a good change? It was perfect as is \ud83d\ude2d they somehow managed to make it worse in most/all aspects.\n\nEdit: my stupid brain just figured out that using \"back\" auto selects the search bar for me. Still mad about the larger titles tho lmao",

Someone kept texting the characters about who will die and when. The dudes name always showed up as Monkey something? I cant remember. The end of the show takes place in like a skatepark underneath a bridge or something like that. I have been looking for over an hour to try to rewatch it.

The main detectives, Thulin and Hess, have that classic clashing-partners dynamic that totally work. The story may not make a lot of sense until you know the chain but it does well to ask you to just go with it. Also, a heads-up, it is quite graphic. Even with its flaws, it\u2019s an awesome watch if you're looking for a dark, fast-paced thriller with some good twists and turns that'll keep you hooked, go for it!\n\nI'd give it a 7.8/10\n\nFlaws: some may feel its a bit predictable (I didn't feel that way) at the end and you have to suspend your beliefs about the killer's abilities lol.",

        "content": "I just got around to watching Wednesday season two, and i was already not enjoying the show much. then in episode four they reveal that the character 'Lois' is not a person in the show but a secret program. i paused the show because i swore i heard those lines before, and after thinking about it for literally half a second, i realize they did the exact same shit in stranger things. whatever secret organization was training eleven was named NINA, and the characters thought it was a name before discovering it was actually a secret program. i thought the show was uncreative before with all the cliche plotlines (such as the person in the hood disappearing from across the street when a vehicle passed by), but now they're actually straight up reusing tropes for shows that are one of the most popular on the entire streaming service! people really pay for this?",
