This ambitious show need not end with the clich\u00e9 of Mulaney waking up from a deep slumber, relieved to find that it was all just one long fever dream. But the show must come to an end\u2014and not because all good things come to an end, but because it\u2019s totally insane. \n\nDeath by three fourteen-year-olds would spell violence for the sake of authenticity, in the name of outdoing the insanity of the internet and exposing final form internet brain rot for its deeply dangerous implications.",

        "content": "A Prophet (2009), directed by Jacques Audiard, is a gripping French crime drama that follows Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French-Algerian sentenced to six years in a brutal prison. Illiterate and alone, Malik, played by Tahar Rahim, navigates a dangerous world divided by Corsican and Muslim gangs. Initially vulnerable, he\u2019s coerced by Corsican mob leader C\u00e9sar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to kill a Muslim prisoner, earning protection but entangling him in the gang\u2019s power structure. As Malik learns to read and secretly studies Corsican, he gains cunning and ambition, balancing loyalty to C\u00e9sar with covert alliances, including with Muslim inmate Ryad.Through gritty realism and intense performances, the film charts Malik\u2019s transformation from naive outsider to calculating player, orchestrating drug deals and manipulating rival factions. Haunted by visions of his victim, Malik grapples with guilt and identity while seizing opportunities during prison leaves to build his own criminal network. The story explores themes of survival, power, and cultural tension in a claustrophobic prison setting. As Malik outmaneuvers C\u00e9sar, he emerges as a new kind of leader, blending ruthlessness with strategic brilliance, setting the stage for his inevitable rise in the criminal underworld upon release.",

Maybe it is because of the serie I was watching (Vikings Valhalla) but I can't really tell if I lose quality or not. But I am very happy this setting exists, otherwise I was thinking about buying firestick 4K which you can disable HDR there as well, and if with the latter option I keep the 4K I would go this route.

The interface always can\u2019t figure out whether it wants to a) get you to watch something from their current lineup b) get you to watch something from their catalogue c) brainwash you with their latest or d) purposely misunderstand you for unknown reasons.\n\nFor example, I can\u2019t remember either the name of the series I\u2019m looking for, nor the names of any of the actors. I have never found a function for reviewing the list of shows I\u2019ve watched on Netflix. I\u2019m easily able to enter the genre.\n\nMy results are many pages of basically unrelated top ten lists. Among possibly 200 results, maybe 20 for into my genre selection. All of those are perhaps the ones with the highest watch counts, I wouldn\u2019t know. The rest of the results are so far off the mark that they would be laughable except that I was there with a purpose.\n\nSearch werewolf: results: Judy Garland biopic, two weeks notice and a bevy of completely irrelevant titles, plus out of 200 results perhaps 30 are unique results. The rest appear multiple times in each of the rows of ten.\n\nSo, thanks for listening. Now, does anyone remember the name of the werewolf series from about ten years ago about an extended family of wealthy werewolves  that included V several main male characters but also one younger blonde female, played by a young martial artist who did all her own stunts?",

Heck, he was a major fraudster it makes sense he would lie, right?\n\n2. Portray the nine ancestral tenets and liver as positively as possible... People saying it changed their life, his kids are healed with no other details given, Brian started the company when he figured out liver was good.  All this can be true as whole foods and better lifestyle choices are good.  No one on the marketing team or ancestral supplements knew about the steroids, he told them he didn't use so they had no idea remember? \n\n3. Separate the brilliant but evil marketing plan that made ALL his supplement companies exorbitant amounts of money from the scam that grew his companies immensely. \n\n4. A mutant physique going viral by taking $12,000 worth of GH per month, eating raw testicles for shock value and denying steroid use to generate more chatter.  He did this to grow his company.  Sure, spreading the word of better living is good, but the main goal is to grow the company.  And they did just that.  Now just make LK the sole evil person and make everyone feel for LK.  \n\n3. Did anyone else notice the beautiful shelf of ancestral supplements the camera panned to right at the end? How convenient, I mean we know liver king lied but he wanted to help and it saved both kids.  Organs and carnivore diets are the key to great health.  Don't want to eat raw organs, let us show you this lovely display of products from ancestral supplements, they are good people who were not in on the scam just profited immensely what a coincidence. Don't buy from ancestral he owns multiple supplement companies. They only told you about one, think that was a mistake? \n\n4. HE LITERALLY TELLS EVERYONE HE'S A FRAUDSTER RIGHT TO YOUR FACE. HE LIED TO EVERYONE.  YOU THINK HE STOPPED BEING FRAUDULENT? C'MON PEOPLE! THE GUY WAS PRINTING MONEY AND DOING FRAUDULENT RECIEPTS.  LITERALLY DOING IMMORAL ASS SHIT TO MAKE MORE MONEY AS HES DOING WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY.\n\nSeriously if anyone thinks this is anything but an advertisement I feel bad for you.  He's duping you AGAIN\n",
