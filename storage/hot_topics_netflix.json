I have several family members with severe mental illness but I can\u2019t figure this out\u2026 \n\nIt was so disturbing to learn what she did to her innocent daughter and her friends. But she was also obsessed with the boyfriend! And then we learn that she lied about having a job! And then we hear her skirt accountability blaming it on her trauma, and then we see how manipulative she is at every level. Like\u2026 I have questions. Weigh in on any:\n\n1. WTF did we just watch?\n2. What mentally illness do you think she has? And what makes you think that?\n3. Why was she fired?? We need a follow up on this. Sounds like Casey Anthony at Universal Studios..\n4. We\u2019re all in agreement that she was obsessed with Owen right? \n5. HOW DID THIS PSYCHOPATH GET FREE IN 18 MONTHS?",

That\u2019s sick, that\u2019s not \u201cthat wasn\u2019t me\u201d \u201ci dont know what i was doing\u201d. She harassed her for almost TWO YEARS. You being assaulted does not excuse you to harass your daughter, it doesn\u2019t even correlate. &amp; then to do it for almost 2 years. \n\nNot to mention her obsession with Owen, that\u2019s disgusting &amp; predatory. She could have just called her daughter ugly, annoying blah blah but she said vulgar things about him. THATS WEIRD. I know this whole thing is weird but it\u2019s even weirder that she was obsessed with him. \n\nI personally would never talk to my mother again. &amp; my mom is by best friend. You told me to off myself everyday multiple times a day. Then said \u201cwell I knew she wouldn\u2019t do it\u201d, I could never trust her again. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

Someone is always arguing with someone else, almost everyone is very opinionated and most are selfish. Clear communication with both of each child\u2019s parents is often problematic.  It is a chaotic lifestyle.\n\nI am curious if others find the married therapist couple helpful or not.  It seems like the writers are mocking them and their therapeutic techniques.  With such a large family, I see the therapists seeing years of therapy costing their clients thousands of Kronor.  When Patrik had the serious incident in school and was distraught, he broke protocol and arrived at the therapists\u2019 home without an appointment.  She was annoyed and couldn\u2019t make an appointment sooner than his next scheduled appointment, which I found cold and insensitive.",
