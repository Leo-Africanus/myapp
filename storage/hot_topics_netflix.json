This was one of this worst series. First of all, why was the daughter not a suspect for the police as she was the last person who saw him dead? There was also NO chemistry between the detectives and that sex storyline was so unnecessary?! Also why would they drag out the whole storyline just to say the daughter killed Aaron?   And then reveal it was the mum? Cornelius said that a few episodes ago too! Also the music.. the acting.. it was TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t understand how people thought this was good? 60K for a dealer to tell james nesbitt that his daughter was seen on the bus\u2026 WHY did the detectives not find out that info from the missing persons report?!? Did they even bother looking for her?!? Honestly I\u2019m raging. The whole show was STUPID!!! Plus why does everyone have a gun in the UK!!!!!!! The percentage of gun violence in the UK is 5%.. FIVE PERCENT\n\nAND ANOTHER THING WHY DID THE PARENTS GO TO THE DRUG DEN AND THE MUM GET HERSELF SHOT IF SHE KNEW WHERE THE DAUGHTER WAS AND WHO KILLED AARON\u2026 it makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!",

The story unfolds patiently, trusting atmosphere over exposition, and it pays off. Every frame feels deliberate. The black-and-white photography is stunning, turning light, shadow, and negative space into tools of tension. Italy isn\u2019t presented as a postcard; it\u2019s cool, distant, and quietly menacing, perfectly matching Tom Ripley\u2019s inner life.\n\nAndrew Scott\u2019s performance is controlled and unsettling, never asking for sympathy yet constantly holding your attention. The suspense doesn\u2019t come from action but from watching small lies calcify into something dangerous. Long silences, lingering shots, and precise editing create unease without ever announcing it.\n\nThe setting, from cramped interiors to vast coastal spaces, reinforces the feeling of isolation and moral drift. *Ripley* is elegant, cold, and hypnotic\u2014a series that rewards patience and leaves a chill long after the final scene fades to black, with quiet confidence and precision",

That\u2019s exactly why their endings left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.\nFor me, Alice in Borderland\u2019s ending felt mid. Stranger Things was fine but divisive. Squid Game\u2019s finale was not much more impactful \u2014 and while I respect that reaction, it didn\u2019t fully land for me.\nI know people do criticize these endings on Reddit, and those discussions exist here. But on a larger scale, it feels like that criticism doesn\u2019t travel far. Outside spaces like this, the dominant narrative quickly becomes \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d \u201ciconic,\u201d or \u201cperfect ending,\u201d and more mixed reactions don\u2019t get much space.\nOne thing I personally felt was that some of these shows played it safe toward the end.\nKeeping most main characters alive \u2014 like in Alice in Borderland and Stranger Things \u2014 isn\u2019t automatically bad, but it reduced the emotional weight for me. Earlier seasons made consequences feel real and unpredictable. The endings, by comparison, felt safer and less memorable, like the story didn\u2019t fully commit to the risks it once set up.\nWhat I find interesting isn\u2019t disagreement \u2014 that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s that sometimes it feels hard to talk openly about these things without it turning defensive. As if enjoying a show means we\u2019re supposed to love every part of it, especially the ending.\nI don\u2019t think criticism means hate.\nAnd I don\u2019t think saying \u201cI expected more\u201d takes away from how good the show was overall.\nSome things that might shape how endings are received:\nEmotional attachment after spending years with a series\nWanting the story to feel meaningful in hindsight\nSocial media edits that romanticize certain moments\nSafer storytelling choices that avoid upsetting large fanbases\n\nNone of this makes anyone wrong \u2014 taste is subjective. I just think it\u2019s healthy to say: this was a good show, and I still hoped for a bolder, more memorable ending.\nGenuinely curious, not trying to argue:\nDo you think recent shows play it too safe at the end?\nWhich endings truly earned their reputation \u2014 and which ones didn\u2019t for you?",

        "content": "After nearly a decade we finally got 5 seasons of Stranger Things. Netflix\u2019s popular sci-fi series has seen its ups and downs over the years, mostly downs, so I\u2019m kind of wondering where all the sudden burst of love is coming from. Could it be a psyop? Could be. But it\u2019s probably something a bit more innocent than that.",

        "content": "While Max and Holly were exploring Henry's memories, there was a scene where Joyce was handing out flyers for the school play. The play that the school would preform is Rogers &amp; Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma\"\n\nOklahoma is about a woman named \"Laurie\" whose at the center of a rivalry between a cowboy (Curly) and a farmer (Jud Fry) - in the end she gets with Curly. During the play, there is a scene called the \"Dream Sequence\" in which Laurie drinks an Egyptian Elixir causing her to fall into a deep sleep. She then has a dream where her and Curly fall in love, just for the antagonist \"Jud Fry\" to kill him and force Laurie to do some awful things.\n\n* Laurie is Mike - Vecna created an illusion where he caused Mike to believe that Eleven was dead (just like the dream caused Laurie to believe Curly is dead)\n* Curly is Eleven - Eleven is not only Mike's love interest, but she's \"killed\" by the antagonist actions just like Curly (even though Vecna's role in Eleven's death is indirect)\n* Jud Fry is Henry Creel (Vecna) - Both are the Main Antagonists\n\nI think Oklahoma is predicting Conformity Gate.",

        "content": "Real or fake. I don\u2019t think is gonna happen that a 9th episode would appear on netflix just because some people weren\u2019t happy with the finale. The show is finished people need to accept that and stop thinking that great final episode is gonna come out of thin air. The documentary is a thing yes that releases 12th but for right now we have a finale an entire show that we could watch and that is called stranger things ",
