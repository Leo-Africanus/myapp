        "content": "Already posted this but it got removed for some reason.\n\nI just finished watching *Million Dollar Secret*, and the ending totally threw me off. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but I\u2019d love someone to help clear it up.\n\nAt the end, only **Sam**, **Cara**, and **Correy** are left.  \n**Sam** doesn\u2019t get to move any boxes, so she\u2019s not important for this part.\n\n**Correy** thinks **Cara** has the money, but he wants to trick her into thinking he believes **Sam** has it.  \nSo when it's Correy\u2019s turn to move the money, he moves it into **his own box**, thinking he successfully tricked Cara.\n\nThen it's **Cara\u2019s** turn, and somehow she guesses correctly, moves the money back into **her** box, and wins.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m confused:\n\nIf Correy really thought he tricked Cara into thinking **he thought Sam had the money**, then he should\u2019ve moved the money into **Sam\u2019s box**. That way, if Cara believed the trick, she would\u2019ve swapped **Correy\u2019s** and **Sam\u2019s** boxes \u2014 and Correy would end up with the money -- thinking she kept the money for herself (or she could have not moved the boxes at all). But instead, Correy moved the money into **his own box**, which only works if Cara *doesn\u2019t* fall for the trick. So... mistake?\n\nBut Cara\u2019s move doesn\u2019t make perfect sense either.\n\nIf she truly thought Correy took the money from her, then logically, he would have put it into **Sam\u2019s box**, she should\u2019ve swapped **Sam\u2019s** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes \u2014 giving Correy the money.  \nInstead, she swapped **her** and **Correy\u2019s** boxes, which happened to be the right move \u2014 but only if she thought Correy had the money in *his* box, not Sam\u2019s.\n\nSo it seems like:\n\n* **Correy made a logic mistake** (he didn\u2019t follow through with his own bluff properly).\n* **Cara may have made a mistake or just guessed right**, which canceled out Correy\u2019s mistake and gave her the win.\n\nMy question is: how did *both* of them mess this up? These are smart people, and I get one of them making a mistake under pressure \u2014 but both? Were they overthinking it? Or was it possibly staged?\n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me, so if I\u2019m missing something or misunderstood their logic, please tell me.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nCorrey tried to trick Cara but didn\u2019t follow through on his own bluff properly. Cara made a move that only worked if Correy made a mistake \u2014 which he did. Somehow both of them made bad moves, but Cara still won. Did they both mess up, or was it staged?",

Let me explain\u2026\n\nHe was right about convincing Cara that he swapped with Sam but if he wanted to follow through with that plan he should have swapped Cara and Sam\u2019s boxes not his and Cara\u2019s. He would then need Cara to swap Sam and his box  (thinking that they were both empty and she still has the million) for him to win. There is no situation where he would have won after swapping his box with either of them. If he swapped with Sam, Cara would have swapped them back leaving Sam the winner and if he swapped with Cara she would have taken it back. Therefore the odds were very heavily stacked against him and he messed up massively.",

        "content": "Recently, it\u2019s been bothering me a lot that autoplay of netflix just ends the episode immediately. Back then it didn\u2019t bother me that much since I could just play back to the episode when Netflix was playing an episode in 20 seconds, but now it just outright ends the episode immediately, and sometimes I just wanted to watch the last part of that episode either for an outro I really like or a sneak peak or extra scene at the very end of that episode. I tried searching on how to turn it off, but nothing that I found was for a tv that had a different format. Can someone help me me please?",
