In the ad, characters literally explain key scenes to each other, spoiling the show we're ACTIVELY watching!?\n\nWhat a terrible decision by Netflix to not prevent this type of thing. I had to yell at my son to close his eyes while scrambling to hit the mute button so it wouldn't ruin the show. I know he's late to the party, but he's just now old enough to watch the show and was so excited to start it.\n\nAiring trailers for future seasons which spoil unwatched seasons is bad enough, but this seems like a new level of disregard. If nothing else, can't they put it some type of setting to disable these types of things?",

        "title": "How Netflix brought interactive voting to \u2018Star Search\u2019",
        "content": "On January 20, Netflix is bringing back the popular talent competition\u00a0*Star Search*, with a twist: For the first time in its history, Netflix will let its audience decide the outcome of a show with live voting. However, unlike how shows have done this in the past, audiences won\u2019t have to send text messages or call a special number to make their votes count. Instead, viewers will vote with their TV\u2019s remote control, or right within the Netflix app if they watch the show on their phones.\n\nNetflix hopes that this level of simplicity will help to make live programs like\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0a lot more exciting, and offer its audience a chance to experience shared watercooler moments that tend to be missing from today\u2019s world of hyper-personalized streaming. \u201cYou can influence the outcome \\[together with\\] everyone at the same time,\u201d says Netflix member product VP Elmar Nubbemeyer. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the Zeitgeist at that moment.\u201d\n\nTo bring real-time voting to\u00a0*Star Search*, Netflix relied on work it previously did for interactive narrative shows. It also snuck voting tests into David Chang\u2019s Netflix show, and showed focus groups segments from two fake shows it cooked up for testing purposes.\u00a0 The company even built internal tools that will help it to repurpose live voting and polling for other live events and shows in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are planning more of these types of moments,\u201d says Netflix\u00a0product designer\u00a0Navin Iyengar. \u201c*Star Search*\u00a0is really the big unveiling of it.\u201d\n\nWhen\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0debuts Tuesday evening, viewers will have two distinct opportunities to make their voices heard. Once a singer or comedian is done with their performance, a graphic will pop up on screen, encouraging each viewer to give it a rating ranging from one to five stars. \u201cWe knew early on that giving a star rating as an interaction was really important,\u201d says Iyengar. \u201cIt\u2019s core to the\u00a0*Star Search*\u00a0IP.\u201d\n\nLater on, they\u2019ll also get the chance to choose their personal champion of the night out of four choices presented next to each other on screen. Each voting graphic will remain on screen for about 60 seconds, and the show\u2019s host\u2014Anthony Anderson, best known for the ABC sitcom\u00a0*Blackish*\u2014will respond to the incoming vote tally in real time.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Netflix has done real-time voting like this, but the company has been experimenting with getting viewers more actively involved for almost a decade. In 2017, the streaming service released its first interactive TV shows, which prompted viewers to choose their own adventure through branched narratives. In one scene of \u201cBandersnatch,\u201d an interactive episode of the dystopian sci-fi show\u00a0*Black Mirror*, the viewer has to decide whether the main character should take his medication by pressing left or right buttons on their remote control, with different choices leading to vastly varying outcomes.\u00a0\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91477533/how-netflix-brought-interactive-voting-to-star-search)",

        "content": "I've been a loyal Netflix user since nearly the beginning, and throughout these years, I've consistently relied on the platform's Details/More Info page. This feature allowed me to read descriptions, check ratings and captions, confirm runtimes, and select the right episode to watch. However, with Netflix's recent design change, many titles now play automatically when you click on them, without allowing us to view these crucial details first. This shift not only disrupts our viewing experience but also raises several significant concerns.\n\nFirstly, the removal of the Details/More Info page undermines accessibility. Users with hearing or vision impairments, or those who prefer certain languages, have been left without immediate access to critical information such as available captions or language options. This change diminishes the inclusive spirit Netflix formerly championed.\n\nFurthermore, for parents, the inability to preview content poses a risk. Without being able to assess content suitability via ratings, parents may inadvertently expose their children to inappropriate material.\n\nAdditionally, for those on limited data plans, it's essential to preview content details to ensure their data is used wisely. Confirming that a show is appropriate and worth watching before it begins streaming is no longer straightforward, leading to possible unnecessary data consumption.\n\nCan we please ask Netflix to restore the Details/More Info page? At the very least, create a customizable account setting allowing users to choose whether to automatically play content or to view details first would greatly enhance user experience and satisfaction.\n\nThis request aims to improve the service for all users and underscore Netflix's commitment to accessibility, family safety, and user choice. Please feel free to weigh in\u2026 anyone else annoyed?",

Y no solo a los del tri\u00e1ngulo.\n\nSiento que Jackie ama a Cole, pero le aterra perder el control. Con Alex hay confianza y cari\u00f1o, pero no esa pasi\u00f3n abrumadora. Y ahora Alex act\u00faa como \"rebelde\", pero claramente es una coraza por el dolor.\n\nMi sue\u00f1o (y quiz\u00e1s el de muchos) ser\u00eda esta estructura:\n\n\u00b7 Temporada 3: \"La Sanaci\u00f3n\"\n      Que no gire solo en torno a \"\u00bfa qui\u00e9n elige Jackie?\". Sino en sanar a toda la familia Walters y su c\u00edrculo:\n  \u00b7 Jackie, Cole y Alex (como describ\u00ed arriba, cada uno con su terapia y crecimiento personal).\n  \u00b7 Los hermanos Walters: Profundizar en Will y su sordera, en Danny y su amor por el arte, en Lee y su b\u00fasqueda de identidad. Que dejen de ser decoraci\u00f3n.\n  \u00b7 Las amistades: Darle arco a Skylar, a Nathan y hasta a Kiley. Que sus relaciones tengan peso.\n  \u00b7 Los adultos: Que la mam\u00e1 Walter y la t\u00eda tengan sus propias historias de superaci\u00f3n.\n\u00b7 Temporada 4: \"La Construcci\u00f3n\"\n      SOLO entonces, con personajes enteros, podr\u00edan explorarse relaciones saludables.\n  \u00b7 Un posible reencuentro Jackie-Cole ser\u00eda desde la plenitud, no desde el trauma.\n  \u00b7 Alex merecer\u00eda encontrar su propia felicidad, con alguien que lo elija desde el d\u00eda 1.\n  \u00b7 Podr\u00edamos ver relaciones s\u00f3lidas entre los hermanos, amistades que perduran y, en general, un \"despu\u00e9s\" feliz y cre\u00edble para todos.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\nPorque Colorado y los Walters son un ECOSISTEMA, no solo un escenario. Su sanaci\u00f3n debe ser colectiva. Esto le dar\u00eda una profundidad incre\u00edble a la serie y har\u00eda que el viaje de Jackie, Cole y Alex se sienta parte de algo m\u00e1s grande y real.\n\nS\u00e9 que Netflix ama los finales r\u00e1pidos, pero... \u00bfno ser\u00eda m\u00e1s poderoso y satisfactorio? \u00bfApoyar\u00edan una temporada de \"sanaci\u00f3n\" que desarrolle a TODOS, incluso si retrasa el \"endgame\" principal?\n\nCompartan sus ideas.

        "content": "Hey everyone, #TeamCole and #TeamAlex (and most importantly, #TeamJackie).\n\nJust finished S2 and, while I loved it, I was left with a strong feeling: if this show wants to be memorable and not just another teen clich\u00e9, it needs to give its characters time to HEAL. And not just the love triangle.\n\nI feel Jackie loves Cole, but she's terrified of losing control. With Alex, there's trust and affection, but not that overwhelming passion. And now Alex is acting \"rebellious,\" but it's clearly armor for his pain.\n\nMy dream (and maybe many of yours) would be this structure:\n\n\u00b7 Season 3: \"The Healing\"\n      Not centered solely on \"Who will Jackie choose?\" But on healing the entire Walter family and their circle:\n  \u00b7 Jackie, Cole, and Alex (as described above, each with their therapy and personal growth).\n  \u00b7 The Walter Siblings: Deepen Will's journey with deafness, Danny's passion for art, Lee's search for identity. Let them stop being background decor.\n  \u00b7 The Friends: Give Skylar, Nathan, and even Kiley proper story arcs. Let their relationships have weight.\n  \u00b7 The Adults: Let Mom Walter and Aunt have their own stories of moving on.\n\u00b7 Season 4: \"The Building\"\n      ONLY then, with whole characters, could healthy relationships be explored.\n  \u00b7 A potential Jackie-Cole reunion would come from a place of wholeness, not trauma.\n  \u00b7 Alex would deserve to find his own happiness, with someone who chooses him from day one.\n  \u00b7 We could see solid sibling bonds, lasting friendships, and an overall believable and happy \"after\" for everyone.\n\nWhy?\nBecause Colorado and the Walters are an ECOSYSTEM, not just a backdrop. Their healing should be collective. This would give the series incredible depth and make Jackie, Cole, and Alex's journey feel part of something bigger and real.\n\nI know Netflix loves quick endings, but... wouldn't this be more powerful and satisfying? Would you support a \"healing\" season that develops EVERYONE, even if it delays the main \"endgame\"?\n\nShare your thoughts. I hope the writers see that there are fans who want a whole world, not just a love triangle.\n\n#TheWalterBoys #Netflix #TeamCole #TeamAlex",

        "content": "*Posted this on letterboxd but I also wanna see a discussion on this here*\n\nWhile watching this I REALLY had to rationalize so so much. I was in an endless rollercoaster of *\u201coh this is bad\u201d \u201cokay yeah no I get it\u201d \u201cno what the fuck\u201d \u201cyeah that\u2019s understandable\u201d \u201cwhat the hell\u201d* and just ended with that.\n\nI am all for messy plots but this was probably just not for me. It deserves this rating *(2/5 stars)* for its execution and filmography at least. What made this movie feel good was how well romanticized it was. Tom Blyth and Emily Bader did incredibly well. For a second, they really make you tolerate emotional cheating, lol. But I also feel like it was so overdone in this movie that in the end, there was just no more rationalizing it.\n\nSo many of the reviews from the ones that have read the book are complaining about parts that were not added and as I\u2019m reading through it all, it makes me thankful they weren\u2019t. What do you mean he was supposed to get a vasectomy after the pregnancy scare even though he wasn\u2019t the hypothetical father? That makes it so much worse.\n\nEverything also felt a bit too romanticized. Kissing in the rain, in the middle of a pedestrian, and during the challengers wind that makes you cheat (iykyk). It felt like they tried to make the kiss scenes feel more immersive, but it just ended up feeling overdone.\n\nAnother thing, Sarah could have said a bit more during that encounter with Poppy at the airport. I understand her implication that \u201cPoppy wasn\u2019t the problem\u201d even though they did end because of her, but it was still a bit vague. It\u2019s probably because she was in a rush and all, but she really could have said a bit more.\n\nAlso, probably the most controversial part of this review\u2014not a fan of the soundtrack. It is so typical and they could have done so much better with some of the song choices. Taylor Swift and CAS, really? But this one\u2019s highly subjective because I think both are a bit overrated. Sorry to anyone who\u2019s a fan of both reading this.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be realistic. What kind of girl who just put on her gloss would make out with someone.",

        "content": "So I saw ST for the first time last November and caught finished the show. One thing that I found interesting is one of the directors said \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if a show can become murky in the middle of it. It can be forgiven with sticking the landing.\u201d/the best part remembered will be the ending. \n\nMy opinion is they didn\u2019t do that. There was just so much questions and plot holes left open. This also made me think about other Netflix shows and their endings. I found it crazy just how much the ending with ST made me not want to rewatch it ever because it felt like they gave up with their characters in the end.\n\nWhile on this subject a show that came to mind that actually did achieve that saying/phrase was Cobra Kai. I know a lot of people have criticism and praise for this show so here\u2019s my hot take. Cobra Kai handled their show and characters better. I felt more emotion for how Daniel, Johnny, and Miguel\u2019s arcs and characters were handled through that show. They didn\u2019t butcher the characters. Even then I can\u2019t complain that the show became murky in the middle. They brought back older characters and introduced new ones which always kept the stakes high. Anyways Cobra Kai is a show I can go back and rewatch with enjoyment. As for ST I can\u2019t say the same with how they handled it. What does anyone else think?",

So I don\u2019t know how to figure tax after a price for Netflix- my state has them( WA state), and im struggling to figure out the end price after tax so I can buy a gift card with that exact amount every month- why?  Ive had too many billing issues with them to do it off my credit card. That said can someone please help me with the tax part of the price?!? The initial price for us is saying - it\u2019s 24.99 a month. Any help would be epic! No I don\u2019t need a math lesson I\u2019m not good with numbers no matter how hard I try so answers like that I\u2019ll ignore to save my mental health. Thanks for reading! I appreciate you all so much for your help!",

        "content": "TW: lots of spoilers. This was actually the most aggravating show I\u2019ve watched. I saw someone talk about it along his &amp; hers (I loved this show) so I figured I\u2019d watch. The first time Adele and Rob astroproject together I saw the colors of their projections so the show was spoiled for me in that moment. \n\nBinged it this weekend but the last episode pissed me off. I thought Louise was smart when she clocked Adele after Adam caught her Astro projecting. But I lost it when she proceeded to call Adele after David told her not to speak to her. FURTHER, tells her about what she knows about Rob and says he\u2019s going to the police\ud83e\udd28. After her failed judgement you\u2019d think she\u2019d actually listen to David this time. \n\nOnly character I liked in this show was her friend. She\u2019d clock Louis all the damn time and rightfully so but Louis shut her off after. That\u2019s the most level headed person Louis had in her life. Idc how much pity she felt for Adele, all those interactions were just gross for character development. How can you claim to pity someone and sleep with their husband repeatedly\ud83d\ude42?? Her judgement throughout the show was so excruciatingly painful.\n\nAs if she didn\u2019t already act stupid enough. She could\u2019ve called 911 to stop the fire. BUT SHE ASTROPROJECTS???? Wtf was she planning to do in the moment. Like it was so foolish it pissed me off. I knew what was coming next when she decides to astroproject and we see Robs projection in the room as well. I was so livid I turned it off when Louise is confronted by Adele and climbs on her.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen so much stupidity in a plot I was aggravated I didn\u2019t want to watch the rest. Like I\u2019ve never seen a worse ending. The fact that Rob wins and David is still sentenced to hell is just sick. I need to wash this show out of my system and forget I ever watched it ",
