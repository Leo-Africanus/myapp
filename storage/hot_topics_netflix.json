        "title": "Million Dollar Secret Winner",
        "content": "This is one of the best reality game shows in Netflix. I was hooked from the beginning.\n\nThere were plenty of times I wanted to scream at the contestants, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell them this\u2026\u201d to convince them you\u2019re not the millionaire, but they end up getting emotional, defensive and raising voices. I learnt that getting defensive like your \u201clife\u201d is on the line can be a truth / honestly signal instead of a signal for deceit. It happened every time in the game (eg Chris, Jaimi) \n\nFor example, Jaimi was twice a suspect. One for voting Lydia and telling the truth. (Sam and Sydnee lied so they wouldn\u2019t be targets) No one believed Jaimi. To me, if I was the millionaire (or not), I would lie about voting Lydia because it instantly puts a target on my back because that was the clue. Jaimi admitted to voting Lydia. So it was obvious she was telling the truth! If you were worried of being caught, you would lie.\n\nStill, no one believed Jaimi. When they found out from the clue that she wasn\u2019t the millionaire, Jaimi could have used that as proof to the group for the next time they suspect her.\n\nAgain, when she was the suspected millionaire, everyone thought it\u2019s her because she told Sam to having two sisters (clue) and everyone refused to believe that another person would conceal it or lie about it. They would always target truth tellers (eg Jaimi or Corey in this case) When Jaimi was in the chopping block, again, she just screamed and cried to defend herself which we already know does not change people\u2019s minds.She could have used the last time she was suspected as proof that she was telling the truth (eg Last time you didnt believe me, and you found out I was telling the truth. This is a game of deception, someone is lying. Anyone who has been honest has been an easy target and has been pinned as the millionaire)\n\n Next, I feel terribly bad for Corey in a way. I don\u2019t think he would ever be able to trust anyone after this show. Lol but in a way, he was naive and his intuition was off throughout the show. He always suspected easy targets instead of thinking deeper (if I was the millionaire, how would I act?) this was missing from him throughout so in a way he was easily manipulated by Cara.\n\nFinally, I feel conflicted about Cara winning because she wasn\u2019t that exciting to watch. But by the end of episode 6, I had a feeling she would win or at least play big in the finale. Why? Because she flew under the radar, everyone trusted her, and she actively kept information about herself hidden. She chose not to share. Her intuition was correct almost all of the time too (Sam was asking info about her sisters because she knew she had the clue, Corey and Sam would vote Sydnee out, Sydnee had immunity, Corey took her box etc) She played the game so very well because of her intuition but I so wanted the winners to either be Sydnee or Sam. They just actively played the game and revealed just enough, but because they were threats that put them in everyone\u2019s radars to be voted off either way! \n\nSam was correct most of time but her emotions got in the way in which she trusted Cara. She kept saying she didn\u2019t have it in her to think Cara would even ever be the millionaire because she wouldn\u2019t let herself go there - that Cara is capable of deceit. This was Sam\u2019s downfall and toxic trait lol Had she kept people at bay and not let her emotions cloud her I believe she would have won. Corey was the same but Corey was off throughout lol \n\nI wonder how they are and what they think about how they were all duped as Sydnee would put it.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Over the past 10-15 years, it seems that European productions, both in cinema and television, have been gaining increasing visibility on a global scale. Whereas it once appeared that everything had to go through Hollywood, now a German, Spanish, or Italian series can become an international success.\n\nI believe this is partly due to streaming platforms. Netflix, Prime, Disney+, and others have made the world more \u201cmultipolar,\u201d even in cinema. Productions are happening everywhere, not just in Los Angeles, and audiences have become much more open to stories told in other languages.\n\nI think of titles like Dark (Germany), La Casa de Papel (Spain), Lupin (France), Suburra (Italy), 1899, The Rain, etc. But also more recent works like Cassandra from Germany, or Adolescence (UK), which has just been released and is already topping the charts on Netflix. And even though it\u2019s a few years old, Zerocalcare\u2019s Strappare lungo i bordi has had a strong impact, even outside of Italy.\n\nSo, do you think this is just a passing trend, or is European cinema truly experiencing a golden age?",

        "content": "okay, in the beginning, i totally loved Brad. I thought he was such a cutie young lawyer who was sincerely interested in Alex's case and helping her with her inheritance. He seemed like a trusted person who he valued her moms wishes for her. HOWEVER.\n\nNina, his girlfriend, was so wonderful and sweet. And the whole time Brad had to play BFF'S with Alex and get WAY too close to her for no reason. I didn't understand why he was so bent on entertaining Alex so much and becoming too friendly with her. She was his client. And he had a great girlfriend (who he seemed like he loved).\n\nAlso the fact that Alex showed no respect for Nina. And how she showed very little remorse for being the reason that Brad could have cheated.\n\nSo no, I was never rooting for Alex and Brad. Though I get why Alex would like him -- he's wonderful, cute, successful, kind, and somehow intertwined with her mom's passing.\n\nI really saw potential for this plot and film. I thought everything her mother said about Alex was true when the film started. That Alex was not truly living her fullest life for some reason. And I think bringing out 'The List' was a wonderful idea. It was poignant, touching, and sweet everything that her mom articulated about what her daughter may not able to see for herself, or ignoring.\n\nHowever, I think that having it become a thing, of now Alex has to go out and achieve every single goal in order to receive her inheritance and videos of her mom pretty strange, and rigid.\n\nPointing out 'The List' was a great thing to do. But not to make Alex go out and do them for a goal. She has to find it in herself, in her time, to do those things. Not for someone else, like a little checklist. But yes, to give a nice acknowledgement and nudge to Alex- I like. I feel like acknowledging 'The List'  was supposed to be about giving a general outline of things that may bring meaning to Alex's life, who seems lost at the time.\n\nI know this was based off a book, and to be fair it was a cute book idea. But seeing it visually made me realize, that some of these things would not work in real life. just my thoughts. what are your thoughts on the movie?",

        "content": "\n\n(My perspective as a former teacher\u2014what did you take from the show?$\n\nI recently watched *Adolescence,* a Netflix drama that has been getting a lot of buzz. \n\nIt\u2019s about a 13 year old boy who lost his way. The people who were supposed to be guiding and shaping him dropped the ball, hard.\n\nEpisode 2, a one-shot progression through a chaotic high school environment, gave me flashbacks of my old workplace. The camerawork makes you feel like you\u2019re really there, and all the unhappiness is pressing in on you.\n\nThe teens are *running* that school.  Their disrespect for authority is  on full display, blindingly bright. \n\nThe only rule the students follow is evacuating the building during a fire alarm. Due to the painfully loud alarm, they wouldn\u2019t want to stay indoors anyway.\n\nThe students don\u2019t respect any authority figures\u2014not the teachers, the principal, nor even the police.\n\nWhen the police and school authorities stand in front of a class to give important information about a murder, the students openly mock them. **No consequence** is enforced for their rudeness.\n\nInstead of fighting through lectures in front of defiant students, the teachers have given up. In every classroom the camera passes by, you can hear the students being \u270c\ufe0ftaught\u270c\ufe0fby videos. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d asks one teacher, who hardly shows up to his own class.\n\nAs the principal hurriedly walks by some loitering students, she chides them to go back to their classroom. They call her a rude name. **No consequences** again\u2014she keeps walking.\n\nEnter Jade, a student and important witness. She rudely refuses to cooperate in a police interview and makes personal insults at the adults. Again, there are **no consequences.**\n\nWhen Jade assaults another student, she gets pulled aside and isolated in a separate room with a minder. The teacher doesn\u2019t act stern or angry with Jade. Instead, she syrup-sweetly asks about Jade\u2019s mum and how she\u2019s feeling. This \u201cRelationship building\u201d(we\u2019ve all been beaten over the head with this phrase) doesn\u2019t stop the attacker from angrily storming out of the room, going back among the other students. The teacher weakly calls after her, \u201cYou have to stay with me. You have to.\u201d Apparently, no, she doesn\u2019t. \n\nThese teens don\u2019t have to do anything they\u2019re told to, because they face **zero consequences** for disobeying.\n\nI came away from this episode thinking how differently these kids would act if they\u2019d been brought up from a young age with corporal punishment in schools. Somehow, it\u2019s become fashionable to think negative reinforcement doesn\u2019t work, but the zero guard rails approach isn\u2019t working either.\n\nI\u2019m sure that suddenly re-introducing corporal punishment on a hoarde of disrespectful, violent teens would result in mutual violence and chaos. These kids are too big, too set in their ways, too numerous, and too aware of their own power to be put back in their place. \n\nBut there\u2019s something primal, to a small child, about the exercise of picking your own switch for a teacher to beat you with. Having to stand in front of your classmates and endure it. Having to participate in your own humiliation, because you know something *worse* will be done to you if you don\u2019t comply.\n\nIt creates a deep knowledge of who controls the classroom: adults. Cultures that inculcated their children with this knowledge didn\u2019t produce such a high percentage of unreachable, unteachable teens.\n\nI know it sounds awful to use pain, fear, and humiliation to control kids. Some authorities take things too far, and use discipline as an excuse for sadism. But unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen the culture kids create when we let them control things. It\u2019s anti-intellectual, slothful, disrespectful, hateful, and rife with bullying. They are too young to know what is good for them. \n\nEven some adults would choose terribly if not for law enforcement. Consequences don\u2019t prevent all crime or all disobedience, but it sure does help.\n\nThere are a few kids who are intellectually curious and self motivated. They will master curriculum independently of any environment they\u2019re placed in. But the average kid will go along with what is easiest. Drop them into a hellscape like the one depicted in this show, and there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll turn out educated or with strong character.\n\nThe main character of this show had a void in his life where the guiding adults should be. His parents left him to his own devices. His school environment made it impossible for teachers to guide him. The void was filled with the toxic influences of delinquent peers, bullies, and online hate groups. \n\nThe whole system needs a serious overhaul. Teachers need to be made into authority figures again. That means support from admin in the face of angry students and parents. That means cooperation between teachers, admin, and government to enforce consequences. Maybe that means corporal punishment? Or at least *something.* Most places don\u2019t even enforce detention anymore, as the parents can\u2019t have their work schedules disrupted by an odd pickup time. ",

It was a horror movie in set in the 90s in Mexico about this girl who had 2 younger siblings in which she always took care of them cause her mom was almost never there. They summoned some demon and i remember at some point the little brother accidentally drew some symbol that brought back the demon. I don't remember the name of this movie but I vividly remember it and I can't find it. If someone knows the name, can you tell me?\u200b\u200b",
