No fights are high adrenaline scenes. Just conversations that feel meaningless to the plot. Rose is actually unbearable with her storyline of constantly changing her mind about staying or leaving was so frustrating to watch and it just feels ljke theyre forcing her into the show. Big boss lady is awful and horribly acted. Peter feels like a shell of himself in this season and half the episodes is just his relationship with rose. Its all awful. The final problem with this season is the muslim people always speaking that language. I dont have any problem with muslims or their language but o hate that half the episode isnt captioned and half of it is and when it is the conversations still feel pointless. Who else agrees?",

With almost every major media company now running their own streaming service and fighting for subscribers, it\u2019s more important than ever to have a variety of good content. Keeping shows with solid writing, even if they\u2019re not huge hits, could help in the long run by pulling in niche audiences, keeping loyal fans around, and making the platform look better overall. Instead of only chasing big, instant successes, streaming companies should think about the long-term value of having a mix of different shows that keep people watching and stop them from canceling their subscriptions.\n\n",

But I start on season 2, and the captions are atrociously wrong. It felt more like they were summarizing what the characters were saying instead of actually captioning it. At one point, a character speaks in a very quiet voice and the captions say \"Naruto....\" when she was clearly whispering a full sentence. \n\nI thought maybe the cc and subtitles for the show got mixed up, and switched between them. Not only is that the not case, but the cc do not even follow the Japanese script. (From what I saw)\n\nI am just very confused and frustrated and was wondering if anyone else was having this issue? I was really enjoying myself but it's very frustrating to not be able to fully understand what's going on in it.",
