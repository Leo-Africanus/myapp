When they again show footage from some time ago they add the distortion so that viewer subconsciously can place the footage in time (\"ah, right, we're having a flashback\").\n\nDid anyone else notice this? And is it indeed an editing trick to help the viewer? Or is really all their archived footage damaged?",

        "content": "There were definitely some problems. First of all their were way to many call backs like I get it the shows about the end and they were about to fight in the biggest karate tournament in the world but did they really have to add a callback to literally every scene. Next how did the sekai tekai get brought back that early seriously only a month I felt like they should have made it a bit longer. Also why would the Sekai Tekai even be the valley I get that it's better narratively but realistically it made no sense. When kreese and silver died it felt so abrupt and also how did kreese even kill that guy that silver hired even daniel could barely beat him so how in the world did he kill him without a weapon. They also didn't even address at all their deaths. Axel got so heavily debuffed it was crazy. The guy went from getting barely hit from being beaten by miguel. Also this is a small detail but why was the Russians even there you could see them right before the fight was about to start. Also Wolf I like his character but honestly it made no sense why he was abusing Axel so much without even doing anything to Zara. I feel like he would be even more frustrated at her because she's not focused. Another huge misoppurtunity was I kinda of wished that Johnny would go back to him and just console him a bit after losing a final. It would be so sweet and awesome. Feel free to critique my points but I'm just curious what you guys think.",
