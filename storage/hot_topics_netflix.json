        "content": "The acting, man, the acting was straight up magnificent. What the hell. How can a one hour long episode about a psychiatrist and a 13 yr old boy be so fucking gripping? The back and forth, the one-take, the expressions, the physicality, the _craft._ I gave this episode \na standing ovation in my room because it deserves it and soooo much more. The way both the actress and the child actor did their scenes... I am truly speechless. Their talent is astounding and apparent and so compelling. The range of emotion, the humanity in the twistedness of Jaime, the eventual realisation and coming-to-terms of the psychiatrist, the way the spectrum of Jaime\u2019s character was shown without disarming clarity. \n\nI will never ever forget this episode. I thought the first two were amazing but this one. Goddamn. God fucking damn. Some actors are just meant to be and I hope this boy goes far and I hope him and the actress earn their flowers (I will look them up once I\u2019m done with episode 4 but I just HAD to spew my thoughts out about episode 3 first. The writing, the dialogue, the camerawork, direction, cinematography all are spectacular in their own right but I feel like in such a claustrophobic setting as the third episode, it couldn\u2019t have worked so magically had lesser actors been on the job so just appreciating that aspect here primarily).

But honestly episode 2 hit me harder. The power the kids had over the adults. The fucking hurt and rage of Jade. The sheer magnitude of having 100+ child actors doing their job effortlessly for a full hour. The CAMERA WORK (a literal seamless transition from ground to drone). The fluctuations between tight, emotional portraits to clinical medium to wide shots. The acting all around from, what\u20267 leads? It was an absolute masterclass in filmmaking and already is in my top episodes of any TV show, ever. I am completely marveled.",

        "content": "To everyone saying it\u2019s pretty clear in the first episode and all the evidence points to it. \n\nI, like many, was waiting for the plot twist where *anyone else* was the murderer. \n\nAnd I sat with why, one reason is - it\u2019s because we are constantly shown what it looks like from Jamie\u2019s view. Like the lady constable DS Frank said in the school, \u201cRight, the perpetrator always gets the front line. \u2018A man raped a woman\u2019. We\u2019ve followed Jamie\u2019s brain around this entire case\u2026Everyone will remember Jamie. No one will remember her\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also shot in such a way that you *feel* like you are a bystander - right next to Jamie, experiencing everything with him. \n\nFrom the moment they barge into his room, sitting in the van looking out the window, not eating his cornflakes, drawing blood, the strip search and to the room where he keeps denying it. You say yes he punched her but you don\u2019t SEE the knife or the stabbing clearly. \n\nAnd then as the episodes progress, you pick and choose the information that supports your hypothesis. He was bullied, he just retaliated. Someone else has the knife. \n\nThe only impact we visibly see of Katie\u2019s death was her friend - who was hurting but was also rude &amp; violent &amp; \u201ctroubled\u201d. \n\nThe scene with the psychologist also starts with Jamie being beaten - again more sympathy. He likes hot chocolate, he LOOKS so innocent. Boys will be boys, but Katie rejected him, while he was doing a nice thing by showing her support. The only time you feel some sense of horror is when he\u2019s yelling at the psychologist, but then he calms down and says sorry. \n\nUntil he actually says he wants to plead guilty, you don\u2019t *want* to believe it. \n\nThis whole show is a masterclass in **how we erase the victim every step of the way**. The narrative is always from the man\u2019s point of view and we forget the woman. \n\nAnd how to find excuses because we don\u2019t want to believe. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what Katie looked like. But I know Jamie likes hot chocolate and hates pickles. \n",

        "content": "I loved the show, I watched a few days ago, and since then I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of videos and post about the show. Something that\u2019s been bugging me is the hyper fixation of the bullying. I don\u2019t think it should be ignored, it was showed for a reason, however I hate seeing people use it as a justification or excuse for murdering Katie. \n \nJamie was a victim, but not of Katie\u2019s. Katie\u2019s comments were made after he participated in the passing around of her nudes and the negative commentary of her body and then tried to take advantage of Katie\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by asking her out. When she rejected him he felt so insulted and humiliated because \u201chow dare someone who is flat and who no one else wants rejects him\u201d. When she retaliates by calling him an incel he tries to intimidate and scare her and when that doesn\u2019t work he murders her. He then leaves her body on the ground, runs off and proceeds to deny murdering her even though there is OVERWHELMING evidence that he killed her. He feels absolutely no guilt and even tried to validate himself by calling her names later in the series. A lot of people act like Jamie is Katie\u2019s victim or that the names she called him is why he killed her when it\u2019s not. \n\nJamie is a victim of societies unrealistic standards for men, unbroken familial cycles, the school system and other men who prey on insecure, neglected and isolated boys. With that being said I don\u2019t feel bad for Jamie, I recognize what he represents however I feel no sympathy. Jamie still killed an innocent girl because he was insecure. Jamie did not kill Katie because she called him names, he killed her because he felt small and powerless and needed to make someone feel weaker. \n\n(This is just how I interpreted the show, I\u2019m interested to hear yalls opinions!! Just keep it kind please) ",

(Atleast this is also my take on how I knew it wasn't mainly about the murder) we saw him confess but nothing like major court scene. It was nice to see the family POV and it gives us a better picture on how he grew up. But I wish we saw some of the before the murder, to get to see more of his attitude towards her. \n",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t seen much discussion about this. People are mainly putting the blame on incels and toxic masculinity. While I agree, I believe the main reason why he lost control is because of his childhood upbringing by his parents while well intentioned. \n\nHis dad experienced physical abuse from his dad. That shapes the way he treats his son. He tries his best but he has a terrible temper as we see the way he confronts the graffiti boys. That scene was chilling since it really reminded me of the way Jamie acted towards the therapist and the girl he murdered. If the dad was holding a knife I could see things turning out differently. He was out of control with his anger hence throwing paint all over his car and staining the carpark. I believe Jamie really didn\u2019t mean to go as far as murdering him. His rage (learnt from his dad) took over and he lost control.\n\nThe way his dad talks to his mum was terrible. Treating her without respect and that would shape Jamie\u2019s view on how men should treat women. This might\u2019ve led him to be drawn to the incel community. Also his lack of self worth could be from his dad as well, never being able to please his dad. As a child, pleasing our parents is our #1 goal and this helps build our self esteem, see us worthy of dating. \n\nIf his dad went to therapy before he had a child and sorted out his rage and his attitude towards his wife, things could\u2019ve turned out a lot better. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I wanted people to pick up this idea more. I hoped this would make parents wary about how they treat their children, how it effects children when they see their parents argue (peacefully talking vs yelling until the other subsides). ",

        "title": "I found adolescence disappointing *minor spoiler\u2019s*",
        "content": "I would like the preface this by saying I did enjoy the show overall, but after the incredible amount of hype around it I just finished feeling like 'am I missing something?'\n\nEpisode 1 was great, and really established the theme and tone of the show. Episode 2 was the weakest by far, most of the conversations didn't make sense (why would they go to a school and go in front of a class looking for and just so openly admit they don't have the murder weapon) episode 2 also had some real wooden acting and some definite miscasting of the child actors (Tommy and Jade just did not suit their roles, jades conversation with the investigators felt like she was reading off a script) also Faye as a character felt pointless and did not add to the show at all, basically felt like Luke's shadow, I really cannot comprehend what people liked about this episode in particular.\n\nEpisode 3 was by far the strongest, felt like I was stuck in the room with Jamie and the psychologist, and the descent into Jamie's psyche was gripping.\n\nEpisode 4 was just so disappointing, i understand the idea of showing the lingering effect on the family and this longing for an answer to 'where did we go wrong?' But I could not connect to it at all, the scene in the shop just didn't click, the nonce point I guess could show how out control these things can get especially now with social media and that people make comments that don't make sense just cause it's more acceptable to commit a crime against someone who's son is a murderer, even if you write the word nonce which no one in the show is. although the episode does do a good job of showing the dads underlying violent nature and aggression it felt like a running commentary being read at me at the end, i just did not do it for me. I think an episode in the cou in the prison with Jamie would have been much more interesting.\n\nAnyway I'm not saying I don't appreciate the artistry and I appreciate the planning and everything that went into it but I do think episode 1-2 were the only ones where the one shot worked cause you feel trapped in these\n'interrogation rooms' and experience this unrelenting barrage of questions exactly as Jamie does, but the other episodes just didn't do it for me.\n\nOverall I think I just went in with too much expectation and I'm only writing this because I can barely find any critique of this work! I am normally on the 'right' side when it comes to media but this is the first time where I've felt so far removed from the popular opinion..",

        "content": "Are there any other people that enjoyed this series in the begining but after a while that \"justifying a fraud\" thing started annoying you? At the begining I liked Mike, he was kind and it was fun to watch, but since season 4 this justification and normalisation of his crime is getting on my nerves since his caracter became super cocky and annoying. I feel like this show is trying to sell that it's ok to be a fraud as long as you're super duper smart and have bunch of amazing lawers to cover it up for you.\n\nIt started as an interesting show but now I'm not sure I can keep watching it.\n\nI'm venting here because I hate it when I give my time to a show and it turnes out to be annoying. \n\nWhat's your opinion on this show? Did anyone feel the same after watching it?",

        "content": "Do you think Jamie left his house that night with the plan to kill her?\n\nFrom the CCTV we know he stalked her, then had an altercation where they pushed each other and then came the stabbing. Both Ryan and Jamie said the plan was to scare her with the knife. Did his anger/rage just take over once she said something he didn\u2019t like, and now he\u2019s put himself in a situation where he\u2019s out of control with a knife? \n\nI think this could be why he maintains his innocence throughout when there\u2019s clear evidence he did it. He lost control and instantly regrets his decision once the anger/rage passes. He knows he did it but he\u2019s in denial and as the months go by in the training centre I think his denial finally becomes acceptance and changes his plea.\n\n",
