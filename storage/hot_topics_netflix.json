The way he plays Elliot awkward, brilliant, paranoid, and somehow still relatable makes the whole show work. Without him, it wouldn\u2019t be half as powerful.\n\nYeah I know it might not be a real \"Netflix\" show but it is on Netflix. What really stuck with me wasn\u2019t just the story, but how real the underlying themes felt. The hacking, the data breaches, the constant sense that someone\u2019s always watching it all got under my skin. I ended up going down a massive rabbit hole learning about cybersecurity, privacy tools, and how vulnerable most people really are online.\n\nNow I actually use different VPNs depending on what I\u2019m doing, run privacy tools to wipe old data, and even started monitoring data leaks with cloaked just to see how often our information ends up exposed. It\u2019s wild how a show meant for entertainment can completely change how you see technology and the world around you.",

When it first comes on, the quality is good, but then, before long, the resolution just gets worse and worse as time goes on. \n\nWhat's happening?! I even went to the playback settings and clicked on high data usage, where it's supposed to show the best video quality for my plan. But still, the poor quality doesn't change, it's still horrible regardless. So idk what's going on. \n\nDoes it have something to do with it being on pc? Or the type of plan that I have?

Just finished watching *Boots* on Netflix and had to jump into r/netflix to share\u2014and I highly recommend it if you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nFirst off: the brotherhood. The camaraderie between recruits under pressure, the friction, the breakdowns, the reunions\u2014every bit of it felt *real*. You\u2019ll find yourself rooting for them when they clash, and cheering when they pull together.\n\nNext: the character work is super nuanced. None of the characters are just \u201csoldiers in training\u201d\u2014each has layers, vulnerabilities, secrets. That makes them all worth your time.\n\nAnd yes\u2014it *does* explore hidden identities. Sgt. Sullivan (played by Max Parker) is this tough-as-nails, by-the-book drill instructor, but beneath the bark there\u2019s a closeted truth, a personal weight. Parker nails it.\u00a0\n\nWhile the first season sets things up brilliantly, there are still threads left open\u2014so yes, I\u2019m all in for Season 2!!!\n\nIf you\u2019re into shows that blend **military grit + growth + brotherhood + queer undercurrent**, this is your kind of watch.\n\nSo\u2026 who else has seen it? Which character struck you the most? And what do you hope to see in Season 2?",

However in the show he keeps speaking English to all the Portuguese characters (I mean he\u2019s also Portuguese himself), and they respond in PT and everyone just chugs along.
