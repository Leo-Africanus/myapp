        "content": "Okay, I keep seeing comments about what a terrible documentary it was. Could it have touched on more? Of course. But I don\u2019t think that was the point.\n\nI think the point of the film was to get at the heart of how this show, that loved the numbers it drew from shocking the public - because they literally wanted people to stop flipping the channel when they passed by and it worked - and how the impact of seeing people violent and pitted against each other had a horrible influence on all of us.\n\nWe see reality TV shows still push the boundaries in different ways, but they feed off of making us disconnect from our own lives and play comparison - at least my life isn\u2019t that bad!\n\nBut we are further seeing the psychological impacts on our everyday lives in the political world. We are losing our empathy for each other when we are all each deeply shaped by our life experiences. I get that everyone is different, but we\u2019ve become so divided and I have no doubt that Jerry Springer among other reality shows, among other factors in the media are doing an excellent job at feeding our apathy. We aren\u2019t each other\u2019s enemies. It\u2019s the people at the top who are playing mind games. We aren\u2019t going to see the change we long for until we stop turning on each other.\n\nThis is what I got out of the film at least. Anyone else?",

It was on Netflix for awhile, still could be.  It had a number/year for the name. It was a medieval/kings/magic type show. \n\nHere come some spoilers, so if you have watched it then you know - \n\nIt is a story about 3 friends. 2 are dating, and the other was adopted by a king. Long story short - as I remember the three of the them come up with a plan. The female in the couple agree to \"fake\" marry the friend to save the kingdom or something... there is a battle - she thinks her boyfriend is dead, so she and new hubby really start looking at each other as husband and wife - then find out bro isn't dead... there is a big battle at the end of the series - chick finds out she is preggers with bro's baby....\n\nWhat was that series called?\n\nThank you!! \n\nEdit: Much thanks to everyone who took time out of your days to help me find this! The show is called Barbarians! Thanks @ExitStageRight99",

        "content": "I'm trying to create a new Netflix account but it's not working. On the home page I enter my email and click the Get Started button, but it takes me to the sign in screen as if I already have an account. I don't recall ever creating an account with that email address, but I enter my usual password and hit Sign In, and it tells me that it can't find an account with that email address. Trying to create a new account again just takes me in a loop of the previous flow. Attempting to use Forgot my Password with my phone number or email address gives me the same message that I don't have an account with those details. I tried running in Incognito mode and using the Android app, and that also didn't work. Is this a common issue, and how do I fix it if it is?",
