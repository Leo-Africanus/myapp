And they always trigger my memories of how the city smelled (I lived in Brooklyn) the days following 9/11. Anyway, I\u2019m no history bluff and I\u2019m sure people will debate on the accuracy of the events that unfolded but from my standpoint, I thought the documentary was well-made and yes, I wish it was a little longer.",

        "content": "This is a brilliant AD for ancestral supplements. Here's how they did it.\n\n1. Paint liver king as a broken, troubled, but \"just trying to get a good message out\" guy who takes all the blame and is the only bad person in this story. Heck, he was a major fraudster it makes sense he would lie, right?\n\n2. Portray the nine ancestral tenets and liver as positively as possible... People saying it changed their life, his kids are healed with no other details given, Brian started the company when he figured out liver was good.  All this can be true as whole foods and better lifestyle choices are good.  No one on the marketing team or ancestral supplements knew about the steroids, he told them he didn't use so they had no idea remember? \n\n3. Separate the brilliant but evil marketing plan that made ALL his supplement companies exorbitant amounts of money from the scam that grew his companies immensely. \n\n4. A mutant physique going viral by taking $12,000 worth of GH per month, eating raw testicles for shock value and denying steroid use to generate more chatter.  He did this to grow his company.  Sure, spreading the word of better living is good, but the main goal is to grow the company.  And they did just that.  Now just make LK the sole evil person and make everyone feel for LK.  \n\n3. Did anyone else notice the beautiful shelf of ancestral supplements the camera panned to right at the end? How convenient, I mean we know liver king lied but he wanted to help and it saved both kids.  Organs and carnivore diets are the key to great health.  Don't want to eat raw organs, let us show you this lovely display of products from ancestral supplements, they are good people who were not in on the scam just profited immensely what a coincidence. Don't buy from ancestral he owns multiple supplement companies. They only told you about one, think that was a mistake? \n\n4. HE LITERALLY TELLS EVERYONE HE'S A FRAUDSTER RIGHT TO YOUR FACE. HE LIED TO EVERYONE.  YOU THINK HE STOPPED BEING FRAUDULENT? C'MON PEOPLE! THE GUY WAS PRINTING MONEY AND DOING FRAUDULENT RECIEPTS.  LITERALLY DOING IMMORAL ASS SHIT TO MAKE MORE MONEY AS HES DOING WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY.\n\nSeriously if anyone thinks this is anything but an advertisement I feel bad for you.  He's duping you AGAIN\n",

        "content": "Most analysts are saying HOLD!!!   \n\nYet I\u2019m thinking about buying? The thing holding me back is that the majority of the analysts are saying HOLD! Netflix is my second favorite stock. I trade daily. My banker said,\u201dI haven\u2019t run into one of you in years.\u201d. I\u2019ve been in the positive column since the day I first started buying it. I\u2019m retired. Have one friend I discuss trades with. Then we compare results. I wasn\u2019t sure which flair box to check. Trading stocks and art are my sorta jobs \ud83d\ude0a. ",

        "content": "Today I've learned that The night Agent was renewed for a season 3 while the recruit was cancelled after season 2.\n\nIf you watched both we can probably agree that the Recruit season 2 was amazing while the NA was pretty shit and very boring.\n\nI don't understand, was the recruit too expensive? Are Netflix users allergic to good shows? What happened and how is it possible to make such random decisions?",
