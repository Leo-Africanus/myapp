        "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom episode 1 I could already tell where the story was going, I remembered reading long ago about a horrible case that happened in Australia in 2015. This case has truly haunted me ever since bc of how blatant the failure of child services and complete lack of justice + lenient sentencing of the murderers were\n\nSecrets We Keep follows the exact same storyline as the Tiahleigh Palmer case. Tia was a 12 yo foster child living with the Thorburn family in Logan City and just like in the series she was being raped and abused by her then 19 yo foster brother Trent Thorburn, who again like in the show got her pregnant. that rapist pos panicked someone would find out and told his parents who then decided to kill Tia and dispose of her body in a river or lake (again just like with Ruby who was  raped by Oscar and murdered by the Hoffmans + her body disposed in a lake). Trent confided in his cousin about the pregnancy just as Oscar showed Viggo a video of him abusing Ruby.\n\nThe father, Rick Thorburn, was the only one who received a life sentence while the murderous mother and son served only a few months in jail. That monster never cracked under pressure to tell the full story even tho all evidence also implicated the mother + the son. since he was the one who physically killed Tia and disposed of her body he was the only one held fully accountable. He actually died recently on april 12 in prison (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/12/child-killer-rick-thorburn-who-murdered-tiahleigh-palmer-found-dead-in-queensland-jail-cell-ntwnfb)\n\nThis case is so fucking sad, i really wish Netflix would acknowledge that the series clearly mirrors tia story and at least state that it's inspired by a true case bc those horrible stories do happen irl. Tia never got justice and was failed by everyone around her, I just hope shes at peace now. I\u2019m so incredibly sad and angry that the whole system failed her in every way possible \n\n\n",

        "title": "Why are the subtitles so bad?",
        "content": "I'm hard of hearing, to some extent (mental disability, not physical. My ears are fine, but I have difficulty processing words that are said), so I strongly rely on subtitles for a lot of shows.\n\nUsually it's fine, but Netflix struggles hard with them, where even Youtube's auto generated subtitles tend to be more reliable in some cases.\n\nSome animes I've watched through Netflix ended up just being confusing due to poor translation, but even fully english content has serious\\* flaws.  \n  \n\\*serious in the case of my disability, as I can still hear the word fine, I just take longer than usual to register it.   \nWhat this means, is if I want to keep up with what's happening on screen, I need subtitles so I'm not in the dark about what's happening in the moment. However, if I read a word and \\*do not hear\\* the same thing, my brain just stutters, and I feel like I'm tripping over my own comprehension.\n\nTo memory, the most recent case was The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, by Wes Anderson. The subtitles were missing words, adding words, and in some cases just changing the context of this \\*very\\* deliberately composed film.  \nIt was one of the few cases I've ever decided to turn off the subtitles and just accept that I'm going to be behind on the words.\n\nFrom what I understand, far more people are using subtitles recently, especially with so much media becoming more \"mumbly\" with their dialogue.  \nIn this world, where subtitle usage is growing more and more, what is it about Netflix that causes them to fall so far behind?\n\nI have DVDs with subtitles on them that are more accurate than the exact same movie on Netflix. Why can't they just use the perfectly usable and accurate subtitles from the DVD, or wherever they get it from?\n\nEspecially with their own productions, don't they \\*own the script\\*? Can't they just pull the actor's lines from that, and call it a day? Surely that would be better than whatever it is they're doing now.",

        "content": "I just finished Season 4 of Stranger Things and I can't stop thinking about Dustin and his loss of Eddie. Eddie wasn\u2019t just a friend to Dustin\u2014he was a mentor, a brother, and someone who accepted him for who he was.\n\nDustin looked up to Eddie so much, and the way they bonded, especially in the final moments, was so heartwarming. Eddie was someone who believed in him, even when others didn't. So seeing him die in such a heartbreaking way was tough on Dustin\u2014and it hit me too.\n\nThe moment Dustin said, \"I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone,\" my heart shattered. Eddie was a gem, and the way he went out, fighting for his friends, made his loss even more tragic. For Dustin, losing Eddie wasn\u2019t just about losing a friend; it was losing someone who truly understood him and had his back no matter what.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what Dustin must be going through, and I\u2019m hoping that in Season 5, he gets the healing and peace he deserves. Eddie\u2019s death was one of the hardest things to watch this season.\n\nAnyone else feel the pain Dustin must be feeling after that loss? Eddie was a huge part of Dustin\u2019s growth, and it\u2019s devastating to see him go. \ud83e\udd7a",

I get this error when I'm away from my parent's home for prolonged periods, but I'm on the home network right now and it's not working. I have double checked that the TV is on the same WiFi as my phone, I've logged both devices in and out, I've tried resetting the Roku and my phone, and it still just gives me the error. I know I can (and frequently do) get a temporary code for 14 days, but since I'm on the home network right now, I'd really rather just log in and have it approved for 30 days. ",
