So I went and cancel my subscription, and now I am completely lost on what will happen... I received two mails just after cancelling: one email says that my subscription will end on 15th april, the second email says I will be able to watch until 27th January!\n\nI tried to contact netflix customer care by phone and chat, to understand when my sbcription will end: the girl on the phone wasn't sure about the answer, but in the end she told me the subscription will and tomorrow, and my 18.01 eur will remain in my balance and I can restart when I want. Since she wasn't sure, I tried also the chat: the girl on the chat wrote me the opposite: even if when I enter nexflix it says \"You can use Netflix until the of subcription on 27th january 2026\", she confirmed that with prepaid card the subcription will go on unil the credit ends, on april 15th\n\nI am so confused and I am also afraid that if I don't do anything now I risk to lose the vision AND the prepaid credit, and of course I cannot trust their customer care operators that told me two different things.

I really enjoy stories where friendship, first love, and emotional bonds grow while dangerous or mysterious things are happening in the background. Shows or movies with suspense, secret organizations, supernatural elements, or crime investigations are totally my vibe, as long as there is also a soft romantic angle that develops naturally. I like characters who are around school or college age, dealing with crushes, loyalty, jealousy, and growing up while facing big threats. It would be amazing if the story has strong chemistry between the leads, slow-burn romance, and moments that make your heart race, both because of action and because of feelings. The overall mood can be dark, adventurous, or emotional, but not too graphic. Basically, I\u2019m looking for something that combines excitement, mystery, and love in a way that feels youthful, intense, and binge-worthy.\n\n",

        "content": "Watched this show recently and\u2026 wow. I think this was a show equivalent of the phrase \u2018that escalated quickly\u2019. I did have a lot of questions which are probably just plot holes:\n\n1. What was the point of her tooth infection? I thought it would come back to make sense at some point and other than her losing the tooth when Catherine/Lexie hit her, it was just- meaningless?\n\n2. Why did they have all that plastic tarp, bleach, and other torture weapons laid out in that lake house if they were not planning anything sinister? \n\n3. How is it even possible that Anna, who used to hang out allll the time with Catherine when they were kids, couldn\u2019t recognize her at all (despite the weight loss and change in hair color), not even an inkling, when working in the same office BUT her mother for some reason immediately picked up on who it was???\n\n4. How is it also possible that Anna married the brother of the girl who watched (and helped) her get raped- and it NEVER came up? How does that dynamic work? Why? How? What?\n\n5. Why did she never tell Jack about the rape? What his sister did? Additionally, in the end after Catherine got arrested WHY did she lie about what happened? What was the point of telling him Catherine got assaulted and not her, if she genuinely believed that Catherine was the killer and the whole thing was solved? Why the lie now?\n\n6. Why the hell was Catherine saying Anna \u2018laughed in my face\u2019 when SHE was the one that abandoned her there to get raped? Anna very clearly saved her from that trauma and she repaid her by letting her suffer what she was about to- so why was she acting all angry about it? \n\n I feel like there were more question marks for me after watching the show than there were any answers. I also feel like, with the whole lake house scene and the way it was shot, that the writers originally planned to do one thing and then just pivoted to make it twistier. Idk.",

        "content": "People inside the buildings coming up and waving, the constant commentary over Alex speaking, the unnecessary conversations with him while he\u2019s over a building and getting the crowd to shout at him whilst he\u2019s up there. Having his wife appear from inside - it\u2019s like they\u2019re doing everything they can to throw him off his game. This is incredibly anxiety inducing as it is, and it\u2019s like the production team have instructed certain behaviours to make it borderline unbearable. It just feels so performative which is not what his climbs are usually about. \n\nI get it\u2019s fun for the show, and looks cool, but the guy is climbing a skyscraper ffs. \nHe\u2019s doing enough to get you your views, please just let us watch him climb and PLEASE LET US HEAR HIM. I\u2019m so sick of the constant yapping from the panellists; it\u2019s like they\u2019ve been told not to come up for air. Stop doing weird commentary and playing these videos when he\u2019s talking, we want to hear his thoughts, his process, his funny quips. \n\nFeels really irresponsible of Netflix to allow this tbh; like the marvellousness of a free solo climb is just being made a mockery of tbh and this is a real person up there. A huge disservice to climbing, and to Alex. Props to him for absolutely giving the crowd what they\u2019re after though. Couldn\u2019t be me! \n",

        "content": "I mean, ok, this guy should be a star of climbing but\u2026 what would netflix do if he wouldnt make it? Like giving up was ok, but what if he was actually falling? Was netflix ok to show LIVE someone dying?\n\nAnd this is normalising this kind of challenges, what if there is gonna be some scapegoats?\n\nCome on, are we such a shitty society where we need to get our adrenaline pumped by someone risking their life for our entertainment\n\n",
