All the characters wear shades of blue and brown through each episode, and all their eyes are bright blue. Beyond that, the houses, apartments and business offices all have blue and brown walls and accent pieces, even the outdoor Safari birthday party has decor and guests in those colors. There are also smaller accents of purples and greens. There\u2019s enough to let me know it was more than intentional, it\u2019s meant to be noticed. But why? ",

        "title": "Had fun at Netflix House Philly",
        "content": "Had a fun time at the Netflix house. Here are my opinions:\n\nAs soon as you walked in, the host invited you to a movie screening and it was completely free. Not sure if that was only because we went on a Saturday. Their theater is a gorgeous Netflix red color and the fabric seats are very comfortable with plenty of room. The seats do not recline. \n\nThe host will also give you a rundown of everything available &amp; answer any questions you have. There was definitely no shortage of staff wherever you went and everyone was so pleasant. They also had security guards on duty in high traffic areas. \n\nTons of selfie/picture opportunities available in the general admission areas. You\u2019ll find yourself dodging photobombing people left &amp; right during the busy times.  My favorite section was definitely the Bridgerton display; was gorgeous! \n\nThe gift shop was also in the general area &amp; extensive! They had so many unique things available for purchase, so if unique Netflix related swag is your thing, you\u2019ll like their shop. \n\nI didn\u2019t try their restaurant in the general area, but a full restaurant is available to purchase sit down meals. \n\nPaid features:\n\nMini golf - we didn\u2019t do the Netflix show-themed mini golf so I can\u2019t give my opinion on this experience. \n\nPuzzle experience - the Philly location currently has The One Piece puzzle. It was so much fun. I recommend it for teens &amp; older fans as you have to figure out clues to proceed in the game. You also have to participate in slightly physical games and you have to work together as a team. You do not have to be a fan of One Piece to enjoy the game, but fans appreciated all the detail even more than the average attendee. They estimate a 45minute completion of the game, but my team only took 30 minutes; I guess we\u2019re a smart bunch. That leads me to say, if you\u2019re anti-social, avoid at all costs. Each game needs 12 players for very specific reasons. Unless you bring 11 people with you, you WILL be grouped with people you do not know. Please don\u2019t be that person that ruins the fun for everyone. \n\nArcade experience - The Philly location has Wednesday as its gaming adventure. I assumed Wednesday would be a puzzle just like One Piece as it was the same price, but it was not a puzzle experience. This adventure is for sure for all ages but younger kids &amp; teens that are fans of Wednesday Adam\u2019s will have the best time. The main area is an arcade themed around the Adam\u2019s family. The rest are gorgeous photo opportunities. If you are not a fan of Wednesday, I wouldn\u2019t suggest this experience. This area\u2019s attention to detail was far beyond my expectation and it was amazing being able to take photos in live scenes from the show. There is a small puzzle aspect to this area, if you can find it ;). Definitely keep your eye out for posters telling you about the puzzle. I\u2019m still a bit confused why this experience is timed. You basically enter &amp; can do whatever you want. My only thought is that it\u2019s to keep it from getting too crowded at one time. I did enjoy this experience but did not feel it was worth the hefty price tag. \n\nVR experience - The VR game was by far my favorite part of the Netflix house and well worth the money. We did the 45 minute Stranger Things VR and maaan, that thing was tons of fun. It\u2019s a physical experience &amp; lots of movement is involved. You\u2019ll be grouped as 6 people per experience &amp; the hosts give you a thorough walk through on how to setup your gear. When purchasing, you can choose 25 minutes of 45 minutes. Afterwards you\u2019ll be able to sit and watch snippets from your experience that the team records and edits. You\u2019ll also be given access to your recorded session afterwards. You can either wait for them to email you a copy of the video, or you can scan the host\u2019s QR code &amp; download it immediately. \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience. The biggest stand out was the staff. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re feeding those people in the cafeteria but everyone \u201cdrank the koolaid\u201d and was 100% dedicated to their characters. \n\nEven if you just want to stop by and check out only the free stuff, as a fan of the bigger Netflix shows, you\u2019ll find something for you to enjoy. If you pay for anything, do the VR. It is the best bang for your buck as it\u2019s a lower price than One Piece &amp; Wednesday. ",

        "content": "About two months ago, I watched La For\u00eat(The Forest) and The Chestnut Man consecutively and the experience stayed with me because both shows are very different but still very enjoyable in their own ways. La For\u00eat(The Forest) felt very emotional and full of atmosphere, with a quiet and mysterious mood that slowly pulls you into the story. The forest setting gives a strong feeling of isolation, and the show focuses a lot on the feelings, relationships and hidden secrets of the characters. It moves at a slower pace, but it gives enough time to understand the people and their struggles, which makes the story feel more personal. After finishing it, I started The Chestnut Man, and the change in style was very clear. The Chestnut Man is much darker, faster and more intense, with a very engaging investigation and strong twists that keep you thinking and make you want to continue watching. It has a serious Nordic noir style where everything feels cold, sharp and full of suspense. Watching these two shows back to back made their differences stand out even more, but it also made me appreciate how both types of crime stories can be equally powerful. Even though one is emotional and slow while the other is thrilling and dramatic, I truly enjoyed both for what they offered. I want to ask others who have watched both shows: which one did you like more, and what made it your favourite?",

        "content": "I just saw the new Frankenstein movie and I thought it was absolutely amazing! However I'm a little confused about the ending of it. It seems that the monster wants to find Victor but let Victor hunt him all the way to the North Pole? Why did the monster run from Victor just to want to find Victor on the ship? If the monster wants to die and Victor wants to kill the monster why didn't the monster let Victor try to kill him? (Through surgery or any other means).",
