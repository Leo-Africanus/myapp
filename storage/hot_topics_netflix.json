        "content": "When Dahmer first came out I remember thinking wow this is probably one of the best limited series I\u2019ve watched (coming from someone who never knew who he was) and was not shocked when it won so many awards. Then by the end of the series with them teasing John Wayne gacy I was thrilled to see that this trilogy wasn\u2019t over and that another serial killer who this time I knew would be the next story they focus on. When the news was confirmed that the next season would be about the Menendez brothers who this time I knew a lot about I was kind of disappointed not because of them personally but because I think the Segway from Dahmer to JWG especially since they were active during the same time would have made an awesome season 2.  Why didn\u2019t Netflix decide to go ahead with JWG is beyond me. Now with season 3 being Ed gein, who mind you barely has any video or audio recording to base the series off with most of it being inaccurate and dramatised, has Netflix missed the potential to make a record breaking trilogy series beyond Dahmer? Especially considering already the ratings for Ed gein aren\u2019t merely as high as the Menendez brothers yet alone Dahmer. \n\nNow again, with the teasers for season 4 being Lizzie Borden? I mean seriously, Ed Geins evidence to base season 3 off was dry to nothing and now they want to focus on someone way before Ed geins time? I don\u2019t think the ratings will be going up anytime soon if they don\u2019t plan to start focusing on newer stories with some evidential backup. \n\n(Also when I say seasons I knew they\u2019re separate shows it\u2019s just to help the timeline ) \n",

        "content": "Now iam gonna be pretty vocal about what I thought when the series was announced...I was FREAKING EXCITED to see a story about this man who inspired many movies and what was he really like . Hollywood has been taking this man's story and making movies but we really didn't know the real story behind who ed gein really was. Fast forward few months letter, we got updates about hitchcock, Perkins , etc who are going to have a character in the show which was pretty interesting to me at least. BUT OH MAN , THEY BUTCHERED so lemme talk about it one by one\n1) This show didn't need freak8ng 8 episodes because it felt dragged out for no reasons . While making a series on real events you outh to lay out the episodes in such a way that the episodes contain those events without dragging... instead here they had to add extra some made up shit just to make the series longer wth??\n2) This brings me to this point, by the end of this series you get this idea about the show basically telling us that ed gein wasn't this antagonist character they portrayed with false narratives and that he was just a sick man who deserved to be told his own story because hollywood never did . But this series did exactly the same by adding stuff which was not even confirmed and repeating the same mistake\n3) Ed gein was a ill man because of his circumstances initially in his childhood But WE DONT GET TO SEE ANY OF IT... NOT EVEN 1 EPISODE OF HIS FAMILY DYNAMIC WHICH MADE HIM THE WAY HE WAS...he's entire family is dead by episode 1 and we are pretty much clueless about his circumstances and what made him the way he was\n4) VICTIMS - HOW THEY HELL DID THEY COME UP WITH THE CONCLUSION ABOUT SOME OF THE STORIES OF THE VICTIM BECAUSE IAM PRETTY SURE ED GEIN WASN'T INVOLVED WITH BERNICE. its not only disrespectful to the victim's family but also to those people whos live was completely destroyed \n5) Him killing evelyn hartley,\n And the two men in his farm should have been used as a perspective of the police and letting us the viewers decide IF he did kill them or not because that's what really happened. We don't know for sure but this show decided to tell this in such a way as if THIS HAPPENED??\n",

But instead I find that shit. \nI had a lot of hype for this season, I thought it would be good and above all that it would be the creepiest of all. But it feels pretty bad.

Plus there are so many stories/perspectives that could be told alongside it for commentary: Aaron Fisher and his mom (self-identified victim and mother), the red-haired assistant whistleblower, Paterno, Dottie Sandusky.\n\nI have to admit I haven\u2019t enjoyed the most recent seasons of Monster but Dahmer remains some of the best television I\u2019ve ever seen. And all three have been great with their social commentary. I just wish Ryan Murphy was more interested in facts and less interested in shocking sex scenes. \n\n",

        "content": "I've been a customer since DVDs. Was super excited to cut the cord. Was all about streaming, didn't once opt for the cheaper plan, but it's finally happened. I've reached the end of my list and Netflix is no longer keeping up with my viewing habits. \n\nI'm wondering if stranger things will be my last month subscribing. I used to be able to count on having a show that was fine that i didn't care much about, but was interesting enough to put on with the wife. Neither one of us are very stratified or interested in what's left. There used to be something to at least consider each month, but since they started splitting seasons it's more like something every three months. \n\nWe quit HBO/max when they stopped delivering new content just before the discovery merger, though it became clear paying for months of zero content was their plan. Disney is just as bad. We're just paying for a library. As soon as the youngest is old enough to not break disks I'll probably dig out the player and cancel that too. Cancelled prime due to the ads.\n\nApple was doing the best, but the drip is slow, so we're waiting for content.  I'm not against reading a book or checking out from the library. I have always loved movies and tv, but what I love is story and novel content. \n\nI know a bunch of you are agrieved over cut and cancelled shows. I hear that, but I didn't much care as long as something was around to watch. I think we might move to streaming 3 months out of the year or something. \n\nBasic cable was somehow better, and I'm throwing up in my mouth saying that.\n\nBut maybe I'm just not being surfaced good content that exists? What we've liked (here or elsewhere): bsg, last air bender (not the live action), fullmetal alchemist, outlander, stranger things, lupin, sandman, wednesday, good place, severence, big door prize, lucifer, game of thrones, firefly, trek (Voyager, strange be worlds), bridgerton (i tolerate it), witcher, wheel of time, rings of power, umbrella academy, lockwood &amp; co, ted lasso, unstable, murder bot, pluto, mrs maisel, shadow and bone, upload, disenchanted, warehouse 13, eureka, cobra kai, lost in space, Westworld, merlin, dragon prince, community, andor, murder bot, arrested development, Queens Gambit\n\nProbably more too... But Netflix thinks I just like horror or trash romance. I actually kinda hate horror, it's only when the writing is very good that I get past that. I watched squid games (for the wife) and wouldn't choose to put myself through that again \n\nI've bounced off: black mirror, the boys, foundation, supernatural, most of the new star wars stuff, most of the new trek stuff, halo, most sitcom/reality stuff\n\nThen there stuff that I'd watch, but only if there's nothing else: altered carbon, top chef, mandalorian, and other stuff where the vision or writing isn't quite good, but I'll deal because it feels like they were trying.",

It was so different from anything I have seen before. Strange, emotional, and full of mystery. The way the story was told kept pulling me in. I kept wondering what would happen next.\n\nAfter I finished I looked it up and saw it had a lot of praise but was cancelled after only two seasons. That made me kind of sad because I really feel like it could have gone somewhere even bigger if it had more time. Netflix has so many shows that end up disappearing under the radar, even when they are really good.\n\nSo I wanted to throw this out to the community. What is a Netflix show you think deserved way more attention? Not the big ones everyone talks about, but those hidden gems that maybe only a small group of people know about.\n\nFor me The OA will stick with me for a long time. I keep thinking about its ending and the questions it leaves open. I wish more people had seen it so we could talk about it.\n\nI would love to hear your picks. Is there a show you watched on Netflix that surprised you and deserved more love? Something you wish had gotten more seasons or more people watching? I feel like this could turn into a great list of hidden gems we all need to check out.\n\n",

        "content": "Is anyone else appalled at the portrayal of Adeline Watkins in this new series?? Show spoiler: she\u2019s straight up suggests to Ed that he dig up a body to be his girlfriend and then proceeds to help him grave rob. There\u2019s no evidence anywhere that Adeline was suggesting things like this or involved in his crimes. If I was the family of Adeline I would be so incredibly upset at this portrayal. Just ranting/wondering what you all think!",

        "content": "If I watch half an episode of a show, I go back later and it either starts at the beginning or thinks I\u2019m on the next one. If I pause Netflix on my TV for 10 mins and come back, it loses where I\u2019m at and exits the app, doesn\u2019t happen with any other service. If I watch half an episode on my iPad, then try and finish it on my tv, it loses my progress AND puts me back one or two episodes. \n\nAm I alone or does everyone deal with this? \n\n",

        "content": "So I used to have the version of Netflix that had ads. I recently moved to the ad free version, and I just realized tonight that I still get ads on the live programming. What I don\u2019t understand is before with my ad free version I could start the show a half hour late and it would auto skip. The commercials had already were done until I caught up live. (the next day on demand I would be forced to watch them.)\n\nMy question is now I\u2019m forced to watch ads even starting late. Is this something brand new?",

If anyone has any better ways please let me know I'm a broke college kid trying to mooch off my mom still.",
