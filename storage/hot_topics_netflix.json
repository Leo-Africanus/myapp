This gives me hope that they\u2019ll preserve the integrity of the novel. Still, I\u2019m left with so many questions about how they\u2019ll approach this:\n\n\t\u2022\tis it be a faithful adaptation or a more modern reinterpretation?\n\t\u2022\tHow will they tackle the intricacies of the Buend\u00eda family tree without overwhelming viewers?\n\t\u2022\tCan the magical realism elements\u2014like the rain of yellow flowers or Remedios the Beauty\u2019s ascension\u2014be done justice on screen without losing their surreal, poetic essence?\n\t\n\nFor those of you have read it,  what do you think.

        "content": "I thought it was ok, good, not bad, but a little bit meh on the first watch through with some great points throughout it. But on a second watch I see finer detail and how it's just a perfect masterpiece of mavenry. It's well acted, directed, and it subverts expectation just the right amount. It doesn'st just follow a formulaic stereotypical form, it choose art. The creative choices are immaculately chosen and it's all so cleverly pulled together\n\nThe way they could have had a basic main character family ninjas working against just basic non-ninja criminals who posed no real threat back to them but they chose a rival and powerful ninja clan was a stroke of genius, it's so much more suspenseful, for them to have an equal footed enemy, rather than some easy target non-ninjas who they could basically have no fear or pushback from.\n\nSPOILER\n\nThe brainwashed, working for the enemy, returned from the dead brother also a great plot choice. What's so great about it, is that ninjas are mythically renowned for mind control... and in this show *they actually do it*! It's just so great. Again it's a complex and sophisticated plot point which you wouldn't expect and enriches the series so much because it makes your eyes go wide with amazement that the plot could be so out of the ordinary hum drum typical show\n\nThe enemy leader of the Fuma, the 19th... man, just one of the coolest most amazing, breathtakingly cool characters I've ever seen in any kind of tv show or film. On the surface he may seem dull or uninteresting. His composure is inconceivably strong. But never once does he raise his voice in anger, or show the slightest hint of fear, worry, panic, he emanates so much intelligence due to how calculated and prepared he is for every single situation and scene. He is too smart and too clever to ever be caught out or unprepared for anything. He's the most perfect villain I've ever seen. He lets the good guy go free, he gives him the flower, he doesn't even care, he's too confident and it's so unexpected\n\nThe cat Hanzo is amazingly adorable and they didn't overdo it with excessive focus on it, so tastefully allotted in its screen time. Small doses but just enough\n\nI could go on but I have things to do",
