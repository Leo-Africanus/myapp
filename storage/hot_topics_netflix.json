Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years?\n\nPeople talk about it on social media, share their opinions, sometimes it's on talk shows, Game Of Thrones did this best, I don't know why Netflix doesn't do this. WEDNESDAY was the same.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nObviously, just give me the entire season all at once. The premise is that they \\*DONT\\* do that anymore. And honestly, splitting up the seasons of these shows a few episodes MONTHS apart is so much worse than week-by-week episodes for a few months sraight.\n\nAlso, people tend not to give a @#$% anymore after binge watching half the season and then having to wait another month for the rest. Am I only in this way of thinking?",

All of the dialogue scenes I'm turning up 5 volume levels more than I normally do, and even then it's still quiet. But the moment any sound effects happen, they're insanely loud.\n\nJust curious if there's an issue with the netflix version of this movie, because I'm not having this level of issues with anything else. I would say maybe it's the movie, but I would think netflix probably works on audio regulating and optimizing themselves as well. \ud83e\udd14",
