(But that is needed for the DRM/HDCP shizzle, so Netflix allows to play higher quality than 1080p)  \nOnly happens on Netflix (tested Disney+ and YouTube).  \nHappens with and without a second monitor connected.

        "content": "A decade or more ago there were only a small number of platforms, e.g. netflix, Amazon. \nThen when Disney for example decided they wanted their own platform, along with a dozen other companies, it resulted in a hugely diluted market place where no one or two subscriptions can provide any meaningful breadth of content that existed back then. \nYet each of the subscription options offer about 10-20% of the content that Netflix and Amazon used to, but still think it's appropriate to charge \u00a310-15 a month.\n\nFor me, this did not result in any improvements as a consumer but represented potential increases from &lt;\u00a320 a month to &gt;\u00a350 a month, which I wasnt willing to spend on 5-6 subscriptions.\n\nI occasionally run an Amazon sub under student pricing and cancel it the second the content I wanted it watched. \n\nSomething else I found frustrating is having to scroll through pages of foreign content or even worse, foreign content that's not obviously foreign until you press play and see/hear the awful dubbing. \n\nI'm looking at you netflix, using foreign content to supplement your lack of new content over the past few years.\n\nI would suggest they have options to filter content in the same way you can by age rating or content type only selecting your preferred language it was filmed in, sifting out any content not in your preferred language or dubbed content if that's your preference. \n\nAt this stage, if that option ever appears I suspect it would be behind a pay wall.",

I\u2019ve got the Netflix Premium plan, and while I do get Ultra HD content, I can\u2019t seem to get Dolby Atmos only 5.1 audio shows up.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets weird: when I switch over to Netflix on my Windows laptop, the receiver actually does switch to Atmos (shows up right on the front panel), but the video quality is kinda trash because the app doesn\u2019t handle 4K well.\n\nI\u2019ve already made sure passthrough and eARC are enabled on the projector, so everything seems set up correctly on paper.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering is this a known issue with the Netflix app on Google TV, or could there be something off in my setup? And most importantly\u2026 is it even possible to get both 4K and Dolby Atmos on a projector setup like this without needing an external streaming device?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone\u2019s cracked the code on this.

        "content": "I thought the show was solid and definitely went through it faster than I thought I would consider considering I already watched all of it and it\u2019s only been out a few days. The breakout stars of this are Garrett Wareing who played Lucas and Jack Schumacher who played Yancy. I thought Minka Kelly also did a good job and Josh Duhamel was fine but something tells me Yancy and Lucas will be getting more screen time.\n\nReid/Lauren: Unfortunately, from an appearance point of view; the actor portraying Reid is a total miscast. I could not stop thinking about it while watching any scene that he was in. He\u2019s half the size of everyone, but somehow he\u2019s the high school star quarterback? He\u2019s just nowhere near as good looking as Lucas so it\u2019s almost laughable that he\u2019s in a love triangle with him and Lauren. Again, he\u2019s half his size, I just kept thinking about how Lucas could flick him to the ground if he wanted to. They should have had the actor who played Tim play Reid. That would definitely be believable for that dude could be in a love triangle with Lucas and Lauren. Reid was also the only actor in this show that was portraying a high school student but didn\u2019t actually look like one because he looked too old. Maybe it\u2019s shallow of me, sorry, but just my honest thoughts. Seems like a nice guy.\n\nCap: I\u2019m very intrigued to see what they do for comic relief in the second season that is inevitable to be ordered because he was the only person who consistently provided that this season. I feel like this is dangerous territory to be walking into because now that he\u2019s gone, they\u2019re going to have to bring in somebody else to fill the comic relief hole. If that person isn\u2019t good, then that hole will become wider. It\u2019s not like he was so laugh out loud funny all of the time, but it certainly was a piece of the puzzle that worked well that won\u2019t be here anymore.\n\nStaten/Quinn: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think they were bad, but they definitely didn\u2019t have the best chemistry. I\u2019m guessing that they didn\u2019t get along great when the camera was off is the most likely answer. I wasn\u2019t clamoring for them to end up together, it just seemed obvious the whole time that they were going to eventually, so it just felt a bit static.\n\nYancy/Ellie: They had great chemistry and I think this was a large part of what carried the show so well. I think Yancy will break out and become a huge star from this because it was always fun to watch him, but she was also fantastic.\n\nThe Mom twist: I understand what the show was doing because they kept hinting at the fact that Tim and Reid were the culprits of the death so I knew they weren\u2019t going to end up having much to do with it and having the mom eventually be the one who did the killing just felt like it was so out of left field. I know they did this so it would be very hard to predict, but it just didn\u2019t feel like it mattered all that much and left no impact on me. it\u2019s also hard to believe that she would cheat on that chiseled chin cop with Kit. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the fact that she was only in like the first episode early on and then she doesn\u2019t appear again until way later. It just felt like cheating. It was also weird to me that she took what Lauren said to her while she was drunk and decided to get straight and sober.Typically these things don\u2019t happen while you\u2019re drunk and they are from conversations you have while you\u2019re sober.\n\nLauren\u2019s Dad: I think the actor did a pretty good job. I just thought it was so annoying how they had him ignoring Staten the first few episodes as if he\u2019s crazy and you just knew exactly where it was going to go. How a piece that large from a truck in a crash could be sitting there for a year is pretty hard to believe, but the fact that he thought it didn\u2019t matter at all and had nothing to do with anything and was so adamant and dismissive of Staten was pretty stupid. The fact he lost his wife to Kit is also hard to believe considering this is the best looking guy in the whole show. Hopefully they give him a storyline with some romance in the second season because that guy could steal anybody\u2019s girl.\n\nThe bottom line is that the show is not going to win any Golden Globes but it was definitely entertaining and I watched all of it in less than two days. I look forward to the second season and look forward to what they\u2019re going to do with it. I\u2019m not going to read the books so it\u2019s probably already predetermined, but I would be absolutely shocked if this show did not get picked up for at least another season and most likely a lot more\n",
