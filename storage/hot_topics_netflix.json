        "content": "I just watched the finale of Next Gen Chef and I found it to be seriously suspect.  \n\nThe show already had some questionable moments.   The episode where they did the brigade service and expected the restaurant to have a different kind of fish substitution, and a substitution for a roaster ingredient to be ready in the normal time frame seemed pretty unfair and unrealistic. Who is going to ask for a different kind of fish? That\u2019s like saying I don\u2019t like beef, do you have lamb (when lamb isn\u2019t on the menu). \n\nA restaurant that\u2019s stocking proteins that aren\u2019t even on the menu is probably going to have food cost issues pretty quickly out the gate. But that\u2019s not even the real problem with the show.  \n\nThe winner was an employee of two of the judges. He was the former employee of one of them, and the current employee of a highly influential finale judge.  In general, I liked the guy and by all accounts he was very confident. Aside from an extremely weird moment where he screamed at London for singing, he was a likable contestant. It\u2019s just when you\u2019re facing people who admired your cooking enough to hire you - TWICE - the question of authenticity really starts to seep in. \n\nBy the end, it just felt weird when he won, and it could have been avoided if they\u2019d just done some homework in booking the judges, or\nbuilt the games blind where they couldn\u2019t know who they were judging. \n\n",

        "content": "Morning everyone,\n\n  \nI just finished a chat with Netflix support but wasn\u2019t able to get any real help, so I thought I\u2019d ask here to see if anyone else has run into this or found a solution.\n\nI use multiple devices at home on the same network to watch Netflix\u2014mostly TVs, but also phones and computers. Until this morning, everything worked fine. Suddenly, my desktop (which is connected via Ethernet) started giving me a message that it\u2019s \u201cnot part of the same Netflix Household.\u201d Yesterday it worked without issue.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, the household restriction was mainly intended for TVs, and you\u2019re only able to confirm/update your household through a TV\u2014not a computer. When I asked Netflix chat about it, their answer was basically: *\u201cGrant your 14-day permissions every two weeks to watch, or use Wi-Fi on your computer.\u201d* That wasn't helpful, especially since my desktop is not a wireless compatible device.\n\nA bit more context:\n\n* My Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections appear to use different public IP addresses, though they are on the same Class C network.  It is only IPv4, not IPv6.\n* My Wi-Fi runs through a mesh system wired into my modem/router.\n* My desktop is directly plugged into the same modem/router.\n* It seems my ISP might be assigning more than one IP, which is interesting but might be the issue.\n\nHas anyone else run into this, and if so, how did you resolve it? It\u2019s frustrating since everything was working fine up until today, and now Netflix suddenly thinks my desktop isn\u2019t part of my household and the only help I am given is to connect it to the same Wi-Fi as my other devices are using.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

        "title": "Just finished Adolescence",
        "content": "Wow, I just sobbed at the very last scene of the Dad sobbing in Jamie\u2019s room and tucking the teddy bear in. Facing what\u2019s probably been his biggest fear since the day he found out what Jamie did - that he, as his father, should\u2019ve done more. \n\nThere were so many emotions to hold while watching this show and I especially felt it during this episode. I wanted to be angry with his family, because that\u2019s the easiest thing to do when a 13 year old boy does something like this. Assume his family/home life is terrible. But there was this mixture of love, shame, anger, and grief they were experiencing. I\u2019ve seen other comments on here say that the dad was emotionally abusive. This may be my own blind spot coming out as the daughter of a man with anger issues, but I can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s what the series was trying to depict or not. What I saw was a man with temper issues but that those issues were extremely exacerbated by trying to keep it together and being in denial about his son\u2019s actions. Not that people are merely \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d but seeing his family be \u201cgood\u201d people made it a more emotional watch for me. And it makes me wonder how it is Jamie became the way he did. \n\nI felt gutted by the last scene and I thought it did an excellent job of demonstrating the grief they are going through. They are grieving the son they once knew and who they thought he was. They were trying to make sense of how this happened even though they had the best of intentions and were, by all means, a pretty \u201cnormal\u201d family. But as I felt gutted for his family, I had to remind myself what her family must be going through. And how what happened was tragic and Jamie\u2019s actions wreaked havoc upon everyone around him - no one in his family did what Jamie did but they are paying for his actions. But at the end of the day his main victim, above all, is the girl whose life he felt entitled to take, and nothing can ever change that. It\u2019s something his family will have to accept and her family will have to grieve forever. ",
