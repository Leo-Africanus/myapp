I\u2019ve contacted Netflix support twice today and a few other times in the past about this dumb household limitations. You can only request a vacation code in advance and only a few times a year. I travel for work often and Netflix ALWAYS force closes every minute in all  hotels. At first I thought it was Marriott hotels all having shitty TVs but finally caught onto the pattern that it is a NETFLIX issue. Prime and Max work perfectly fine in all my hotels. But I cannot use Netflix in my hotel rooms while my husband uses it at home. (I pay for more than 1 screen btw.) even if my husband is not at home and I log out of every single device and only log into my mobile phone and the hotel tv, Netflix still force closes every minute on the tv. There\u2019s no option to update household on the TV Netflix. It just doesn\u2019t exist. Does ANYONE have anything they\u2019ve done that has helped with this or advice? Do I just cancel Netflix atp?\n\nTL;DR Netflix \u201cset household\u201d isn\u2019t an option on my hotel tv, I cannot stream Netflix while I travel for work, and I travel often. Any tips/advice?",
