        "content": "This is literally the best exmaple I\u2019ve seen so far of a show that should\u2019ve have been so much longer yet was obviously done in a way to make it short and full of action within just 8 episodes. This show should\u2019ve been 20 episodes. Instead the creators decided to do what Netflix has now done multiple times and condense it into one of those shows where it\u2019s just nonstop action and plot twist and turn with conflict and resolution happening way to fast. It\u2019s a great show, but way too fast passed. Which is what ruins it. The characters don\u2019t have enough time to develop and that makes the show feel shallow and not as intense or meaningful because u lack connection with the charictors. An example of this is how quickly cane\u2019s character is brought in and how quickly it goes south with him, it\u2019s supposed to be a sort of plot twist, but it doesn\u2019t even feel like one becuase there\u2019s not enough time to even developed a proper plot. Another exmaple is how quickly the early plot twist with sherif is done and how quickly the sherif goes from partner to being killed. It\u2019s just all far too rushed and should\u2019ve been carried out through multiple episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this exact issue of rushed shows so much recently on Netflix, they had great potential but just were executed in this poor fashion which ruins the whole thing.

Was taken directly from the Roku home page to an ad and then the show started playing.\n  \nIt was very confusing at first, but its not uncommon for animes to start in weird spots with a lot going on to drag you in and catch you up.\n  \nAbout 12 minutes in, it dawned on us. We were watching the last episode. Everything about the episode culminated in \"this is the closing of a story\".\n  \nI backed out to see that it had taken us DIRECTLY to the last episode and auto-played it. None of the previous episodes have any play time on them.\n  \nThe show was instantly spoiled for us.\n  \nThis $500 TV is less than 6 months old. The bug is reproducible and there are many forum posts on Netflix and Roku community forums from the last 2-3 weeks complaining about this. Where both Netflix and Roku are passing the blame to each other.\n  \nIt's our fault honestly for trusting technology to do something correctly, with how bloated and garbage smart TVs, streaming services, and technology in general, are these days.\n  \n**TL;DR:** Be aware that there is a reproducible bug when selecting a search result in Roku that is on Netflix where it will automatically play the LAST episode of a TV series. Whether this is a Roku bug or Netflix app on Roku bug is unclear, as they keep passing the blame.",

I can still press esc to exit this view.\n\nI have already tried:\n\n\\- 4 different browsers: Opera, Chrome, Firefox and Edge.\n\n\\- Using their Windows app\n\n\\- Clearing cookies\n\n\\- Entering my e-mail address using all caps\n\n\\- Restarting my desktop\n\n\\- Using WiFi, mobile hotspot and ethernet\n\n\\- Logging in by asking a forced password reset\n\n\\- Waiting 24 hours (and more)\n\n\\- Updating my system and browsers, as well as having Chrome as fresh installation.\n\nNone of these fixed anything. I can do everything on another laptop used by my caregivers as well as my phone, but I can't do that every time nor do I want to use my phone to watch shows. I do not want to do a complete reset of my desktop as it will require multiple days of reinstalling everything and setting things up the way I want them, just to watch netflix. \n\nThe last support person I spoke to rushed through everything I said and didn't actually read it all, frustrating me more and more the more we spoke. The 2nd support person I spoke to supposedly escalated my issue, but I'd never received a message or e-mail that it had, which I wanted to know in the first place from my last point of contact.\n\nHonestly, I'm at my wit's end, I just want it to work, but nothing we have tried works even remotely. If anyone knows how to fix these issues, that'd be AMAZING. For now I really just can't do anything.",

        "content": "I shared (and paid) for several years netflix with my cousins, but I recently moved far away from them and since my cousin is the main customer, I have no more access to the account, since it asks to change or add another household.\n\nThe whole principle about this crap was that people could share it everywhere, and now they want me to pay even more?\n\nNo way in hell, I'll either not watch or find the series elsewhere. Hell I prefer to buy them in DVD collections than give a dime for netflix again.\n\nIt almost like they want to lose customers, I hope the go backrupt after this.\n\nSorry for the vent but all I wanted after the week was relax a bit at night and I get this crap to make my evening worse.",

        "content": "Hi everyone! I can finally afford Netflix again and I\u2019m so excited! I\u2019m looking to get into a new Netflix series. I really like psychological thrillers and mysteries. So far, I have finished Money Heist, How to Get Away with Murder, and You. I loved these all. This is my type of genre. Do you have any recommendations of what I should start next based on my interests? Thanks!",
