I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

Ehm . . . okay, is that a look back to when they were alone in the boat, before it capsized (mentioned in the beginning)?  Nope, they seem to be on the island still, so it's the present.  \n\nAnd then too much psychological randomness to handle.  Pictures flashing by, views into different places without context.  All kids in a school being bombed (seemingly on the island too?).  And Yara, which I thought was Jana's late sister, wearing that shoe.  \n\nSuddenly the island is covered with water, rising and rising, and from the lighthouse a blow-up boat suddenly unfolds \u2014 which had previously been underneath the sand on the shore. \n\nThat's right after they managed to communicate their location on the radio and saw help pass by, upon which Adam thought he could swin out to the boat with a short rope for safety. \n\nWhat am I missing?  \nWhy was it so incomprehensible to me?",
