I don't think it detracted from the movie at all, maybe even made it a tad better.\n\nIt is set in feudal China, where fights were solved with swords and the gap between upper and lower class was substantial. Tons of action, tough guys, some blood, some love interest stuff, even some interesting period stuff that might possibly be made up. \n\nI guess you'd have to like these types of movies to begin with, but I suspect even MrsBadDog would be down if I were to watch it in front of her. \n\ntldr: great movie, will watch a few times.

        "title": "(DARK)I Just Started Dark and I Think I Already Figured Things Out",
        "content": "So I just started watching Dark after seeing a reel on IG that intrigued me. It mentioned characters who are both protagonists and antagonists at the same time. It showed Eren, Paul Atreides, and then I recognized the dude in the yellow raincoat, realized it was from Dark. I had been thinking of watching it for a while, but that reel pushed me to finally start. I\u2019ve been keeping away from spoilers to get the full experience, since I heard the show has a lot of twists. Right now, I\u2019m on episode 3, around the 4\u20135 minute mark, and as I was watching, I started putting a few theories together. \n\nTheory #1: \n\nEarly on, Ulrich (the cop) mentions how he lost his brother a long time ago. Then when Erik and Mikkel go missing, the police find a kid\u2019s body, but it\u2019s not either of them. His clothes look old, and he has an old Walkman, so I started thinking: \u201cWhat if that\u2019s Ulrich\u2019s brother that somehow came back?\u201d Later they say the body isn\u2019t identifiable, which kinda supports my idea, maybe he doesn\u2019t match anyone in their time period. That made me feel like I might actually be onto something. \n\nTheory #2: \n\nThen Mikkel disappears and I thought he came back, but turns out he\u2019s actually in the past. The newspaper said 1986, and he even saw his own dad as a kid. That\u2019s when I started thinking back to my Ulrich\u2019s brother theory, if Mikkel went to the past, could it be that Ulrich\u2019s brother went to the future instead? Just a thought I had. Curious if anyone else thought the same thing this early on. \n\nTheory #3: \n\nNow, because of the IG reel, I got a tiny spoiler that Jonas is both the protagonist and antagonist. That got me thinking: \u201cWhat if the antagonist is Jonas from the future?\u201d It kinda makes sense. The story revolves around time travel, so maybe future Jonas is trying to stop present Jonas from doing something, maybe mistakes that future Jonas already made himself. Like he\u2019s trying to rewrite things but ends up being the villain from his younger self\u2019s perspective. \n\nTheory #4: \n\nThis one might be a stretch, but hear me out. We know Jonas\u2019 dad (the one who killed himself) was named Michael, right? That sounds a lot like Mikkel. What if Mikkel stays in the past, grows up there, and ends up becoming Michael? That would make him Jonas' dad. It would explain why he knows so much and why his suicide is so important. Maybe it was all part of the timeline. But then I started wondering, wouldn\u2019t killing himself mess up the timeline? Or maybe that\u2019s just how it\u2019s supposed to happen? Maybe everything is already destined to happen a certain way, like the characters don\u2019t really have free will. \n\nTheory #5: \n\nI\u2019ve also been thinking about the hooded guy we keep seeing but never see his face. Could that be Michael (Jonas\u2019 dad) trying to fix the past after messing it all up? Maybe he caused the time travel stuff, saw the damage, and tried to reverse it but couldn\u2019t, so he gave up and killed himself? Or maybe the man in the hoodie is actually future Jonas, since he\u2019s supposed to be the antagonist. Or could it be that guy in the hotel?? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just ranting at this point lol. One last question, do the birds have meaning? Every time something happens, the birds die. Is that a side effect of time travel or something? Some kind of natural consequence? Just thought that was interesting. \n\nThis show is wild already and I\u2019m only a few episodes in. I love the whole time travel mystery vibe and I\u2019m tryna stay spoiler-free, but I wanted to drop my thoughts so far and see if I\u2019m on the right track or just reaching. Either way, let me know what y\u2019all think, just please no major spoilers, I\u2019m still early into it. \n\nThanks! ",

I was greeted with an ad in the beginning and then I paused it and they were nine more ad breaks. Just absolutely insane! I then see they added Hitchcock movies and same thing. I go to check out vertigo and I'm greeted with a beginning ad and then there are nine more scattered throughout the movie and they are pretty close together.\n\nThis is just pathetic! How are most people out there just putting up with all of these ads? You pay 8 bucks a month or whatever it is and still have to sit through all of these ads. I'll stick with watching on my laptop I guess. Picture quality isn't as good but at least I'm not inundated with all of these ads. \n\nI know they don't have the same programming Netflix does but sites like Tubi are 100% free and they have ads. How is it that Netflix charges us and still has ads? I'm actually very surprised It has that many ads for a movie. The only show I really watch on my TV app is Seinfeld because there aren't any ads.

        "content": "I just finished watching Sirens and I enjoyed it for the most part. There was something that really threw me off though and I was wondering if anyone else noticed it or if I have got it wrong.\n\nSo, when Simone and Devon's mum dies Simone is 7 and Devon is 12. But the show makes it out like no one was around for Simone after, but where was Devon? She didn't go straight to college at 12 years of age.. she would of been like 18 when she went to college right? (I am not from the US, so I don't know the exact age most kids go to college) Which means Simone would have been 13 when Devon left. So why was Simone the one that was neglected, and put into foster care but not Devon!?!? Unless I misheard the ages they said they were when their mum died it doesn't make sense!? Did I miss something???",

The most recent example is *Lucy*, which disappeared around January or February (at least in my country), and lo and behold, it's back \u2014 currently ranked #10 among the most popular movies locally.\n\nWhat I don't understand is, if Netflix had every intention of retaining the rights to a movie, why wouldn't they renegotiate the renewal before the contract expires? Seems silly to me.",

        "content": "&gt;!Loved the show! So much to think about! I've read the other threads on here which have made me see some things I missed and think about other things a little differently, but I still have some thoughts/questions...\n\nWas Devon actually thinking Simone should feel obligated to care for an abusive father part of Devon's trauma response? A \"misery loves company\" mentality? Devon spent her life trying to protect and support Simone. Why is she now, all of a sudden, trying to bring her down? Simone was totally justified in not wanting to do a damn thing for her dad. Did Devon feel it was more about helping her than the dad and it was finally time for Simone to start paying her back for all she did for her?\n\nJose!! I thought he was the most mysterious/interesting character! At the end, when he called Simone \"my love\" (I think that was the term)...so creepy and so telling. If anyone was  being \"cultishly\" controlled, it was him!\n\nThe girl in jail. What did she represent?\n\nI really need to watch it again knowing what I know now. I'm sure so many things will look very different!!&lt;",
