        "title": "Am I Alone in My Interpretation of Adolescence?",
        "content": "So first of all, it was an amazing Miniseries - acting, scripting, casting, filming wow!\n\nIt has been interesting to read all the different takes on the show - Some are saying it's anti-male - some are saying it's specifically targeting the red pill culture and misogyny that's rife amongst kids. Some are pointing out how toxic bullies are - heck, some people are doubting who actually stabbed Katie!\n\nBut when I watched it, I honestly thought the beauty was that it wasn't pointing any specific fingers... Or maybe pointing many fingers at many problems coexisting in kids' worlds these days.  Merely highlighting how chaotic and scary kids lives can be and how easily it can all go wrong nowadays.\n\n1. Jamie wasn't specifically red pill or incel - but he's certainly been influenced by some of those ideas - they've found their way into his language - In a similar way to how people in the 90s used to call everything bad 'gay' at highschool 'aww I don't want to go to history class, it's so gay!'  - this way of normalising certain negative beliefs you may not even personally hold, find their way into your language.  He's certainly had some negative influences however - he has also engaged in some bullying of his own making derogatory comments to some women online.  I don't think he's a specifically bad kid though - He deserves punishment, don't get me wrong, but I think we are still meant to care and have compassion for how he ended up where he ended up.\n2. Katie was clearly one of many bullies making life very hard for Jamie - People ask \"why pick on Katie rather than other males picking on him - it must be because of sexism or red pill\" - but honestly the extra pain and shame of being humiliated by a girl you have a crush on ads an extra sting that makes it 'make sense' - not in the sense that Katie is to blame obviously, but just why she might be targetted uniquely with extra resentment.  We are never specifically told what Katie did or said in full, but based on the way her best friend was reacting to police, there was some guilt involved - again, no murder was deserved, but the best friend realised they had pushed Jamie too far and felt conflicted as she's just a teenager herself and doesnt' know how to interpret what's just happened. The show was smart not to specify how exactly Katie bullied him so as not to make it look like she deserved it - The show wasn't about blaming Katie.  Katie was also horribly bullied with her private photos so she's also a victim there, who may well have 'paid it foward' by passing her bullying pain onto a new victim \"Jamie\".\n3. We are clearly shown a school with very few boundaries run by teachers who don't care and don't exert much discipline.  The kids are unruly, the cops compare it to a prison... It's like nobody is paying any attention to anyone.\n4. It's made clear just how horrific online bullying can be - and how easy it is. When the adults were younger, teasing was usually limited to a few perpetrators - but nowadays the whole school can team up and humiliate someone on IG (as they did with both Jamie and Katie) - even if it's just through random emoji reactions to other comments - the sense of shame and humiliation can be more extreme than most adults are aware of.  It got me thinking a lot about how scary that is for kids nowadays for sure.\n\nTo me - it was more a display of what a horrible jumble of circumstances kids can find themselves in - Jamie isn't all evil, he's a confused kid stuck between wanting to be nice, and being told by male and female bullies that he's an incel for being nice and only 'bad boys' win... Katie is likely a typical teenage girl with her own angst and insecurities and she wasn't bullying any more than any other girl sometimes does - but she got caught up in a confluence of events that are more common now than any other time in the past.\n\nIt showed kids with nobody paying attention to help guide them, and as a result, their worst natures come out without regulation - sort of a modern-day 'Lord Of The Flies' in many ways.\n\nWhat I didnt' see was a direct attack on boys or bullies or even red pill - the incel movement is used more as a way to tease and humiliate a boy who didnt' even 100% buy into the dogma - and the red pill ideology was just ONE of the many moving parts that caused a murder and a death to occur that never should have.\n\nAm I alone in feeling this way?",

        "content": "Example: \"Drive to survive\" has spoilers for the next episode at the end of the episodes. Well, if you already spoiled it, I guess I won't watch another episode.\n\nIt's great for shutting down binge watching, but usually I just see if HBO has something that they don't intentionally spoil available.\n\nAnd when you spoil the current episode by putting in a spoiler about what will happen \\_this- episode, I won't even watch the first one.\n\nNetflix, you're not competing with TV channels anymore, when someone starts watching an episode they already intended to see it, trying to hook people oldshool TV-style just drives them away.",
