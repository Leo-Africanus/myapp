Which is a shame because I love period pieces and thought perhaps I could stomach the more mature themes but just an hour or so in and I can tell it\u2019ll be one of those shows that romanticizes women\u2019s pain. I googled some reviews before deciding not to continue watching, and apparently it\u2019s like this the whole show so it\u2019s an absolute no from me. \n\nI\u2019m down for any better recommendations if you can spare some please and thank you\ud83d\udc97",

Mind you, you'll see no reaction shots from the audience, just some movements of silhouettes. With non stop incessant canned laughter. \n\nThe special is funny, and you start to see reaction shots from the audience a bit into the special, and you seen it's during the pandemic with social distancing and masks, but I think they took some laughter sounds from the middle and PILED it onto the top haha.- am I wrong?

        "content": "Just a random observation/thought. I'm at Ep 28 of the Chinese Drama 'The Double', right after Wencai dies. I'm gna refer to Jiang li's stepmom as Fu Ren bc i can't recall her name for some reason. But seeing the loving relationship they had, Fu Ren is a victim too in a sense, although she's still horrible. I was just thinking if Fu Ren's father wasn't that way, Wencai and Fu ren wldve lived happily ever after and have a kid of their own. The original Jiang Li wouldn't have been sent to zhenv hall, she would've still been alive and living well. Her mother wouldn't have passed either without fu ren's sabotage. Concubine Hu would still be 'sane' and an actual part of the family and her daughter would still be alive. Tong er would also be alive. So total of 8(?) lives, if we include fu ren's unborn son with Wencai, would've been saved. \n\nAnyways this was just a thought i had and wanted to share, don't take it too seriously because obviously without this, the whole plot line wouldn't have existed. Xue Fangfei probably would've ended up actually dying, her dad would as well and justice wouldn't be served. But idk, pretty sad to think about.",

However, Netflix has added a horrible AI smoothing filter to all episodes which has made them completely unbearable to watch. I've seen a few people complain about it online. How can we get rid of it? Should I start a petition and send it to Netflix? This is ridiculous and so unnecessary. Many of us like the 80s/90s graininess because it adds to the charm and nostalgia of the show. No one asked for this attempt at modernizing the look of it. I'm so frustrated about this! ",
