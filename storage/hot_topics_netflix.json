I love films that keep you guessing till the very end \u2014 with smart plots, psychological twists, or a touch of mystery. I\u2019ve already seen the big ones like Gone Girl, Prisoners, The Call, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I\u2019m hoping to discover some hidden gems or underrated thrillers that deserve more attention. I enjoy both slow-burn psychological thrillers and fast-paced crime mysteries \u2014 something gripping enough to binge in one sitting.

        "content": "Hi. So I've been seriously running through the entirety of Netflix for the last two years because it's been the perfect escapism for me especially when I find a great show. I finished all of 'This is us' while it was still on Netflix... and I've been trying to fill the gap since! I'm currently watching Nurse Jackie (loving the 7 seasons) but I need something lined up for when I finish that in a few weeks or something to watch WHILE I'm watching that so I can take a break since there's so many episodes.\n\nI have watched and loved: Ginny &amp; Georgia, Atypical, Sex Education, Great Pretender, Never Have I Ever, Beyond the Bar, Sirens, North of North, Queen's Gambit, Wednesday, The Four Seasons, Derry Girls, Dare Me (sad it didn't get picked up), Pulse, The Apothecary Diaries, Delicious in Dungeon, Toxic Town, Maid, Apple Cider Vinegar, Arcane...\n\nI could just go on for hours. Is there any sort of shows y'all can recommend to me based on what I've given here? ...that I've hopefully not watched already? I appreciate all and any input! Extra note: I've been looking for more WLW/Yuri/Lesbian media as well if you have any good recommendations! Gonna watch Soulmate on prime soon!(For K-dramas I've watched Beyond the Bar, Attorney Woo, The Glory, Death's Game, Be Melodramatic and Age of Youth/Hello my Twenties. Those are all of my favorites! Trigger was okay \u263a\ufe0f )\n\nEdit: I'm gonna try and binge Stranger Things as well. Haven't watched it yet if you can believe that \ud83e\udd23",

I don\u2019t know where that rate came from, Netflix had it as an option. \n\nSuddenly my billing said it was paused and I had to update payment,  but Netflix blocked every option I had to update the payment method. I opened the account in the U.S. in 2010 and they changed my billing and phone number to Venezuela and said the account was opened in Venezuela a year ago. Their customer service just keeps pushing for me to close the account and open a new one under the new rates. When I try to update the billing, they changed my U.S. phone number to a Venezuela phone area code and it doesn\u2019t let me change it or verify the new billing method.\n\nI have email proof that the account was opened in the U.S. in 2010. Netflix claims they only keep billing records for a year so they have no record of it. At first I thought I might have been hacked but their customer service is so intent on me ending the account. \n\nTheir customer service actually said,\u201d and just to let you know if your account was created in United States you should be paying us $17.99 not $5.99.\u201d\n\nSeems like I have no recourse and it\u2019s a dirty way they\u2019re getting longtime customers to end their grandfathered rate accounts.",

The premise of it was that they would show what was a seemingly random murder at the start of episode 1 and then the rest of the season would be about everything that led up to that point. I swear it was a multiple season thing with different stories and characters each time, or maybe it was like different shows all kind of linked by a premise. The season I remember most vividly, the initial murder happened on the beach of a lake, and the story behind why the woman did it was because her sickly sister wanted to come out and party with her and they ended up taking ecstasy or something and because of her condition she went into cardiac arrest and the guy who was murdered at the start tried to perform cpr and ended up caving her chest in and killing her. I thought it was called Monsters or something but that seems to be a true crime thing. That\u2019s about all I remember though pls help thank you v much everyone",

        "title": "Unpopular opinion: Boots does not need a second season",
        "content": "All of their comments on socials are people asking for a second season, and the actors have been vocal about wanting one as well. But as much as I loved all of the characters and wouldn\u2019t be mad at seeing more things explored, I also feel like the show is already a complete story. Netflix has a tendency of milking things at the expense of quality, and I think we need to normalize leaving shows at one season and not dragging out projects just because we can. \n\nAs someone who was in the military, there\u2019s something really special about boot camp and I think that specific setting was very vital to the storyline. You\u2019re thrown into this new world, cross paths with all of these incredible people and DIs that completely change your life, and then you never see them again. Everyone gets separated for job training and then different assignments all over the world and moves on with their careers and lives. But there\u2019s something so special about it while you\u2019re there and it\u2019s a memory you look back on forever. I think the show does an amazing job at capturing that, and it\u2019s a complete story to me. \n\nIt would be really hard to keep the same characters when everybody would be in a different place. They would either need to find a new cast of people for wherever Cope ends up stationed or pan back and forth between all the current characters and their storylines. The GW storyline wouldn\u2019t really work because they have job training and wouldn\u2019t just get deployed straight to the conflict. \n\nSullivan ended up being dishonorably discharged (something he\u2019s not getting around) so although he was a great character it would be hard to make him work in the story when he\u2019s no longer a Marine. A lot of people didn\u2019t like his ending but I think it was a really good depiction of someone living through the DADT era, and how it can eat you alive. He suppressed himself to that extent and it ended up not even being worth it, because the anger from all that suppression caused him to get kicked out anyway. It\u2019s a complete arc, showing how damaging (and pretty ridiculous) these policies were and how they even caused the military to lose out on great soldiers. Perfect, model Marine with a silver star but ultimately gets kicked out just because he\u2019s gay.\n\nI know the memoir this is based on covers many more years of Cope\u2019s career beyond boot camp, so they could make it work if they wanted to. But I feel like it isn\u2019t necessary and don\u2019t really see it working without a significant dip in quality. There\u2019s nothing worse than amazing shows being cheapened by weaker and weaker follow up seasons. Reminds me of Squid Game which had no business having a second and third season, the director himself said it was only because he needed money lol.",

        "content": "Just started watching *Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy* by accident. I was watching *The Gacy Tapes* on Netflix, then googled it and found out Peacock made a whole series. I was curious if Monster would ever do Gacy, but another platform just created it. It is a good watch if you like Monster series and have seen the Gacy tapes as well. \n\nWow \u2014 Netflix really has to step up its game now.\n\nI\u2019d say *Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy* is just as good as *Dahmer: Monster* Season 1. Seasons 2 and 3 of *Monster* are okay, but now Netflix has real competition \u2014 everyone\u2019s jumping into the true crime series game.",

        "content": "I don't want to say too much about it, because I know it just came out for streaming and people are going to be watching it. But I just watched *A House of Dynamite* and I'm both so frustrated and beyond disappointed, at the same time.\n\nThe trailer for this movie had me super hyped. I've been looking forward to watching this movie all week. While the movie underperformed, in my opinion, it wasn't actually terrible; just kind of a let down from what I expected out of the trailer. But still not awful...at least not until that \"ending\". That was just so anticlimactic and bad. I don't know for sure what I was expecting instead, but that wasn't it.\n\nWhat is it with Netflix and these cliffhangers? So many quality films have felt ruined by poor endings: *How It Ends*, *Fractured*, *Leave the World Behind* and now *A House of Dynamite*, just to name a few.\n\nWhy does Netflix keep doing this?",

        "content": "For context my family splits who pays for which streaming service but as the password crackdowns continue that becomes less true. If you take into account that streaming has ads now Im not sure it is any different than cable. Sure streaming services have original content but I\u2019m hard pressed to say original content is even worth it anymore. People are afraid to admit Netflix original content is cheeks. Apple original content is the only streaming service I\u2019d stand on business for. HBO is $10/mo with cable vs $20/mo as a standalone.\n\nI\u2019m not switching to cable but at what point does the streaming pig get slaughtered? ",
