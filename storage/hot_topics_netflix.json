This documentary is so extremely devastating, a bunch of piss poor excuses working as government servants. The only one with integrity and honor being General Honor\u00e9. Its always better to be safe then sorry, mandatory evacuation of ppl in below sea level neighborhoods should've been 1st and not even second guessed. The corrupt Major Nagin, awful Governor Blanco, incompetent FEMA Director Brown, horrendous President Bush just ugh I want to vomit and I wonder if how tragically they screwed this up lives in their heads to this day....

        "content": "I love My Life With the Walter Boys so much!! The whole cast seems so lovely and like a genuine family. But I have a few issues with season 2\u2026\n\nFor me, the actress who plays Jackie can not act at all. Her character did not land. A lot of the scenes of hers felt stiff, flat, disengaged and unnatural. Take the final scene for example when the ambulance comes, her reaction just didn\u2019t feel natural. It felt laboured and half hearted and I noticed it enough that it effected my overall feeling \n\nBy comparison the actor who plays Cole I thought was fantastic this season. I loved the delivery of that portrayal of the actor, really shined, especially this season. He did such a beautiful, seamless transition that  made him more likeable, vulnerable and understandable. It\u2019s such a lovely light hearted family show that reflects the beauty and complexities of family subtly, and his character adds depth and rawness, which is really refreshing. He\u2019s doing a great job\n\nThe love triangle though\u2026.is driving me crazyyyy. I honestly feel like it\u2019s so obvious that Cole and Jackie are meant to be together. Their chemistry feels so natural, and they bring out the best in each other, it\u2019s real relationship energy and intimacy where they feel like an in love couple with an unsaid understanding \n\nI really don\u2019t enjoy Jackie and Alex as a couple. At all. It\u2019s frustrating that season 2 ended on basically the same cliffhanger as season 1\u2026 but at least there\u2019s clear growth with Cole this time around. His character feels more grounded and less arrogant, which I loved seeing\n\nI  want Jackie to finally settle down instead of bouncing between the brothers. Alex might be the \u201cgood boy\u201d type, but it\u2019s obvious Jackie\u2019s heart is with Cole. That\u2019s the relationship I want to see play out in season 3\n\nIt\u2019s a great show and I adore the family essence of it but I have issue with season 2 not being much growth in the story and the actress who plays Jackie not being really present in her delivery. For me it was Cole\u2019s character who really shined this season but I\u2019m hoping everything steps up for everyone in season 3\n\nWhat does everyone else think?? ",

The way the documentary lays out the Cambridge Analytica scandal feels like a thriller more than a history lesson. They follow people who were directly involved  journalists, former employees, even people who had their data pulled into the whole thing  and it shows how personal information became a weapon during elections.\n\nThe film does a really good job of making you see data as more than just numbers on a screen. They literally call it the most valuable resource in the world now, even more than oil, and watching how easily it was collected and sold was pretty disturbing.\n\nI think the scariest part was how much of it happened quietly. Most people had no idea their Facebook likes or quiz answers were being used to build psychological profiles on them. By the time they realized it, the damage had already been done.  It made me think about how much info we all give away without even noticing and it makes you a little sacred or at least made me a little scared. \n\n  \nWhat did you people think, did you like the premise? And also what are some movies like it that I can watch to feed my paranoia lol",

        "content": "Kendra brings up the trauma from her past. And I wouldn\u2019t say she uses it as justification for what she\u2019s done, but more to explain what her mind set was. And she specifically says something along the lines of her daughter starting to get older, and her own fears of what happened to her as a teenager happening to her daughter. So in her sick mind, this was her way of protecting her. At least thats the point I think she was trying to make, regardless of how deluded it might be. \n\nOkay, fine\u2026.thats where your head was at. \n\nSo\u2026why did you message Owen\u2019s new girlfriend\u2019s mother? Were you trying to \u2018protect\u2019 her too? \n\nThe fact that the producers at no point thought it necessary to focus on that aspect and force her to confront it is where this whole thing falls apart for me. \n\nAnd for the record, she didn\u2019t do NEARLY enough time. \n\nEdit - Unknown Number (can\u2019t change the title) ",

        "content": "The strangest part for me was when the police go to Kendra\u2019s house and say they\u2019ve tracked the IP address back to this house. When the police call Lauryn inside the house and tells her what\u2019s been going on she doesn\u2019t really seem shocked. She doesn\u2019t confront her mom at all. She doesn\u2019t say anything! \n\nThen the dad is told to come over by the police, outside the police explains what has happened and that Kendra has also lied about having a job.\n\nWhen the dad goes inside he\u2019s only bothered about when Kendra was laid off her job, he doesn\u2019t mention anything at all about the fact Lauryn\u2019s mom has been aggressively cyber bullying their daughter for over a year! \n\nI don\u2019t know it\u2019s just strange none of them seem remotely surprised about the cyber bullying.\n",
