And movies like Trainwreck, while not great, still have had some merit. But my GOD -- Kinda Pregnant, which debuted today on Netflix, is fully unwatchable -- it's like a Z-grade Adam Sandler movie (and funnily enough, Adam Sandler's nephew, Tyler Spindel, directs this atrocity!), with a \"wild and wacky\" plot that is completely over the top and characters who are not in any way recognizably human. And Schumer actually co-wrote the script, so she can't blame this on bad writing. It is ATROCIOUS. Watched about 30 minutes and flipped it off, both literally and figuratively. Schumer really seems to be in a very bad place if this garbage is any indication.",

The writing had its moments where it felt a little off, so l get the criticism. But what really threw me off this season was the wardrobe and styling.\nUsually, I don't even notice this kind of thing, but it was so bland that it actually stood out. The outfits gave stock photo and had zero personality. It's even more wild because the actor who plays Rose is so gorgeous outside of the show that I didn't recognize her in an interview she recently did. Don't get me wrong she's still pretty in the show, but why would the stylists make these choices? I saw some real-life photos of her, and she looks even better outside of the show, which just made me wonder why they went with such a dull look for her character.\nLast season, the styling felt a lot more natural, but this time around, it just felt like they were covering her up if that makes sense? It didn't feel purposeful. Did anyone else notice this, or am I overthinking it?",
