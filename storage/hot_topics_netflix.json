I\u2019m not even gonna mention the whole first couple of episodes of him being a basketball coach protecting a kid from an abduction. They sooooo loosely tied it in with the main story that they might as well of labeled it as the \u201cPeter is a great guy, remember?\u201d Prologue. \n\nThe story is generally boring. They made Rose sadly annoying and inexplicably demanding and entitled. It got so stupid and lost that the head of the program was forced to say, in literal dialogue \u201cNight Agent missions often hit deadends\u201d as if accidentally being caught on a hot mic trying to explain away why there are so many dumb unnecessary twists. \n\nWatch season one and pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

The massacre scene was awesome and terrifying. I loved the dialogue. Some of the performances were really excellent, particularly Captain Edmund, Bridger, and Virgil characters I thought were really strong. The conflict between the Mormons, US Govt, Native tribes, and the townsfolk was really interesting and imo should\u2019ve been the focal point of the show. \n\nThe main story following Isaac, Sarah, and the kids was very weak. Their decisions constantly did not make sense. Isaac would\u2019ve got on his horse and said \u201csee ya\u201d the very first time the mom almost got them killed, and certainly 3 or 4 times later. Sarah would not have acted so defiant to Isaac\u2019s instructions, especially considering he is a professional outlaw and she established immediately that she is scared and out of her depth in the wild west. The only strong acting out of that group imo was the boy. Other than that the writing on their whole plot line was messy. When they shoehorned in the love story in the 11th hour I actually rolled my eyes lol. \n\nAll in all it was a good watch that I don\u2019t regret. Just a shame as it was so close to being great. ",

It\u2019s an outstanding story that deserves the Pulitzer Prize it was awarded. I learned that Netflix made a 4 episode mini series and couldn\u2019t want to watch it. So I actually subbed for a month JUST to watch this. \n\nVery early into episode 1 and I was already saying \u201cuh oh\u201d. It\u2019s got some pretty cheesy acting. The actress that plays Marie looks nothing like how she\u2019s described in the book. Nobody has an accent that makes sense. I know people say Mark Ruffalo had the worse accent, but ignoring that I thought he actually played the role decently well. All of that is stuff I can ignore, though. \n\nThe real issue is half the story didn\u2019t end up in the show. Like minimum half the story. Probably more is missing in reality. And with it, half the characters are gone, too. The story that did manage to make it into the show had nearly every aspect of it changed. I can\u2019t think of anything original from the book that made its way into the show. Characters who never met in the book have screen time together. Who lives and dies is changed. Characters who don\u2019t kill anybody are suddenly gunning people down. The ending is changed. I mean it\u2019s seriously almost an entirely different story. Which is frustrating when you know the amazing story that this was sourced from. \n\nHad I never read the book, I\u2019d probably have watched it and thought \u201cmeh\u201d. But knowing what they did to butcher this, I have to call it a complete failure. It doesn\u2019t manage to capture anything about the original story it\u2019s supposed to represent. \n",
