        "title": "Stranger things finale, big moments and big questions. I can't stop thinking about what WASN'T in the finale.",
        "content": "This is far longer than expected. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the finale, have to say Jamie as Henry/Vecna stood out, he absolutely killed it. There were a lot of amazing moments, but I can't shake the feeling that a lot was missing, it even felt rushed in some places and I'm left with a lot of questions.\n\nWe saw zero demogorgons, demodogs or demobats in the finale, weird from a show that started with the demogorgon. \n\nWe didn't see the \"army\" Vecna showed Nancy in Season 4 and she talked about. I remember her speech: \"Vecna showed me so many terrible things. This giant creature with a gaping mouth, and this creature wasn't alone, there was so many monsters. An army, and they were coming into Hawkins. Into our homes.\" \n\nVecna had no defence, yet he knew Eleven and the gang would be coming, he even saw into her mind, he knew all their plans.\n\nThe military did nothing to the gang and just let them go after the crimes they committed, murdering their soldiers etc? They even let Hopper who had a fight with Dr. Kay become chief of police again?\n\nVecna was impaled and decapitated, the mind flayer was shot and burned yet Will felt nothing when he was right there? What happened to the hive mind? Not long before the big fight we see him reacting to when Henry felt pain from his memory of being shot in the cave as a kid. I thought he would have been seriously hurt or even killed being right near the hive mind when they were attacking the mind flayer and Vecna.\n\nVecna and the mind flayer were these otherwordly eldritch horrors with god-like powers and they were defeated so easily with not much loss for the gang.\n\nThis part is a bit too sci-fi for me and I love this sort of stuff, I'm just not smart enough to understand it, but: The whole blowing up the wormhole at the lab with the C4 at the dark matter seemed off. It completely wipes out all of the upside down, and probably the other dimension, but leaves Hawkins at the gate completely fine where we see \"Eleven\" standing to be killed? Would it not have also wiped out Hawkins, or at least done some damage?\n\nI understand the idea behind the Eleven ending, it was a smart idea in theory, but I don't think they pulled it off too well. Maybe I missed something, but she was right next to Mike in the truck right as they exit the gate, all of the El-Jammers were pointed at her and normally she's crippled and can't do anything but she manages to then escape the truck and get to the gate. Maybe it was an illusion like Mike later says, but she wasn't at the truck part from what I can see, and then how did Mike know about Kali? He never met her. He never witnessed what happened to her.\n\nThere was an 18 month time skip before Mike plays D&amp;D with the gang and tells them about El? Why do Hopper and Joyce not get told anything?\n\nFinally, where is Suzie? I thought Dustin and Suzie were together, we didn't see her at all. Also Vickie? Wasn't Robin going to take Vickie out?\n\nHonestly, not trying to hate on the finale, I love Stranger Things, but as mentioned I was left with a lot of questions. I'm interested in how others interpreted all this or if anyone can explain any of it.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \nI enjoyed the finale, but it felt rushed and oddly incomplete. Key things set up earlier never paid off (no demogorgons/monster army, no real Vecna defence, hive mind inconsistencies with Will). Vecna and the Mind Flayer felt underpowered for supposedly god-like threats. The military\u2019s response made no sense, the wormhole/C4 resolution felt inconsistent, and the Eleven ending was confusing (illusion logic, Kali reference, escape). Several characters/subplots (Suzie, Vickie, Hopper/Joyce learning about El) were just dropped. I love Stranger Things, but the finale left me with more questions than answers and I\u2019m curious how others interpreted it.\n\n",

She definitely wasn't on Vecna and El's level on power but her powers were beyond them, Kali the reality manipulator. She has my respect and she is definitely my fav s5 character.\n\n",

        "content": "**1. Vecna and the Mind Flayer were defeated way too easily. The kids and the military had a more difficult time with a pack of demogorgons and demo dogs than the 2 main bad guys.**\n\nSpeaking of demogorgons and demo dogs... where were they? My 9 year old son asked me where they were during the fight and I was like... oh yeah... what the hell? If he could figure it out right away why didn't the Duffers?\n\nDid they run out of budget or something? They could've had the rest of the gang fighting them while El and Vecna did their thing.\n\n**2. The focus on S5 in general was too much on new characters or characters that weren't important. We want to see the main gang.**\n\nEl, Mike, Will, Lucas, Dustin, Max, Jonathan, Nancy, Steve, Robin, Joyce and Hop and even Erica.\n\nThese characters should've gotten the most screen time. It was a travesty that a lot of it went to Holly... someone who was inconsequential for the entire previous 4 seasons became one of the most important characters.\n\n**3. The Duffer brothers chose an ending that wasn't satisfying for me personally. I wish Jonathan and Nancy got together. I wish El and Mike got together. El's ending was not only unsatisfying but just lame overall. The only real good relationships throughout the entire show were Max and Lucas followed by Joyce and Hop.**\n\nI don't know if MBB did something to piss off the Duffers but her ending was so underwhelming for not only how magical she was but how magical the entire show was in S1.\n\nThe scene on the rooftop with Jonathan, Nancy, Robin and Steve was just cringe. Why are these people in their early 20's acting like they're in their 30s?\n\nMy boy Steve deserved a better ending than just naming some random chick who didn't even show up on camera that he was going to be with.\n\n**4. The elephant in the room is Will's whole coming out thing. S5 E7 focused way too much on his sexuality for some reason?**\n\nWhy the hell was it relevant? Oh because Vecna was gonna use it against him... blah blah blah. Oh please. It was on par for a Netflix show to somehow insert this subject matter out of nowhere. It was wholesome if it wasn't Stranger Things but it didn't fit a show about kids defeating a space wizard and his spider overlord boss. Like come on. Also, it's hilarious how anyone who thought this was weird automatically gets labeled as a \"phobe\" of some sort. People aren't allowed to speak up even when something is just so out of place these days.\n\n**5. Did you guys notice how much sitting around and talking there was going on this season? Literally just people standing around yapping.**\n\nA great example was when Max decided to blab on non stop to Holly when she saw the portal away from her own body.\n\nSeriously, go watch the other seasons. The dialogue to actually doing something ratio was vastly different than S5 where every other scene is someone doing a speech about something.\n\n**6. This is a hot take but why did they make Robin absolutely insufferable?**\n\nEvery time she was on screen explaining something or trying to be whimsical it just became so tiring very quickly. Every time she began to blab at a million miles an hour about something I just looked away and focused on something else.\n\n**7. Kali.**\n\nUseless and lame character from the first to the last episode she was in.",

The songs they used were all bangers and there were surprisingly many of them when there was so few in the middle episodes. Overall one of the best episodes of Stranger Things and a GOOD ending, just what we wanted, not like so many other popular shows that decide to make it a bittersweet / bad ending that ultimately falls flat.  \n\nAlso, major bonus points for Joyce's arc this season. Winona Ryder and David Harbour completely knocked it out of the park.  \n\nA 10/10 episode and finale in an otherwise uneven season. \ud83d\udc4d",

        "title": "Pervasive \"Next episode\" popup help?",
        "content": "Can someone pretty please tell me about this popup? Unfortunately images are not allowed, so I will do my best to describe it. \n\nIt's large. It appears in the bottom right 1/9th of the screen. It's SUPPOSED to appear if you mouse over the \u23ed\ufe0f \"next\" button. The text at the top reads \"Next episode\" and it contains a thumbnail of the next episode and a short block of text describing the next episode's events.  \n  \nThis gloriously unhelpful popup is always active. It appears instantly when I start the application, and can *sometimes* close, if I mouse over it for a while. However, it always returns on its own after about 4 or 5 minutes without my even touching the mouse and it takes up a disruptive portion of the screen and sometimes covers subtitles which affects my ability to use the service.\n\nI am using the browser version, and the browser I use is Firefox, updated this morning. I have turned off \"Autoplay next\" in settings, which mysteriously worked for a while, and then just as mysteriously, stopped working the next time I used the application. \n\nThank you to anyone in advance!",

        "content": "Prior to Ozark, Breaking Bad was my all-time favorite show (yeah there are definite thematic similarities). The suspense, pacing, and stylistic elements of this show were amazing, perhaps only outdone by the production and the acting.  I've never watched an entire run of any show until Ozark (for context I did wait a couple of years before I watched it again).  Seriously, watch this show.  It's a gem.  ",
