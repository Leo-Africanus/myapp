I liked the setting, the overhead shots of the area, the action was pretty good, son was a realistic character imo, I liked seeing Holt McCallany back in action and the plot was basic in ways but easy to follow and fun to watch. It\u2019s not ozark but it\u2019s only 1 season compared to like 5. I would give it a 7-8 out of 10. Topher grace\u2019s character was pretty fun as well, he\u2019s a good actor. All in all, a pretty fun watch. ",

I've tried restarting the browser, reloading the website, signing out and back in, switching to Microsoft Edge, and none of this has solved this issue. I've only started experiencing this issue within the last two months and it only happens with some movies while other movies will show the full 1080p. I'm also sure it's 480p because I checked using the Ctrl + Alt + Shift + D shortcut to see more information. I'm also quite certain it's not my internet as my download speed ranges anywhere from 30mbps to 120mbps. Has anyone else experienced this and/or know how to fix it?",
