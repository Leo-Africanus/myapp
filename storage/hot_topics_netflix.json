        "content": "TW: spoilers\n\nI found this show couple days ago and watched almost all of it in one sitting, just finished the second half of the last episode rn and need to pour out my thoughts somewhere. The 70s arc of the main character was the best to watch, even though it was the most emotionally charging part, ngl at some point i was watching it only for her human scenes, because of the vibe (and because i could rest from the uncanny valley).\nThe only part i don't like in it is her son shooting his bullies and never getting caught, it's naive for me.\n\nStill, I'm pissed about the plotholes, like why the house stayed empty for such a long time with a robot inside and the decomposed body in one room, why their rentor haven't checked it first? Where are the squatters? Like an ABANDONED INTELLIGENT HOUSE FROM THE 70s WITH A TRAGEDY ATTACHED TO IT, it sounds like an urbexers wet dream, so again, you want me to believe, that in 50 years nobody got inside? \nAnd better, that nobody found the deceased child in the room OR the robot herself and if someone found them, they didn't go to police with it?\n\nAlso Samira's husband is written so insufferably, he gets more clueless and abusive with every episode, from consequently gaslighting her wife, through sending her to psych ward, cause she's scared of the old, uncanny valley robot, that tried to harm her 3 times previosly, to trying to kill her, because Cassandra said so\ud83e\udd23. I don't think he was meant to be so stupid as a character, he just turned out like that. Juno is weirdly infantilized, like she was playing kindergarten games with Emily, aren't they 9 years old? WHY she didn't drop out of school?? And WHY IN THE LAST EPISODE BOTH OF THE PARENTS WERE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT AND DIDN'T INFORM THE POLICE? LIKE AAAHAGAHSHXHHSKAUSH\n\nBut while watching all of it and being absolutely enchanted with her 70s plotline i started to think, that Cassandra's story would work better as an analog horror series, than as a netflix show.\nGood analog horrors are a rarity rn, i think that after Gemini Home Entertainment and The Walten Files everyone keeps copying. It saddens me, that the idea for her story was already used by netflix, cause it has so much potential for this different form.",

Or is there really nothing to watch on netflix?\n\nAnd its now always pushing for me to rewatch everything I've already watched, like just minutes after I've finished something it's the big main full screen suggestion. What's that about? Where's all the good stuff? Is there a way to game the algorithm so I can see the stuff it's not showing me?

I have watched alot of teen and young adult series on netflix and I realize that most persons look like they are models and they are always well groomed.\nIs this typical of high schoolers and college students in the US? Or is it because these shows are centered around rich areas so the characters are reflective of that? Or is it because they choose the best looking persons to cast and these persons fresh up before filming? The females are always hot and the males look like they go to the gym. \nWhereas from what I have seen in real life, most people are average looking. So is this a rich neighbourhood thing or what with these series. Please answer and be respectful. If this is not the place to have a discussion about this, let me know.",

        "content": "Why aren\u2019t all old school Raw episodes on Netflix, they are skipping episodes and all episodes from each year are not there. They literally went from 1993-2001 with not a whole lot of episodes, they skipped a big portion of years in 2002-2021 like when are they going to update and put more. With the WWE Network we got all of it and this is why I miss the Network even more it was easy to access them. Hopefully Netflix gets on the ball and adds more episodes from each year since Peacock got rid of them.",
