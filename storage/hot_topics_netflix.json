        "content": "I\u2019ve always been a big\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0fan, so when Netflix announced the\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0series, I was super excited. I didn\u2019t expect it to be exactly like the old\u00a0Addams Family. I knew it would have its own twist, but it just feels\u00a0off.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t like the acting. It looks weird and unnatural, not in the charming, spooky\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0way, but in a \u201cthis doesn\u2019t feel believable\u201d way. The makeup doesn\u2019t look good either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere, it makes the characters look kind of awkward.\n\nThe plot also feels too childish, like it\u2019s trying to be edgy but still ends up being a teen drama without much depth. The detective/thriller angle is actually a good idea in theory, but the execution feels\u2026 meh.\n\nIt\u2019s below the quality I usually expect from Netflix\u2019s big series, and it\u2019s disappointing because it\u00a0could\u00a0have been amazing.\n\nIs it just me? Or did anyone else go in with high hopes and come out feeling\u2026 meh?",

The plot seems to have picked up in pace compared to season 1, and there\u2019s a lot more tension and drama building up between the characters. I\u2019ve noticed that the writing feels sharper, and some of the storylines are finally starting to pay off after being set up earlier in the series. The new characters they introduced have also brought fresh energy and unexpected twists, which keep things exciting. Of course, there are still a few moments where the pacing slows down, but overall, it feels like the show is heading in a strong direction. I\u2019m curious to hear whether you think the changes have improved the series or if you prefer the way season 1 unfolded.\n",

But it happened the way it did, so all the time spent planning the robbery ended up going to waste, I guess.\n\nAt the end, Leonardo Notarbartolo still insists that he wasn\u2019t the mastermind of the crime, but just one of the gang. What\u2019s your opinion on this? Was he really just following the gang\u2019s lead, or was he actually the one in charge? I still believe he\u2019s a genius for hiding the fact that he was the mastermind. \n\nWhat happened to Agim, the police officer, in 2015, when he was found in possession of illicit diamonds is truly devastating. I believe he fell in with the wrong crowd and got caught red-handed. I hope he\u2019s living a better life now.\n",

        "content": "I know that some time in the past Netflix decided to block PiP on iPhones for those with the ads included version.  Has anyone found a way around this?  I usually watch while doing other things on my phone, so this obviously creates an issue for me.\n\nI get Netflix with ads for free with my cell phone contract, so I don\u2019t want to upgrade if it can be avoided.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "I pay for Netflix for myself and my dad, who lives at a separate location, I am paying the fee for a second location, but every time I try to watch Netflix I have to say I\u2019m the primary household, and then my dad has to do the same thing when he wants to watch. Essentially kicking the other person out. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind so much if I didn\u2019t have to log in on my back up email account every time either of us try to watch something to confirm it\u2019s actually my account. \n\nDoes anyone know what I am doing wrong? I know it\u2019s something but I am annoyed I\u2019m paying for the extra location and it\u2019s essentially wasted money. ",
