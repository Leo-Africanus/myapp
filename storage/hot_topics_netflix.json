Shutter Island is powerful on the first watch, but once the twist is revealed, a lot of its impact fades. The film leans heavily on atmosphere and shock.\n\nPrestige, on the other hand, is built for rewatching. Every scene matters. The structure itself is part of the illusion, and the   themes-obsession, sacrifice, rivalry, and identity run far deeper than just a single twist. It doesn\u2019t just surprise you; it plays with you.\n\nShutter Island tells you its truth at the end. Prestige hides it in plain sight from the very beginning. That\u2019s the difference. One is a great experience once; the other is a masterclass that gets better every time you revisit it.",

It only seems to occur on original Power Rangers.  It is actually quite nauseating.  I don't get travel sick, but I feel that this would be the feeling...\n\nIt only happens on the panning movements. It looks like the screen is only able to update at a really low refresh rate.\n\nI have been wondering if it is part of the cheap recording at the time or very poor digital conversion.  I originally thought it wasn't happening on the sentai stuff, but it actually is,  just less obvious. \n\nThe TV isn't the issue.  I see the same thing on my PC.  Not as obvious on the phone though.\n\n\nHas anyone else seen this?",

I\u2019ve made it. And you can tell I\u2019ve made it because I talk really slow now, pause a lot, smoke a cigarette on stage, and let the crowd applaud my existence. There were way more stories than jokes. Not sharp stories that build to something clever, just rambling anecdotes that relied on the audience already being on his side. It felt less like he was trying to make people laugh and more like he knew people would cheer no matter what he said. And they did. This felt safe, comfortable and almost lazy. Like he knows the brand is bulletproof, so why bother tightening the material? I get that he\u2019s earned the right to do whatever he wants. He\u2019s one of the greatest to ever do it.

Do you think money for a show even if it was for free speech and lots of money in Saudi Arabia he was selling out? Or maybe taking up a great opportunity to profit from being a comedian. I know he\u2019s just doing typical bits for comedy (they bring in politics because of relevancy) but he\u2019s always spoken the truth about that stuff. So curious what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds Dave is a killer on the mic and definitely murdered it with the 2025 surprise special.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\n  \nThis post is mostly a rant about Netflix and the way they handle stuff with many of their shows. I came to realize Netflix has an absurd strategy to keep customers locked in releasing new series/shows at a steady pace but for the majority, series are almost never finished unless they are really classics or series they have acquired. I am really annoyed but the number of times I locked into one of the series and then have to realize there will not be any ending of the show. It came to the point where I even start to lookup whether or not there is going to be a final season before investing the time to check it out. \n\n  \nSeries which have left a bitter taste to me personally since there is no \"what's next\":\n\n* Marco Polo\n* Away\n* 1899\n* Snowpiercer\n* Barbarians\n* Pulse\n* The recruit\n* Boots\n* Lost in space (it has an ending but there was more imo)\n* ..\n\nI know this post is not going to make any difference and I understand more than anybody else the business, it is money first, customers second but damn me, damn me for watching unfinished series. Especially the science fiction seems to be affected by this problem quite a lot. (or maybe that is because I watch too many of those)\n\nI just hope I am not the only one who has this feeling and who has been disappointed more than once in the past years?",
