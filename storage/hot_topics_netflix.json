        "content": "\nOne common point of contention among both critics and viewers of the new season of Wednesday is Netflix's decision to split the release into two parts. As the first four episodes set up a satisfying new mystery, many feel the mid-season cutoff is abrupt and disrupts the show's momentum, leaving viewers with an \"unsatisfying appetizer\" rather than a complete meal. \n\n\"Fans will have to wait until Wednesday, Sept. 3, for Wednesday Season 2, Part 2 \u2013 which will conclude with episodes five through eight.\"\n\nWith so many taking it to the Internet streets; Is the uproar warranted? Or are we just spoiled brats moonlighting as binge divas?",

A boy that just became an adventurer and a group of monsters (a bunny girl, a goblin and a slime I think, maybe more)\n\nThere\u2019s then the evil/dark Lord who is actually just a good guy who became sympathetic to monsters, he looked like a very cartoony much and had a sea creature wife.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all I remember from it.

This confuses me: how can the algorithm have changed completely in just half a day?\n\nAnyways, I logged into the account, changed the password, logged off from all devices. I enabled PIN verification for all profiles and verified email and phone number. What more can I do to ensure that these people can no longer access our account?

Can anyone remember what this show was, I have added some facts I recall below - beware some may be spoilers but I can\u2019t remember all details:\n\nDaughter/model sent to live with aunt in Australia after ruining a designers outfit.\n\nThere\u2019s a girl called Coco and I think the uncle had recently died? Aunt and uncle were a surfing family - he had a shed to make surf boards in.\n\nI think there was a character Tom?\n\nDaughter makes friends, offends friends, then makes a fashion show of swim suits through the decades for an annual celebration on the beach.\n\n",
