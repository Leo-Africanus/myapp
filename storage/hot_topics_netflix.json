I love that (it seems at least) she has not done any fillers, botox, or other procedures. I love that she can be fully expressive, she can fully emote, and be comfortable as a woman who is growing and aging. No shade to actresses who do get cosmetic work, the pressure to look young and beautiful all the time must be immense. I was wondering if you noticed how expressive she is as Aggie Wiggs, and if you too felt it refreshing to see a woman in all of her glory take space with her aging face in this show.",

I love a show that has me yelling at my TV. I would like to take this opportunity to list a few of the people in this show who pissed me off.\n\n1. Abbott - Why would you approach someone who you know is a pysopath and serial killer pretty much, all alone, with one weapon? I knew as soon as he followed him he was gonna die, smh. It was so upsetting.\n\n2. Marvin - I completely understand him wanting to help his son and being in denial about how sick he really was, but he was constantly having to clean up Nile's messes. His legacy was also constantly at risk because of Nile's recklessness, but he just kept helping him over and over again. I know that's his son, but I would have called the police on him asap.\n\n3. Shelley - Was anyone else annoyed by Shelley? Why would you be mad at your ex wife for not being able to forgive the man who was driving drunk and caused a crash that killed your child?? And then to blame Aggie for his suicide to her face when she came to you telling you that she thinks Teddy was murdered. Obviously Aggie wasn't 100% in the right for doing things like throwing the brick through his window, but I can understand her anger. Also, having to see him constantly, knowing that he was never punished must have been hell. It's like they all made her out to be the crazy one for being angry.\n\nNile - Obviously he pissed me off cuz his impulse control was dog shit, and he was a terrible person all around, but he made a really good villain. I think a good villain makes the best stories.\n\nHow did ya'll feel?",

I fought it a few times, eventually it worked for a few hours, then cut out. Now, my main monitor connected directly through hdmi struggles to be recognized. It's glitchy just like how it was when I was trying to watch netflix except, I'm not trying to watch netflix. I'm just trying to use my monitor.\n\nA post I just posted was removed immediately and as I'm trying to post once more, my monitor is connecting and disconnecting making my screens act bananas, like they're trying to gaslight me into not posting.
