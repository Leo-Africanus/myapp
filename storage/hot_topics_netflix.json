        "title": "Bullet Train Explosion",
        "content": "Bullet Train Explosion is both a modern remake and a follow-up to the 1975 Japanese film The Bullet Train, which also inspired the Hollywood thriller Speed. The story brings back the high-stakes idea of a vehicle that can\u2019t slow down without risking an explosion. This time, it\u2019s the Hayabusa 60 Shinkansen\u2014a sleek, high-speed train racing toward Tokyo. A ransom must be paid before the train reaches its destination, or the result won\u2019t just be the death of those onboard\u2014it could mean disaster for millions in the city.\n\nWe meet the characters, understand the stakes, and in many ways follow the now-established beats\u2014like the government refusing to negotiate with terrorists and efforts to discreetly evacuate passengers. Much of the first half plays out confidently and effectively. The bullet train setting is a treat on its own (as someone who recently traveled to Japan, seeing those stations in the film gave me mild PTSD). But what sets this version apart is that the bomber reveal happens midway through the film\u2014and they\u2019re onboard. From that point on, the focus shifts to the dynamics inside the train, and that\u2019s where the movie starts to lose steam.\n\nRead my full review at https://reviewsonreels.ca/2025/04/18/bullet-train-explosion/",

Is it a copyrights thing or hiding sensitive topics to protect the viewer or just a netflix issue? ",
