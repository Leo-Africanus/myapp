HOW many movies are you able to find that are in 4K available on Netflix? Just find some spare time to search throughout the genres and movies and series and try to do some math and calculation. For an example, search through random 100 movies and write in the comment section the actual result of 4k movies that you find.\n\nI mean, this cannot be serious. I pay 14-15 EURO a month so I can watch movies in 4K and actually there are only a few out of hundreds. How is this possible?\n\nWhose idea was to put Interstellar on Netflix with that trashy resolution? What is it? FHD? Where's 4K? Where's the IMAX 4K version so I can enjoy that? I am currently at the 36th minute and the quality of face is like painted out of Minecraft game.\n\nDo you have any explanation why I am not seeing titles in 4K, but rather old-trashy FHD?

I've had Netflix before and was happy with the platform, but when the prices went up and you couldn't share an account anymore, I just stopped using the service. Now, I'm thinking about getting it, since there are some games that catch my attention and having it on my phone makes it more convenient for me to play in my free time. I wonder if these games are really worth it and what their average length is (I imagine each one has its own style and some will last longer than others, but in general). Can these games take months to complete? Or can they be completed in a week, depending on the hours you put in? As I said, I have little time, so I'm more interested in shorter games, preferably so I don't have to pay for the service once or twice.",
