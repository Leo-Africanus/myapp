Not to say there is one true interpretation of the individual Gods, but the Thor we get in TotG is written waaaaay more like the Thor of old, a far cry from the Marvel Thor the majority of modern consumers are more used to.  \nThat's just one example. The Myths are filled to the brim with murder, torture, damnation, war, death just to name a few of the more... comfortable examples.   \nI hope it gets picked back up. I want to see the next chapter of the story. And I absolutely believe it stands well on it's own as a fantastic take on the stories. ",

But apparently another season is coming eventually? Same with Virgin River. I could have sworn the last season was advertised as the last one. I also thought stranger things was over before they released their \"final season\" which I haven't watched bc why would I wait that long between seasons??? Also I thought it concluded and I honestly thought it had run it's course already anyway. \n\nAgain, this is a real question bc I feel like I'm going crazy.

I mean did anyone know the show Strip Law was coming in seven days?

Were they hoping the viewers of Netflix were thinking \"oo boy, I sure want to watch a netflix original that is an irreverent adult animated comedy about Las Vegas lawyers!\" Like who the fuck wanted this? Is this a niche I'm not in or something?\n\nWhat I will say is that maybe, just maybe this show is slightly more creative than the other generic series they've made considering it has SOME mixed-media, the style is capable of making interesting expressions and movements, so maybe this won't be so bad (not that it'll succeed, because I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in the entirety of Netflix that has the series with a reminder on)",

What should I keep in mind before watching the whole series? The 1st episode reminds me a lot of stranger things like small town, children out of their house at night, stranger Mysterious building and more. My question was is this show really worth watching or its  just hype? ",

        "content": "I quite fear that the movie will not get received favourably by the audience. I concede that it's good, not the best but it's quite good.\n\nWhat i do fear though, is how they left us hanging at the end. 2 hours is hardly enough time to wrap this nicely and leave nothing behind. It should've been made,I think, into a miniseries the likes of The Queen's Gambit. \n\nWe do not know how Hal will go from the end. How will he face his council? What about the implications on the wider world that King Henry attack his neighbours unprovokedly? That he sees daggers in the dark where it is not? What about the betrayal? And what about the French King's daughter? How will they wrap up their relationship? Hal did kill her brother and, what happened to her father?, her father presumably. And how does Hal feel, knowing that he's the same as his father? That he did not quite distinguish himself from his father? \n\nThey're many things I fear that were not addressed. It's quite rushed, even from the beginning I thought enough time had passed before they embark to France but no, it's likey weeks had passed before they declared war on France. \n\nRegardless of all of that, I think it did quite well in the end. It's not the best, but it's... ah. I can't think of anything to compliment it. But it's good, I guess. \n\nIf you've watched it, what do you think? ",
