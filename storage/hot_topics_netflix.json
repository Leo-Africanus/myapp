Although they all still become instant celebs after premiere.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

While the dialogue may not be great and the plot can be very clich\u00e9d it also had some great humour especially from William Sabka as Johnny Lawrence. The young cast were also very reliable and it had some great recurring characters especially Paul Walter Hauser as Stingray. The fight scenes were well choreographed and it was nice to see so many of the cast from the older movies return. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spinoff too considering how popular it was.",
