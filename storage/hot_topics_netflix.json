I use an Apple Cash card for any online purchases and subscriptions, so they don\u2019t drain my accounts when I don\u2019t use them unnecessarily. Or when they all will inevitably get a data breach, I\u2019m sorta ok.. I got a Netflix subscription for the last time on 8/22/25-9/22/25 &lt;- paid period. \nToday we have 11/25/25 - they have tried again on last Thursday 11/20/25. When I go on their website, after looking around and struggling to get through the annoying banners that force you only to restart your sub - because there is no clear way to get to your account. You\u2019re there just to \u201crestart\u201d obv. There is no way to delete my cc info with Netflix either with their app or on the website.

        "content": "I work for a US health system and just started watching this.  I am very confused by their roles - like they call Lockhart \u201cMr\u201d Lockhart, \u201cconsultant\u201d, but he is clearly as surgeon as he is seen in scrubs performing surgery.  In US they would call him Dr. Lockhart and refer to him as Supervising Attending.  The \u201csupervising\u201d title may vary by health system, but he would officially be know as Attending Surgeon.\n\nAlso is Tracy a nurse or a midwife? Or are those interchangeable over the pond?",

        "content": "So I have a 2023 Samsung QLED TV and I tried to access the netflix games selection (tetris, boggle, pictionary, lego party) and I noticed when I clicked on it I got the \"play on select TVs only\" response...but when I go to the FAQ my TV clearly looks like one of the eligible smart TVs to use it. It's fully updated and I am just confused why my TV can't access it. Has anyone else had this problem?",

        "content": "I feel like this is a bit of a Boomer app tech question but, here goes. I use the Netflix app for my smart TV. I haven't used it in a while but, when I go to click a movie or show instead of a landing page appearing where you can see the info, add it to your watchlist etc, the content immediately starts. So I can't figure out if this is a settings issue or what. No clue. Anyone have any idea on what to do or have encountered this issue before? ",
