Her character development was dog water. The second to last episode where she pushed the father in the lobby and she\u2019s talking to her sister afterward and they come to the conclusion that \u2018he\u2019s [Phillips] the reason I\u2019m going to be fired\u2019 instead of her physically putting her hands on someone where there was witnesses. Her starting the relationship the entire time knowing others would think she slept with her boss to win. She just stayed on that and literally didn\u2019t do anything about it. Waited a year to go to hr to discuss their relationship with them. Then got mad/upset/freaking out at Phillips for getting the attending position when that\u2019s literally what he was trying for the entire time??? I don\u2019t know I just really didn\u2019t like her the entire time I watched this show \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI LOVED Camilla\u2019s and Sophie\u2019s arc though. And I\u2019m also really happy to find something with Justina Machado again.\n\nI hope someone else understands. ",

With the characters, the landscape, the amazing fashion sense of Inuit women, the stories that are unfolding, even the music ...omg I was shazaming everything! Acting is top notch. So natural, something you don't see very often in comedies . I couldn't recommend it more!!!! Eagerly waiting for more seasons!",
