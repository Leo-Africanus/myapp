If they had of spoken to police or FBI I believe he would have been taken in for questioning and possibly arrested or at least monitored very closely. Therefore not escaping so he could end his own life rather than face the consequences of his actions. \n\nSecondly - they lost their daughter. She has not communicated with them since Brian passed away. They never- according to her and her husband- confided in them. \n\nThirdly - their reputations in the community. People are angry at them. Blaming them for not assisting parents desperately trying to find their daughter. \n\nAnd finally financially - they had to pay Gabby\u2019s parents a significant sum - not disclosed - from the settlement of the civil lawsuit. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m wondering - was it in fact sound legal advice?\nWhat are your thoughts?
