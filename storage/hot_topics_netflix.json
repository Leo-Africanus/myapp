        "content": "i know a lot of people here hate the second season and admittedly sure its not as good as the first one, however its a pretty close tie. having our antagonist directly involved into the game a second time yet we now know the entire time who it is probably has to be the best writing switch in any series ive ever watched. it was very entertaining not knowing when he'll switch up back to his own side and felt oddly satisfying watching him do so at the end. granted there was barely any sad moments in the series like the first one had, not as memorable of characters but it still got the job done it set out to do. at the end of it all i still wanted to watch more and any series that makes me feel that way deserves a great score.\n\ni would rate the first season a definite 10/10\n\nthis new season is definitely a 8/10\n\ncould've done better, better pacing, better characters and more drama but definitely not bad at all.",

What\u2019s the reasoning for such long period of wait time for 10 episodes max? Compared to TV shows from the early 2000s and 2010s where they would have 20-30 episodes per season. Is it budget reasons? Or is it just to create more hype for the tv show? I hate it. -_-\n\nOr is it just me that feels this way?\n\nExample, season 2 of squid games released today with only 7 episodes, I finished it already and now going to have to wait several years for season 3\u2026 besides the rant I think season 2 was great.

        "title": "SPOILER: My thoughts on Squid Game Season 2",
        "content": "I'm not going to go super in-depth or make this spoiler-heavy but I thought I'd give my honest review on season 2 so... let's begin.\n\nFirst off, what would I rate this season? In comparison to the first season, I'm going to be generous and give it a 6/10. The pacing of the show felt slow at first. Starting off with scenes of Seong Gi-Hun then fast forwarding 2 years later. Pretty much emphasizing that Gi-Hun's on the hunt for the front man/the one in charge of the games to begin with. Puts up money and sends grunts to go on a wild goose chase to find the recruiter he came across in the subway back in season 1. After a long 2 years, they finally spot the recruiter then secretly follows him but things don't go as planned. Stuff happens, Gi-Hun then formulates a plan which failed and now we end up with end getting back into the game. Pretty much the \"I will find you, and I will kill you\" cliche except he doesn't plan on killing the head??... so... yeah. I'll leave it at that.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's fast forward. The failed plan that became an even bigger fail since there was a snake amongst him as he planned on going in and infiltrate the island with a group of people. This was realized during the first game that his backup no longer had a trace on him so his backup is... well... back on another goose chase. But instead of finding the recruiter, they're trying to find the island. And that's pretty much all we got out of them. Again, I'm not trying to spoil much.\n\nDuring the first game, Gi-Hun insists on helping everyone make it out in one piece. A lot more survived this time around compared to season one. Cool. After this, we now have a better look at the new players, a lot of which, are either just wimpy or plain annoying/obnoxious. Season 1 had its annoying characters too but they were done in a way where it felt just right and not over the top. A ton of \"high school bully\" type of characters. The new player(s) that were written well enough was the mom &amp; son duo. That's all I can say about the characters.\n\nNow, onto the primary reason people are watching season 2, the games. We're first introduced with red light green light since it's a staple of the show. The games that followed after that were different which was quite nice. But that's where it kind of stops being nice. The game now introduced a new thing where players could vote to either stay or leave after EACH game. If I'm going to be honest, I feel like this took away what made season 1 so good. The weight/burden of choice. In season one, players had only ONE opportunity to vote, it made scenarios a lot more impactful and gave the players an option of joining. With that, players bared the weight of \"the point of no return\". Once you were in, you're staying until the end. In this season, with players given the option to vote after every round, it eliminated that impact and made it more of a \"Don't join them, join me\" ordeal. Pair that with the high school bullying, you're left with kinda of an \"meh\" feeling. There isn't much fear since players can just stay for the money or they'll just pair with Gi-hun since he's played the game before. Follow the leader. \n\nOnce the games began, the pace suddenly sped up, leaving less room for you to have any sort of attachment to some characters. The games felt rushed/sped up making them not as fun and suspenseful to watch. With that, we're then back to scenes with Gi-Hun's muscle for hire are still looking for a way in and very little clue as to what's up with Triangle 11. The ending, being Gi-Hun's final plan which ALSO fails. Lots of gun fire, players are \"offed\", aaaaand we're left with a cliffhanger. \n\n  \nHonestly, I would have preferred they made an additional 2-3 episodes to flesh it out a bit more and conclude it all as a whole but nope... many questions a left unanswered and it seems we may have to wait for season 3. Wasn't a bad season, but it wasn't exactly great either. To those who are well-versed with celebrities in K-POP, you may enjoy it a bit more, maybe. Even then, it was okay. I'm not sure if I'll stick around for season 3 but yeah... what are your thoughts?",

The issue is did he put the smaller suitcase inside the larger suitcase or did he have time to move the bomb into the new suitcase?\n\nEither way there is an issue because the smaller suitcase wasn\u2019t left at the baggage area but when they open the suitcase on the plane the bomb is only in one suitcase.\n\nNot sure if anyone has any clarity on this.\n\n",
