        "title": "Just watched Thirteen on Netflix and it\u2019s one of the darkest movies I\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s not even horror",
        "content": "So I watched Thirteen on Netflix recently and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. It might be the darkest movie I\u2019ve ever watched and it\u2019s not even classified as horror. That\u2019s how heavy it is. It\u2019s disturbing because it\u2019s real. There\u2019s no supernatural force, no jump scares or anything like that. Just raw, spiraling human behavior, especially from young girls trying to find their place.\n\nWatching Tracy\u2019s downfall was infuriating. The way she gets pulled into Evie\u2019s world. It\u2019s such a gut-punch because deep down, you can see how much of it is her trying to find validation. It\u2019s not just rebellion for rebellion\u2019s sake. These are kids. They don\u2019t know right from wrong, they don\u2019t understand long-term consequences. They only know what\u2019s cool, what gets them attention, and what numbs the pain they\u2019re carrying.\n\nWhat made me the angriest was the parenting, or the lack of it. Tracy\u2019s mom just stood there so often. Blank-faced. Passive. She\u2019d watch her daughter scream at her, curse at her, break down in front of her and she\u2019d just exist there, like she didn\u2019t know how to act. She said at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s not how I raised you,\u201d which shows she had tried before, but once Tracy spiraled, it was like the mother was too scared or emotionally paralyzed to intervene. And the father? Barely even there. Useless.\n\nThere\u2019s also this eerie transformation that happens with Tracy. At the beginning, she\u2019s just this sweet, insecure girl. But by the end? Her face, her body language \u2026. it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a completely different person. There\u2019s a moment where she doesn\u2019t even look human anymore. Her pain and trauma show up physically on her face. She looked evil. Terrifying, even.\n\nAnd Evie,  I have a lot of thoughts. She\u2019s manipulative, yes, but also clearly broken herself. And somehow, she hides it behind that innocent, \u201ccute\u201d look. But she absolutely destroyed Tracy's life and enabled everything terrible that happened.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an easy watch. In fact, it was painful to sit through. But it\u2019s one of those movies that sticks with you. It\u2019s a reminder that adolescence is fragile, and if adults around don\u2019t step in, don\u2019t really parent, then kids are going to fall into dangerous hands.",

        "content": "I honestly blame TikTok's hype culture for how movies are turning out these days. One of my favorite genres has always been romcoms, but over the years, the quality has noticeably dropped. If you look back, there are so many classic romcoms that still hold up BECAUSE that was the standard for the genre back in the day. Nowadays, it feels like movies are being made with specific actors or tropes just so they can get the TikTok treatment. People know some influencer is going to make a reaction video with exaggerated expressions and fake gasps to hype it up. So they continue spitting out shitty films because this group is so easy to satiate. \n\nA perfect example of this is My Oxford Year that came out recently. Honestly, that movie was a mess. Sofia Carson's acting was so cringey that I had to pause the film. Yet, all over TikTok, I keep seeing posts about how \u201camazing\u201d it was and how people \u201ccried so much.\u201d I couldn't even muster up any emotional response because the film felt rushed, and the acting was just... not it. I just miss the days when movies were good BECAUSE they were good, not because they were trending on a platform. Thankfully, I was never really one to watch movies or shows when I was younger so there\u2019s tons of classics I haven\u2019t watched. It\u2019s just bothersome that I never see criticism for these terrible movies. ",

        "content": "Oh my gosh. Before we got to the big reveal (those who watched it know what I\u2019m talking about), the movie was a hard watch. \n\nEvery single scene she had the same exact facial expression and you know when you\u2019re watching a movie and you can clearly see that a person is acting? That\u2019s exactly what she felt like. \n\nEvery single moment her facial expression was seductive and flirty, literally every second she talked. There\u2019s a scene where she\u2019s asking how someone died and her face looks exactly the same as when she was flirting with the love interest. Like what. It\u2019s like she\u2019s always trying to keep herself pretty, if that makes sense. But this is not an ad or a beauty campaign. A good movie doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re watching a movie, but this was the exact opposite whenever Sofia was on screen. \n\nAlso she made zero effort to have any sort of chemistry with Corey. You could see in his eyes, the passion and the longing, but nothing from her. \n\nThe movie is honestly pretty good but Sofia Carson\u2019s acting really ruined it for me. ",

If I transfer my profile can I still use it on my account and will my watch lists and recently watched update over both accounts?",

I just reviewed my account and saw that Netflix changed my account type in November of last year back to premium ($27.99/month) for a difference of ~$220. \n\nI spoke with \u201can agent\u201d and was told refunds are only valid for 7 days. I mentioned that this must happen all the time as they weren\u2019t even surprised. I also mentioned \u201cclass action lawsuit territory\u201d and the agent quickly ended the chat. \n\nIs this non consensual account change happening to anyone else? Has anyone reviews the fine print, am I missing some detail? ",

        "content": "Please no spoilers for those that haven\u2019t seen it. I will say that I was a bit disappointed. The movie had a bit of everything tbh which was good. I think they could of really killed it (figuratively speaking), but damn I hated the fact it did such a good job in the intro and the first 20mins then everything got stale tbh it felt rushed towards the end. No I haven\u2019t played the game but I\u2019ve heard only positive things about it. Just curious about ppls opinions. I\u2019d give it a 5/10 tbh if the whole movie started and ended with that level of performance and storytelling easily 9/10 for me. Completely random but evil dead by far 10/10 scariest movie made(the newest one)",

        "content": "As an elder millennial, I grew up with Woody Harrelson and Pierce Brosnon. Always loving the James Bond aspect of Brosnon. I watched and have watched everything he does. Thomas Crown Afair standing out. So I loved this and even the Out Laws. \n\nThis dropped and I figured I would watch it for nostalgia sake. \nCool casual watching until this scene. \n\nI grew up wanting to be Brosnon. \nI'm watching the movie now as an older adult and I want to be Harrelson. Problem is, I actually grew up to be Brosnon in this scene.\nThe personality, the lack of just being happy in the moment.\n\nTLDR: This scene didn't register for me as a teen. Now I can't get passed it. IATAH",
