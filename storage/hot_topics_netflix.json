        "content": "It's not a review. It's a rant. Because I'm disappointed. \n\nI watched it mainly because it\u2019s a limited series and because Jon Bernthal is in it. Even then, it was hard to push myself to finish it in one go. The ending was painfully bad, and the writing felt lazy.\n\nIt feels like the creators tried too hard to misdirect the audience by scattering half baked subplots everywhere, without committing to any of them properly.\n\nJack Harper is an especially poorly written detective. He\u2019s introduced as a caring and sharp investigator, but from the very first crime scene he behaves like a clueless amateur. He\u2019s a detective, yet when he clearly senses he\u2019s in trouble, he doesn\u2019t act like one at all.\n\nThere were several clues, like the phone, that ultimately went nowhere except for a confrontation with Duffie, which itself was a mess. A detective says \u201cyou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d the suspect runs away, and he just stands there doing nothing. That was the moment I completely lost interest. (I don't want to even get into the swab thing and ring lost scene)\n\nFrom then on, nothing felt even remotely believable.\nZoe tries to warn Jack, and he doesn\u2019t even bother to consider what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s unbelievable that, after two people close to his sister died, he still fails to see a pattern or ask her for any unknown stories.\n\nAny normal person would have connected the dots and at least listened to her. The Catherine to Lexy transformation was a stretch, but that can be excused for the sake of the story.\n\nFrom what I understood, Anna went to the cemetery in the first scene, saw them having sex, went back to Atlanta, decided to start over, and when she couldn\u2019t get the job back, she used a hometown murder she saw on social media for field reporting so that she can go back to her town formally.\n\nEven then, the timeline makes no sense. Her disappearance was only for a year. What makes even less sense is why she married the brother of a former friend who watched and enjoyed while she was SA'd. She never tells him the truth and continues to live in the same town. None of this adds up.\n\nThe worst and most foolish twist was the mother\u2019s revenge plot. It might have worked if it had been slowly spread into the story. Instead, it\u2019s dumped on the audience in the final minutes through a letter voiceover, making it feel rushed and absurd.\n\nAnd Zoe\u2019s murder, the complete absence of her daughter\u2019s reaction or even her presence, and the fact that he does not bother to check on the daughter when he finds Zoe in the bathtub or even after the final headshot. and then in the final scene the daughter leaves flowers only for the infant. None of it makes any sense.\n\n",

But in this they\u2019re all wooden as hell, like they\u2019re reading a script written by an amateur or from a teleprompter. My only theory is this is an example of Netflix shows beginning to write for \u201csecond screen viewing\u201d knowing that a lot of people watch shows when on their phone so they have the characters say unnecessary dialogue to explain what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of that in the first episode alone. But the actors also seem to be getting zero direction and not knowing what to bring to their roles. It\u2019s very weird.  ",

I've tried multiple browsers and the app but no use. What am I even paying for?\n\nI've tried other... services  and I can watch 4k there with no problem so it's not because of my computer.

What was with all the \u201cmurder\u201d supplies she got Richard to buy\n6. Jack said Alice showed signs of dementia during the year Anna left. Was she premeditating that far in advance?\n\nFinally, how am I supposed to believe an old woman is capable of pulling off gruesome murders that require lots of physical strength as noted in one episode\u2026 I mean 40 stab wounds? Also, how did she get the friendship bracelets? Did Anna have them in her box I.e do we assume they all gave them back to her?\n\nWhat was the side story about the blackmail In Rachel\u2019s phone when it came to their weird shit with Duffie?\n\nLazy ending and the show had more potential.",

I particularly liked the tie from mccarthy to current events ( which has not been lost on many of us for some time now.) Although the lighting was a bit dark for me at times, I really ended up with goosebumps at the end. History lesson and current event in one. \n\nI wish we had more filmed theatre on Netflix. ",
