        "content": "Just finished the last season of The Sandman, and something struck me that I can't stop thinking about: there\u2019s no clear villain. Actually, there\u2019s no real villain at all.\n\nSure, we have Lord Azazel arguably the closest candidate. But can you really call a demon a \"villain\" when evil is literally his nature? He\u2019s doing what demons do. There's no moral twist, no manipulation, just raw, elemental ambition. Even Lucifer, who I fully expected to be the looming big bad this season, didn\u2019t take that role. And honestly, I was a little disappointed she didn\u2019t even show up at Morpheus\u2019 funeral. I kept waiting for her to appear, one last move, one final word but no. Her absence almost said more than her presence could have.\n\nThe beauty of this season, I think, is how conflict arises from duty, grief, pride, and change rather than a singular evil force. Morpheus isn't fighting villains; he's navigating consequences. Everyone's following their nature, their role in the grand cosmic dance, even when it clashes with others. And that makes it all feel more... mythic? More tragic? Definitely more human.\n\nCurious if anyone else felt the same. Did you miss having a \"main antagonist\"? Or did the lack of one make the story hit harder?\n",

        "content": "A key part of the series is Jamie\u2019s stubborn pleas of innocence despite his murder of Katie being clearly captured on camera. \n\nHe\u2019s so adamant that most people spend much of the series assuming there must be more to the murder than just Jamie doing it (there isn\u2019t, as is clear is episode 1).\n\nA take I haven\u2019t seen anywhere else is that Jamie\u2019s pleas of innocence are another impact of his online incel/red pill exposure: fundamental to redpill, alt-right culture is a type of postmodernism. All mainstream narratives are false, institutions can\u2019t be trusted and aim only to mislead and control the public, presumably a shadowy global organisation controls everything. This is epistemological framework is central to Andrew Tate\u2019s shtick and all reactionary public intellectuals (like Bret and Eric Weinstein) who repeatedly refer to \u201cthey\u201d.\n\nJamie is brain deep into this stuff and subsequently is effectively delusional when he comes crashing into reality after committing murder. When he\u2019s saying he didn\u2019t kill Katie, it\u2019s not so much that he\u2019s lying as that he genuinely doesn\u2019t understand the typical concept of truth in which he\u2019s being judged upon.\n\nThis theme is spelt out more clearly in the final episode when the youth who sells Eddie the paint confides that he\u2019s a part of an online community who believes Jamie to have been framed by some conspiracy of \u201cthem\u201d - he says something like \u201cthey didn\u2019t even make the stab wound anatomically correct\u201d\n\nThe final brilliance of the show is it manages to elicit this type of conspiratorial attitude from some section of the audience who feel it remains open by the end whether Jamie was the killer.",
