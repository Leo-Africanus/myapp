I enjoyed the back and forth between the vampire focusing on the telling of the story and the interviewer trying cut out the embellishments and go for the stuff he\u2019s leaving out.  In a way it feels like, yes the vampire wants to look good in his story, but also cares more about HOW it sounds something pretty important for stories that last the rest of time.  Whereas the interviewer focusing on hard hitting facts that are cut and dry is something often focused on tonight news.  Something not know for its longevity.  Like each one wants a story but its style of storytelling reflects their age relatively.  I\u2019m used to Netflix being some quick on and done stuff and it\u2019s nice to see something with a little more art and vision.  Like comparing an album to a mixtape.  Can\u2019t wait for part 2",

Is there any way to remove or block certain categories from showing up? Especially 'games'. \n\nThere's also a whole row of live-streaming wrestling matches that can't be thumbs-downed to dissuade the app from trying to suggest similar content. \n\n(Some of the games advertised also have in-app purchases - !!! - and there's no way to block those from going through on the card on record for payment)\n\nThe wrestling content is at least still tv programming; it's just a genre I'd like be to be able to de-prioritize (it should not be at the top, above my list, above continue watching, nor above the category I actually clicked on). \n\nThe games are a cash grab that don't belong, but I know better than to think Netflix will get rid of anything that scrapes them a bit of profit, so I just need to know how to never see 'games' again via my own paid subscription. Especially not as one of the first rows, before I get to the content that I have actively engaged with. \n\n(and of course it's just crap mobile games expy'd, it's not even like we're being offered to demo Echo the Dolphin )\n\nI'm in the USA getting the games spam via Region 1 but I ASSUME they're hawking this to everyone so I also labeled it 'all'.",

        "content": "Alright. I\u2019m wanting to binge a show and don\u2019t know which one of the three I should start with and complete. I have probably watched one episode of black dove and no good deed, however I don\u2019t retain anything unless I watch it a few times so basically  it\u2019s like I\u2019m starting over again. Pls tell me which one you enjoyed most, if any. ",

        "content": "Judging from the amount of talented actors and cast members not to mention the squid game dome, the rooms, the uniforms and the subplots and let\u2019s not forget the search for the squid game island etc. \n\nAdditionally, the cost likely included elaborate special effects, custom props, and intricate set design, which are essential to recreating the intense and surreal atmosphere. High-quality cinematography and expensive post-production work, like editing and sound design, also contribute to the overall cost.\n\nConsidering all the expenses like the dome, elaborate sets, talented cast members, costumes, and marketing, how much do you think Netflix spent on Season 2?",

        "content": "Harlan Coben is a master at creating stories packed with suspense, unexpected twists, and turns that make his books and Netflix series almost impossible to put down. The tension, the mysteries, and the twists keep us hooked until the very end. But here's the interesting thing\u2014once we finish a story, it often seems to fade from our memory quickly. Why is that?\n\nIt can't be as simple as just following a formula\u2014because if it were, many writers would be able to do it. What makes Coben's stories so compelling in the moment but forgettable after? Is it the pacing, the focus on plot over deep characters, or something else? ",
