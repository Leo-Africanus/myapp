        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Netflix customer since the early days. I travel frequently for work and usually bring a Roku stick to use in hotels.\n\nThis week I couldn\u2019t log in, so I contacted Netflix support. I was told that my subscription is intended for use at my home location and that I can\u2019t use it while traveling.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that I\u2019m on a plan with a 4-device limit and I stay within it. I\u2019m not sharing my account with anyone outside my household \u2014 I\u2019m just logging in from a different location while traveling.\n\nIt feels like Netflix has shifted from enforcing device limits to enforcing location, which is a big change in how the service works, especially for people who travel often. Streaming on a phone or laptop seems to work, but devices like Roku or Apple TV are where the problems show up.\n\nThe policy itself was disappointing, but what really pushed me to cancel was how little concern there was about losing a long-time customer. The response was essentially \u201cthat\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nIf you travel often and rely on streaming devices, this is something to be aware of.",
