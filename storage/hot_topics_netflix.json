This morning, when we were supposed to be finished, my young daughter tried bringing it up and was prompted if she wanted to re-subscribe. She clicked yes, not even understanding what that meant and boom, resubscribed and charged for an extra month, no sign-in required. WHAT? Absolutely not OK that this is even possible. She was signed into the Kids profile only, we just checked. Has this happened to anyone else?\n\nEdit: confirmed with Netflix support. TBF, they were helpful and have refunded the month and signed us out of all devices. However, they confirmed that the resubscription came from the TV and admitted that it is possible to do this without a password or PIN if the device is still signed in after you unsubscribe.

It now takes twice as many clicks to get to the content I actually want to watch.\n\nWorse, the previews autoplay more aggressively, recommendations feel even more random, and the horizontal scrolling is exhausting and inconsistent across devices. The redesign feels like it was built to impress a demo room, not serve actual users who just want quick, functional access to their content.\n\nNetflix used to be seamless. Now it feels bloated, distracting, and deeply out of touch with what made the platform great in the first place. At least should have give users an option to revert to the classic layout.",

        "title": "Netflix urged to prepare for 'long and messy' Baby Reindeer legal battle\nThe woman who claims to be the real life Martha from the hit Netflix show Baby Reindeer is suing the streaming giant for $170 million, with a pretrial conference taking place",
        "content": "Article - A woman claiming to be the real life Martha from Baby Reindeer [is suing Netflix for $170 million](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-real-life-martha-524997) and one legal advisor has warned [the streaming giant](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/netflix) to expect a \"long\" court battle.\n\nFiona Harvey [filed a lawsuit against Netflix last year for defamation](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/golden-globes-netflix-baby-reindeer-882144), intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and violation of her right of publicity, according to court documents obtained by The Mirror US. She alleged Netflix \"created an easily accessible road map to allow viewers to track her down in real life and connect the dots to her identity.\" In the show, the character Martha is played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nHarvey claimed she was \"tormented\" after [the show, in which she isn't named](https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/baby-reindeers-richard-gadd-issues-462748), was released. She said she suffers from \"anxiety, nightmares, panic attacks, shame, depression, nervousness, stomach pains, loss of appetite and fear, extreme stress and sickness,\" according to the court documents. She's seeking $170 million in damages.\n\nA pretrial conference will be taking place in regards to the case today. Legal advisor James Pipe has spoken to The Mirror US and shared what he thinks Netflix could expect as the case begins.\n\nPipe told us, \"This lawsuit between Fiona Harvey and Netflix is already making headlines, and honestly, it's got all the ingredients of a long, messy legal battle. Harvey is suing for $170 million, claiming Baby Reindeer is basically a version of her life, and that Netflix defamed her, violated her privacy, and acted negligently by letting it air. But is she likely to win? That's not so easy to say.\"\n\nHe continued, \"First, she\u2019ll need to prove that viewers could clearly tell she was the inspiration behind the character, and that what was shown was both false and harmful to her reputation. That's a tall order.\"\n\nThe expert explained, \"Netflix hasn't named her, and the show is billed as a dramatized 'true story', meaning some parts are based on real life, but others are fictionalized.\" When suggesting how Netflix will respond, Pipe said they will \"likely lean hard on freedom of speech.\"\n\nHe added, \"They'll argue that the show is protected artistic expression, that names and details were changed, and that no reasonable viewer would assume the character was a 100% accurate portrayal of a real person, especially someone never named.\"\n\nPipe also suggested Harvey might find it difficult to win the negligence parts of her case. \"They'll argue they didn\u2019t act recklessly and took steps to fictionalize the story,\" he said.\n\nThe trial could be a long one, according to Pipe. \"With a claim this size and the level of media attention, we're probably looking at least a year or two before there's any final decision, unless they settle early, which can happen if both sides want to avoid a drawn-out court fight,\" he suggested.\n\nThe expert concluded, \"Bottom line: Harvey has a shot, but Netflix has deep pockets and strong legal arguments. It\u2019s going to come down to whether the court sees this show as storytelling, or something more damaging.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer tells the dramatized story of comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked, with the character Martha ending up with a nine-month jail sentence for her harassment against him. In a statement shared with The Mirror US, Harvey previously said, \"Earlier in 2024, Netflix released a program called 'Baby Reindeer', which they billed and marketed as a 'true story'. One of the two main characters, 'Martha', was clearly intended to be based on me.\"\n\nJames Pipe is a legal advisor who spoke with The Mirror US on behalf of [Free Grants For Felons](https://www.freegrantsforfelons.org).",

Unfortunately ever since the turn of the century he's been churning out absolute rubbish and seems to lack any interest in producing anything remotely funny. While his  roles in more serious drama have been impressive it seems he's using his contract with Netflix to produce movies that lack any kind of passion and exhibit no sign of humour whatsoever. I didn't expect much from this latest effort seeing as it was a Netflix production and they don't seem to care about quality control but HG2 is an absolute turd of a film. They've taken all the best aspects of the original and thrown them away in exchange for a cynical promotion of golfers who appear on their appalling golf show \"Full Swing\", invited every celebrity who was willing to show up and deliver some lines lacking any kind of cohesion and a plot that is like something written by an early version of AI. It's sad to see how streamers and YouTube have contaminated the movie industry and how media platforms like Tik tok and Instagram have produced all these talentless influencers who show up on any film or tv show willing to indulge their vacuous content. If you haven't watched this yet do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague, instead rewatch the original and don't let this ruin your memory of a time when movies actually had some heart and charm.",
