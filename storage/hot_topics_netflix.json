It dives straight into some of the most uncomfortable themes that the Myths were originally all about. Not to say there is one true interpretation of the individual Gods, but the Thor we get in TotG is written waaaaay more like the Thor of old, a far cry from the Marvel Thor the majority of modern consumers are more used to.  \nThat's just one example. The Myths are filled to the brim with murder, torture, damnation, war, death just to name a few of the more... comfortable examples.   \nI hope it gets picked back up. I want to see the next chapter of the story. And I absolutely believe it stands well on it's own as a fantastic take on the stories. ",

Netflix is filled with crime documentaries, Korean romantic shows and what not but family/kid shows like these bring back genuine smiles and laughs.\n\nThe Big Show was good, rather surprised me. The main cast was brilliant. Not a minute of lag. Just fun and as it ends (well ended back in 2020 and I\u2019m ranting about this in 2026), I\u2019m genuinely gutted.\n\nBring it back!!",

It should've been made,I think, into a miniseries the likes of The Queen's Gambit. \n\nWe do not know how Hal will go from the end. How will he face his council? What about the implications on the wider world that King Henry attack his neighbours unprovokedly? That he sees daggers in the dark where it is not? What about the betrayal? And what about the French King's daughter? How will they wrap up their relationship? Hal did kill her brother and, what happened to her father?, her father presumably. And how does Hal feel, knowing that he's the same as his father? That he did not quite distinguish himself from his father? \n\nThey're many things I fear that were not addressed. It's quite rushed, even from the beginning I thought enough time had passed before they embark to France but no, it's likey weeks had passed before they declared war on France. \n\nRegardless of all of that, I think it did quite well in the end. It's not the best, but it's... ah. I can't think of anything to compliment it. But it's good, I guess. \n\nIf you've watched it, what do you think? ",

        "content": "I remember having this option on Netflix where it would start up a cheesy interactive game show that helped you pick something to watch. I think it would ask you what mood you were in and started giving suggestions that changed based on your feedback. I remember using Netflix on my PS3 so this would have been a number of years ago.",

        "content": "So, this morning, I signed into Netflix and I was gonna watch Puss in boots: The Last Wish like any self respecting person would but I couldn't find it, not on my list nor the search feature. Same goes for Across The Spiderverse, Princess Mononoke which I watched yesterday so I know it was there, Can't find Spirted Away either so I think it's safe to assume not a lot of Studio Ghibli is here, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World isn't here nor Despicable Me 4 but I dont care for that one. \n\nAnyway, what's going on? Did my computer accidently change regions and me updating and shutting it down last night instead of using sleep mode changed it back to the US? Is this not a region thing and Netflix is messing up? Any answers would be appreciated. ",
