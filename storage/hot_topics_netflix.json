        "content": "I haven\u2019t gotten around to watching Season 4 yet, but having seen everything up to Season 3, I genuinely believe Jibaro is the most perfect episode in the entire Love, Death &amp; Robots anthology.\n\nYes, I know that\u2019s a bold claim considering the heavy competition \u2014 Bad Travelling, Beyond the Aquila Rift, Zima Blue, and The Witness are all incredible in their own right. Everyone has their personal favorites depending on what they value most: hard sci-fi, suspense, animation style, or raw emotion.\n\nBut Jibaro hits different. For me, it\u2019s one of the best modern folklore interpretations ever put on screen. It tells a deeply compelling, emotionally charged story \u2014 without a single word of dialogue \u2014 and still manages to feel more complete and immersive than most dialogue-heavy shorts. The animation is chaotic in the best way, the sound design is absolutely haunting, and the symbolism runs deep.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful, brutal, tragic, and strangely mesmerizing \u2014 a true S+ tier episode in my book. A masterclass in visual storytelling.\n\nCurious to know \u2014 where does Jibaro rank in your list?",

HUGE step up from season 1. \n\nThe character developments from Season 1 is fantasic. Kyla, Cal, Shane, Will, Dave,  new characters that will be main characters... really good development. \n\nBringing back side characters that were in Season 1 to reprise the role in season 2 was FANTASTIC. No Spoilers!!!  At least 3 primary side characters are back for season 2 with new side stories, like getting a \"Pontiac Bandit\" episode, I hope they continue it. \n\nReally good story development, already excited for Season 3. \n\n\nEpisodes had the same vibe as The Office jump from Season 1 to Season 2. \n\nIt is still very much \"guy humor\"... pussy jokes, and ragging on each other, sure.  But if you even remotely enjoyed Season 1, do not miss Season 2! \n\nI'm going 8.5/10! ",

I\u2019m so happy for him cause he did such an amazing job and deserves to win many more where that came from. Still can\u2019t believe that was his first real acting job. I\u2019ve never seen a performance like that from such a young actor especially his performance in episode 3. An hour long one on one conversation shot in one take with no cuts and the range of emotions he has to portray from one moment to the next is a big ask for the most seasoned of actors. I genuinely felt terrible for him at the end even though he was a murderer. That\u2019s not easy to pull off. Stephen Graham called him a generational talent and I totally agree with him. Can\u2019t wait to see where his career goes from here.",

I mean more if there is a coastal or beach town , fisher town or something similar, with a bunch of good looking Teenagers and Young Adults, that all apart from knowing how to drive a car they all know how to drive boats and they all surf and dive and are having their bonfire parties. Does something like that exist? Like a town with strong outer banks vibes? \n\nI know the gossip girl experience actually does exist, its called le rosey, a swiss boarding school. Prerequisite is that ur parents have to be loaded. Pretty much any expensive swiss boarding school.\n\nI know the emily in paris experience actually also does exist. Prerequisite is that 1. You speak french 2. You get a fashion job in paris that does get you invited to all these fashion shows and u live in the 6th and 7th Arrondissement and wear designer and earn good money. Or you can be an influencer or a nepo Baby like all the daughters from Fran\u00e7ois Henri pinault. But the emily in paris experience does def exist in real life. \n\nBut I cant really Wrap my head around, if the Outer Banks experience is purely fictional or there is a town like that sonewhere in the world with such an environment. \n\nEdit: maybe somewhere in Australia? Or a little beach town in the south of france? Nizza? Monaco? LA? Malibu? Hawaii? Denmark?",

        "content": "Big Mouth released when I was (I believe) in late elementary school. I began watching it in middle school and really enjoyed the first 2-3 seasons, it was very relatable and gave me confidence. I tried to watch more in high school and it honestly made me a little uncomfortable as the characters hadn't aged with me, and I began to realize how strange and grotesque the humor really was. Now that I'm in college, I tried to watch this newest season, and I feel like a straight up PDF file just for watching it \ud83d\ude2d it makes me feel very weird and not only that, the show has zero charm that it had before. It's extremely rushed and they're running out of ideas. This is my honest review, the first 2 or 3 seasons are very decent, especially for kids of similar age-- but it's turned into a dumpster fire rrom there.",

I have had to revert to using subtitles. \n\nWhile on regular channels, I am able to hear everything well, it\u2019s only on Netflix that the volume is very low no matter how high I turn it up. \n\nIs there a way that I can increase the volume on Netflix? Thank you in advance for any advice! ",
