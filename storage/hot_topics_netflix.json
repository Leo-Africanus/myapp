        "content": "Did anyone else feel this way?\n\nSpoilers ahead.\n\n\nI was so sucked in by wayward, it was great, the plot the mystery, the acting (Mae was a little flat but that's their shtick and I like them and Toni was so awesome I just didn't mind), I was loving it. \n\nThere was so much energy and intrigue in the show. And then in episode 8, I felt like it just didn't deliver. I think it just wasn't good as a limited series. The mystery that was built was too big for the wrap up. I wanted to understand by the end something about the inner world or workings of the townspeople. In general, for a show which centered so much around emotions, the deeper we got into the series the more shallow the characters seemed to become. It was really disappointing. We never were let into the characters internal experience. \n\nI wanted so badly to see Laura and Alex actually TALK about things. Like the relationship was never sold as functional or emotionally intimate. I get if at first they were freaked out but when they got on the same page, why was the most we got was a a couple arguments? No real conversation. Alex is obsessive and won't let things go about work but his wife is obviously going through all this and not  actually planning on leaving town snd he's not bothering her constantly about it? \n\nThe timeline just felt wonky and poorly conceived following the set up. A great concept with poor follow through. I was left wanting more, but not in a good way, but in the way that I felt they would have to undo what they had done to answer things in a satisfying way.

I personally found it to be disturbing but in a way that's like \"you wanna look away but you can't.\" I don't see the show as trying to portray him to be sympathetic, I see what he's doing and what he's done. It's creepy as hell. And as disturbing as the previous 2 seasons were, I found them to be quite educational in a way. What signs to look out for, like it's teaching us what to be cautious of. I also heard that the next season has been green lit and will focus on a female killer which is kind of a relief in a way, cause I'd like to see how these people became who they are from both sides of the gender. But I get what others are saying about how Ryan Murphy is \"glorifying\" these people. Idk, I just wanna get other people's opinion on it.\n\nP.S. Forgot to mention that I love what they did with the correlation/motif &gt;!between Gein and the movie Psycho, I think it really brought it to life.!&lt;",

        "content": "I just finished the last episode, and I believe the show was intended to be more of a social commentary, almost borderline satire. I didn\u2019t hate it but didn\u2019t love it either. At first I was getting annoyed by the clear inaccuracies, or embellishments and what seemed like lazy writing. It feels more like the show was designed to critique modern fascination with blood lust, and the twisting of stories by the media, authors, writers, movies, etc. for entertainment. The girlfriend seemed more like a schizophrenic hallucination or possibly a symbol of a textbook female lover in a horror story. She didnt feel like a real character. Her dialogue was off, she was inconsistent, and unrealistic. I think that was the point. They didn\u2019t want to spell the underlying message out for the viewers. \n\nNow with all that said, I wish they didn\u2019t go about it this way. This show had real potential to be great. It was shot well, the music was good, good actors, interesting dialogue at times, the real story was crazy enough. But there were many scenes that were forced in there with no significance. Pulling you out of the story and into one of Ryan Murphy\u2019s strange fantasies. Also the title is misleading, the title \u201cThe Ed Gein Story\u201d gives the impression this is a somewhat accurate representation of the actual Ed Gein Story. It is far from that. While i finished the show, i lost interest halfway through episode 6. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Watch Mindhunter or American Primeval instead lol. \n",
