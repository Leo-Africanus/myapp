It was about a murder in the White House, and it really kept me guessing the whole time. Cordelia  Cupp, a modern day Columbo, and bird watcher was riveting!  I am so sad because Netflix, in my opinion, does this with so many shows. I wish they would at least commit and do less shows for production. They have so much junk on the platform that is no good, but this was, it really was! Tell me what you ladies and gentleman think below. Am I the only one? I would love to hear your thoughts. ",

Or at least a voice. Of a generation. Since then, Lena Dunham has remained a topic of public fascination, often more for her missteps than her media. There\u2019s been outrage, apology tours, half-started memoirs, a medieval coming-of-age film with a prosthetic rat, and now\u2026 a Netflix series called\u00a0***Too Much***. And reader, it is.\n\nLet\u2019s not bury the lede:\u00a0***Too Much***\u00a0is messy. It\u2019s loud. It\u2019s prone to emotional whiplash and cinematic ADD. It\u2019s a show that asks you to embrace characters who, in real life, you might ghost after a single brunch. It is also, somehow, the best thing Dunham has done in years.",

It almost reminded me of one direction when they came together they blended amazingly together for their first performance. Id love to hear others thoughts on the current bands. \n\nBand 2: Landon, Shade, Malik, and Bradley could be an amazing soul/R&amp;B group and I see the potential, loved their auditions and could definitely see them going far!! \n\nBand 1: Donzell, Aaliyah, Cameron, and Katie I dont have too many thoughts on this first group but they had have a lot of powerful voices here and im interested in seeing what direction this group heads in\n\nBand 3: Nori, Wennley, and Brianna \nI think this group needs a fourth, but were quick to rush and form a three piece. It feels like something is missing or out of place to blend all their voices together\n\nOne more band is currently forming but Id love to hear everyones opinions so far! ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching Building the Band on Netflix, still on EPISODE ONE LOL and I noticed something that feels a little off. Each contestant performs one by one in to the group of 50, and people are eliminated as the performances go on.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question: doesn\u2019t this give an unfair advantage to contestants who perform later?\n\nFor example, if contestant #3 performs, they\u2019re being judged while all 50 people are still technically in the running. But by the time contestant #40 goes up, a bunch of contestants have already been eliminated, so there are fewer people to compete with or be compared to. That feels like an uneven playing field.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Is there something I\u2019m missing in how the voting or eliminations work that makes it fair? Curious what others think.\n\nOr should I just wait and it will seems clearer later?",

Schmidt**\u00a0\u2013 Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist from The New York Times\n* **Eric Newman**\u00a0\u2013 producer of\u00a0*Narcos*\u00a0and\u00a0*Children of Men*\n* **Lesli Linka Glatter**\u00a0\u2013 directed all 6 episodes (she\u2019s known for\u00a0*Homeland*)\n\nThese are not just Hollywood names. These are people who\u2019ve worked inside media, politics, and truth itself. And it\u00a0*shows*.\n\n*Zero Day*\u00a0isn\u2019t just a political thriller. It\u2019s a reflection of our time: how fragile the truth has become, how fear spreads faster than facts, and how power is often invisible. Whether \u201cProteus\u201d is real or not is almost beside the point\u2014what matters is\u00a0*what people believe*, and what happens when everyone has their own version of reality.\n\nI get why some viewers (like my girlfriend \ud83d\ude05) found it slow or hard to connect with\u2014it\u2019s not action-packed, and it doesn\u2019t hold your hand. But for those who pay attention to current events, politics, or media\u2014it\u2019s almost\u00a0*too real*.\n\nThis show hit me hard.

        "content": "I am currently traveling and will be for pretty much the whole month of July. Before leaving the US, I made sure to download a good bit of content to watch on the different plane flights. Imagine my suprise when not even two days into my trip, all of my downloaded content was gone. One movie I had downloaded just that morning while on a layover. I had only watched one movie and a couple episodes of a new season of a show. Then, to make it worse, I can't re-download any of that content because I hit my monthly limit. On top of that, I tried to download some content on another device, but am not even being given the option to do so anymore even though I have in the past.\n\nI was able to contact Netflix support who could offer no actual explanation for why my content was now missing or why I could not download to a second device. Both devices were showing under my account with titles being downloaded. And their only suggested solution was to pay for a higher tier of service that would allow me to download more content (I'm on the ad supported tier) since the one device that can download content has already maxed it's limit. That has got to be the biggest corporate greed solution ever. Why should I pay more for a service when I am not even getting what I am paying for now? I'm paying for a service that will let me download some content for travel without removing it mysteriously and without warning. I don't need 100 downloads, 15 is fine. I'm also paying for a service that is supposed to allow downloading content on two devices. Yet that isn't working either anymore. Both of my devices are new and fully compatible, and I have downloaded on both in the past. \n\nSo now I have dozens of hours to look forward to on airplanes with none of the content I was really looking forward to watching. Fortunately I still have some content from other streaming services who haven't removed my downloads mysteriously. I've been a Netflix customer since the days of mail DVDs, but this has honestly got me thinking to finally ditch Netflix. It's clear they care more about their short term profit than actually keeping customers.",

        "title": "The story of kpop demon hunters was really weird (SPOILERS)",
        "content": "KPop Demon Hunters is an extremely fun movie, with banger songs, amazing vocal performances, and godly animation (sony is so good at this style). Yes, i loved the movie, but the story just left me confused at the end.\n\nWhile watching the movie, I thought that the movie was about how no one is truly evil, and everyone deserves a second chance. The evidence of this being the girls not wanting to use a diss track to make the golden honmoon because they didn't want to do it with hate, and also Jinu's whole backstory. Yes Jinu did leave his child but Rumi said in the movie that that's not all he is, which led me to believe that this would serve as a signal that demons can also be good. Also, Gwi Ma was the one who used the demons fears to take control over them, so they couldn't be completely at fault.\n\nDespite all this, Gwi Ma dies (which is expected), but every demon dies as well. Are we to believe that all of them deserved that death? Because that's not the message the movie was hinting at earlier. Jinu dies, and yes it could be argued that he paid the price for his sins, but I'd argue that 400 years of tormenting voices of his family was enough torture for the character. I feel like it would've been more interesting if they'd explored the idea of Gwi Ma being evil, and demons the humans who made mistakes and are now paying the price.\n\nThe plot point of Rumi being a half demon was interesting, and led to the actual message of the movie, of not being ashamed of you are, but it could've been explored more. The same applies to her relationship with Celine, which was just served to us through flashbacks.\n\nAlso, not a real criticism, but just a side note, what happened to the missing persons cases, cause their souls are just gone? Was the identity of Gwi Ma and Saja being demons now known to everyone? Did everyone just accept that fact?\n\nTLDR; fucking amazing animation, songs, voice acting (glad they didn't do chris pratt as jinu), and an extremely fun movie, but the plot left more to be desired\n\n  \n(Also, the sort of romance between jinu and rumi was weird, it's literally the 1000 year old anime girl that looks like she's 9 years old, but a little better)",
