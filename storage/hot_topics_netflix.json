        "content": "So what are we thinking so far? \nMy thoughts below because I wish I knew someone who watched this \ud83d\ude02\n\nI personally am loving this show, so much talent and appreciated that they did all the showcases in one episode, I really thought they\u2019d annoyingly split it. The pace has been good, and I know they need the cheeky cliffhanger. \n\nSZN 4 - \nI absolutely believe that SZN 4 are the clear winners unless they royally screw up. \nI really wish they\u2019d chosen another name though! They all have such star quality, particularly Donzell and Aaliyah - incredibly powerful voices. Cameron\u2019s is so unique and I feel when Katie gains her confidence she shines.  - plus they seem like nice people. \nThey all scream \u201cI would have such a good time chilling at a party with them all\u201d \nAbsolute fan here of what they are bringing to the table; the energy, the difference in voices, the oomph they give. \n\nSweet Seductions - \nI\u2019m on the anti-Allison train and I know she\u2019s being made the villain, but she just seems like such an awfully narcissistic person that I don\u2019t think they could have edited it that much. it goes to show that chemistry on stage and actually having true friendship in the band really shows in the performance, \u201cSweet seductions\u201d were not conducive - and I don\u2019t see longevity in the band just based on their toxic relationship growing due to Allison being a drill instructor and treating them like props.i wish the other 2 had ended up with the other girls that Allison ditched. Allison will be the demise of them all. \n\nI think Soulidified and 3quency will also go far. \n3quency really surprised me tonight! But wow, they really did work so well together and seemed like such a unit. It was real sweet having the other girls try on the makeup too. \nAgain, seeing people be friendly to each other and supportive of each other is just going to make me like the band more haha but yeah they aced it. \n\nSoulidified is not my cup of tea BUT I can see how they would appeal to others, working hard as well together, seems like they have the business side of it all down pat and there voices do really work with each other. But some are definitely better than others, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter as much though because they are blending so well. They really were great tonight and had fabulous energy with each other. Song choice suited them for sure. Even if they don\u2019t win I think they\u2019ll get signed elsewhere. \n\nMidnight till morning - I\u2019m not going to lie I got my hopes up that they might try something a bit different with country dusky voices but they seem to just be wanting to fit the cookie cutter. I know it\u2019s for the drama, but Connor is annoying me and the immaturity/insecurity shines whenever he makes a snarky comment about another band. Being Australian I was having hopes for them, but maybe the \u201claid back\u201d Aussie way is preventing them from pushing themselves further \ud83d\ude18 I\u2019d be so frustrated too if you\u2019d made it that far and your 20 something yr old band mate just wanted to get laid. \nAlso very sad moment when Mason spoke to the late Liam Payne about seeing him way back, and about it being full circle. RIP Liam. \n\nAnd finally ! Gosh this is long - \nSiren society - I think they might leave, which is unfortunate as I actually think they did well tonight and really tried to push themselves with so much choreography. They seem really sweet to each other and supportive. I would have preferred them over sweet seduction any day. \nChoosing a song of one of the judges I don\u2019t think did them well either, way too risky at that stage - and as Nicole said - she has her own way of interpreting her own song, to then emulate that - well it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nAnyway everyone, I am SO KEEN to hear your thoughts on everyone! Who are your favorites? Who do you think is being carried? Who\u2019s going out? \n\n",

        "content": "Just finished the documentary. I remember when that whole saga was on the news. I think the guy was a nut and just wanted a way to make easy money. His wife was willing to go along with whatever he did. I have a lot of questions that were left unanswered by this documentary. Was he actually planning to go in the flying muffin UFO thing? If not, then why build it so large? If so, then how would he have controlled it? To me this seemed like he wanted to build something big enough that it would seem credible for a small person to fit inside when he called the police.  \n\nAnother thought\u2026 when the kid said \u2018I thought we were doing this for a show,\u2019 I think it spilled the beans that he was always planning to \u2018accidentally\u2019 let the balloon go so he could call the FAA. (Who would ever think to call the FAA?! That clearly seemed planned). So I\u2019m wondering if  it\u2019s possible his kid going missing was not the original plan but just became part of it. Either way, I think jail time was suitable. Thoughts?",

One of them is assigned the role of the hunting wolf, and for a moment he goes into shock.\n\nI didn\u2019t save the name and I don\u2019t know how to search for it. I think it was listed under the mystery or thriller category.\n\nAny idea what it might be?",

        "title": "Old Guard 2 - did you notice?",
        "content": "So here\u2019s my Old Guard 2 questions: \n\n1- So Quynh is out, but she speaks modern language fluently after 500 years? Also she is completely sane and in control? Does this whole immortality and healing thing applies to mental health as well? \n\n2- did they use young face filters on Charlize ? She doesn\u2019t look normal. Too smooth and toned face like instagram filters. Or is it just me? \n\n3- Discord - completely useless character?! She is the first immortal. Ok, but no background story at all? Tua\u2019s speech implies - he said \u201cshe is the first immortal by design\u201d. Meaning what?? She was designed? Or is it some English phrase I\u2019m poorly understanding (English isn\u2019t my 1st language).\n\n4- the whole immortality lore - Nile being the last one and she is the destroyer because she has the same mark with Discord. Ok but how and who or what decides it? Why now? And how exactly Book gave up his immortality to Andy? Just by thinking about it? I thought there may be some hug or physical touch, some glow or at least something that implies \u201chey it\u2019s done\u201d. But just thinking about it transfers immortality? \nEven let\u2019s say Nile is the destroyer, then how the F the other immortals died before? How Discord is mortal? Is that because their mentality or body gives up? Discord doesn\u2019t seem like she gave up on her immortality. I mean in that case Book would\u2019ve died long ago. How those book lore\u2019s created and by whom? There were times when immortals were known or designed ? I thought Andy was just worshipped as a Goddess. But that was it.\n\n5- storyline was WAAAY off - Andy\u2019s mortality and second immortality wasn\u2019t even revealed. That would be badass if Discord just thought Andy was mortal, may be she would even try to approach her and lie about working together for cure, and then betray her by taking all other immortals, and in the last fight she learns Andy is immortal again, which is what she wants the most, and it would anger her so much and that would\u2019ve lead to more aggressive fight sequence? That would be cool. Now, Quynh herself is mortal too. And she is so cool with it? And nobody said to Quynh \u201cyo, Discord actually let you get captured and thrown into the ocean.\u201d I was like \u201cSAY SOMETHING TO HER\u201d.  Quynh would turn against Discord in the end. And this whole bomb sequence? That was just out of nowhere? \u201cOh hey come to me or I will blow up this country?\u201d And then \u201cI wanna end you because you help people\u201d. Excuse me ?! \ud83d\ude02 did they really sat down and wrote this ? I mean,  these are incredibly strategic immortals fought thousands of wars over the millennias. And this is the sequence you write for these characters\u2019 battle? Chatgpt could\u2019ve written better scenario than this. Discord\u2019s stabbing Tua in the beginning - for what exactly? \u201ci need some books about myself so people don\u2019t know who am I, so lemme stab your immortal ass real quick\u201d. Yeah OK. They were literally pals for centuries, he can tell everyone. And Tua is doing what exactly? Immortal librarian? Sounds cool tho \ud83d\ude02 And what was the scene with Quynh and Andy in the past? No explanation? Am I missing something ? I hope I do, cause that was left out. \n\n6- Fight sequences - the 1st movie fight sequences were the highlight of the movie, they were delicious to watch, old combat styles mixed with modern styles? There was a whole video about choreographing Andy\u2019s fight style. They actually spend time on it. Now in this one? It seemed robotic, weird. First fight scene in the mansion was ok, but other scenes later on? Downgrade from the 1st movie. I was expecting something epic in the last battle with Discord and Andy. And that scene was like someone sketched a good portrait and a toddler scribbled on it. There were good parts but execution and delivery was OFF. \n\n7- acting and directing - Quynh actress: yeah, she didn\u2019t deliver the character. She was slow, kept zoning out of the character, she looked badass and fights scenes were ok, but when she spoke she was speaking like someone just learned how to act, the only time I felt power in her was when she spoke mandarin when she cursed Andy. I was like \u201cdamn girl where was that power in other scenes before?\u201d Uma Thurman was just chilling in the movie. She was like - yeah lemme take a walk around the set and you capture me occasionally. She looked bored AF. I heard that she wasn\u2019t interested in the project because the shooting schedule kept changing. Can\u2019t really blame her if that\u2019s the case. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t feel right to see a sequel to this movie to be done this way. Old Guard 1 was epic. I\u2019m sad. \n",
