Well later in the day my tv said I needed to update my payment method. I went in to update it and it was a card number and name I have NEVER had or heard of before. I called netflix and they changed my email for me and I changed my card information. They told me \"maybe its an issue when you have the same emails linked to many thing\" like but the card?!?! Thats not mine?!?! Im so confused. I feel like i got help, but no answers? ",
