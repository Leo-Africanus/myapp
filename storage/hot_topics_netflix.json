Agree Wayward has \u201cwhiffs\u201d of Midsommar as I saw it put in one post but what irked me the most was the inconsistency in talent/character development and the made-for-TV Hallmark Christmas  special feel that was so pervasive. Toni Collette is one of my fav actors (interesting she also starred in Hereditary, another Ari Aster film). \n\nThis was my introduction to Mae Martin and I fell a little in love with them! I read they not only directed the film but it\u2019s based on both personal experience and a young friendship with someone sent to one of these \u201ctroubled teen\u201d institutions. \n\nI would love to see a film length version as the series format felt watered down. More emphasis on Alex and Evelyn\u2019s past could add more depth. Sydney Topliffe was really good but it didn\u2019t feel like she had much to work with. I found Abbie\u2019s story more interesting than Leila\u2019s and if it were further developed, would have added depth to the character. Or maybe, just more character development in general would have made all of the roles more compelling if fleshed out. \n\nI guess it says something about the story itself that my main complaint is that I wanted more! Just felt thin to me which feels inexcusable for an 8 episode series, each around 45 min duration. \n\nHope not too harsh! I really did enjoy it and this is the first review I\u2019ve ever contributed. Curious about similar (or not!) thoughts.  \n\n ",

They definitely left us on a cliffhanger, and I\u2019m curious if anyone else thinks Netflix will renew it for another season?\n\nI really hope they do. There\u2019s still so much to explore with the characters, and I\u2019d love to see more of Cam\u2019s journey as a gay man in the Marines. His character development has been one of the most interesting parts of the show. That said, Netflix can be unpredictable when it comes to renewals (I\u2019m still not over Mindhunter, The Society, and 1899 being canceled). Plus, with the Pentagon\u2019s criticism of the show, I worry Netflix might shy away from continuing it.\n\nStill, Boots was genuinely excellent and absolutely deserves a season 2.

        "content": "Hal loves Kate so much but he respects her even more. Relationship goals. Kate can\u2019t decide what she wants she loves him but he irritates the hell out of her. \n\nI like the character development of these people. Hal is just male. He loves and adores her and is trying to figure out what she wants so he can take her lead. Kate wants it all and doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice anything except Hal.\n\nThey are both strong politicians and their strengths and weaknesses complement each other.",

What the heck was this all about? \n\nMy sister and I watched this this afternoon and she said it was better than anything we've watched in the last 3 weeks. \n\nAll over kids, being kids, playing on property that is for the housing... technically a park as it wasn't her property. \n\nWas this because their skin was a different color, or was this just grumpy old lady syndrome? She really had it out for her neighbor. \n\nAnd jeez, 2 years the cops had been going out there to deal with her complaints about kids playing and yelling?\n\nAnd the end, jeez she really didn't want to get up out of that chair did she. She really thought she was going to get off. \n\nAnd that letter, 4 sentences that were me, me, me. I feared for my life, I thought she was going to hurt me. No remorse... God. This was delulu. \n\nI seriously do not understand this. Didn't she rent her house?",
