I don\u2019t know where that rate came from, Netflix had it as an option. \n\nSuddenly my billing said it was paused and I had to update payment,  but Netflix blocked every option I had to update the payment method. I opened the account in the U.S. in 2010 and they changed my billing and phone number to Venezuela and said the account was opened in Venezuela a year ago. Their customer service just keeps pushing for me to close the account and open a new one under the new rates. When I try to update the billing, they changed my U.S. phone number to a Venezuela phone area code and it doesn\u2019t let me change it or verify the new billing method.\n\nI have email proof that the account was opened in the U.S. in 2010. Netflix claims they only keep billing records for a year so they have no record of it. At first I thought I might have been hacked but their customer service is so intent on me ending the account. \n\nTheir customer service actually said,\u201d and just to let you know if your account was created in United States you should be paying us $17.99 not $5.99.\u201d\n\nSeems like I have no recourse and it\u2019s a dirty way they\u2019re getting longtime customers to end their grandfathered rate accounts.",

But I just watched *A House of Dynamite* and I'm both so frustrated and beyond disappointed, at the same time.\n\nThe trailer for this movie had me super hyped. I've been looking forward to watching this movie all week. While the movie underperformed, in my opinion, it wasn't actually terrible; just kind of a let down from what I expected out of the trailer. But still not awful...at least not until that \"ending\". That was just so anticlimactic and bad. I don't know for sure what I was expecting instead, but that wasn't it.\n\nWhat is it with Netflix and these cliffhangers? So many quality films have felt ruined by poor endings: *How It Ends*, *Fractured*, *Leave the World Behind* and now *A House of Dynamite*, just to name a few.\n\nWhy does Netflix keep doing this?",

Was probably filmed sometime in the 90s, but no earlier.\n4. There was no plot, simply a compilation of short songs.\n5. One of the episodes had a Yankee Doodle song filmed in the forest.\n6. (This one is really important) One of the characters was a green bipedal reptile in a purple wizard outfit with a cap and robes. He may have had yellow stars on his hat and robes as well but not definitive.\n7. The intro to each episode was a very short looping animation of the animal characters dancing in a 2D hand-drawn style over some type of patterned background.\n\nThere is only one possibly false detail, one of the characters may have been a bipedal bear with a top hat (lol now that I think about it it kinda reminds me of freddy fazbear)",

Another Lady-- I forget her name -- becomes visibly agitated that the honour had been \u201csnatched\u201d from her.\n\nIt was such a simple moment, yet it reminded me something.\n\nHere were people surrounded by unimaginable wealth and luxury -- yet burning with the same insecurities and jealousies that haunt us all.\n\nThe King and Queen, for all their power, suffer in their own ways.\n\nThe Lords and Ladies suffer for attention, for prestige, for a sense of being seen.\n\nAnd suddenly, it reminded me-- this isn\u2019t just their story. It\u2019s ours.\n\nWe chase new jobs, new relationships, new milestones, believing each next thing will finally make us happy. But it never really does. It\u2019s the same script, just in modern clothes.\n\nThat night, I remembered something Sadhguru once said: If you have tried every possible way to fulfill yourself, and you have realized that nothing really works, it means you have come to the point: \u2018And now, Yoga.\u2019\n\nIt took me years to understand this. Growing up, I was brainwashed to be in constant pursuit of happiness. But Yoga showed me something different. It turned my gaze inward and revealed that what I was chasing was never missing-- it was just within.\n\n\n\n",

(For me it adds an extra layer of \u201crealness\u201d to the documentary.)\n\nI wonder if we will see more true crime documentaries filmed this way with the advancements of technology and body cam footage etc. I think the documentary was beautiful put together and even with majority of the documentary being on body cam footage, it still told a very clear story.\n\nCurious to know anyone\u2019s thoughts on this? Did you think the body cam footage made things \u201ctoo real\u201d? Invasion of privacy? Would you like to see more true crime documentaries that include police body cam footage etc?\n\nTIA! \ud83d\udc8b",
