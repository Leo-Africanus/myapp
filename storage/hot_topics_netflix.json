        "content": "My God! This show is so fucked. In mere 4 episodes, the show manages to tackle huge issues like the evil of social media among younger generation, the consequences of it, the legal system of a nation and the family which suffers through it all.\n\nThe cinematography and the music is intense. Check out the soundtrack by Aaron May and David Ridley. Stephen Graham is a mad actor! The other actors have done a great job and the overall production is a beautiful piece of art. They shot entire episodes in a single take! \n\nThe finale of the episode will tug at your heart strings. You can't stop from feeling the dread of the family. Stephen really outdid himself in this episode, he better have an Emmy or at least a nomination. I nearly cried, he portrays the emotion in such a devastating way that you may have to look away. \n\nI found the series highly engrossing. It draws you in and let's you do the work of filling in the gaps as a viewer, really makes you think. Most Netflix shows have been mid for me for the past couple of years, I haven't loved a Netlix show as much as this one in a long while. Do give it a watch.\n",

        "content": "Just finished Castlevania and S2 of Nocturne. I loved Castlevania and pretty much every aspect of it from the plot, animation, action, characters, just everything. \n\nNocturne is a little disappointing this far. The plot doesn't really seem very cohesive and not as much time is spent on character development. My biggest gripe is everything involving Edouard. First off i was under the impression that soul forging took damned souls from hell and used dead bodies as a vessel to house them. But now apparently it's just the soul of the person who had the body? Not a fan of that. Also why on earth did no villains kill the night creature who betrayed them multiple times?? Ridiculous to keep him alive. Same with Drolta like it really ruins any death when they can just be brought back to live essentially perfectly themselves with no downside. I don't get why the Abbot didn't have control over them at all. \n\nThen there is the Abbot himself. What was his thought process? \"OH I should be the worst forgemaster ever and use demons to fight for god\" Then after everyone realizes that the Abbot is doing this they are just all to chill with that discovery. Father of my child or not I don't think I'm just chatting with him in my house after that. \n\nI also don't understand what Olrox was really doing there. He never seemed into the vampire messiah thing so why go there in the first place. \n\nFinally all the non main vampires crumbled like paper as well as the night creatures really. Then suddenly forest during the day=absolutely no sun reaches the ground and vampires get there safely somehow. \n\nThe animation, action scenes, and creature designs were top notch though. Let me know if others agree. ",

The way both the actress and the child actor did their scenes... I am truly speechless. Their talent is astounding and apparent and so compelling. The range of emotion, the humanity in the twistedness of Jaime, the eventual realisation and coming-to-terms of the psychiatrist, the way the spectrum of Jaime\u2019s character was shown without disarming clarity. \n\nI will never ever forget this episode. I thought the first two were amazing but this one. Goddamn. God fucking damn. Some actors are just meant to be and I hope this boy goes far and I hope him and the actress earn their flowers (I will look them up once I\u2019m done with episode 4 but I just HAD to spew my thoughts out about episode 3 first. The writing, the dialogue, the camerawork, direction, cinematography all are spectacular in their own right but I feel like in such a claustrophobic setting as the third episode, it couldn\u2019t have worked so magically had lesser actors been on the job so just appreciating that aspect here primarily).

I know the show didn\u2019t specifically state what he was involved in online, but what was your takeaway or perception? How do you believe this played into Jamie\u2019s belief system or himself and women? ",

You can see every single line on Kate Hudson's face and every single hair is illuminated by the shitty lighting.  \n\nHow is it that shitty shows like this get made and actual good series are discontinued?  \n\nIt's really really bad.",
