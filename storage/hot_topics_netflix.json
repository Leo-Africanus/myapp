        "content": "I just watched the finale of Next Gen Chef and I found it to be seriously suspect.  \n\nThe show already had some questionable moments.   The episode where they did the brigade service and expected the restaurant to have a different kind of fish substitution, and a substitution for a roaster ingredient to be ready in the normal time frame seemed pretty unfair and unrealistic. Who is going to ask for a different kind of fish? That\u2019s like saying I don\u2019t like beef, do you have lamb (when lamb isn\u2019t on the menu). \n\nA restaurant that\u2019s stocking proteins that aren\u2019t even on the menu is probably going to have food cost issues pretty quickly out the gate. But that\u2019s not even the real problem with the show.  \n\nThe winner was an employee of two of the judges. He was the former employee of one of them, and the current employee of a highly influential finale judge.  In general, I liked the guy and by all accounts he was very confident. Aside from an extremely weird moment where he screamed at London for singing, he was a likable contestant. It\u2019s just when you\u2019re facing people who admired your cooking enough to hire you - TWICE - the question of authenticity really starts to seep in. \n\nBy the end, it just felt weird when he won, and it could have been avoided if they\u2019d just done some homework in booking the judges, or\nbuilt the games blind where they couldn\u2019t know who they were judging. \n\n",

        "content": "Wow, I just sobbed at the very last scene of the Dad sobbing in Jamie\u2019s room and tucking the teddy bear in. Facing what\u2019s probably been his biggest fear since the day he found out what Jamie did - that he, as his father, should\u2019ve done more. \n\nThere were so many emotions to hold while watching this show and I especially felt it during this episode. I wanted to be angry with his family, because that\u2019s the easiest thing to do when a 13 year old boy does something like this. Assume his family/home life is terrible. But there was this mixture of love, shame, anger, and grief they were experiencing. I\u2019ve seen other comments on here say that the dad was emotionally abusive. This may be my own blind spot coming out as the daughter of a man with anger issues, but I can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s what the series was trying to depict or not. What I saw was a man with temper issues but that those issues were extremely exacerbated by trying to keep it together and being in denial about his son\u2019s actions. Not that people are merely \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d but seeing his family be \u201cgood\u201d people made it a more emotional watch for me. And it makes me wonder how it is Jamie became the way he did. \n\nI felt gutted by the last scene and I thought it did an excellent job of demonstrating the grief they are going through. They are grieving the son they once knew and who they thought he was. They were trying to make sense of how this happened even though they had the best of intentions and were, by all means, a pretty \u201cnormal\u201d family. But as I felt gutted for his family, I had to remind myself what her family must be going through. And how what happened was tragic and Jamie\u2019s actions wreaked havoc upon everyone around him - no one in his family did what Jamie did but they are paying for his actions. But at the end of the day his main victim, above all, is the girl whose life he felt entitled to take, and nothing can ever change that. It\u2019s something his family will have to accept and her family will have to grieve forever. ",

        "content": "Black Rabbit did a phenomenal job at portraying life in a big city restaurant, especially its seedy underbelly. I grew up in Philadelphia with a step dad who owned multiple successful restaurants in the city and Jake reminded me so much of him as he was in the early 2000s. Charming, charismatic, ambitious but underneath, stressed out, under pressure, and constantly worrying about money trying to keep up appearances. Even the staff brought back early memories of my life as a hostess/bartender at some of those restaurants/nightclubs. Very close, very tight knit, but riddled with drug use and drama, and overlooking major red flags. I really appreciated the effort they went through in giving the viewer a realistic representation of that world. ",
