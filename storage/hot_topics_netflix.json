It was cool seeing more sides of the Squid Games other than the games themselves.\n\nLee Jung-jae does an incredible job in showing the development his character went through and how it has matured Gi-hun.\n\nNew additions like Thanos, Kim Jun Hee, Cho Hyun-ju and others were great additions to the show. \n\nAnd seeing the mastermind play the games, at one point, i thought he actually turned good. But later events proved otherwise\u2026\n\nI want to specifically point out that those last 2 episodes were also INSANE.\n\nMy only complaint is how the season ends, in my opinion it was a bad spot to end it. It kinda feels like were in the middle of an episode and BOOM, ending.\n\nI cant wait to see how season 3 picks up, especially after how it ended.\n\nAnd this last thing is kind of a tangent. I wonder if David Finchers American remake wont be a remake, but possibly a spin off, showing that the organization is global, and season 3 could possibly set that up.",

Maybe would've been better to just release season 2 and 3 in 1 go but this felt like a lot of filler again.\n\n(Also, the insurrection at the end was dumb as shit. Why would they go along with that?

I updated my household to there because it prompted me to do so, but it kicked my husband out at our residence. It prompted him the same, but then it kicked me out. Is it not possible to watch on 2 different WiFi sources at the same time? Is there not a travel option? I swear there used to be, but again, I haven't been in this situation for many months. What do you suggest? Do I need a second email for my husband? Can I have 2 profiles on my account? Should I downgrade to Standard since I obviously don't make use of Premium? Thanks for your advice.
