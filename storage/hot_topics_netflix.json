Unfortunately the video quality is very poor and often time blurry and pixelated. I understand that it is an older tv show, but still the video quality shouldn't be this low.The resolution is 432p and the video has 0.20 Mbps ! bandwidth, that is an extremely low bandwidth for even SD tv shows, it\u2019s usually between 2.5 to 3.0 Mbps. \n\nWith the current picture quality the show is basically unwatchable on Netflix and I advise people who want to watch it to look for the DVD or blu ray release. Those versions are of much higher quality.",
