        "title": "Department Q - question about Lyle - SPOILERS",
        "content": "I just finished Dept. Q and loved it!  I loved the writing/dialog, the characters, and the acting.   At first I thought Matthew Goode (Mr nice guy in Downton Abbey) was too 'soft' for this role as Carl, but he turned out great.  And of course, Rose and Ackram nailed it.   I do have a question, which came up already in a response to another thread, but I want to post it here as a new question so it gets more eyeballs. \n\nThe question relates to Lyle (Harry's brother, Ailsa's son), and Sam Haig. I THINK I've got it mostly figured out now, so most of this is how I think it happened, but there are still some questions. \n\nMerritt as a teenager was 'dating' Harry.  She didn't see much of Lyle (Harry's brother) - he just came over occasionally and 'interrupted' them. So I guess there's no reason to think she was that familiar with Lyle.  Meritt, Willliam, Lyle and Harry all live on the remote island of \"Mohr\" - an island that is now in decline due to the demise of the oil industry. \n\nHarry robbed Merritt's household, and during that event, Harry first struck William, but then we later discover that it was Lyle who severely beat William.   The local policeman pursued the event, but mistakenly thought Harry was the culprit and chased him to his death on the ferry.   Merritt came back to Mohr to attend Harry's funeral (and presumably met Lyle again there). \n\nMany years later (10, 15 years?) ('current time'), Lyle is obsessed with Merritt (as a romantic target? Sexual? - not clear).  \n\nLyle has spent a lot of time in an institution, and while there, encountered 'Sam Haig', another inmate.  Sam was smart, and taught Lyle the art of deception / investigation / etc.  Now, Sam and Lyle are both out of captivity and working.  Sam was now an investigative journalist, doing well, driving a Porsche.  Lyle was struggling, working as a grunt on the local ferry. \n\nLyle decides he wants to get closer to Merritt. He knows she is a prosecutor (she's been on TV a few times so 'well known') and decides to impersonate Sam Haig, claiming to want to share information about corruption, etc with Merritt. Merritt finally meets him in a cafe, and 'warms' to him. She has no idea that it is Lyle and she's never met Sam Haig before so has no reason to doubt who he is.  So this is 'issue/question 1' - is it feasible that Merritt would not recognize Lyle 15 years later?  Lyle (as Sam) sleeps with Merritt.  'question 2' - is the real Sam Haig still alive at this point? \n\nIn addition to meeting with Merritt at the hotel on a regular basis for sex, Lyle is spying on her at her home - he's seen by William through the window one night.  So that explains how Lyle knows Merritt's movements. \n\nMerritt loses the case she's working on, and on the spare of the moment, decides to leave, with William, for Mohr on the ferry. \n\nLyle has followed Merritt onto the ferry (since he's been following her in general, this makes sense) and kidnaps her.  But - also on the ferry is Ailsa - Lyle's mum - who assists with the kidnapping.  How could Ailsa be on the ferry that day, given that it was a spare of the moment decision by Merritt to go that day?  Plot Hole? \n\nHaving kidnapped Merritt, Lyle then goes to kill the real Sam Haig at the 'cliff face' to tie up any loose ends, since he's been impersonating him.  Is this the correct timeline for Sam's death - AFTER the kidnap of Merritt? \n\nI don't normally pay this much attention to a show but there was something about the 'style' of this show that really connected with me, so I got really invested.  Now we have to wait to see if there's a second season! \n\nI thought the first 8 episodes were fantastic; I though E9 was a bit 'happy ever after', with the therapist showing up at Carl's house, soft music, etc but it was still great, and did set up for a second season - with the team well-funded and now respected.",

I watched it yesterday and after taking a bit of time to think about the movie, I now ask myself what it was even about. In hindsight it just seems like someone wanted to make a movie about people killing each other and then decided to wrap this motive into a little bit of story. And many have done this before, like in John Wick. But in Havoc.. well I feel like they messed it up. During every major fighting scene I had the same questions: How is she still alive? How did they get here? Where has he been? And the same goes for the scenes afterwards. The fights take do long that I forget what the story is even about and after it ends I\u2019m left wondering what just happened, what is the situation and who\u2019s friend with who now? \n\nIn conclusion, I am not necessarily saying that it was a bad movie. I even think the choreography was quite alright. But it just seemed like it got a bit.. out of hand, I guess.. ",

        "content": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!!\u00a0**That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

Netflix added the first two seasons to the service and was seemingly popular with the fans.  I\u2019d rather see Netflix produce a third and possibly fourth season of the series we already love and want instead of starting over from scratch.\n",

        "title": "Goo Goo Muck vs Bloody Mary \u2013 Wednesday Dance Scene Just Hits Different with the Original",
        "content": "Okay so I know Bloody Mary by Gaga has basically taken over every Wednesday dance edit on the internet. I get it\u2014it\u2019s catchy, moody, and fits Jenna Ortega\u2019s moves really well. And I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve vibed to those edits more times than I can count.\n\nBUT.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the actual song used in the show is Goo Goo Muck by The Cramps. That offbeat, punky, slightly weird 80s vibe? It matches Wednesday\u2019s oddball, vintage aesthetic perfectly. It\u2019s quirky in the exact way her character is. And the fact that Jenna choreographed the dance herself to that track just makes it feel more raw and authentic.\n\nI honestly like Goo Goo Muck more than the sped-up Bloody Mary remix. Not saying the Gaga version isn\u2019t fire, but there\u2019s something about the original song choice that feels way more unique and true to the tone of the show. It has that creepy-cool energy that makes the scene unforgettable.\n\nAnyone else feel like Goo Goo Muck deserves more credit for how iconic that scene became? Or are y\u2019all team Bloody Mary all the way?",
