I know its not alot to go off of but thats pretty much all i can remember, if someone knows what im talking about please let me know ive been searching for years!",

I just started watching The Hunting Wives, and the second Malin \u00c5kerman stepped on screen I had to pause and rewatch her entrance like three times because I genuinely thought Lana Del Rey had gone full method actress and snuck into a limited series for fun.\n\nLike seriously, THE VIBE IS UNCANNY.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the bone structure (though, let\u2019s talk about that flawless symmetry and those cheekbones that could slice glass). It\u2019s the whole ethereal, vintage glamor-meets-smoldering-siren aesthetic. Malin is channeling ultra soft-focus noir queen energy, and that\u2019s LDR\u2019s entire brand. The pouty lips? Check. The dreamy bedroom eyes that look like they\u2019ve seen a thousand tragedies and three failed love affairs? Double check. That effortless blend of elegance and danger? Like\u2026 are you kidding me.\n\nEven the styling in The Hunting Wives is doing some heavy lifting in this comparison. The hair is big, brushed out, and retro glam. The wardrobe? Draped in silk and southern charm, with that \u201cI may look like I bake pies but I\u2019ve definitely buried secrets in the backyard\u201d energy. It\u2019s basically Born to Die era Lana meets Chemtrails Over the Country Club if it were a thriller.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the voice. Malin\u2019s got that low, honey-dipped register that feels like it should be narrating an Old Hollywood murder ballad. Tell me she couldn\u2019t say \u201cmy baby\u2019s in the bar with his dandelion wine\u201d and make it sound like a threat and a lullaby.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is brilliant casting, a weird timeline crossover, or my brain just doing somersaults\u2014but I\u2019m not letting this one go. Malin \u00c5kerman = future Lana Del Rey. You heard it here first. Someone cast them as mother and daughter in a twisted psychological thriller IMMEDIATELY.\n\nAnyone else see it or am I losing it?",

        "content": "Sorry for another HG2 post...\n\nSo it didn't need to be hilarious and honestly my humour expectations were pretty low. The storyline expectations and what they'd do with all the characters though, was much higher. \n\nThe Maxi Golf concept was really good and current with Liv Golf but the execution was so damn bad.\n\nAll it needed to be was Shooter and Gilmore teaming up with 2-3 of the cameo golfers (probably Scheffler and fuck if it could've been Tiger, or even Daly!) and having playoff with other actual golfers, or actors who seemed like golfers, in a more grounded maxi/standard golf playoff. The first half being Gilmore actually getting good at golf again and being courted along with Tiger and Shooter to bring back fan favourites.\n\nAlso, this might be a stretch, but Stiller could've quietly brought back White Goodman from Dodgeball and been the man behind Maxi golf. Vanessa didn't need to be dead, the motivation to \"save golf\" was enough.\n\nI expected that as it was a sequel to something which is one of the most quoted comedies of all time to be bigger in scale but it overall looked really cheap, and the scale actually felt smaller than the first movie.\n\nAlso - it's one of the most quoted and rewatched movie of all time, why did they have to literally replay the old jokes?",

        "content": "I enjoyed it.  I quite enjoyed the video game like golf challenge during the last twenty minutes, it had the nice kind of the screw ball comedy that fits in this kind of world.  I liked seeing Ben Stiller return, the MJF and Becky roles, Haley Joel Osment having a key role.  He had the beard in his small role in the Boys so I knew who he was.  Didn\u2019t like Shooters face turn.  Paying homage to the ones no longer with us was respectful.",
