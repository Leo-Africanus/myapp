        "content": "To everyone saying it\u2019s pretty clear in the first episode and all the evidence points to it. \n\nI, like many, was waiting for the plot twist where *anyone else* was the murderer. \n\nAnd I sat with why, one reason is - it\u2019s because we are constantly shown what it looks like from Jamie\u2019s view. Like the lady constable DS Frank said in the school, \u201cRight, the perpetrator always gets the front line. \u2018A man raped a woman\u2019. We\u2019ve followed Jamie\u2019s brain around this entire case\u2026Everyone will remember Jamie. No one will remember her\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also shot in such a way that you *feel* like you are a bystander - right next to Jamie, experiencing everything with him. \n\nFrom the moment they barge into his room, sitting in the van looking out the window, not eating his cornflakes, drawing blood, the strip search and to the room where he keeps denying it. You say yes he punched her but you don\u2019t SEE the knife or the stabbing clearly. \n\nAnd then as the episodes progress, you pick and choose the information that supports your hypothesis. He was bullied, he just retaliated. Someone else has the knife. \n\nThe only impact we visibly see of Katie\u2019s death was her friend - who was hurting but was also rude &amp; violent &amp; \u201ctroubled\u201d. \n\nThe scene with the psychologist also starts with Jamie being beaten - again more sympathy. He likes hot chocolate, he LOOKS so innocent. Boys will be boys, but Katie rejected him, while he was doing a nice thing by showing her support. The only time you feel some sense of horror is when he\u2019s yelling at the psychologist, but then he calms down and says sorry. \n\nUntil he actually says he wants to plead guilty, you don\u2019t *want* to believe it. \n\nThis whole show is a masterclass in **how we erase the victim every step of the way**. The narrative is always from the man\u2019s point of view and we forget the woman. \n\nAnd how to find excuses because we don\u2019t want to believe. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what Katie looked like. But I know Jamie likes hot chocolate and hates pickles. \n",

        "content": "I loved the show, I watched a few days ago, and since then I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of videos and post about the show. Something that\u2019s been bugging me is the hyper fixation of the bullying. I don\u2019t think it should be ignored, it was showed for a reason, however I hate seeing people use it as a justification or excuse for murdering Katie. \n \nJamie was a victim, but not of Katie\u2019s. Katie\u2019s comments were made after he participated in the passing around of her nudes and the negative commentary of her body and then tried to take advantage of Katie\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by asking her out. When she rejected him he felt so insulted and humiliated because \u201chow dare someone who is flat and who no one else wants rejects him\u201d. When she retaliates by calling him an incel he tries to intimidate and scare her and when that doesn\u2019t work he murders her. He then leaves her body on the ground, runs off and proceeds to deny murdering her even though there is OVERWHELMING evidence that he killed her. He feels absolutely no guilt and even tried to validate himself by calling her names later in the series. A lot of people act like Jamie is Katie\u2019s victim or that the names she called him is why he killed her when it\u2019s not. \n\nJamie is a victim of societies unrealistic standards for men, unbroken familial cycles, the school system and other men who prey on insecure, neglected and isolated boys. With that being said I don\u2019t feel bad for Jamie, I recognize what he represents however I feel no sympathy. Jamie still killed an innocent girl because he was insecure. Jamie did not kill Katie because she called him names, he killed her because he felt small and powerless and needed to make someone feel weaker. \n\n(This is just how I interpreted the show, I\u2019m interested to hear yalls opinions!! Just keep it kind please) ",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t seen much discussion about this. People are mainly putting the blame on incels and toxic masculinity. While I agree, I believe the main reason why he lost control is because of his childhood upbringing by his parents while well intentioned. \n\nHis dad experienced physical abuse from his dad. That shapes the way he treats his son. He tries his best but he has a terrible temper as we see the way he confronts the graffiti boys. That scene was chilling since it really reminded me of the way Jamie acted towards the therapist and the girl he murdered. If the dad was holding a knife I could see things turning out differently. He was out of control with his anger hence throwing paint all over his car and staining the carpark. I believe Jamie really didn\u2019t mean to go as far as murdering him. His rage (learnt from his dad) took over and he lost control.\n\nThe way his dad talks to his mum was terrible. Treating her without respect and that would shape Jamie\u2019s view on how men should treat women. This might\u2019ve led him to be drawn to the incel community. Also his lack of self worth could be from his dad as well, never being able to please his dad. As a child, pleasing our parents is our #1 goal and this helps build our self esteem, see us worthy of dating. \n\nIf his dad went to therapy before he had a child and sorted out his rage and his attitude towards his wife, things could\u2019ve turned out a lot better. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I wanted people to pick up this idea more. I hoped this would make parents wary about how they treat their children, how it effects children when they see their parents argue (peacefully talking vs yelling until the other subsides). ",

The obsession with sex for both the boys and girls in the school, the \"sexual marketplace\" competition accelerating bullying between boys, from boys to girls and from girls to boys. \n\nJamie is eerily mature for his age, we see this in how cognisant he is of the situation that he and the people his age are in; but that maturity isn't a true maturity and acts as an illusion which I can understand make people think he is responsible for his actions. \n\nThat maturity is a very fragile one. It's superficial, only existing as an expression on the surface - a performance that others his age copy from social media and force each other to fit into. \n\nI think that's the main point to take from this show.

Did his anger/rage just take over once she said something he didn\u2019t like, and now he\u2019s put himself in a situation where he\u2019s out of control with a knife? \n\nI think this could be why he maintains his innocence throughout when there\u2019s clear evidence he did it. He lost control and instantly regrets his decision once the anger/rage passes. He knows he did it but he\u2019s in denial and as the months go by in the training centre I think his denial finally becomes acceptance and changes his plea.\n\n",

        "content": "I have an issue with my PC monitor that I only notice when using Netflix. The problem is a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen, as if it's slightly out of focus. The line is about one pixel high but stretches across the entire width of the screen. My monitor is an LG UltraGear OLED 34GS95QE. Please help me \u2014 I really don't want to send the monitor for repair if it's something that isn't caused by the monitor itself.",

It was really eye opening to what goes on online and how it can affect people, especially young people. I\u2019m 18 and had no idea about \u2018incel\u2019 or \u2018exploding pill\u2019, it was terrifying seeing what content anyone can access. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take my eyes of the screen, 4 hours straight I was on the edge of my seat. \n\nI honestly think this is a good programme for anyone raising kids to watch. It was very eye opening.\n\nAnd the acting. Holy shit, I had to remind myself often that it was a to show and not a documentary. Hats off to everyone who worked on the programme.",

        "content": "There\u2019s a lot of articles on Facebook about the new series Adolescence and the vast majority of people seem to have completely missed the point of the series and the message it\u2019s trying to convey?                                                                   You have people asking whether Jamie really killed Katie, saying that it was left on a cliff hanger and there will be a series 2, that it was about bullying or knife crime. The series is clearly about toxic masculinity and how young boys are being brain washed by Andrew Tate and the likes. Jamie couldn\u2019t handle being rejected by a \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who was weak and vulnerable after her topless photos were circulated. He thought he was entitled to her, that he deserved her. She did ridicule him online with her comments on his Instagram which was a contributing factor but it really did come down to Jamie thinking he was entitled to Katie.",
