        "content": "I watched Members Only: Palm Beach and the whole time I had a very odd feeling, like something was off. Visually everything checks out: luxury cars, massive mansions, yachts, ocean views, etc.\n\nAt the same time, the people in the show feel strange. The outfits look cringe and overloaded, kinda Chinese market-style. The overall vibe comes off as kitschy. In Europe this aesthetic disappeared a long time ago. In Italy if someone dressed like this showed up at a high-end event here, the reaction would be\u2026 complicated. Real wealth here usually shows through restraint, quality, and taste. Loud luxury feels outdated by decades.\n\nBecause of that, the show feels staged. Expensive scenery, dramatic behavior, exaggerated styling.\n\nAmericans, is this an accurate reflection of how wealthy elites in the US actually look and behave, especially in places like Palm Beach? Or is this more of a dressed-up TV version made for drama?",

        "title": "Questions about Stranger Things",
        "content": "1. Why does Vecna need to open four gates in Season 4, but then in Season 5 he changes his plan and needs twelve children instead?\n\n2. Why does Vecna need twelve children on his side to bring the Abyss to Earth?\n\n3. Why does Vecna wait years before acting directly?\n\n4. Why, in the Abyss during the final showdown, are there no other creatures present (demogorgons, demodogs, demobats, etc.) besides the Mind Flayer? Did they join him spontaneously (as if that were a good strategy\u2026)? Were they all in the Upside Down? Were they all dead? Who knows!\n\n5. Why is Mike\u2019s mother able to move freely around the hospital with a gas tank and hide it inside one of the dryers without any demogorgon noticing?\n\n6. Why do the military, once they become aware of the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan, do nothing to stop it?\n\n7. Why does Vecna, once he learns about the \u201cbeanstalk\u201d plan (through Kali\u2019s memories), do nothing to stop it?\n\n8. Why, inside Henry\u2019s mind, does Holly need to pull out the \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d move, with binoculars?\n\n9. Why, once Eleven disappears, do the military decide to abandon the town and all the protagonists as if nothing had happened? Nancy and Hopper should end up in prison for at least manslaughter. Instead, Hopper regains his job as sheriff and even considers a career advancement.\n\n10. Why is a huge creature like the Mind Flayer unable to kill the protagonists in the final battle (with legs as big as an apartment building, which everyone easily dodges with a somersault)? And how do the protagonists manage to climb to the top of a canyon so quickly?\n\n11. Why, all of a sudden, can everyone enter and exit the Upside Down without needing an oxygen mask anymore?\n\n12. Why isn\u2019t Max blind after coming out of her coma?\n\n13. Why is Joyce involved in extremely dangerous missions and plans, despite often having no real active role and providing no significant contribution?\n\n14. Why do the characters think it\u2019s a good idea to stop and talk and deepen their relationships in the middle of very intense action scenes?\n\n15. Why do gravity, air, sound, etc. work normally in the Abyss just like on Earth? Very convenient for playing \u201cspace explorers\u201d!\n\n16. Why is Vecna able to activate long-distance mind control over Hopper?\n\n17. Why does Vecna kill following \u201critualistic\u201d patterns instead of attacking en masse?\n\n18. Why is Eleven able to defeat 001 as a child but not as an adult (at least initially)?\n\n19. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna kill Eleven immediately when he has the chance?\n\n20. Why are Jonathan and Nancy not even slightly injured by the slimy substance that forms after they attack the shield generator?\n\n21. Why does Henry receive an interdimensional stone with black dust and turn into a murderous madman?\n\n22. Why does the Mind Flayer change form and strategy every season? If his goal is to infest Earth, he had countless opportunities to do so (and couldn\u2019t he have the demogorgons carry stones with black dust to possess other people, as he did with Henry)?\n\n23. Why does no one in Hawkins, besides the protagonists, wonder what is happening? No one comes up with conspiracy theories?\n\n24. Why does no one outside Hawkins take an interest in this town? Does no one have friends or relatives outside the city? What is the government doing? No external journalists investigate?\n\n25. Why do a bunch of kids always manage to figure everything out before scientists and the military?\n\n26. Why do parents tolerate such prolonged absences and/or so easily accept absurd or incomplete explanations?\n\n27. Why is the Abyss \u201cfrozen\u201d on the day Will disappeared?\n\n28. Why does Will, despite having survived, attract no interest from the military? (There must be surveillance footage showing him fighting off demogorgons.)\n\n29. Why don\u2019t the demogorgons in the laundry room hear the music Lucas plays to save Max?\n\n30. Why does no one seem to notice the gigantic walls surrounding the Upside Down before Season 5? Excluding Dr. Brenner\u2014judging by the notes he wrote and then forgot in the Upside Down lab\u2014when did he produce them? And why is there no trace of this information in the real Hawkins lab?\n\n31. Why is Eleven even capable of generating wormholes? It has been confirmed that she accidentally created the Upside Down in 1983.\n\n32. Why is Eleven able to hurl people into other dimensions? She is the one who threw Henry/001 into Dimension X / the Abyss.\n\n33. Who or what created the shield generator in the lab that keeps the Upside Down intact? Was it Eleven when she created the bridge?\n\n34. Why is Dimension X / the Abyss the only dimension trying to interfere with Hawkins?\n\n35. Why is Suzie no longer mentioned? Why aren\u2019t Robin and Vickie included in the finale? Why are unresolved subplots left hanging?\n\n36. Why does the fate of characters like Dr. Kay remain ambiguous?\n\n37. Why does Nancy suddenly appear skilled with weapons, without any explanation or prior training?\n\n38. Why do demogorgons switch from being intelligent predators to almost stupid monsters, depending on the circumstances and the characters involved in a given scene?\n\n39. Why do the disappearance of dozens of people, numerous deaths, and the presence of giant monsters not lead to serious investigations or intervention by the press or the FBI?\n\n40. Why, in Season 5, do the vines no longer have any significance, when up until Season 4 simply touching them disturbed the hive mind?\n\n41. Why do the characters constantly seem on the verge of death but then survive (after a few seconds, a few episodes, or from one season to the next: Hopper, Nancy and Jonathan, Steve, Eleven)?\n\n42. Why did Vecna specifically take control of Will in Season 1 and not other kids?\n\n43. Why does the wormhole show only Hawkins in the Upside Down?\n\n44. Why do the Russians disappear entirely? Why do they no longer spy on operations in Hawkins, considering that even kids manage to do so with the help of a high school physics teacher?\n\n45. Why doesn\u2019t Vecna maintain a constant army, and why doesn\u2019t he fully exploit it?\n\n46. Why is Max able to graduate despite having missed almost two years of school?\n\n47. Why do Joyce and Hopper never talk about Henry, even though they went to school with him?\n\n48. Why does every season have to \u201creset\u201d the world as if nothing had happened before?\n\n49. Why is Vecna not mentioned at all in the early seasons?\n\n50. Why does this series handle certain narrative turning points in such a sloppy way (\"good enough, let\u2019s go!\")?\n\n",

Or, rather than the lab and Henry Creel's backstory, they can also go for an entirely new group of kids exploring the origins of the Upside Down in the 50s or 60s. I am pretty sure that it will be a prequel, and it will be set in Nevada because it is the place where Henry got powers and everything started, so it will be a perfect location for a spinoff.",

        "title": "Stranger things finale, big moments and big questions. I can't stop thinking about what WASN'T in the finale.",
        "content": "This is far longer than expected. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the finale, have to say Jamie as Henry/Vecna stood out, he absolutely killed it. There were a lot of amazing moments, but I can't shake the feeling that a lot was missing, it even felt rushed in some places and I'm left with a lot of questions.\n\nWe saw zero demogorgons, demodogs or demobats in the finale, weird from a show that started with the demogorgon. \n\nWe didn't see the \"army\" Vecna showed Nancy in Season 4 and she talked about. I remember her speech: \"Vecna showed me so many terrible things. This giant creature with a gaping mouth, and this creature wasn't alone, there was so many monsters. An army, and they were coming into Hawkins. Into our homes.\" \n\nVecna had no defence, yet he knew Eleven and the gang would be coming, he even saw into her mind, he knew all their plans.\n\nThe military did nothing to the gang and just let them go after the crimes they committed, murdering their soldiers etc? They even let Hopper who had a fight with Dr. Kay become chief of police again?\n\nVecna was impaled and decapitated, the mind flayer was shot and burned yet Will felt nothing when he was right there? What happened to the hive mind? Not long before the big fight we see him reacting to when Henry felt pain from his memory of being shot in the cave as a kid. I thought he would have been seriously hurt or even killed being right near the hive mind when they were attacking the mind flayer and Vecna.\n\nVecna and the mind flayer were these otherwordly eldritch horrors with god-like powers and they were defeated so easily with not much loss for the gang.\n\nThis part is a bit too sci-fi for me and I love this sort of stuff, I'm just not smart enough to understand it, but: The whole blowing up the wormhole at the lab with the C4 at the dark matter seemed off. It completely wipes out all of the upside down, and probably the other dimension, but leaves Hawkins at the gate completely fine where we see \"Eleven\" standing to be killed? Would it not have also wiped out Hawkins, or at least done some damage?\n\nI understand the idea behind the Eleven ending, it was a smart idea in theory, but I don't think they pulled it off too well. Maybe I missed something, but she was right next to Mike in the truck right as they exit the gate, all of the El-Jammers were pointed at her and normally she's crippled and can't do anything but she manages to then escape the truck and get to the gate. Maybe it was an illusion like Mike later says, but she wasn't at the truck part from what I can see, and then how did Mike know about Kali? He never met her. He never witnessed what happened to her.\n\nThere was an 18 month time skip before Mike plays D&amp;D with the gang and tells them about El? Why do Hopper and Joyce not get told anything?\n\nFinally, where is Suzie? I thought Dustin and Suzie were together, we didn't see her at all. Also Vickie? Wasn't Robin going to take Vickie out?\n\nHonestly, not trying to hate on the finale, I love Stranger Things, but as mentioned I was left with a lot of questions. I'm interested in how others interpreted all this or if anyone can explain any of it.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \nI enjoyed the finale, but it felt rushed and oddly incomplete. Key things set up earlier never paid off (no demogorgons/monster army, no real Vecna defence, hive mind inconsistencies with Will). Vecna and the Mind Flayer felt underpowered for supposedly god-like threats. The military\u2019s response made no sense, the wormhole/C4 resolution felt inconsistent, and the Eleven ending was confusing (illusion logic, Kali reference, escape). Several characters/subplots (Suzie, Vickie, Hopper/Joyce learning about El) were just dropped. I love Stranger Things, but the finale left me with more questions than answers and I\u2019m curious how others interpreted it.\n\n",

There are so many good series I wanted to watch but they are always with unnecessary sex scenes. I want some good action movies like Jason Statham makes, most of his movies don't include sex at all.\n\nI'm especially looking for action and comedy movies that have huge emotions, which make me bawl my eyes out. Some that are just gruesome but also funny. You get what I mean?\n\nIt's not like I'm looking for something that a child could watch, sex scenes make me uncomfortable, haha.\n\nDoes anyone know movies like that? Thanks already!",

        "content": "Hi, for the past 2 years my Samsung smart TV has refused to run getting stuck at the NW-2-4 error, a problem that plenty of people have but no one has any answer for but finally tonight I solved whatever was causing my problem.\n\nBefore doing this though, make sure you tried the usual fixes i.e hard reset, redownload the app, unplug replug etc, plenty of guides online.\n\nAnyway, what finally fixed it for me was clearing the TVs cache. Every tv is different so try and find a guide online for how to do for yours, but at least for my Samsung smart TV I went Settings&gt;Support&gt;Device Care&gt;Start Device care which begins a short process that checks the tv for problems AND importantly, clears the cache. \n\nIf that still hasn\u2019t worked you can try deleting the Netflix app from Manage Storage in the device care and redownloading it (though I doubt this is much different if you tried redownloading the app normally).\n\nIf still nothing has worked, some have said they found success doing a factory reset of the tv which sadly forces you to redownload and log into ALL your accounts again. \n\nIf you\u2019re unlucky enough that none of this has worked at all, the problem is more than likely to do with your network/ISP, and if your not someone that would consider themselves tech savvy, your probably going to need to call your service provider for tech support (another pain in the ass). I wish you the best of luck with this though, theres a lack of useful help online that goes beyond \u201cunplug and replug the tv\u201d and I doubt these tech support lines have some esoteric knowledge they\u2019ve been hiding for like 7 years. \n\nI hope I could help some of you at least and happy new year \u2764\ufe0f",

        "title": "Stranger Things has officially ended \u2014 or\u2026 has it?",
        "content": "(Spoiler alert)  \nWhen you look at the series through the lens of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the ending of Season 5 does not feel final. It feels less like the closing of a story and more like a party reaching the end of a campaign while the world around them keeps breathing.\n\nStart with the Mind Flayer. In Dungeons &amp; Dragons it is not a god and not a cosmic ruler. It is one aberration among many, dangerous but not ultimate. The important detail is that it existed long before Henry entered Dimension X. Vecna did not create it and never truly commanded all of it. He only shaped a fragment, the way someone might force smoke into the shape of a spider. Even if that fragment was defeated, the deeper intelligence remains. It was already there before Henry and it will continue after him.\n\nFrom there, Dimension X becomes easier to interpret. In D&amp;D, the Far Realm is not a parallel universe. It sits outside reality and leaks into it only when reality cracks. It is ancient, hostile to reason, impossible to conquer in any permanent sense. Its beings are not merely evil. They are alien in ways the mind cannot safely hold. Dimension X behaves in the same way. That suggests it may not be the true source of horror, but rather a fissure, a place where something far larger presses through. The Upside Down is then not the enemy itself, but the distorted echo of what lives beyond.\n\nVecna fits into this structure. In myth and in D&amp;D lore, he is terrifying, but he exists inside a chain of command. If he falls, the machine does not stop. Someone else assumes the role. That is why Eddie Munson becomes such an intriguing figure. He died in the enemy\u2019s realm. His body was never recovered. He carried fear, guilt and unfinished purpose. Legends and campaigns are full of such characters, pulled back into the fight, not because they choose evil, but because something stronger claims them.\n\nThe experiments surrounding Kali point to the same unfinished world. Dr. K did not work on only one subject. Several women received her blood. That leaves the possibility of children with powers that remain unseen, unstable, unpredictable. Some of them may become protectors. Others may be consumed. A few might be taken by the same forces that shaped the Mind Flayer.\n\nThe creatures of the Upside Down also do not simply vanish. The Demodogs seen in such numbers in earlier seasons behave like an army that waits for new orders. They retreat, recover and emerge again when called.\n\nAnd then there is Will. He carries something the others do not. His connection to the Hive Mind has never been completely broken. In stories and in campaigns, there is always one character who leaves the battlefield changed forever. That mark does not fade. It becomes a thread the enemy can tug on.\n\nThe final image of the show quietly reinforces all of this. Children gather around a Dungeons &amp; Dragons table and begin to play, while the original group ages into mentors, guardians and witnesses. One generation finishes its chapter. Another one sits down, opens the rulebook and starts rolling.\n\nPerhaps Stranger Things did not truly end. Perhaps only one party reached the final session, while the greater campaign continues, waiting for whoever is brave or foolish enough to take the next seat at the table.",
