        "content": "The acting, man, the acting was straight up magnificent. What the hell. How can a one hour long episode about a psychiatrist and a 13 yr old boy be so fucking gripping? The back and forth, the one-take, the expressions, the physicality, the _craft._ I gave this episode \na standing ovation in my room because it deserves it and soooo much more. The way both the actress and the child actor did their scenes... I am truly speechless. Their talent is astounding and apparent and so compelling. The range of emotion, the humanity in the twistedness of Jaime, the eventual realisation and coming-to-terms of the psychiatrist, the way the spectrum of Jaime\u2019s character was shown without disarming clarity. \n\nI will never ever forget this episode. I thought the first two were amazing but this one. Goddamn. God fucking damn. Some actors are just meant to be and I hope this boy goes far and I hope him and the actress earn their flowers (I will look them up once I\u2019m done with episode 4 but I just HAD to spew my thoughts out about episode 3 first. The writing, the dialogue, the camerawork, direction, cinematography all are spectacular in their own right but I feel like in such a claustrophobic setting as the third episode, it couldn\u2019t have worked so magically had lesser actors been on the job so just appreciating that aspect here primarily).

But honestly episode 2 hit me harder. The power the kids had over the adults. The fucking hurt and rage of Jade. The sheer magnitude of having 100+ child actors doing their job effortlessly for a full hour. The CAMERA WORK (a literal seamless transition from ground to drone). The fluctuations between tight, emotional portraits to clinical medium to wide shots. The acting all around from, what\u20267 leads? It was an absolute masterclass in filmmaking and already is in my top episodes of any TV show, ever. I am completely marveled.",

        "content": "To everyone saying it\u2019s pretty clear in the first episode and all the evidence points to it. \n\nI, like many, was waiting for the plot twist where *anyone else* was the murderer. \n\nAnd I sat with why, one reason is - it\u2019s because we are constantly shown what it looks like from Jamie\u2019s view. Like the lady constable DS Frank said in the school, \u201cRight, the perpetrator always gets the front line. \u2018A man raped a woman\u2019. We\u2019ve followed Jamie\u2019s brain around this entire case\u2026Everyone will remember Jamie. No one will remember her\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also shot in such a way that you *feel* like you are a bystander - right next to Jamie, experiencing everything with him. \n\nFrom the moment they barge into his room, sitting in the van looking out the window, not eating his cornflakes, drawing blood, the strip search and to the room where he keeps denying it. You say yes he punched her but you don\u2019t SEE the knife or the stabbing clearly. \n\nAnd then as the episodes progress, you pick and choose the information that supports your hypothesis. He was bullied, he just retaliated. Someone else has the knife. \n\nThe only impact we visibly see of Katie\u2019s death was her friend - who was hurting but was also rude &amp; violent &amp; \u201ctroubled\u201d. \n\nThe scene with the psychologist also starts with Jamie being beaten - again more sympathy. He likes hot chocolate, he LOOKS so innocent. Boys will be boys, but Katie rejected him, while he was doing a nice thing by showing her support. The only time you feel some sense of horror is when he\u2019s yelling at the psychologist, but then he calms down and says sorry. \n\nUntil he actually says he wants to plead guilty, you don\u2019t *want* to believe it. \n\nThis whole show is a masterclass in **how we erase the victim every step of the way**. The narrative is always from the man\u2019s point of view and we forget the woman. \n\nAnd how to find excuses because we don\u2019t want to believe. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what Katie looked like. But I know Jamie likes hot chocolate and hates pickles. \n",

        "content": "I loved the show, I watched a few days ago, and since then I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of videos and post about the show. Something that\u2019s been bugging me is the hyper fixation of the bullying. I don\u2019t think it should be ignored, it was showed for a reason, however I hate seeing people use it as a justification or excuse for murdering Katie. \n \nJamie was a victim, but not of Katie\u2019s. Katie\u2019s comments were made after he participated in the passing around of her nudes and the negative commentary of her body and then tried to take advantage of Katie\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by asking her out. When she rejected him he felt so insulted and humiliated because \u201chow dare someone who is flat and who no one else wants rejects him\u201d. When she retaliates by calling him an incel he tries to intimidate and scare her and when that doesn\u2019t work he murders her. He then leaves her body on the ground, runs off and proceeds to deny murdering her even though there is OVERWHELMING evidence that he killed her. He feels absolutely no guilt and even tried to validate himself by calling her names later in the series. A lot of people act like Jamie is Katie\u2019s victim or that the names she called him is why he killed her when it\u2019s not. \n\nJamie is a victim of societies unrealistic standards for men, unbroken familial cycles, the school system and other men who prey on insecure, neglected and isolated boys. With that being said I don\u2019t feel bad for Jamie, I recognize what he represents however I feel no sympathy. Jamie still killed an innocent girl because he was insecure. Jamie did not kill Katie because she called him names, he killed her because he felt small and powerless and needed to make someone feel weaker. \n\n(This is just how I interpreted the show, I\u2019m interested to hear yalls opinions!! Just keep it kind please) ",

I'm looking for a documentary that I KNOW I must've seen on Netflix, but I can't seem to find it. \nIt's a documentary about something something gay men in Nazi Germany's military. I tried to Google it but it only came up with El Dorado (the one about the gay nightclub). \nDoes anyone know of this documentary, or if it's even on Netflix?",

        "content": "Here's my review of this show:\n\nThe continuous shots made me feel like I was watching a video of someone underwater and trying to hold my breath to see how long I'd last... Impressive how the actors stayed in character for 50 minutes straight. \n\nThis whole thing felt so rushed and slow paces at the same time I don't even know how that works but it was so on and off. \n\nParts of it looked like BODIES or something that has already been done before\n\nWell done Stephen, brilliant actor per usual, loved him in BODIES more tho, I'm surprised he didn't the hype during that show in 2023 because it was wonderful. \n\nHowever, I understood the point of the show, it was hardly about the murder, we'd know because they spent more time showing his toxic masculinity rather than trying to figure out how innocent/guilty he is. (Atleast this is also my take on how I knew it wasn't mainly about the murder) we saw him confess but nothing like major court scene. It was nice to see the family POV and it gives us a better picture on how he grew up. But I wish we saw some of the before the murder, to get to see more of his attitude towards her. \n",
