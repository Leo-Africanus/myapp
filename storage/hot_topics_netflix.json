        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to understand how Netflix classifies Windows devices and chooses codecs, and I\u2019m hoping someone here might have deeper insight into what\u2019s happening.\n\nSystem:\n\nASUS VivoBook X515EA\n\ni3-1115G4 (Intel UHD / Xe-LP, Gen 12)\n\n8GB RAM\n\nWindows 11\n\nInternal 1920\u00d71080 panel (~200 nits)\n\n200 Mbps internet\n\nMicrosoft Edge (latest stable)\n\n\n\n---\n\nBackground (briefly)\n\nInitially I experimented quite a bit trying to get Netflix to stream 4K to my 1080p panel for the higher bitrate and let it downscale. I now understand that without a certified 4K HDCP 2.2 display attached, Netflix won\u2019t send the UHD ladder. I\u2019ve accepted that and moved on.\n\nDuring that process I also tried various \u201cNetflix 4K\u201d / codec-related browser extensions and other tweaks. None of them changed the actual codec ladder being served.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m not chasing 4K anymore.\n\n\n---\n\nCurrent goal: HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to achieve now is much simpler:\n\nI just want Netflix to use HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR instead of AVC (H.264).\n\nHere\u2019s the consistent behavior:\n\nHDR OFF \u2192 always avc1 (H.264), ~3 Mbps at 1920\u00d71080\n\nHDR ON \u2192 switches to HEVC (Main10 HDR ladder works correctly)\n\n\nSo clearly:\n\nHEVC decoding works on this system\n\nAV1 decoding is supported (confirmed in edge://gpu)\n\nHardware video decode is active\n\nPlayback is smooth, no dropped frames\n\n\nHowever, in SDR mode Netflix never selects HEVC or AV1. It always falls back to AVC.\n\n\n---\n\nDRM detail (important part)\n\nFrom the Netflix debug overlay:\n\nIn SDR mode \u2192 KeySystem: com.widevine.alpha.SW_SECURE_DECODE\n\nPlayReady Hardware DRM is not disabled, but SDR sessions appear to use Widevine software secure decode.\n\n\nThis makes me wonder whether the codec ladder selection is tied to DRM path classification.\n\nWhen HDR is enabled, the ladder changes and HEVC is used.\nWhen HDR is disabled, it falls back to Widevine SW secure decode + AVC.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019ve verified\n\nHardware acceleration enabled in Edge\n\nHEVC and AV1 decode supported by GPU\n\nVideo decode shows as hardware accelerated\n\nPlayReady not disabled\n\nOnly internal display active\n\nVirtual display drivers removed (used earlier while experimenting with 4K)\n\nClean system state\n\nTested multiple recent Netflix originals\n\n\nStill locked to AVC for 1080p SDR.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to understand\n\nIs Netflix assigning certain Windows laptop device classes to an \u201cHD SDR AVC\u201d tier regardless of decode capability?\n\nEven if the GPU supports HEVC and AV1, does server-side device classification override that and force AVC for SDR under Widevine SW secure decode?\n\nHas anyone with a similar Intel Gen 11 UHD system managed to get HEVC or AV1 for 1080p SDR on Windows?\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine whether this is:\n\nA configurable limitation\n\nA DRM / pipeline limitation\n\nOr purely server-side policy\n\n\nAny technical insight would be appreciated.\n\nAnd yes, I did use AI to get this post written since I\u2019ve been troubleshooting this for a while and wanted to present the details clearly. At this point I\u2019m just hoping someone here might have insight I\u2019ve missed.",

        "content": "So my goal is mainly to get over the shorter more binge-able tv shows first then move onto the bigger shows. I\u2019m open to anything whether it\u2019s a movie or tv show, whether it\u2019s animated or live action. My latest watches include:\n\nThe Night agent\n\nThe art of Sarah\n\nArcane\n\nWayward\n\nAvatar the last airbender\n\nLost in starlight \n\nTwilight of the gods\n\nA knight of the seven kingdoms \n\nHis and hers\n\nPluribus\n\nThe beast in me\n\n ",
