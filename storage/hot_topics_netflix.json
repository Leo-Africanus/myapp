Knowing ie. Peaky Blinders is a period piece drama is way more useful for knowing if I'd watch it, than knowing it's 'Captivating' and 'Provocative' or whatever.",

There are too many plot holes to list here but the best scene is the last ten minutes of the season and takes place in the office. Perry\u2019s writing and the acting were brilliant .
