I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Don West.   \n  \nOk I feel this might be self explanatory, but come on I mean at first I thought he was the annoying, selfish, mechanic in space. Then now he\u2019s my favorite character! My favorite episodes showing this are S2 E10 where Will, Penny and Judy have to board the Jupiter . Knowing Don he probably wasn\u2019t into goodbyes but he showed up for this one cause he didn\u2019t owe any of them money ended hugging penny before she left that\u2019s my favorite scene of the whole show, and I think\u2026 S2 E6 is it where Don saves Penny, Vijay, Dr. Smith and Mr. Jackson from freezing in space \u201cHey, kiddo you alright?\u201d Melted my heart.   \n\n\n2. Dr. Smith \n\nAnother I feel is self explanatory. I wanted her to die for 2 seasons and then I wanted her to thrive! She might\u2019ve been the evil, con artist who stole identities and killed people, but she get better all she really wanted was a fresh start and yes to get that she did have to poison her sister but anyway\u2026I feel if the series continued she would become the weird aunt to the kids.\n\n  \n3. Ben Adler\n\nYasss! He was good all along if you rewatch the series! Like yeees!\n\n  \nWhat do y\u2019all think?\n\n",

I couldn't really relate to any of the characters but with the humour and the chemistry between the cast/characters it didn't really matter. The fact that the episodes were 30 minutes or so helps, I'm not sure if it could've been 45-50 minutes each. I had no problem binging it within a day. Highly recommended.\n",

        "content": "I've been racking my brain and would love to watch it again. Of course, it was on Netflix. It was about a serial killer who had effectively retired and a cop who had been hunting the serial killer for some time (possibly retired also). The serial killer was somewhat of a local legend, I believe inspired by Gary Ridgeway (The Green River Killer). I believe the serial killer and the cop are neighbours.\n\nMost of the show involved general family drama and such, while our serial killer, let's call him \"Bob\" struggles to control his \"urges\" after being \"retired\" for some time. \n\nEventually, he gives in, and \"Bob\" commits further murders (I think). The first season ends when the cop, having been hunting \"Bob\" for decades, suddenly concludes that our guy, \"Bob\", his neighbour, is indeed the guy he's been looking for for some time. \n\nIn the final scene, our detective guy whispers in the serial killer's ear, \"I know\" or something like that. Which is basically where the finale ends.  \n\nI'm hoping there was a second conclusive season that I can watch. If not, I would love to watch that first season again. Thanks in advance!",

It\u2019s a five-part animated adaptation of the classic comic, directed by Alain Chabat, what he's done with this series is genius!\n\nThis version stays true to the heart of the original while adding a fresh, modern touch. The humor is sharp, the animation is beautifully done, and the voice cast fits perfectly. The story follows Asterix and Obelix as they stand against the Roman forces, while their druid Getafix finds himself in trouble, struggling with memory loss that causes him to forget the magic potion recipe. Naturally, chaos follows.\n\nWatching this took me straight back to afternoons spent in the Hornsby library, pouring over Asterix comics, getting lost in their sharp wit and playful satire. Those stories always had a way of making the world seem a little brighter, balancing clever historical nods with lighthearted humor. No matter how many times I read them, they were a source of comfort and a guaranteed laugh.\n\nThis adaptation captures that timeless comic feel, and the jokes remain packed with satirical charm and modern pop culture references. Whether you\u2019re revisiting a childhood favorite or discovering Asterix for the first time, this is well worth a watch\u2014Alain and Netflix have done a fantastic job bringing these characters to life!\n\nNaturally, I think they've done a bangup job but these are just my thoughts but I'd love to hear what you think of the mini-series and if you think they should they bring out more. What do\u00a0**you**\u00a0think?\n\n[Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight - Season 1 Promo poster](https://preview.redd.it/9fzt5g5x7bye1.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddae755e30e15e3da7f6110fc554f0e287e26ee)\n\n  \n",

        "title": "Dandadan closed captions missing?",
        "content": "For some reasons the English dub of Dandadan does not have closed captions on Netflix. Hulu and Crunchyroll have it, but on Netflix it's missing. All Netflix has is subtitles to the Japanese audio which does not match the English dub. Why is it missing specifically on Netflix and not on any of the other streaming services? Given Netflix's big push with closed captions I'd have expected it to be rectified, but it hasn't been. What are the chances this gets fixed before season 2 comes out in July?",

        "content": "I'm looking for a Netflix series that I saw a few years ago. I think each episode had its own story and they were all animated. The episode was very brutal and cruel. There was a higher species, I guess alien creatures that could control humans through eye contact. So humanity was enslaved and controlled. However, there was a group of people with certain helmets that prevented this control and fought against these creatures with weapons. I remember that it was very bloody and brutal at the beginning of the first scenes. I don't mean Love Death Robots, it's called something else but I can't find the name. Thanks in advance.",
