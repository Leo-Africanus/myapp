When I want to watch anything on my smart TV Netflix app it tells me thus is not possible brcause I am currently watching Harry Potter on that same device and can only use one at a time. I did watch Harry Potter a month ago and didn't open it since and this only became an issue a few days ago. But what I am able to do is watch Harry Potter (and only that) on my TV and anything else concurrently on my phone, so their device tracking doesn't actually work at all. I have tried restarting and logging in and out of the app on my TV (it can't be uninstalled) but to no avail. Really frustrating and kind of unbelievable that a 400 billion dollar company can't get such a simple feature right.",

        "content": "Here's where I currently stand on Netflix as a whole:  \n  \nAs an example: If Netflix produced Star Trek: The Next Generation, it would have been cancelled after the first season and it would never have become as huge as it is today.  \n  \nNetflix needs to take more responsibility to bring stories to fruition and conclusion. Stop producing so much absolute C, D and F grade productions.   \n  \nFocus up and work to improve the shows that have traction to be there. You cancel shows with viewers measured in millions and waste money producing umpteen 100's of things with viewership measured in thousands. \n\nPeople pay good money to spend their time getting involved in concepts, plots, character development, etc., only to have Netflix repeatedly and relentlessly pull the plug on them. \n\nAlso becomes difficult to find things worth watching because you have to browse forever through low grade productions on the platform. \n\nPersonally, I think they should stop wasting so much money, only to pull the plug on good productions because of.... money, and stick to their guns and see things through. \n\nThere's a mathematical reality to having, for example, 10,000 things to watch, spread over your subscribership, vs 5,000 higher quality things spread over your viewership. Viewership hours are finite. They put so much out there, they distract viewership from coagulating onto good productions that rely on viewership to continue production. It seems like they do not understand this basic concept. \n\nCurious to hear what you all think, please comment below :) ",

I feel like there's more stories to be told and I want to know more about the characters, but it feels like there's not enough since they had to cram everything in one movie and cut some parts out.

The only options I saw were \u201cRemind Me\u201d and \u201cWatch Trailer.\u201d Then I realized that this issue is also affecting almost every single non-Netflix original and some Netflix originals. These Netflix originals do not have title cards and are just text. Also, there are no titles on my watch list even though I remember having many shows and movies added.\n\nI contacted support and they were not helpful in the slightest (they suggested I just wait and that my request will be processed in the backend\u2026 whatever that means). \n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar recently I would greatly appreciate any troubleshooting advice!",

        "content": "Everytime I open the Netflix app on my pc, it just gives me a white screen, freezes my pc and then crashes it. The browser version works fine. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, and yesterday it helped only once and then the app started crashing again. This started out of nowhere, I have no clue what could be causing it. I've tried pretty much every trick I could find by googling, but none of them helped, and also I couldn't even find any thread anywhere with the exact same problem as me, everyone else had the crash happen differently. Has anyone else experienced this? Any idea what could help?",

        "content": "\n\nWell,it happened. I just turned 30. Skimming through Netflix and there is a category that says \u201cretro\u201d\u2026.now when I think of Retro\u2026.i think of Herbie,Sanford and son,convoy,Star Wars,Dirty Dancing. \n\nSo,I start scrolling through them\u2026.\n\nBut,what did I see? All the shows I watched growing up\u2026THAT\u2019S RIGHT. Reba,Zoey 101,Fairly odd parents and when it really hit me\u2026\u2026\u2026.Drake and Josh. \n\nTime flies so fast in this life. Thanks for reminding me of that Netflix. Always in a hurry. We don\u2019t look at the present. I couldn\u2019t wait to finish highschool,couldn\u2019t wait to finish college,get married,have a career. To which I have done all of that. Even bought my dream vehicle. \n\nThanks for reading. Im off to watch Drake and Josh while I stroll down nostalgia avenue. \n\n",
