It barely had time to breathe before Netflix pulled the plug.\n\nThis is exactly why people are losing faith in Netflix. You finally make something with original IP, solid cast, great atmosphere, smart writing, and instead of giving it time to grow, you kill it off faster than a ghost hunt in episode one.\n\nMeanwhile, the most mind-numbing reality shows get renewed before the first season even finishes airing. Why? Because they\u2019re cheap and easy and someone in a boardroom thinks short-term numbers matter more than actual storytelling.\n\nPeople keep asking why fans don\u2019t get invested anymore. This is why. You give us something promising, with real potential, then yank it away like it never mattered.\n\nLockwood and Co deserved better. The actors deserved better. And honestly, the fans who actually stuck around and told people to watch it deserved better too.\n\nSo yeah, maybe it didn\u2019t bring in Stranger Things numbers overnight, but maybe if you let your shows breathe instead of canceling everything that isn\u2019t a viral hit in 24 hours, you\u2019d have more to show for it.\n\nNetflix is out here ghosting its own content. Fitting for a ghost hunting show, I guess.",

It's crazy because strangulation can be seen on the outside and not be seen on the outside but have a full on  impact from inside the neck. But what makes this whole case a mystery is that Tom ( the father) and Molly hade bearly any scratches or woundes on them. But parts of Jansons brain was out. \n\nI believe that it was all pre planned. She read about the first wife and made up a story. Intoxicated him weak and begun hitting him with the bat. Then shouted out so that the father could come up and help her finish story. Let's not forget to change the sheets she said. Why was there a whole brick bedroom?  And why was it so easy for the to hit him with it? \n\nIf Tom was there while Janson was alive... could he have them stopped the altercation or right then call 911? NOOOO ! He always wanted to off somebody after years as a FBI agent. \n\nI feel sorry for them kids. Me, myself and I have also been manipulated as a child and used as a spokes person. I understand. They are grown now and can recall memory better.  ",

Our obsession with romance is what makes women such easy victims to predatory personalities. \n\nMy hope is for women especially in marriage obsessed cultures, is to wake up and realize they're more worthy endeavors in life.

Did anyone else find her incredibly irritating? She came across as being rather uneducated and very presumptuous, neither of which are great traits in a psychologist. \n\nFirst of all, she states that the guy being paralytic was intentional because he wanted to make his date vulnerable (what?! He was the drunk one  not her) or because he wanted some dutch courage so that he could get away with his evil plan. Surely if it was all part of his plan, he wouldn't have gotten black out drunk? \n\nSecondly, she said that him having pre-booked a hotel is a clear sign that he wanted to control the night and has a sense of ownership. There are SO many other reasons as to why someone might book a hotel. \n\nI think what irritated me most (so far) is that she claimed that people with EUPD like Carl are often violent and spontaneous. That's just not true. I have EUPD (aka BPD) and these kind of claims can be SO damaging. I know several others with a similar diagnoses, none of whom are violent or spontaneous. I wouldn't hurt a fly, and schedules are everything. Saying he was undoubtedly dangerous because of his EUPD diagnosis was ridiculous. As if what he did was down to his personality disorder. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the guy is absolute scum and I really feel for Katie's family. This psychologist though... I'd love to know more about her credentials. ",

        "content": "Mindhunter was in my opinion one of the best series Netflix ever produced. So when I learned it was cancelled after the second season it was such a disappointment. In this article, they discuss how the series might return in the form of movies. I think this is really great. David Fincher would be returning with the same cast theoretically if he likes the scripts\u2026 Fingers crossed. \ud83e\udd1e",

She told me that the average age of virginity loss is eleven years old in the UK, and when I googled a bunch of surveys that said it was 17.5 years, she stopped speaking to me. (?)
