What did he expect from me??? Did he want me to kick my brother off? My landlord doesn\u2019t pay towards my Netflix.

Scum.\n\nThat evening I log his device out. \n\nI fly home for Christmas and this morning (6 days later) I see he\u2019s been using it again so I change my password.\n\nMy question is, how did he log back in when I logged his device out? Do PS4\u2019s auto save passwords? \n\nTL:DR I live with my landlord, I signed into my family Netflix on the communal TV, he started mooching. I logged him out but he got back in\u2026 how?\n\nEdited to fix my grammar. ",

He was honest about how American culture is so twisted with money when it comes to their own parents and America.  He made so many important points that people in general should really reflect on.  I love this guy - reminds me so much of George Carlin.  I had no idea who he was but I tend to watch what\u2019s in the top 10 and this is.  Not as heart felt as Jamie Foxx\u2019s special but clearly a different story there.  Ronny paid tribute to his dad at the end and I had some tears but I hadn\u2019t laughed that hard in so long.  I hope he does more specials/ tours - before he decides to peace out. I\u2019d pay to see him to make me laugh.    I wanted to see who else watched and everyone\u2019s thoughts were.

        "content": "My subscribing email account keeps getting \"What did you think of \\[recently watched program\\]?\" rating request emails for the programs watched by one specific profile (the first one, which I assume it regards as the \"master\" profile).\n\nI've gone to the \"unsubscribe\" link (the same as what's available via the Notification Settings menu in account preferences) and deselected everything except Account Updates (security alerts, billing), but the emails keep coming.\n\nThis is a major nuisance as well as a privacy concern (even though it's reasonable for the registered email to have access to all profiles).\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "I absolutely love this show trilogy, but I somehow never see or hear it mentioned when people talk about the best Netflix originals (usually being Stranger Things and Squid Games, which I also love).\n\nIs it because it has a source material? (Trollhunters 2015 book) But I would argue that couldn't have been that popular yet since the show came out a year later. Or it just didn't get a huge pickup?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this show trilogy?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/411y8f4eak8e1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9698a208d567b88e57ebc1f1a362af3e87202313\n\n",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm currently in UK and my friend (whose account I use) is in India. Initially, I was able to use her account just fine and was able to log into her other account as she sometimes shares with her sister.\nBut this time around, I was unable to log in despite her renewing the plan and sending me the correct ID and password. \nI tried logging into my phone as well as my laptop but Netflix simply asks me to choose a plan to continue. Can someone help me out? \nThanks! x\n",
