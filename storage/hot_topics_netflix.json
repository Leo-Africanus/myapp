Or was the movie genuinely bleh? \n\nBarely any Joe and Nicky screen time, no actual communication happening between people, Andy just looking away deeply at every moment, underwhelming fight scenes, a stupid ending. \nTo be fair, there were some good parts. I did like seeing Andy a little happier. I loved Quyns angst. Booker made me cry. But overall it was a disappointing sequel.\nI mean if you're going to take 467866 years to make it, at least get it right??\n",

Mystery?\n\nIt was perhaps even closer to a castle that they inherited. Lots of greenery and sunlight. More in line with spirits and the faye rather than monsters, i think",

I would only download episodes if I expect to move out of WiFi range or even spotty internet. \n\nThen at the destination, two days later I had a 2h bus drive and thought \"well, maybe watch that stuff now?\", but now Netflix gives me an error with my login credentials. I requested a password change and it gave me a \"too many log in -56\" error. \n\nWow, what a terrible user experience. I really just want to watch an hour of my downloads that already exists on my device, now the premier opportunity for the Netflix app to do it's perfect thing will be over just to cool off it's \"too many log in\" shutdown.",

        "content": "Just watched KPop Demon Hunters, and I've got a lot of really positive things to say about it. Fun animation and action, the Huntrix girls are really charming, and the music is a bop. I really liked how Celine wasn't forgiven for her catastrophic errors as an adoptive mother.\n\nYet, at the same time, I'm kind of left cold by other aspects. \n\nFor instance, why doesn't Rumi's father ever get brought up? I feel like understanding what drew her parents together would have been really relevant to this theme of split identity.\n\nSpeaking of, the entire \"demons are enslaved to Grima\" plot point is never explored in any great depth. We don't see demons other than Jinu who struggle with being controlled by him, and there are no free demons at the end of the movie who get to decide what their fates will be. The tiger and bird feel like different classes of being with no ability to speak anyway. They spent centuries/millennia being forced to feed him at no benefit to themselves, and it just doesn't matter. None of the demons other than Jinu get any development. \n\nGrima himself was fun at first, but he's boring in his final appearance.\n\nRumi's coming out and embracing herself moment doesn't actually feel like it matters - they complete the spell and the result is exactly the same as if they had never revealed it. The only difference is that, now, she has cool scars she isn't ashamed of, but she and the world are completely unchanged otherwise.\n\nI dunno how to describe it, like this could have been an 8/10 or 9/10 but it's missing a chunk of movie.",

        "content": "Going in a ranking from worst to best\n\n22. Season 3 Episode 5\n\nThe characters in this episode are bafflingly incompetent and it drags on for way too long and they could have easily had this and episode 6 be the same episode and taken out about 20 minutes of it \n\n21. Season 3 Episode 6\n\nDisappointing, player 333 is probably the most miswritten character I've seen in a while and they really didn't take his character in the right direction and it was all around a pretty underwhelming ending\n\n20. Season 2 Episode 7\n\nAgain just a pretty underwhelming episode not necessary even that bad but it just falls flat\n\n19. Season 2 Episode 2\n\nNot bad just not that interesting \n\n18. Season 2 Episode 5\n\nI honestly couldn't even tell you what happened in this episode apart from the beginning \n\n17. Season 3 Episode 4\n\nOff to a decent start but a bit too long\n\n16. Season 1 Episode 2\n\nNot a bad episode at all but objectively I feel like I can't put it higher\n\n15. Season 3 Episode 1\n\nNot a great episode but it gives season 3 a decent start\n\n14. Season 2 Episode 4\n\nGood idea and we'll executed but they're better episodes\n\n13. Season 3 Episode 3\n\nPretty much same as s2 e4\n\n12. Season 1 Episode 9\n\nMostly solid episode and I honestly would've preferred if it had ended here and left in ambiguous\n\n11. Season 2 Episode 3\n\nOpens the new games well but I prefer other episodes way more and I wasn't hugely invested in most of the characters this episode introduced which is strange considering they all had more screentime than the side characters in season 1 (who were wat better)\n\n10. Season 1 Episode 1\n\nJust a solid pilot episode\n\n9. Season 1 Episode 3\n\nIconic episode that expands its side characters well\n\n8. Season 1 Episode 4\n\nMore build up than anything but it's food build up so I don't mind\n\n7. Season 1 Episode 5\n\nJust a good episode\n\n6. Season 2 Episode 1\n\nSuch a good start so it's a shame the season goes mostly downhill after it\n\n5. Season 2 Episods 6\n\nThis is just a really solid idea for a game and it's really good\n\n4. Season 1 Episode 8\n\nSets up the s1 finale perfectly and if you didn't already, will definitely make you care about these characters\n\n3. Season 1 Episode 7\n\nI know the VIPs suck but if you ignore that, this episode is really great\n\n2. Season 3 Episode 2\n\nIt's so frustrating how great this episode is because it proves season 3 overall could've been so much better\n\n1. Season 1 Episode 6\n\nAbsolutely no explanation needed",

We carefully followed every step in the screen, including the unexpected ones like entering payment details.

        "content": "I am currently rewatching sex education and i've noticed that it keeps skipping a few seconds in a random scene switch. It skips about 5 to 7 seconds so when i rewind for 10 seconds it skips again on the same spot. So it seems it is not completely random. \nThe skip also happens without any UI indicator.\n\nOn a different post here i've seen that headphones was the cause for another user. I've turned bluetooth off but still have those skips. \n\nI am watching on my phone most of the time but the skips do not occur when i'm watching on the TV.\nCurrent android version: 15\n\nI don't know if the skips are only on sex ed or another show, didn't watch anything else recently\n",
