        "content": "I\u2019ve just finished Pluto after stumbling upon it by chance on Netflix. I was actually just looking for something to have playing in the background, without the intention of actively watching it. Ever since Vinland Saga and AoT, I had pretty much given up on finding something genuinely good in that space \u2014 especially on Netflix.\n\nFirst of all: did anyone else notice how many hints and references there were to Monster?\n\n1. Tenma being a scientist/doctor.\n2. And what I found even crazier: they basically adapted Julius Reichwein 100% as Ban-Kouchou. He looks exactly like Julius Reichwein. Like, 1:1. \n\nI also really loved the many Evangelion references (e.g. \u201cpierced Braun 1589 \u2192 Adam pierced by the Lance\u201d). Those are just the ones I personally noticed.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m left with a few questions:\n\n1. How was Braun 1589 able to kill a human? And how was Gesicht able to kill a human as well, when they technically shouldn\u2019t be capable of that? As far as I understand, only Pluto \u2014 and Abdulla \u2014 should have been able to do so, since they were equipped with unpleasant emotions. Braun and Gesicht were created as \u201cnormal\u201d AIs.\n2. Why was Atom able to lie to Helena at the end?\n3. Who is the teddy bear, and why did Braun decide to kill him?\n\nI get that, especially in sci-fi, you can\u2019t avoid a few plot holes \u2014 but there were quite a few things that ultimately made me settle on an 8.5/10.\n\nThe lack of fight scenes didn\u2019t bother me at all \u2014 quite the opposite. There were so many incredibly beautiful and symbolic images: Pluto crying together with Atom, Epsilon slowly shattering to light etc. It all felt almost like a dream. I think it was a very smart decision by the creators to prioritize these atmospheric visuals over action scenes.\n\nI might have liked to see at least one female member among the seven robots, though.\n\nLastly, I really wonder why this anime is so relatively unknown. And: do you have any other anime recommendations? I had basically given up on the whole medium, but Pluto has given me hope that there\u2019s still something truly great out there.",

I was told that my subscription is intended for use at my home location and that I can\u2019t use it while traveling.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that I\u2019m on a plan with a 4-device limit and I stay within it. I\u2019m not sharing my account with anyone outside my household \u2014 I\u2019m just logging in from a different location while traveling.\n\nIt feels like Netflix has shifted from enforcing device limits to enforcing location, which is a big change in how the service works, especially for people who travel often. Streaming on a phone or laptop seems to work, but devices like Roku or Apple TV are where the problems show up.\n\nThe policy itself was disappointing, but what really pushed me to cancel was how little concern there was about losing a long-time customer. The response was essentially \u201cthat\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nIf you travel often and rely on streaming devices, this is something to be aware of.",
