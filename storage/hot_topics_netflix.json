        "content": "I recently watched both the Woodstock \u201899 and Astroworld: Concert from Hell documentaries on Netflix, and I\u2019m still processing what I saw. As someone from Gen Z, I was somewhat familiar with the Astroworld tragedy through social media when it happened, but I wasn\u2019t aware of the full scope of what unfolded until now. In contrast, I had only heard some stories about Woodstock \u201899 \u2014 mostly through TikTok clips or stories so watching the full documentary was incredibly eye-opening.\n\nThe Astroworld documentary was extremely difficult to watch. The fact that so many warning signs were present beforehand \u2014 and yet still overlooked is truly upsetting. There were multiple moments leading up to the event where proper crowd management, communication, or even a pause in the show might have prevented loss of life. The most heartbreaking part is knowing it was preventable. Seeing the trauma experienced by survivors and hearing from the families of the victims was deeply emotional. It\u2019s clear that they deserve answers, accountability, and justice. Mind you, NO ONE WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE is one of the most unsettling parts of it all. \n\nWoodstock \u201899, on the other hand, was disturbing in an entirely different way. While I wasn\u2019t born at the time, the documentary captures a level of chaos, neglect, and cultural volatility that\u2019s hard to wrap my head around. The environment looked completely out of control \u2014 no rules, barely any security, and so many people were harmed. The stories shared were horrifying. \n\nI\u2019d be interested to hear from anyone who attended AstroWorld/Woodstock \u201899 or remembers it happening (if comfortable ofc). I\u2019m also curious how others processed these documentaries, especially if you watched both. \n",

        "content": "This is literally the best exmaple I\u2019ve seen so far of a show that should\u2019ve have been so much longer yet was obviously done in a way to make it short and full of action within just 8 episodes. This show should\u2019ve been 20 episodes. Instead the creators decided to do what Netflix has now done multiple times and condense it into one of those shows where it\u2019s just nonstop action and plot twist and turn with conflict and resolution happening way to fast. It\u2019s a great show, but way too fast passed. Which is what ruins it. The characters don\u2019t have enough time to develop and that makes the show feel shallow and not as intense or meaningful because u lack connection with the charictors. An example of this is how quickly cane\u2019s character is brought in and how quickly it goes south with him, it\u2019s supposed to be a sort of plot twist, but it doesn\u2019t even feel like one becuase there\u2019s not enough time to even developed a proper plot. Another exmaple is how quickly the early plot twist with sherif is done and how quickly the sherif goes from partner to being killed. It\u2019s just all far too rushed and should\u2019ve been carried out through multiple episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this exact issue of rushed shows so much recently on Netflix, they had great potential but just were executed in this poor fashion which ruins the whole thing.

Was taken directly from the Roku home page to an ad and then the show started playing.\n  \nIt was very confusing at first, but its not uncommon for animes to start in weird spots with a lot going on to drag you in and catch you up.\n  \nAbout 12 minutes in, it dawned on us. We were watching the last episode. Everything about the episode culminated in \"this is the closing of a story\".\n  \nI backed out to see that it had taken us DIRECTLY to the last episode and auto-played it. None of the previous episodes have any play time on them.\n  \nThe show was instantly spoiled for us.\n  \nThis $500 TV is less than 6 months old. The bug is reproducible and there are many forum posts on Netflix and Roku community forums from the last 2-3 weeks complaining about this. Where both Netflix and Roku are passing the blame to each other.\n  \nIt's our fault honestly for trusting technology to do something correctly, with how bloated and garbage smart TVs, streaming services, and technology in general, are these days.\n  \n**TL;DR:** Be aware that there is a reproducible bug when selecting a search result in Roku that is on Netflix where it will automatically play the LAST episode of a TV series. Whether this is a Roku bug or Netflix app on Roku bug is unclear, as they keep passing the blame.",
