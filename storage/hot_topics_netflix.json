        "content": "Cassandra was an interesting story that I couldn't help but wonder what happened next. By the time we get to the end, we get that bitter sweet ending. But I was curious on what I missed on the first watch knowing what I know now. I found that the story is actually very sad when you watch it a second time. It lets you see everything from Cassandra's perspective. In the past, the last thing that happens is Cassandra watches her son die and shorts out. Her daughter then starves to death in the room and 50 years past. When she wakes up, she first assumes the boy is Peter. She is obviously very hopeful that her last memory was wrong. But then she notices that it's not Peter and a new family is in her house. What's the first thing she does? She goes to the master bedroom and enters the closet to check on her daughter. You can see when she enters the room and when the wife looks, you can see the closet door close with no one else around. Cassandra went into the secret room. Now at this time the rest of the house starts coming on with an expressionless Cassandra. I believe at this point, the robot is mourning her daughter and losing her mind. You next see Cassandra standing by the pool where I believe she's thinking about killing herself and wondering if she can just fall in and end it. But then she sees the mouse and that's when you know she's gone crazy. She talks to it and runs it over. When the family wakes up, she's not acting like herself anymore. She's pretending to be a house servant for them so she can take over the family and replace the ones she lost. The rest of the story plays out as normal, but now you know where her madness comes from.\n\nI'm glad I took the time to watch it all. It was very interesting.",

I'm definitely not watching ads.\n\nHowever I'm curious how this has affected their market share and how many users they lost? I know they want ad users but was this an overall win for them?\n\nI haven't been paying much attention, but I was wondering what people think in this sub now that the new plans have been out for a while.\n\nI kinda miss my comfort show but not for $25 a month when every other platform is less with better content. \n\nThoughts?

After his father passed away, Facu told me he wanted to buy a Torino to restore\u2014his dad had owned one years ago. Of course, I thought it was a fantastic idea and encouraged him to go for it.\n\nA few days later, he sent me a couple of really beat-up listings from Marketplace, and we ended up finding this one. We\u2019re both from Villa Ballester, but I live in Villa Devoto now (Buenos Aires, AR)\u2014and the car happened to be just a few blocks from my place. We went to see it, and the guy selling it mentioned something about the new series, but honestly, we didn\u2019t pay much attention at the time\u2014we thought it was just some random detail.\n\nA few months later, though, it became a big deal. Facu got a call from the show's production team asking him to bring the car to the premiere. Some automotive outlets like Motor1 also reached out to feature it. The car is beautiful, but the story behind it is even more meaningful. I contributed a few parts from my line of work (locks).\n\nIf you're interested, you can follow the restoration process on Instagram: @theclassicgarage_arg. it's in Spanish.",

They're all really horrible, and seem to be intended for a much younger audience (what made Netflix think I'd enjoy these based on my viewing history?). \n\nOne of the games was literally intended to help very young readers. Each level consists of walking on top of the text for a 1\\~3 sentences story, and interacting with a few of the words along the way.\n\nMost of what I tried (5-6) all seemed like something a 3rd year computer science student did for a project-class over a quarter. They're taking up the second row as well as the background feature at the top. Seems like a really poor landing page experience.",

And on my account I am the household, but ever since I did that I\u2019ve been having nonstop issues where he keeps getting signed out of Netflix every day, and I have to help sign them back in (he\u2019s old and bad with tech), and now it keeps signing me out of my own account even though we\u2019re part of two different households that I pay IDK $17.99 per month for my account and then an additional $7.99 for his account. How do I fix this because at this point I don\u2019t see the point in paying the extra money if it won\u2019t let us have two separate households. I\u2019ll provide pictures below of what I mean.",

I finished the show because it\u2019s fairly short and because i kept thinking I\u2019ll eventually like it and understand the hype. Unfortunately, I did not.\n\nThe thing that bothered me most about the show was its tone and pacing. Every single scene is very dramatic and slow. Every single one. Very tense music, long and deep stares, slow movement, a few lines of dialogue, followed by more very intense music and even longer stares and slower movements. I kept thinking \u2018holy mother of god, not every scene needs to feel like it\u2019s the most dramatic moment of the show\u2019. In other words, very slow pacing and not enough tonal shifts.\n\nDid anyone else feel that way?\n\nSome of the character choices were odd and unbelievable.

        "content": "Am I the only one who's Netflix glitches out and constantly doesn't save my place in the episode I was watching? Like for example I'm currently watching North of North and I'll be in the middle of episode 6, pause it, turn the TV off and go back to watch it the next day and it'll start me all over on episode 4 that I hadn't watched in days. Or for example ugly betty if I'm watching that and I go to Netflix to watch it, it won't even be in my watch history and I'll have to search it just to find it and watch it. Netflix is constantly doing this to me on all sorts of shows and movies on phones, laptops and TVs. I pay for Netflix but I have the cheapest tier with commercials. It makes me wonder if these glitches happen to make me try and upgrade?",
