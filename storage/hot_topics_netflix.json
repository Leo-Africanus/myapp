        "content": "What\u2019s up r/netflix! I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

But going into Havoc, my expectations were reset, and I was ready to watch a mindless action movie. \n\nThe intro made me realize what I was in for: was I watching a movie or a video game intro? Everything looked fake, this is a movie that doesn't know how to act like a movie. And that's when Tom Hardy stepped in. An actor that isn't sure how a real human acts. \n\nYes, this movie is stylized and over the top. It's not trying to be realistic, but I think it's supposed to be a video game movie. From the hijacker's neon LED masks to the impossible camera action, this is a video game movie. \n\nBut at the heart is Hardy, whom I'd love to see him play an average Joe, who works as an electrician, but doesn't have a weird accent, a bizarre walk, or looks like he's acting. Because that's all I see now after Capone, Venom, and now Havoc: Tom Hardy is ACTING. But not like real human being. ",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI\u2019ve been testing HDR content on my Xiaomi Pad 6, and I\u2019ve noticed some interesting things while comparing SDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. I wanted to share my experience and hear your thoughts on a few issues I\u2019ve encountered. I\u2019ve had similar experiences with HDR on my LG CX OLED as well, so I\u2019m wondering if this is just how HDR is implemented or if it\u2019s something else.\n\nSDR (Standard Dynamic Range):\nSDR has much better brightness compared to HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. It doesn\u2019t look dim at all, and the brightness feels natural and sharp. The colors are balanced, and overall, it provides a more comfortable viewing experience compared to the HDR formats.\n\nHDR10+ and Dolby Vision:\nHDR10+ and Dolby Vision are supposed to enhance brightness, color, and contrast, but on the Xiaomi Pad 6, both of these look surprisingly dim, especially in comparison to SDR.\n\nDolby Vision in particular appears washed out, with colors lacking vibrancy and saturation. I was expecting much richer colors, but it seems flat and dull. Even HDR10+ feels less bright than I imagined.\n\nA Few Questions I Have:\nWhy are HDR10+ and Dolby Vision versions so dim? I thought HDR content was supposed to have better brightness and contrast.\n\nIs Dolby Vision really a useful feature to have? The feature is hyped up as this premium viewing experience, but when compared to SDR I don\u2019t really see the benefit.\n\nStreaming Issues:\nAlso you can\u2019t turn Dolby Vision or HDR10+ off if you don\u2019t like it. This is pretty frustrating, as I\u2019d prefer to stick with SDR in some cases, but the app forces HDR formats regardless of my preference.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nHonestly, I\u2019m struggling to comprehend why HDR has become so popular and why it\u2019s valued so highly as a premium feature. If it\u2019s supposed to make content brighter and more vibrant, why does it often seem like it\u2019s more of a dim, washed-out experience?\n\n\n",

        "title": "Race for the Crown",
        "content": "Heya!\n\nBinged the series last night and was pleasantly surprised with what I've watched. I am not into horse racing, and generally speaking, do not approve of gambling. That being said I approached the first episode with an open mindset and that if the first 10-20 minutes suck, then I'll just turn it off.\n\nIt started off a bit slow on the horses side and pretty fast on the glamour and glitz side, with lots of great personalities larger than life. The dapper jockey, the self-proclaimed race horse investor, the billionaire (there were a few actually) and a colorful and multi-national cast from the stables. Man, the show runners narrative building game was spot on! I felt like I was right there and then despite knowing nothing about horses, like I mentioned already.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much, so I'm gonna stop talking about what happened in the show, but will leave some notes to compare.\n\n- **Biggest surprise of the season**: Kenny McPeek. Whoa. What a man. What a rock. I did not expect to like him as much as I did by the end of the season. The way he was nonchalantly introduced and the part he played later was astonishing. Kudos to the show runners again.\n\n- **Biggest disappointment of the season**: Michael Iavarone and Frankie Dettori, not because they disappointed me, but because I was very disappointed along them as their endeavors didn't exactly go as planned. Michael grew on me, although the dude is all show.\n\n- **Katie Davis** was adorable. Watch her rip her heart out on camera. \n\n- **Umberto Rispoli** had the most normal/sane and lovely family and I just couldn't help but feel happy for them. It's nice to see someone doing it right in these *interesting* times.\n\n- **Michael Repole**... yeah.\n\n- **Dornoch's team** were so so great and genuine. Loved every single person in there, but especially Jayson Werth's crew (that's how I am referring to his family). I honestly didn't expect to see such a healthy and functional unit until I read that he and his wife go way back to highschool, which explains a lot.\n\nAs a conclusion, I think for me, this show is on par with Full Swing in terms of immersion into the sport, and Tiger King in terms of suspense (just don't look up the results for 2024) and character/narrative building. Really loved it and hoping to see season 2!",

We went through the most recent shows release and they all seemed to be in the top 10 at least for a day in some country. I understand the incentive for Netflix to do so but I was wondering if you have noticed any new show/movie that hasn\u2019t. ",

        "content": "This is better than The Traitors IMO - one of the best social deduction games\n\nI loved that the millionaire had a secret agenda. The Traitors had the traitors do some missions but it was very rare. I wanted more of that and got it in Million Dollar Secret. \n\nI enjoyed the millionaire being rotated so often. It lets you see different strategies from different players.  \n\nThe winner played such a good game, and showed she was strategic in not voting Syd when she had immunity, playing the final round right etc. \n\nI would've been okay with Sam winning too. \n\nCorey...take a shot every time Corey guessed the millionaire incorrectly \ud83d\ude02 he was cool though. \n\nUltimately it was nice to see all of the contestants trying to play strategically. Some of the challenges could be improved (threading needle in the final episode?) but I can say the same for the Traitors. \n\nHoping there's a season 2! What are your thoughts? ",
