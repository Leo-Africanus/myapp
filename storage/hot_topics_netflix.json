Instead of falling into the well where the ball of light (the portal) was, he teleported back to the future (his timeline) by touching the portal while it was in the garden?\n\n(She told Vincent his dad changed after he saw his childhood friend called Red fall into the well and disappeared forever. She also witnessed it too.)\n\nLike, did she know? Did she know that originally, Red fell into the well, but then decided to change the future by not doing it? Hinting the wink in the ending scene? Or at least she was somehow aware Vincent (Red) changed the future? And also, how did they not notice that Vincent looked exactly like his dads childhood friend? (...they don't know he time travelled and was the same person.) Cuz there's gotta be more than just her believing there was something weird with the house, right?\n\nOr am I just overthinking it over a PG-rated series?\n\nTL;DR I'm wondering if Vincent\u2019s aunt knew he was actually Red and that he changed the past. The wink at the end got me thinking that if she aware of the altered timeline and that Vincent was Red?\n\nIt's all speculations and theories, I wanna hear what you guys think!

Some even dope (which is bad, obviously).\nBut Amaia? She goes beyond cheating \u2014 she sabotages people.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to dope to be better.\nIt\u2019s another to literally endanger your teammates just to feel superior.\n\nHer ego is insane:\n- Always needs to be the center of attention.\n- Gave Zoe a hard time for no reason.\n- Treats her \u201cbest friend\u201d Roque like trash.\n- Constantly yells and criticizes instead of motivating her team.\n\nWhen Nuria broke her record, the first thing Amaia thought was \u201cshe must be doping.\u201d Her ego just couldn\u2019t handle being outperformed.\n\nAnd then? She almost drowned a teammate because she didn\u2019t get the info she wanted. Fatima literally had to stop her.

It recommended this movie it was a full length feature and extremely colorful, and for some reason in my mind, it was kind of surrealist/ multi genre. I know that it was taken off Netflix ~10 years ago so this may be a long stretch.\n\nDoes this ring a bell with anybody?

It\u2019s just heartbreaking on every level.\n\nThe neighbor using racial slurs toward the kids is beyond disgusting. There\u2019s no excuse for that \u2014 period.\n\nBut watching the documentary, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was super one-sided. It really pushed a specific story and didn\u2019t even try to explore other angles. For something that\u2019s supposed to be journalism, that\u2019s not great.\n\nHere\u2019s what I kept thinking: what if the neighbor was autistic or had health issues that made her super sensitive to noise and screaming? That\u2019s not something you can control. Ask me how I know. Now imagine kids constantly running around your yard, yelling, leaving trash, and ignoring when you ask them to stop. In pretty much any neighborhood \u2014 even diverse ones \u2014 that would be considered disrespectful. Would you be okay with that? Be honest.\n\nIf you\u2019re repeatedly asking for boundaries and people keep ignoring you, that\u2019s incredibly frustrating. The doc didn\u2019t show what happened before things blew up either \u2014 for all we know, she could\u2019ve tried to be friendly at first.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s been through a sexual assault, I also get how unsafe it can feel when someone\u2019s pounding on your door at any time of day, let alone at night. If she had trauma, that could\u2019ve easily triggered panic. The cop\u2019s \u201cjeez\u201d reaction just made her out to be unstable right away. Like dude, you showed up at night \u2014 what reaction were you expecting?\n\nCould she have moved? Maybe, but maybe she couldn\u2019t afford to. And let\u2019s be real \u2014 older, childless women living alone often get painted as \u201ccrazy.\u201d That stereotype is so misogynistic and lazy.\n\nI guess my main issue is how the documentary completely flattens the story. It makes it look black and white when real life is almost never that simple.\n\nLet me be clear: it\u2019s not okay to throw stuff at kids or to use racist language against anyone, and especially children. But it\u2019s also not okay to ignore someone\u2019s personal space or call them crazy for wanting peace and quiet. And \u201cthey\u2019re just kids\u201d doesn\u2019t make it fine.\n\nIf you step back and take race out of it for a second, the whole situation feels a lot more complex. Netflix really leaned into the race angle when in reality, this could happen in any kind of neighborhood.",
