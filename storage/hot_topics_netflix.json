I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

I'm just seeing 14 games? They're all really horrible, and seem to be intended for a much younger audience (what made Netflix think I'd enjoy these based on my viewing history?). \n\nOne of the games was literally intended to help very young readers. Each level consists of walking on top of the text for a 1\\~3 sentences story, and interacting with a few of the words along the way.\n\nMost of what I tried (5-6) all seemed like something a 3rd year computer science student did for a project-class over a quarter. They're taking up the second row as well as the background feature at the top. Seems like a really poor landing page experience.",

Set in 50 BC, it follows the adventures of a small village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. The titular hero, Asterix, is a diminutive but cunning warrior who, alongside his loyal, super-strong friend Obelix, defends their village with wit, bravery, and a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, granting temporary superhuman strength. Obelix, perpetually strong due to falling into the potion as a child, carries a menhir and loves wild boar and brawls.The series blends slapstick humor, clever wordplay, and historical satire, poking fun at Roman bureaucracy and cultural stereotypes while celebrating Gaulish camaraderie. Each album sees Asterix and Obelix embark on quests\u2014whether thwarting Caesar\u2019s schemes, exploring foreign lands like Britain or Egypt, or protecting their village from internal strife. The comics are renowned for their vibrant art, memorable characters like the tone-deaf bard Cacofonix, and timeless appeal across generations. Translated into over 100 languages, Asterix remains a cultural icon with comic books fans around the world!",

But once it became clear that she actually cared about him, I started liking her again. What bothered me though was how she seemed to lose herself along the way. She started off strong but kind of got lost in the middle, which was a little disappointing.\n\nThat said, I still thought she was the kind of character who kept you curious, like you wanted to know more about her. She knew how to flirt, knew what to say in the right moments. Her dynamic with Joe, especially in the beginning when they first started getting closer, was really intriguing to me.

Without the extra home fee. Why? No idea. Yes, I visit   \nall the time, but I don't sign into Netflix on my phone. So who knows how.\n\nHere's the thing. \n\nI can watch it on my laptop.  But, no thanks. I DO have a smart TV. Ok, cool. No problem. I sign into netflix on the TV and.....it works for a little then tells me I am not the main home. Ok. fine. I guess. But then how can I watch it on my laptop. \n\nI have a better idea, Netflix. If youre letting me watch at my location, ditch the damn laptop and let me watch on the TV. \n\nHas ANYONE run into this? Or am I just lucky and unlucky at the same time? I COULD pay for an extra \"home\", just so I can watch it on my tv 10 feet in the other room, I guess haha ",

        "content": "I found it a really easy, light hearted, comedy show about a group of friends. It's not my usual style but I thought it was refreshing and nice to see lots of cool actors in one show.\n\nIt all got a bit dark when Nick died, OMG? I wondered if Steve Carrell already said he wouldn't film any more seasons so they killed him off. What a turn! But I guess his character was a bit messy, an older man leaving his wife for a younger model, and Anne also confirmed in the show that he cheated on her. I didn't feel as though the cheating confirmation was taken seriously enough, and was swept under the rug by the group and not really acknowledged. Just me? \n\nIt was nice to see Steve brought some Michael Scott humour vibes to Nick, if you know you know!\n\nFinally, my favourite was Domingo Coleman, I thought he was so sassy and funny, my favourite little scene was when they were all taking a photo with Ginny, and the photos would sync to Anne's iPad so he told everyone to pose like they aren't having a good time. And he's the only one doing it! \n\nFinally, a shout out to Anne for dealing with so much and trying to not let her hurt feelings turn to hatred towards Ginny and also reminding her and Nicks daughter that Ginny was a person.\n\nSo will they make a new season?\n\n ",
