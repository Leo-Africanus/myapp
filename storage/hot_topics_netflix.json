        "content": "My wife and I have been slow-binging This Is Us (1-2 episodes/night) on Hulu. I recently realized it's also on Netflix and since we already have Netflix and have nothing else to watch on Hulu currently, we're canceling Hulu. But when we switched to watching it on Netflix the 30-second \"previously on This Is Us\" recap no longer plays. It always played on Hulu. When we didn't feel like watching it, it was very easy to skip by pressing the \"forward 10 seconds\" button a couple times, but I found it nice to watch if we took a break from the show or when they brought back characters/storylines from several episodes or seasons back. \n\nI've clicked through the settings and can't find a way to get it to play. I also searched on this sub. In one post from 3 years ago someone said \"it's in trailers and more at the bottom of the episode list.\" I scrolled to the bottom of the episode list and there is nothing that says trailers and more. In another post from a year ago, someone said to toggle the \"watch from the beginning\" setting. I couldn't find that setting, and furthermore, when I googled how to find it, I found several other posts about it that said the actual function of that setting is (was?) to reset your watch history on a show so that it starts from the first episode of the first season again. That's not what I want to do.\n\nIf there is a setting that works in 2025 to cause the recap to play at the beginning of each episode let me know",

        "content": "I was excited to watch EMILIA PEREZ tonight and resubbed to Netflix for the first time in a while. \n\nI only watch things on my PC Desktop (high-end machine, fiber connection). For years I was able to get a great bitrate (8+ Mbps) by using their Win 11 desktop app. I seemed to recall they'd lowered their computer-streaming bitrate recently so I chose to get the most expensive plan, thinking maybe if I opted for the 4k version it would give me a higher bitrate while streaming to PC. It did not. \n\nEMILIA PEREZ came through at 2.5Mbps. \n\n(insert grey death suffering meme guy). \n\nI gave it 25 mins of low-bitrate nonsense before I fired up \\[an alternate viewing option\\]. I'm writing this as I wait the 15 mins for it to download.\n\nI'm still happy to give Netflix my money for the month. I *want* to pay them for content that I want to watch. I want that content to get my views. But for some reason Netflix decided to *regress* in quality (I believe this bitrate downgrade came right around COVID, similar to Google removing the ability to play owned movies on YouTube.) At least we'll always have Apple - supporting 21:9 monitor-owners since 2010. \n\nI'm not going to ask: \"Why do they do this?\". I know. You know. It's because we don't matter, and they don't care. The amount of people who watch Netflix exclusively on PCs is probably 0.0001% of their user base and we're not worth catering to. That makes sense. I just wish they figured out some way for their service to be able to feed us a higher bitrate stream of their content. I get that people who own TVs probably don't notice or care about bitrate, but computer-streaming people would. ",

I have also tested from a 4K Google TV and several phones, Android and iOS, the results are very similar. Poor picture quality. I have also tested different connection types from different locations,\n\nOver the past five years i have noticed a very steep decline in quality, especially on older titles and titles that \"aren't hot\". I know why, it's the amount of data, both sending, receiving and storing. It's expensive, and thats why I was willing to pay almost 40 dollars monthly.\n\nI am on the 4k package, I'm paying through my teeth for a crisp image, and they deliver this gritty, lumpy, pixelated picture on my devices? \n\nNetflix should take a look at why, besides volume of content, people keep using the service.\n\nThey should use qualified people to check the algorithmic content they're spewing out, and have better standards for picture quality. \nThis is unacceptable!\n\nI don't even have to share a picture, you can just check for yourself.\n\nEdit:\nEdited to remove a part I wrote about poor quality of content because it took focus away from my main point. Which is the steep decline in picture quality, especially on older movies and shows on their service.",

        "content": "Anyone have any news if they plan on increasing the speed on playback ? if its going to stay 1.5x while other platform is offering 2x and 3-4x ... im thinking to unsubscribe as i realised i using it less and less, normally i go in, watch some episode then change website to watch further as they talked to slowly for me...\n\nbeen using it for years and so far i love it on the profile, on the suggestions and list, and how it continues off whenever you left off that is what i love the best. but the slow talking is getting on my nerves and i lose concentration cant stay and focus on the show... end up dropping it or switching to another platform because i will want to know what happens. or it gets too slow and i say i comeback next time i throw it in the lazy watch bin....\n\nbeen using it for i think since it started in Singapore.. and my plan is the max plan now with +2 user extended (i have to msg people too waste time to keep track on payment or i pay for everyone...) so if not worth my time anymore i thinking if i should just one less thing to do and pay..",

        "content": "Hey guys, I\u2019m new to Reddit and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m completely phrasing this question right but I\u2019m hoping I can find an answer. Basically I have one primary account thats under my \u201csisters email\u201d. Under that email, is three profiles, mine, my brother-in-law\u2018s, and my nieces.\n\nThe secondary account, which is under my email, is the additional account so it is limited to only \u201cone profile\u201d. And the profile attached to that account is my sisters.\n\nSo basically the issue is I need to swap the profile assigned under my sister\u2019s email address (the main account) with my profile on the secondary account.\n\nI called up Netflix and they said there was no way to do this, but I just don\u2019t buy that as an answer. If anyone has any advice or input at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

        "content": "So I know Charlize Theron herself said (and I think I heard it from others I concede in the project as well) that a major reason for the delay is that Netflix leadership changed and blah blah blah. The longer this delay continues, the more I think that\u2019s bullshit. I dno what the real issue is, but if that\u2019s what happened, how come it didn\u2019t affect any other Netflix shows/movies? Everything else seems to be relatively on track. \n\nAlso, the last I heard was that the movie was possibly being moved to 2026 now! Im not sure how legit that is though. If it is, what is the issue? At this rate, I\u2019m betting they won\u2019t be making any more after this one finally releases. IF it releases. I\u2019m starting to doubt we will ever get it at this point.\n\nLastly, I was super surprised that the sub for this movie has less than 700 followers. I was going to post there, but that sub is not very active. \n\nSo my questions to all of you:\n\nDo you think the change in leadership was the actual issue? I know there were multiple issues, but, other than the strikes, this seems to be the one that they cite specifically as delaying them. \n\nDoes anybody have any concrete information on a possible release date? Is it really possibly going to 2026? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

        "content": "I'm not sure what happened, I have a Netflix account with 3 profiles. One of them was made into an extra member a year ago for a SmartTV in another location.\n\nStarting 2 days ago the app keeps asking for a SMS verification, the profile isn't an extra member anymore and the slot is empty. How do I restore this and why did this happen ? I don't want to make an extra Netflix account, can't I use the other profile like I did for the past year ?",
