        "content": "Minor spoilers ahead!! \n\nI'm pissed at the reaction to thos show; it feels like a lot of people hate on it because they think it's piggybacking off of Squid Game, and I really don't feel that way. Squid Game was cool but it didn't really have substance to me, it felt like a game for the most part, it felt like that's what the showrunners treated it as. \n\nBut The 8 Show, *I* believe, has such a fucking fantastic message that ot portrays so beautifully. I think the cruelty of 8th Floor and 6th actually shows you what it's like being in the shoes of someone poor going up against someone rich. I think 4th floor and 5th floor being 'slaves' to the upper floors, and, somewhat by choice, not helping the lower floors is also fucking spot on. The lower floors stick together -- except one of them really needs the money, and will do *anything* to get it, including hurting the people around them. \n\nI was bothered by some plot holes, but i can explain things like 2nd locking them all up by... Well, they didn't want more time, but now that they have it... And 5th being naive and delusional makes sense, too, to me at least. Lots of whacky shit, but it's so raw and intense that I think it did its job well. \n\nAnd with the ending, I think it tied things up well. I did NOT like the games, I did NOT like the brutality, as a matter of fact I was so disturbed i cried at some parts and the only reason i didn't skip things was cuz i didn't wanna miss story, or miss the emotions that came from things like 3 fucking HOME RUNNING 1'S HEAD. \n\nChills.\n\nIt's not for everyone. But I've been poor all my life, and i have had a lot of friends and family in different places. All the different systems of hierarchy and power that are put in place is what gets people killed. As an anarchist and anti-capitalist, the message resonated with me, not manhy shows or movies I've seen capture just how genuinely brutal and uncaring the *systems* are while somehow making sure to keep every character somewhat empathetic or understandable. Except 8. Fuck 8. \n\nGreat show, the hate is undeserved, i don't think it's really about the story so much as what it's trying to tell you. ",

It recieves PCM only, so i have the TV set to that, and even if i choose stereo in netflix, its unusable, at maximum volume, there is absolutely no way one could make out peopls voices, subtitles are required.   \nThis si so incredibly stupid for a time nearly 30 years after the year 2000. Humans are suypposed to get more inteligent, but this stupid nonsense, is destroying the entertainment industry. Yes, its THAT bad,. Ive searched the web, and found no asnwers, onyl countless individuals wiht teh same heartache.  \nSo here I am, telling netflix on a reddit cahnnel, they should remix the entirer catalogue and reupload it, remastered, wiht a vocal boost audio option.  \nI dont think anyone wiht enough brain capacity or intellect would read this though,. the onyl solution is if im somehow going to find myself working for Netflix and fix it myself.\n\nThis is nto a user or hardware issue. The moxies have been uploaded with 5.1 or stereo withi the vocals (center channel) too low. Simple as that.",
