They definitely left us on a cliffhanger, and I\u2019m curious if anyone else thinks Netflix will renew it for another season?\n\nI really hope they do. There\u2019s still so much to explore with the characters, and I\u2019d love to see more of Cam\u2019s journey as a gay man in the Marines. His character development has been one of the most interesting parts of the show. That said, Netflix can be unpredictable when it comes to renewals (I\u2019m still not over Mindhunter, The Society, and 1899 being canceled). Plus, with the Pentagon\u2019s criticism of the show, I worry Netflix might shy away from continuing it.\n\nStill, Boots was genuinely excellent and absolutely deserves a season 2. What do you all think?",

I remember playing out in the village I was raised in as a child, and there was always one weird house where a scary adult would live. You and your friends would all avoid them at all costs, but sometimes a ball would just go into their garden by accident or you'd just be existing and they'd make your life a misery when they came out, etc. I forgot how scary that used to be as a child and this documentary really reminded me of that fear and power imbalance of an adult making you feel that way when you are just playing and having fun outdoors which should be such a magical part of childhood. I knew something horrible was going to happen in this situation of course, but for some reason I didn't think it would be such a cruel and barbaric murder like that for some reason. Yes, the lady is definitely mean, racist, angry and a nasty bully, but for her to take the life of that wonderful lady and mother, and leave those babies motherless just absolutely broke my heart, I just didn't see it coming. All of that loss and hurt over something minor. One minute they had their lovely mother just advocating for her children and defending them like she had every right to do so, and then next minute she was gone. Her life was lost, and those poor children of hers will never feel the same again. All over that evil lady, who had years to just go live somewhere else if she wasn't happy in a family neighbourhood.\n\nI don't know. It's just really broken my heart. It's just so senseless. ",

        "content": "Just watched The Perfect Neighbor and I have to say what a gripping story it was. Along with that, I've seen many comments piling hate onto Susan but after doing a little unbiased reflection, I feel like we're missing the crucial aspects of the story.\n\nLook, it's clear that the show depicts Susan as this overtly sensitive, schizophrenic, person with no tolerance towards her neighbors. The show does really well in trying to frame her character poorly, and of course this is done in an intentional way. The show includes all the instances where she repeatedly called the police for ,seemingly, \"small\" matters where the kids where causing a nuisance on her property. It also makes sure to include scenes where the police were not on her side and called her a \"psycho\". Plus, there's that random scene where she rams into a fence in a closed-off area (totally unrelated to the plot) but clearly just to paint her as mentally deranged. Of course, all of this builds to the mom being shot.\n\nIt's clear Susan Lorincz didn't have the straightest head in town. She was an elderly widow, who mostly kept in solitude and was eager to protect her peace and her rights. From the facts, not every single issue she raised was legally right but many were. Sure, there may have been better ways she could've handled the trespassing, but being in her position, it's easier said than done.\n\nWhen the show so blatantly paints Susan in a horrible light, it becomes so easy for us to overlook the real problem: the parents of the kids. There were countless occasions where the kids were trespassing and leaving their belongings on Susan's property despite the numerous prior arguments. The kids can't be blamed - kids will be kids. But what were the parents doing during this entire fiasco? Not a single one of them stepped up to parent their kids and teach them not to cross boundaries with this potentially unstable woman. Instead, all of them huddled together and kept spewing this narrative of \"Oh, everyone hates this lady. She screams at everyone's kids\". After each event, any reasonably minded parent would have told their kid to keep their distance for their safety (as they even complained that she might hurt their children) but instead they did nothing, except make Susan the scapegoat for their lack of apathy. In the end, because everything was unchecked and left to escalate further and further without any address, a mother died.\n\nTruly, I feel the only true victims here are those poor kids. They were just caught in the crossfire, in a completely avoidable situation, solely due to their parents' staggering incompetence. Despite countless incidents, they were still left unguided and unprotected through no fault of their own; and this lead to a death where they were the ones to pay the price.",

        "content": "Idk how accurate the portrayal of Marine boot camp is but they did an amazing job of character development. They did a great job of addressing toxic masculinity, how men struggle with sexuality in the armed forces at any age, how young kids struggle with figuring out who they are and their purpose, loss, relationship dynamics and much more. Kudos to Netflix- can\u2019t wait to read the book. ",
