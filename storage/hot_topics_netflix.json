Now at the end of the second episode, I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ll be removing this show from my list. Suddenly the whole thing became a televangelist prime time, which, when we\u2019ve literally mentioned several times already that this show is live for the whole world to see, to me became very tone deaf. I don\u2019t care what kind of religion you practice, as long as you don\u2019t shove it in my face and especially if you\u2019re gonna try to convert me I\u2019m hella out.

I'd like to watch Netflix, but not only is it difficult to filter out content warnings, they don't necessarily cover everything or are vague. I'll probably do exposure therapy, but it'll probably be a while and in the meantime I need really gentle things. I don't want to just limit myself to kid's movies though.\n\nList of triggers: asphyxiation, asthma attacks/shortness of breath/wheezing, choking, coughing fits, EMTs, CPR, weird blue/purple skin coloration(confusing sorry) and cerebral palsy (sorry, also hard to explain but it was kind of part of the process), lung issues in general,  and to a lesser extent funerals, grief, dying. Ironically I could watch Sweeney Todd no problem, so I guess unrealistic bloody deaths are okay, plus that one was actually kind of validating in a weird way.\n\nMaybe I can find a list somewhere, and I know it's hard to remember what movies do and don't have these things without having those triggers yourself. My current comfort movie is Napoleon Dynamite which I could technically watch over and over, but I'd like some other options.\n\n\\*edit: I'd also like to stay away from romantic movies for now\n\nThank you!!",

There\u2019s four lines of metadata with the minutes and the megs, and the codecs etc. in the top left corner of shows that I have not had metadata on them for four seasons.  What happened. It\u2019s about the fifth time that has happened and nothing I can do seems to get rid of it. I\u2019ve tried logging out. I\u2019ve tried turning off my television. I\u2019ve tried selecting different shows and I keep getting annoying metadata.  Why is that? What can I do to fix it?",

You\u2019re talking &gt;!peeling the face back and re-arranging fragments of bone to \u2018fit\u2019 back together, and weaving veins into a foot?!!&lt; \n\nI already had a deep appreciation of the NHS and experience with emergency surgery myself, but this just renewed it to another level. Following those stories, the families\u2026 and then the Drs\u2019 absolute focus and coordination. So much respect. \n\nHaven\u2019t finished it yet but couldn\u2019t wait to post about it.
