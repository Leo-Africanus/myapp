But the more I\u2019ve learned since then, the scarier part isn\u2019t just the manipulation and it's all about the data that's everywhere.  \n  \nYour phone number, your email, even your address history  all of it is floating around. The Social Dilemma scratched the surface because I feel it's much scarier real life. (that thing about what google knows about you is actually terrifying). I can\u2019t help but think a real sequel would be less about screen addiction and more about how our entire identities are already being bought and sold in the background.  \n  \nHas anyone else felt that paranoia spike after realizing the real problem isn\u2019t the apps on your phone, it\u2019s the invisible network of companies that already own your information?",

Every other device I try it on works fine and I can watch there, just not my PC for whatever reason. It worked in the past, I checked my history and I was able to use it as recently as last month, but now it just doesn't.\n\n  \nI've tried clearing my cookies, cache, all of my browser settings and history, tried opening it on Chrome, Edge, and even downloaded and tried the Netflix app from the Microsoft store, tried a fresh install, enabling experimental flags to see if it was an html5 issue, changed my DNS, allowing DRM content to be played through my browser settings, updated, deleted, and re-updated my Widevine component, shutdown and restarted my PC multiple times. Nothing.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely nothing is working to get it to play on my PC and I cannot figure out why. I'm at my wit's end with it since I've been trying on and off to fix it for a week now, and every other search I come across either tells me how to fix Error Code 1003 instead of 1290, or even how to fix it for Linux or Vivaldi users. Can I get any help at all as to how this can be fixed or even a clue into the right direction?",

Do you believe it to be generally accurate, was some things overdramatized, etc?\n\nAlso, RIP to Gabby. She really did seem like a sweet girl who believed in the best of others and I hate when abusers like Brian take advantage of that. I\u2019ve been there and thank my stars I didn\u2019t cross paths with someone like Brian.",
