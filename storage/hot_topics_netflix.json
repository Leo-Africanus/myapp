        "title": "I liked Wayward and I don't understand the criticism",
        "content": "The series premiered exactly a week ago, I watched it, and I enjoyed it. I didn't once think the actors were bad, a criticism I've seen a couple of times in reddit discussions. I was also very surprised by how they managed to make the dialogue between Leila and Abbie sound realistic and natural compared to how they've made teenagers speak in other Netflix shows, and I appreciated that.\n\nI definitely have no experience in entertainment criticism or analysis; the only way I judge whether the acting was good or bad is how much I believe the actors, and therefore how much I can focus on the plot. This is, of course, very subjective, but the only time I felt a little disconnected from the plot was with Abbie's father. I didn't fully believe his character's outburst or his overall persona, but I don't think he had more than 15 minutes of screen time, and I don't consider it \"bad\" acting\u2014just less compelling. I truly don\u2019t think this show had \"bad actors\".\u00a0\n\nI think most of the criticism I\u2019ve read comes from people that aren\u2019t the show's target audience, which, from my perspective, seems to stem from their personal biases against queer people or from not connecting with or relating to the show's theme, which is intergenerational trauma and how it can cause children, teens, and eventually adults to feel the weight of their parents' unresolved grief or trauma, resulting in deep guilt and a sense of being \"bad kids\", even before they\u2019ve developed a moral compass or an integral sense of self.\u00a0\n\nAs for the protagonist, I can\u2019t thank Mae Martin enough for the representation they gave the trans community in this series. I\u2019ll save that aspect of this review for another subreddit though, as I have read very ignorant and rude comments regarding Mae Martin\u2019s character, Alex, and I hope to minimize that aspect of the discussion in this post.\u00a0\n\nI think the show does an incredible job of showing that there are no \"bad kids,\" but rather they are a direct result of their environment and the extremes parents or families go to in order to \"cope\" with their children, rather than working on themselves or simply trying to connect with them from a place of love, understanding, and empathy. I think all parents should go to therapy at least a few times, which I recognize is a statement that stems from and leads to something much deeper from a historical, sociopolitical, and evolutionary perspective. But, I think many parents should have gone to therapy before having children, and the series does a great job of taking that feeling and amplifying it to a psychological thriller level, while also depicting the dangers of retreats, programs, and poorly researched and unethical therapeutic methods for minors.\n\nOne of Sydney Topliffe's (Abbie) lines from Episode 1, \"When you had kids, what the f\\*\\*\\* did you imagine it would be like?\" that she says to her dad in an outburst, really struck me. I think it captures the incomprehension and frustration that so many children and teenagers feel: \"Why did my parents even have kids?\" Meaning, \"Why did this person or these people bring me into the world only to make me feel every day that they wish they hadn't?\" or \u201cDid they create an idea or expectation of children and family, if any, in their heads that I'm not living up to, or do they simply not like me as a person?\u201d Even though it could never be the kid\u2019s fault truly, they are made to feel as though it is. Another line that captures this sentiment is Toni Collete's (Evelyn) line in Episode 7: \"Birth is... nonconsensual.\"\u00a0\n\nI've also seen criticism that there are plot holes. I finished the series today, and I can't say with complete certainty that I found any plot holes per se, but I did feel that some things were left \u201cup in the air\u201d. For example, I think some character's subplots felt a bit rushed; it would have been interesting to know more about many of them (e.g., Riley and Maurice), but I also understand that it's a miniseries and covers topics that could give much more screen time in order for them to thrive.\n\nAs for the toads (I think cane toads), I do think they're simply symbolic. They're an invasive species that has taken over the town, and in one way or another, they're everywhere, just like Evelyn. Depending on the culture, they also represent different things, such as fertility and abundance, transformation and rebirth, healing and purification, among others (Logan, 2024). All of the articles I found about toad and frog symbolism can be closely associated with the series, including those that presented a negative and evil interpretation of frogs and toads, as most of the characters have different or opposite perspectives of Evelyn, many having both throughout the series and their character's development. Also, I'm sure the show implies that the toads have a role in the making of the drug used on the graduates, which isn't so far fetched in a science-y fiction way as there are psychedelic amphybians. The fact that the phase is called \"The Leap\", is probably also a play on the fact that frogs jump or \"leap\" from one place to another. I also think it could symbolize the term \"leapfrog\", which according to Cambridge Dictionary, can also be used as a verb to describe: \"to improve your position by going past other people quickly or by missing out some stages\". Maybe this could be interpreted as wanting to heal and become your new self with Evelyn's drug quickly, without going through a much longer process of healing and learning to live with your trauma, by facing your past, yourself and others, but that could just be a personal interpretation.\n\nI also read some reviews that said the series dragged on too long, something I personally disagree with. I think almost every aspect of the series contributed to the plot and deserves analysis from an entertainment perspective, but also from a psychological one. If anything, I sometimes felt it was fast paced and I hope they decide to renew for a second season.\n\nIn the future, I would love to rewatch this series with even more attention to detail, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it has incredible potential, I hope Mae Martin takes up more production and acting roles as well.",

        "content": "It was really nice to see the kids come from Toronto. I\u2019m Canadian and I could understand these teenagers. We don\u2019t really have reform schools here. I think they were banned. We made conversion therapy illegal a few years ago. So sending young girls to America is plausible.  \n\nI completely remember having a sketchy friend for a ride. He had a car like that. The whole scene where ditches Lelie is on point. Sketchy guys were never far behind. But she does make it across the border. That\u2019s some guts without back up. \n\nI kept watching because that griped me. I was a fucked up Canadian teenager. I\u2019d be terrified in the states. You don\u2019t have the same laws and I would feel much more in danger. This to me more of harrowing tale just from that perspective.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t like Mae Martin I find that disheartening. They he/she wrote an award winning show called \u2018Feel Good\u2019 for Netflix a few years back. It\u2019s all about how hard it is be different and hurting inside. I think it was very good and taught me a lot about Trans people. I was glad to see Netflix give them another show. \n\n\n\n",

I sat through the whole thing and binged without any skips, but I wished I did, or at least watched it in a faster speed. I saw a lot of people having so many questions after watching, and I get it. I feel the same way too, and how I truly wish it could've been a movie instead. not the best series, but it's dragging me to watch it enough even though with a very loose thread. interesting concept though!",

        "title": "If Wyler Had Their Own Episode in Season 3\u2026\ud83d\udda4",
        "content": "Here are two pictures, the first is fan-made (credit: @viviwonders01 on TikTok), and the second is from the show. Had to include both to set the mood.\n\n\nOkay, I can\u2019t stop thinking about Wyler, so I pulled together my dream scenes for Season 3. These are just fan ideas (no S2 spoilers), not in order, just the moments I\u2019d die to see between them.\n\nScene 1: Jealousy Sparks \u2013 First Encounter (Final Version)\nWednesday is tracking Enid through the woods when she stumbles upon a remote encampment, a hideout for Hydes. She stops dead when she sees Tyler among them. He\u2019s older, harder, but those eyes are unmistakable.\nWednesday (cold, guarded): \u201cYou\u2019re the last person I expected to find here.\u201dTyler (half-smirk, but there\u2019s a flicker of something softer): \u201cGuess the woods like throwing surprises.\u201d\nHe steps closer, voice low.Tyler: \u201cI can help you find Enid.\u201dWednesday (flat): \u201cHow could I possibly trust you?\u201d\nTyler doesn\u2019t answer immediately. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a Hyde pack member approaching to give Wednesday directions. He watches the man speak to her, muscles in his jaw tightening, jealousy flickering with something darker.\nInside Tyler\u2019s head: That guy. And a hundred others. They\u2019re all better for her than me. I\u2019ll never deserve her, not after what I\u2019ve done. But I\u2019m not letting anyone else have her.\nTyler\u2019s hand brushes a pot plant on the table. With a sudden flick, it crashes to the ground.Tyler (dry, almost mocking): \u201cMy hand slipped.\u201d\nThe Hyde lingers a moment too long, and Tyler\u2019s eyes darken.Tyler (voice even lower, dangerous): \u201cWho does he think he is? You\u2019re mine, Little Braids.\u201dWednesday (smirking, arching an eyebrow): \u201cIs that\u2026 jealousy?\u201dTyler (smile fading, eyes dark): \u201cJealousy doesn\u2019t begin to cover it.\u201dWednesday (quiet, but cutting): \u201cThen stop looking at me like I\u2019m yours, Tyler. That\u2019s not how you earn your way back.\u201d\n\nScene 2: The Woods, North of the Canadian BorderEnid is missing in her wolf form. Wednesday won\u2019t stop searching, and Tyler refuses to let her go alone.\nTyler: \u201cShe said the woods would always keep me safe. Feels like they\u2019ve turned on me.\u201dWednesday: \u201cThe woods don\u2019t betray. People do. Trees are indifferent, like me. Learn from them if you want to survive.\u201dTyler: \u201cTrust you to turn survival into poetry.\u201d\n\nScene 3: The Angry Love ConfessionWhen someone insults Wednesday, Tyler loses control. His fury spills into the truth he\u2019s been hiding.\nTyler: \u201cSay it again and I\u2019ll bury you for it.\u201dWednesday: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201dTyler: \u201cOf course I did. Because I love you. You\u2019ve haunted me since the day we met. Whether you accept it or not, you\u2019re mine, Little Braids. I only have eyes for you.\u201d\nWednesday (after a beat, low voice): \u201cPossession doesn\u2019t scare me, Tyler. It excites me\u2026 and if I\u2019m being honest with myself, I\u2019ve thought about saying your name when I shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re a danger I can\u2019t resist\u2026 my Monster.\u201d\n\ud83d\udc8b Their kiss is sharp, dark, inevitable.\n\nScene 4: Wednesday\u2019s Narration\u201cLove is a disease I thought I\u2019d never catch. Feelings expose you, weaken you. But Tyler saw everything I swore to bury. And despite every reason not to\u2026 I love him. Without him, every day feels hollow.\u201d\n\nScene 5: Tyler\u2019s Grief &amp; ApologyTyler: \u201cYou\u2019re the only one left who really sees me. And I can\u2019t lose you too.\u201dWednesday: \u201cPathetic. You sound like every grieving soul clawing at the dirt.\u201dTyler: \u201cI don\u2019t deserve forgiveness. But I need to know one day you\u2019ll give it to me\u2026 or I\u2019ll never stop hating myself.\u201dWednesday (quiet, firm): \u201cDon\u2019t beg for forgiveness. Earn it. And if you do\u2026 maybe I\u2019ll let you keep me.\u201d\n\nScene 6: Favourite TortureTyler: \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of pain I\u2019d bleed for.\u201dWednesday: \u201cThe kind you won\u2019t survive.\u201dTyler: \u201cThen let me die happy\u2026 in your hands.\u201dWednesday: \u201cCareful, Tyler. I enjoy making promises like that come true.\u201d\n\nScene 7: Kidnapping/DangerIf Wednesday is captured:Tyler: \u201cTouch her and you\u2019re already dead.\u201dWednesday: \u201cWednesday Addams doesn\u2019t die, Tyler. I\u2019ll write your eulogy before my own.\u201d\nIf Tyler is trapped:Tyler: \u201cYou could\u2019ve left me. But you didn\u2019t.\u201dWednesday: \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t. Because monsters deserve someone who won\u2019t run.\u201d\n\nScene 8: Wednesday Takes ControlAfter betrayal, Tyler submits to Wednesday\u2019s lead. The power shift only makes their bond sharper, darker, and undeniable.\n\nScene 9: Proving HimselfTyler protects Enid, then later risks his life for Wednesday\u2019s family. In doing so, he finally proves he deserves a place at her side.\n\nScene 10: Gothic Romance Moments\n* A kiss to the haunting sound of Wrong by Chris Grey.\n* A Phantom of the Opera dance, starting with Tyler kissing her hand.\n* Wednesday finds a hidden sketch of herself in Tyler\u2019s notebook. Proof she\u2019s consumed him too.\n\nScene 11 (The Unspoken Truth \u2013 updated):\nTyler: \u201cTell me the real reason you missed.\u201dWednesday (quiet, almost a whisper): \u201cBecause even I can\u2019t help caring for someone like you. Even when I wish I didn\u2019t. It eats me alive that I still care for you. You\u2019re someone I shouldn\u2019t care for. I never get eaten alive, Tyler. Other people get eaten alive by me.\u201dTyler (smirking, but there\u2019s pain behind it): \u201cThen hate me forever. At least it means you\u2019ll never forget me.\u201dWednesday (soft, almost dangerous): \u201cI don\u2019t forget monsters, Tyler. I study them. And one day\u2026 I decide what to do with them.\u201d\n\nScene 12: Choosing Her Over the PackTyler: \u201cYou think she\u2019s not worth it? She\u2019s worth more than every secret you\u2019re hiding. She\u2019s worth everything. I\u2019m choosing her. You never mattered.\u201dWednesday: \u201cFinally, the Hyde made one smart decision. Don\u2019t make me regret it.\u201dTyler: \u201cI won\u2019t. Not when it\u2019s you, Little Braids.\u201d\n\nBonus Scene: The CaveSearching for Enid, they get trapped inside a cave. By torchlight, Wednesday carves sharp symbols into the stone while Tyler watches.Tyler: \u201cYou make even the dead feel alive.\u201dFor a heartbeat, she almost lets herself smile.\nBonus Scene: Featherweight in My ArmsWednesday stretches for something just out of reach, and Tyler swoops in, gripping her waist to lift her effortlessly.Tyler: \u201cYou weigh nothing in my arms\u2026 like a feather.\u201dHer eyes widen for just a second at his arms and abs before she quickly looks away.\nWhich of these moments would you want to see most in Season 3?
