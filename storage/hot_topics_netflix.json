But we're both from Toronto and thought it was cool the director was from there. I myself like art as well.\n\nAfter watching film, it was easy to follow, fun movie. Not heavy on plotline but animations, colours, music was pretty awesome.\n\nLooking into the history and BTS of the film was what really caught me (hence sharing article). So much respect for the teamwork, thought and intention.\n\nFelt like it's a milestone for many of us who didn't make it in something but the alternative path brought us towards something we'd never imagined. Overcoming our battles and demons and bringing in a new version of ourselves.\n\nSo glad for this film's success and everyone involved \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nP.s. yes you should watch this masterpiece \ud83d\udc4c",

Like, \u201chey, the world isn\u2019t gonna end if this embarrassing thing exists.\u201d\n\nAnd Netflix has nailed this: some of their best comedies are hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time, showing how humor can live right next to grief, awkwardness, or chaos.\n\nSo yeah, call it what you want, but for some of us, dark comedy is therapy in disguise.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR: Laughing at pain makes it lighter.

It made me wonder how much easier it would be today with everything being online.\n\nBack then you had to forge documents and physically be somewhere to make the scam work. Now with social media, data leaks and people oversharing, you could probably impersonate someone you have never met just by piecing together public information. Name, address, phone number, old photos, even their signature if they have posted it somewhere (I myself have never changed my phone number or email, I imagine I'm in every database online). The scary part is how official everything can look. A scammer could set up fake accounts, fake email domains, fake phone numbers, and most people would not even think twice if the message looked professional. If someone had enough of your personal data they could probably pass as you with your bank, insurance, or even your employer. That's why I'm using Cloaked just to stay safe because I'm spiraling into all of this modern day privacy stuff and it's scaryyy. \n\nI know there is places you can buy data but is there any software or method to help with this stuff? I'd like to know your opinions or advice.",

As in, it didn\u2019t matter who was or wasn\u2019t the millionaire throughout.\n\nZERO tactics required until the end game. Just a popularity vote in reality and clutching at straws. \n\nOverly sexualised, this is coming from a heterosexual male here too. It\u2019s like the producers brainstormed what makes TV popular and they\u2019d all been watching Love Island etc.. Absolutely no need for the abundance of bikini shots, the shots of girls running from behind in said bikinis or the choice of clothes for the \u201claser beam\u201d task. I\u2019m all for having attractive people on TV, nothing wrong with a bit of eye candy, but this seemed so forced and unnecessary?\n\nWhat would I change:\n\nSome form of jeopardy for getting / not getting a millionaire out. For instance, every time a millionaire is caught an extra \u00a310 is added to the pot.\n\nOne more thing:\n\nDid they all (except the winner Cara) play it poorly? As in, as the rules stand and if you\u2019re sure someone is a millionaire (as they often thought they were at certain points in the game). Would it not be in your advantage to team up with one other person and attempt to keep that \u201cmillionaire\u201d in until the end?\n\nIn closing:\n\nIt all came down to a game of chance at the end anyway, kind of renders the rest of the show pointless. \n\nI think there is a format in here somewhere, they just need to refine it, a lot!\n\nOff to find something else to watch now \ud83d\ude05\n\n",

As someone who knows relatively much about the history of the Second World War I expected, judging by the title, a more thorough history of the Nuremberg trial of which I know less. However, that\u2019s not what I got at all. \n\nThe trial is treated more as a sideshow and the documentary watches more like a general history doc of the Second World War. A missed opportunity to do something unique in my opinion. I get that it is also meant for people who don\u2019t know anything about the Second World War, but I think you can also just introduce the fact that the trial is about the horrors and crimes during that war and then go on with a documentary about how the trial took place. \n\nNow it\u2019s just the worst of both worlds. It\u2019s veeeery general on the war, it\u2019s causes and the way it was lost itself, but then also it just touches briefly upon the different perpetrators. \nWouldn\u2019t it have been far better to go by topic, eg people responsible for the camps, people in general administration, generals etc etc. Or just a couple of episodes where they talk about one person only, eg Speer, G\u00f6ring or Hans Frank? \n\nTLDR: the documentary is not anything like the title would suggest and it feels more like a general history doc of WW2.

        "content": "Hey, it's not much a question about the season rather than a technical issue, ig..., E17 \"the princess dowry\" can't be played for some reason..., when I searched about it it showed that it's episode 20.., so now I'm confused with the order and note that every episode after and before E17 can be played except it for some reason. Does anyone know what's up with that?",

        "content": "When you open a film on Netflix, it counts as a hit, or view. If you look at the rating at the start of the show and decide not to watch the video and close it before the opening credits finish running, you've still technically watched the movie: by opening the movie, you generated a view for the movie. This means that if you open a movie and realize it is something you would never watch, you still stated that you watched it by opening it. This information is probably used by Netflix to determine what to add to its catalog, and false data like yours can be used to justify posting more movies you don't want to watch. \n\nIf Netflix included ratings and warning in the descriptions of their shows, we could decide whether to watch a show based on this information without opening the video. If the rating and warning make us concerned and we decide not to watch the show, we won't generate false data by opening the video. This could reduce the amount of false data used in determining Netflix content. ",

They would've immediately figured out Kyle sold it, and that he was Margo's sister. If they had just left out the other shooting but that they found the gun, that wouldve been way more realistic. But also, no forensics were done at all??",

It used to release so many cool stuff and have a super exciting comming soon \ud83d\udd1c. Now days its just doesn't give you a good value bang. The coming soon are just boring platform transfer ex: Demeter left prime to go on netflix lol and they dare brag new on netflix for old stuff like Oppenheimer from 2023 \ud83d\udeae.

Maybe someday Netflix will make an option to go back the old design.",
