Or was the movie genuinely bleh? \n\nBarely any Joe and Nicky screen time, no actual communication happening between people, Andy just looking away deeply at every moment, underwhelming fight scenes, a stupid ending. \nTo be fair, there were some good parts. I did like seeing Andy a little happier. I loved Quyns angst. Booker made me cry. But overall it was a disappointing sequel.\nI mean if you're going to take 467866 years to make it, at least get it right??\n",

Then during flight (in flight mode of course), the app wouldn't let me watch my downloads and demanded me go log in. \n\nWhile I understand that Netflix would want periodic verifications that I am the viable user, doesn't this defeat the purpose of pre-downloading stuff? I would only download episodes if I expect to move out of WiFi range or even spotty internet. \n\nThen at the destination, two days later I had a 2h bus drive and thought \"well, maybe watch that stuff now?\", but now Netflix gives me an error with my login credentials. I requested a password change and it gave me a \"too many log in -56\" error. \n\nWow, what a terrible user experience. I really just want to watch an hour of my downloads that already exists on my device, now the premier opportunity for the Netflix app to do it's perfect thing will be over just to cool off it's \"too many log in\" shutdown.",

We carefully followed every step in the screen, including the unexpected ones like entering payment details. When I contacted support, the only solution offered was to start the entire process over again. No explanation, no mention of a refund, just that they can\u2019t add the account for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d Yet somehow, there was no issue letting someone accidentally complete steps they weren\u2019t supposed to.\n\nAfter 10 years as a customer, this was too much. Poor support like this is exactly what drives people away. So I\u2019m done. Netflix got an extra \u20ac9.49 from me but not a \u20ac more.",

        "content": "If you see the story from the point of view of Devon and Simone you can understand better that they were struggling with mental illness (both their parents did - pretty sure they both had psychosis, their parents showed symptoms of bipolar; schizophrenia, severe depression). These disorders are genetical so it makes sense that Devon and Simone struggled with mental health and they were also showing symptoms - remember that Devon also said to Simone that she is not taking her medication. At the end of the movie you see how Simone got very triggered by the fact that Kiki found out about the \"kiss\" and she got fired...Simone started to switch and got into a mixed, mania episode...\n\nKiki and her husband showed signs of Narcissim, manipulation etc\n\nI think this show is about mental illness and how mania, psychosis looks - a lot of people don't understand at all how bipolar, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders are like ( I am commenting as someone who has schizoaffective bipolar disorder). throughout the all episodes you can see hallucinations, the struggles etc. Even Devon thinking that Kiki has a cult...Devon gets very paranoid about Kiki and starts to have all this stories about cults, how she is killing people etc...when in reality Kiki is not an evil monster...she is just a woman with lots of money, and probably a bit narcissistic and manipulative.\n\nI think the show is also about trauma bonding between people whith mental illness like bipolar/schizophrenia with people who has narcissistic tendencies. It's well known that people on schizophrenia spectrum can be very easy to manipulate and usually are the victims. It's interesting to view the show as a person who has the disorder because throughout the whole show no one time is mentioned a disorder name. It is only mentioned that Simone and their Dad are taking medication or they should; Simone's and Devon's mom tried to kill them and then killed herself and that Devon struggles with addiction and now she is sober.  Throughout the whole show it has this feeling of everything being a hallucination, a mesmerizing or paranoia vibe ...seeing something that is not real...like a Siren - is how psychosis or mania can feel like, very good depiction. \n\nAs someone who experiences mania, depression it looks very similar with how Simone was. You can see her behavior throughout the show but especially in the end. She was shocked when she was fired and after that she got triggered when her dad said \"it will be us 2 again and we try again to be good\" she was so scared that she went back and this could also trigger a mania episode in her (mania can be triggered by high stress) and then she immediately and impulsively jumps into Peter's arms. Then the scene where she is all dressed up and she talks with her sister Devon - look at that scene where she appears like she is on drugs, like it is not real, everything moved so fast to her being the new wife, giving up her loyalty to Kiki so quickly, her being showed on that hill with the big house in her background, everything being so grandiose, quick, mesmerizing - this how mania feels",
