I was blown away by the teen boy's complex, contradictory psyche, and in particular, wowed by the skillset of the actor portraying him.\n\nBut I can't get past the fact that this series cares infinitely more about the interior struggle of a boy and what leads him to violence than it does about the girl that he KILLED? Katie's only role in this series is to literally DIE so that she can advance the killer's character development. Where is she in this story? Certainly not on the killer's mind: He did nothing wrong. He did nothing wrong. He tells us, over and over and over again.\n\nAt what point do we get to have media that says: Actually, I don't give a fuck why you decided to murder that girl or woman. She gets to have HER story told. And you get to rot in jail.",
