The problem is, **both chat and phone are broken** for me \u2013 I always get an error like \u201csomething went wrong, please try again later.\u201d I also tried **different browsers**, but nothing worked.\n\nI live in **Germany**, if that matters.\n\nIf I reply to the email explaining that the chat and phone don\u2019t work, they just send the **same answer again**, telling me to use chat or phone.\n\nSo I\u2019m stuck in a loop: I **paid**, I **can\u2019t watch**, and the **support channels are broken**.

        "title": "Frog - some questions",
        "content": "I just watched the show Frog, it's pretty good with a great vibe and an interesting story, it's just that character behaviors are absurd. Can someone explain the following:\n\n1. Why can't the protagonist report her to the cops over what she is doing to him (ignoring the kid)? \nI genuinely don't understand why the fact that he cleaned up after her makes him her hostage. She doesn't want the cops to know that she killed the kid, ok. But what does she actually have on him at all, there is no clear proof that he knew she did it when he cleaned up, and nothing stopping him from just reporting her now for harassment and trespassing - what will she do, say \"btw I also killed a kid last year and he might have realized it but didn't report me?\" There's really nothing keeping him from reporting her over what she is doing then. \n\n2. Why does he act like he can't report her for killing the kid due to lack of evidence? If he was going to report her for killing the kid, he wouldn't even need all that, since presumably the child and her personal life can be investigated and people would have noticed her child missing in real life. I do understand why he doesn't want to report it at first, I just think that acting like later he can't do it because she stole a recorded confession and a video of her leaving alone doesn't really make much difference if he wanted to talk about it\n\n\n3. Why does everyone in the show act like its impossible to arrest a person for anything unless I guess you catch them in the act? On one hand this guy thinks he will get in trouble for simply not reporting a murder no one can even prove he really knew of, and yet this woman literally slams into his car in front of the police station, walks around like a maniac , ultimately assaults (to the point where its an attempted murder) that guy and the protagonist's daughter, and yet she walks because the case isn't solid enough? I mean what more do you need aside from the two victims saying she did it to them. It's just ridiculous that on one hand you can stab and attack people but the cops can't do anything , but a guy will live like a hostage over fear of what an allegation (from the murderer) about him covering up a crime would do to him?\n\n4. Why wouldn't the father of the child report his son missing? Again, if he was in her custody and disappeared, you don't exactly need to have a footage of her killing the kid to build a case.\n\n5. Why doesn't the protagonist consult anyone, ever? Even if he was so scared of the cops, it makes no sense not to warn his daughter about the psycho who is harassing him and threatening her life. He has friends, connections, but just stays silent as if her throwing an allegation on him for supposed cover up (which can only harm her) is a figurative gun pointed at his head. Why would most people who know him even care or believe her? \n\n6. Why does the protagonist at no point change the locks?\n\nI almost burst out laughing when the genius cop (who literally did nothing to solve the case and seems to share the view raised in my point 3.) told him that he acted like any person would in his situation.\n\nFinally, this is just something I noticed in several Korean crime shows I recently watched (I still really like them), there seems to be a trend of functioning adults being ridiculously gullible and just taking everyone for their word even when it's totally absurd. Like if you just make a convoluted and dumb threat or if a totally untrustworthy person makes a promise, characters treat it like the most solid logic they can't possibly argue against.\n\n\nOverall the concept was good and I love this type of a thriller, I just think more solid rationale should have been given behind some actions. \n\nFinal comment - the psycho woman was so convincingly grating, I rarely genuinely detested a character so much, even though the protagonist himself was frustrating in his choices. I'm not even talking about the fact that she is clearly a maniac, but even her gestures, laughter, mannerisms, all made me feel this unusual aggression. I wanted to see her get punched, and it seems the show was very self aware that she'd evoke this reaction because she does get punched a lot and it's always really satisfying.",

On the day it premiered, it suddenly had around 2,000 six-star reviews on IMDb, and almost none of them included any kind of in-depth written review.\n\nAt the same time, the show sits at 100% and 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIMDb is owned by Amazon, which is a direct competitor to Netflix through Prime Video. I can\u2019t help but wonder whether Amazon benefits when new Netflix titles are flooded with early low ratings, especially since user scores are one of the first things people check before deciding what to watch.

        "content": "Just wanted to give a little PSA to parents who have children. If you have Netflix installed on your console, *anyone* can launch the app without a Xbox account signed in. If you have logged into Netflix with a Netflix account then *anyone* can watch whatever content they want, what ever rating they want. \n \nI am a parent of 3 kids and have taken what I thought to be reasonable steps to ensure that screen time was strictly enforced via Xbox app and family settings with screen time limits and password protected accounts. Every app on the Xbox requires an account to be signed in, every one but Netflix. \n \nToday I happen to be downstairs at 5am(I am usually at work by this time but called in sick and was grabbing some cough syrup) when I heard my son moving upstairs and decided to blend into the shadows and see what he was up to(he\u2019s supposed to be grounded for bad grades). Well sure enough he came downstairs, turned on the Xbox, and I watched him go from the log in screen on the Xbox to the apps list and pull up Netflix, and the app immediately went straight to the profile screen. Now luckily ( or maybe he had a feeling) he clicked on kids profile and started watching \u201clost in space\u201d BUT my wife\u2019s profile is still signed in so if he wanted to he could have just as easily started watching Castlevania or the Witcher or worse. \n \nIt just sucks that companies keep dropping the ball with parental controls. If my son was on his account and tried to open Netflix, the Xbox won\u2019t let him because it\u2019s blacklisted from his account. If you try and open Disney+ without first signing into an Xbox account you get the error \u201cplease sign into with an Xbox account first\u201d just like every other app or game on the console. Netflix is the only one that lets you bypass the Xbox account login. ",

        "content": "The show is about six people representing six countries (I think there are six countries):\n\n* Australia\n* Korea\n* Japan\n* Australia\n* Mongolia\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n\nThey fight with each other to show which country has the strongest people.\n\nIn this show, although it starts slow, there are so many neck-and-neck matches between different teams representing different countries in Asia. It's absolutely fascinating and amazing, and there were some that were truly mind-blowing to see the intensity and also some of the games where these underdogs beat these obvious leaders or at least who look like obvious leaders. \n\n  \nAnyway, I'm personally enjoying it. I encourage you to also check it out. Definitely, I think episodes 2 and 3 onwards it becomes very intense, so if things feel a little slow in the first episode, don't give up. I highly recommend it. \n\n",

Me personally, I subscribe to several cheaper services that are discounted, but looks like Netflix has a lot of variety. I tried posting this on r/tv, but deleted it...not sure that sub's big on Netflix lol. ",

        "content": "Can the updated interface on the Android/TV app be fixed...it is horrible.  I get the idea of conforming to most other streaming apps, but displaying all content in a single line to scroll through just doesn't work.  Some of us have many titles in our watchlists, and scrolling through them on a single line is annoying.  It would be much more usable to display them in a grid to make finding the wanted title faster and simpler.  Also, PLEASE add an option to sort the list (by title, date added, etc.).  This also makes the interface more user friendly.",
