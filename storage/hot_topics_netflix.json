        "content": "The other night, I started watching Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story on Netflix.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting much-- just another royal drama filled with silks, chandeliers, and scandal.\n\nBut one scene caught me off guard.\n\nLady Danbury sends out an invitation for the first ball of the season. Another Lady-- I forget her name -- becomes visibly agitated that the honour had been \u201csnatched\u201d from her.\n\nIt was such a simple moment, yet it reminded me something.\n\nHere were people surrounded by unimaginable wealth and luxury -- yet burning with the same insecurities and jealousies that haunt us all.\n\nThe King and Queen, for all their power, suffer in their own ways.\n\nThe Lords and Ladies suffer for attention, for prestige, for a sense of being seen.\n\nAnd suddenly, it reminded me-- this isn\u2019t just their story. It\u2019s ours.\n\nWe chase new jobs, new relationships, new milestones, believing each next thing will finally make us happy. But it never really does. It\u2019s the same script, just in modern clothes.\n\nThat night, I remembered something Sadhguru once said: If you have tried every possible way to fulfill yourself, and you have realized that nothing really works, it means you have come to the point: \u2018And now, Yoga.\u2019\n\nIt took me years to understand this. Growing up, I was brainwashed to be in constant pursuit of happiness. But Yoga showed me something different. It turned my gaze inward and revealed that what I was chasing was never missing-- it was just within.\n\n\n\n",

(For me it adds an extra layer of \u201crealness\u201d to the documentary.)\n\nI wonder if we will see more true crime documentaries filmed this way with the advancements of technology and body cam footage etc. I think the documentary was beautiful put together and even with majority of the documentary being on body cam footage, it still told a very clear story.\n\nCurious to know anyone\u2019s thoughts on this? Did you think the body cam footage made things \u201ctoo real\u201d? Invasion of privacy? Would you like to see more true crime documentaries that include police body cam footage etc?\n\nTIA! \ud83d\udc8b",

I forgot about them and there\u2019s no collection of them along with The Killers either on the front page or in search.  Does anyone remember the names of the other films?\n\nThey did the same thing with the Harlan Corben series\u2019.  They had him on a bunch of morning talk shows and then no Harlan Corben tile in the Netflix app.  I saw Stay Close, got busy and I know there are more Corben limited series I probably would like, but it took me writing this post to dig deep and remember it was Corben series I need to sift through Netflix to find.\n\nThey did the same thing with the Elvira campaign on Youtube a couple of years ago.  This was a bit better because it was easily searchable on youtube and I saw the ones I was interested in, but no trace of it at all in the Netflix app felt like a huge disconnect.  A Tile\u201d within the rows. from search.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s bad is that it feels like it was a waste of effort for Netflix to have made the promotions because the content very quickly fades back into the obscurity of the catalogue.",

        "content": "I know the show has been out for a while but I just finished it. I wanted to know what you guys thought about the ending, because I'm enraged by it. I loved all the episodes up to the last two. I genuinely cannot believe how badly they fucked everything up, it actually makes me mad.\n\nFirst off, Amy and Danny. Everything about the relationship between these two in the last episode is so confusing to me. The car chase that led Amy and Danny to crash was so avoidable and unrealistic. Amy has just lost everything, literally everything, and yet she still completely forgets about all that and chases Danny, showing no emotions to what had just happened (I can let this go because it could just show her obsession with all of this and her inability to let it go, even at the cost of her life). But then, instead of ramming into the car or just chasing him until he stops, she goes BESIDE HIM, and they both look AT EACH OTHER, DRIVING, NEAR A CLIFF. It's such a dumb way to cause the crash, there were so many better ways to go about this.   \nThis also brings me to another point: after the crash when they're chasing each other, they're making jokes, almost flirting with each other, but they also hate each other? Have you ever seen two people who want each other dead talk in such a friendly way? cause i haven't. His brother had just died (for all he knew), and she had just lost everything, and yet they are all lovey dovey with each other. Maybe I'm not getting the point of the story, but a few minutes ago she completely ignored the fact that she lost everything to chase this man, and now she's asking him to carry her and casually talking to him? It's just like one second they hate each other and they're threatening each other to die, and then the next they're all emotional and cracking jokes.  \n  \nThen there's George. The entire show he was an extremely nice person who wouldn't hurt a fly (to an extent, since he did basically cheat on his wife but you get the point). When he finds out his wife cheated, he gently grabs her hand and calmly says he wants a divorce, and now, all of a sudden, he shoots someone without a second thought? Don't get me wrong, I understand that he was worried and so he did rash things, but we've seen him worried/stressed along the show and not make such aggressive decisions, like at least show that he has a bit of remorse or is scared to end someone's life. I just found it so unlike him.   \nThen there's Paul. It's understandable that he'd be mad, but leaving your BROTHER to die because he threw away your college letters? 5 seconds before that, he was all proud, saying he wasn't going to leave, that Danny had accepted his flaws so many times, but then just by saying one little sentence, Paul did a whole 360 and hated him, texting him that he never wanted to see him again? And why did he even text him?! for all he knew Danny was dead, he left him with the knowledge that he was gonna die.\n\nI also want to point out one thing that made me very irritated. The scene where Danny and Paul split up is just so weak man. You're telling me Paul couldn't have put his hand a bit further down, or Danny couldn't have boosted the jump using the wall, fuck, or they could've looked around a bit, and they would've found the vent Danny used. Such a dumb and infuriating scene.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make this rant too long since I want to know your opinions. I have so many other things to criticize, but I think I gotta take a deep breath and calm down cause this shit made me mad bro, what a waste.",

        "content": "Whenever I log onto netflix on my ipad, i\u2019m logged out. No matter what, I\u2019m always logged out. Irritating but whatever, I just log back in but it doesn\u2019t work. I will do it three, four five times yet every time it acts as if it\u2019s logging me in then immediately takes me to the login home page again. Sometimes i\u2019ll swipe out the app and come back and i\u2019m logged in, but it never lasts. Also, if I manage to get in i can only watch one episode of a show. When the episode ends it won\u2019t automatically go to the next episode, it\u2019ll say some error code and when I click on it, it says that error code as well. Then I try something else and the error code is there too. I swipe netflix out, and I\u2019m logged out yet this time it won\u2019t log me in regardless no matter what, I have to wait a couple hours or for me usually the next day. Is this common? Thanks. This has never happened in my ipad ",
