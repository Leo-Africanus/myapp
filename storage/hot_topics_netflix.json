Then she finds out that not only was the ex fianc\u00e9, who abandoned her and broke her heart, was the one who killed her dad. But that her best friend (who had lied to her before) WITNESSED IT. I realized then that the show was pretty much over so I was waiting to see her reaction. \n\nShe was gonna at least yell at the ex, right? WRONG. She reaches over after a few seconds and holds his hand. \n\nWhat the actual hell? \n\nThe show was pretty all over the place to begin with. The weird dog breeder plot, The detective constantly being lied to by her closest friends and family, All these forced \u201ctwists\u00a0and turns\u201c about Josh that turned out to have nothing to do with him etc. \n\nI guess I should\u2019ve kept my expectations low lol but I at least expected an ending that would be a teeny bit satisfying.

I\u2019ve enjoyed the show but leave well alone, cos everything interesting to say about the characters has already been done.  \n\nThe writers stymied the progress of Sam Loudermilk by blunting significant storylines that involved him having to grow beyond his hound dog persona.  \n\nIn S1 he pursues Allison then wins her in final episode, as he is league jumping he\u2019ll have to evolve to keep her heart.  Her character is killed off in 1st episode of S2. \n\nBen marrying Sam\u2019s Ex as S1 big finale story beat, is completely reset to starter positions early on in S2.  Mid S2 they are living back together like it never happened.   \n\nEnd S2 Sam is literally left holding the baby, he\u2019ll sure have to grow up fast now.  Early S3 the baby subplot is wrapped up within 1 episode.  \n\nI wish the writers had the confidence to grow the characters and not contrive to have them in their starter positions every season. It feels like they were making it up on the hoof every season, with no story arc.  \n\nThe show is a gem to discover as a joyful distraction, with Ron Livingston perfecting the grouch.  But any more seasons will lose its charm and overstay the welcome.  It\u2019s of its time and should be enjoyed as such.  ",

I have liked and like more comfort shows like The Office, Parks and Rec, Curb etc., but they tend to bore me in the end and feel a bit superficial/like a waste of time so that's not what I'm looking for. I would like something to really dig deep into, something that'll engange me and something that's preferebly about real world issues/power/politics/business.\n\nI've enjoyed Succession, BB, Better Caul Saul, Game of Thrones, House of Cards to name a few, and have lately been giving Mad Men a shot (currently in the last episode of season 1, but not really feeling it). Debating whether to start West Wing/The Newsroom/The Wire/Billions/Six Feet Under instead.\n\nAnything u can recommend? Would greatly appreciate it :))",

We are losing our empathy for each other when we are all each deeply shaped by our life experiences. I get that everyone is different, but we\u2019ve become so divided and I have no doubt that Jerry Springer among other reality shows, among other factors in the media are doing an excellent job at feeding our apathy. We aren\u2019t each other\u2019s enemies. It\u2019s the people at the top who are playing mind games. We aren\u2019t going to see the change we long for until we stop turning on each other.\n\nThis is what I got out of the film at least. Anyone else?",
