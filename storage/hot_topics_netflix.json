No reason, no confirmation email, no explanation of what \u201cthe system\u201d even means. Just\u2026 goodbye, I guess? They also refused a refund for the remaining time on my subscription. Is this normal? Has this happened to anyone else? I\u2019m genuinely baffled. It felt like talking to some automated authoritarian Big Brother thing \u201cthe system decided you\u2019re out\u201d.

Food, Culture, Nature and the People are all fabulous. \n\nDuring my visit to Cu Chi Tunnels, I befriended my tour guide who was super informative. We spoke a lot about the culture and history of Vietnam with more focus on the war. He was from the North and his family were part of the communist party. But he was neutral and explained the whole scenario. One thing I was clear, that there's no good guy or bad guy here. Both the sides had committed war crimes. But then I visited the War Memorial, I felt the US did horrific attrocitices. They equally killed civilians as did the communists. So all in all, I had a belief that all 3 parties, The communists of North, South Vietnamese and The US were all equally guilty of inflicting so much pain to common people and created so much disruption that no one could live happlity during that period in time. \n\nBut after watching this series, I feel the South Vietnamese were the neutral guys who got stuck between the North and the US. Is this a right way of understanding the whole scenario?",
