        "content": "The whole premise of the Victoria Beckham documentary was that she fought for 17 years to be taken seriously in fashion and build her brand, all for it to finally stabilise in 2023 after cumulative losses of -\u00a369 million pounds, to post a triumphant profit. But the truth is she posted a EBITDA profit of around \u00a32m pounds, but still an operating loss of -\u00a32.9m. This year, she\u2019s had to extend loans of \u00a36.3m to keep it afloat. It\u2019s not successful and hasn\u2019t been, and if you can\u2019t make a company generate a return in 17 years, after that much investment, it\u2019s not going to magically start making a return. And for that \u00a370 million investment to have meant anything, it needs to be able to generate more than that at some point, not just pay it back. Like who in god\u2019s name pumps that much cash into something year after year, as an escalating commitment to failure, and then gets a documentary made about what a big success it is. I\u2019m baffled! I own some of her eyeliners, and now I know David Beckham has partially subsidised them!",

I know they probably were following the way the books were published (I didn't know it was based off a book) but still, they had Teresa as the love interest when it should have been Brenda, Gally was nice to have but still was a bit out of touch, and then newt dies, terrible, would recommend only to watch the first one and then no more, it's definitely not worth it",

Instead of falling into the well where the ball of light (the portal) was, he teleported back to the future (his timeline) by touching the portal while it was in the garden?\n\n(She told Vincent his dad changed after he saw his childhood friend called Red fall into the well and disappeared forever. She also witnessed it too.)\n\nLike, did she know? Did she know that originally, Red fell into the well, but then decided to change the future by not doing it? Hinting the wink in the ending scene? Or at least she was somehow aware Vincent (Red) changed the future? And also, how did they not notice that Vincent looked exactly like his dads childhood friend? (...they don't know he time travelled and was the same person.) Cuz there's gotta be more than just her believing there was something weird with the house, right?\n\nOr am I just overthinking it over a PG-rated series?\n\nTL;DR I'm wondering if Vincent\u2019s aunt knew he was actually Red and that he changed the past. The wink at the end got me thinking that if she aware of the altered timeline and that Vincent was Red?\n\nIt's all speculations and theories, I wanna hear what you guys think!

She almost drowned a teammate because she didn\u2019t get the info she wanted. Fatima literally had to stop her.

        "content": "Hey guys, I vaguely remember this movie from long ago in Netflix when I got really into animation as a child (The Secret of Kells was my go to when I was little!). I was wondering if I could describe this film and see if anyone could identify the movie:\n\nI don\u2019t remember very much about the plot of the movie, but I do remember that it was hand drawn possibly before 2009 and it was one of the suggestions on Netflix right after you finished the secret of Kells. It recommended this movie it was a full length feature and extremely colorful, and for some reason in my mind, it was kind of surrealist/ multi genre. I know that it was taken off Netflix ~10 years ago so this may be a long stretch.\n\nDoes this ring a bell with anybody? It could\u2019ve been a foreign language film, but I\u2019m pretty sure that it was dubbed in English.",
