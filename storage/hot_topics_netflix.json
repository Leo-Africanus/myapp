Netflix\u2019s biggest show till date, bringing in a new Sci-Fi IP which demands quality in its storytelling given its scale. Till Season 4, I thoroughly enjoyed the lore of the universe. I felt like the sci-fi elements were the priority (if there was any) and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff was sort of secondary. Season 5 feels like the writers turned into a bunch of teenagers and wrote up some BS to finish the plot.\n\nThe only thing I have liked is the Upside Down being a wormhole. Apart from that, from The Crawl to The Bridge, almost all elements of the lore have insane number of loopholes. Plus, the actors have such cringe dialogues. This wasn\u2019t the show I fell in love with.\n\nSaying \u201cthis is just supposed to be a fun sci-fi\u201d screams of calling a superhero movie \u201cjust a fun movie\u201d or a shonen anime \u201cjust a shonen.\u201d\n\nThe world you build has to make sense, the rules you establish have to matter, and the way you make these stories into a reality has to be upto the mark man. \n",

You's series finale I'm pretty sure is the worst rated episode of the series. And the switch-up towards Stranger Things? I haven't seen anything like this since Games of Thrones. Maybe the series finale can redeem its reputation but I'll be shocked if just 2 hours is enough for them to give a satisfying conclusion to every plot line (I'll still be watching though).\n\nThe only other show that ended this year and IMO had a satisfying ending was Alice in Borderland. But even then, season 3 wasn't really necessary and we could've ended with season 2 tbh.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019ll start by saying that I\u2019m sorry if a similar topic has already been discussed; I\u2019m not very comfortable using Reddit. I should also mention that I\u2019m currently using ChatGPT to translate, as I\u2019m French.\n\nMy problem can be summed up very simply: I no longer have Netflix in 4K.\n\nI\u2019ll immediately answer the various questions you might want to ask to help solve my issue:\n\n* Yes, I do have the 4K Premium subscription;\n* Yes, I have purchased and downloaded the HEVC Codec from the Windows Store;\n* Yes, I am using Edge (more specifically, the Netflix app, which is basically Edge);\n* Yes, I have tested with Edge directly and without the app;\n* Yes, I have turned off my second monitor;\n* Yes, I have disabled NVIDIA Instant Replay.\n\nI\u2019ve been watching my 4K-available series and movies on Netflix since 2022, and I\u2019ve never had any issues until now. I\u2019ve always managed to find the solution on my own whenever 4K stopped working (disabling NVIDIA Replay, turning off my second monitor, etc.). But this time, honestly, I\u2019m stuck. I don\u2019t understand why, all of a sudden, I no longer see 4K displayed when I press CTRL + ALT + Shift + D. It shows 1080p instead, even though I haven\u2019t changed anything and this happened overnight.\n\nI should still point out one thing: I\u2019m used to what 4K looks like and what 1080p looks like, and honestly\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m watching my movies and series in 1080p, despite what CTRL + ALT + Shift + D indicates. Maybe it says 1080p but it\u2019s an error. Just in case, you\u2019ll find the bitrate shown in the screenshot below.\n\n[https://prnt.sc/9f1A7PSXMvMD](https://prnt.sc/9f1A7PSXMvMD)\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",
