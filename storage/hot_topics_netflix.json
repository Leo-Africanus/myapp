Like why? The last straw was the opening of Episode 6. He (i guess) imagined being in a sitcom. Why couldn\u2019t they continue with the hacking greedy corporations storyline without the dad being an imaginative character in Elliot\u2019s head? Like i said, i enjoyed the original concept and am thinking about finishing it but idk? Have any of you finished it? Is it worth it? It just annoys me when writers try so hard to be clever and eccentric with these shows ultimately losing the plot &amp; ruining a good show. ",

First, her mother nearly kills her. Then her dad neglects her to the point where she's starving. THEN she gets taken into foster care and is sexually abused there. \"Stealing\" someone's husband is one of the lesser evils she could have committed given her awful circumstances. It's immoral, of course, but desperation will lead to desperate measures.\n\nDevin is alright. She's had it pretty tough, but Simone arguably had it even worse. Given what we know now, I'm surprised she wasn't a bit more sympathetic towards Simone for not wanting to come home. I don't have too many thoughts on her. \n\nMichaela is fabulous! No notes. Prime example of how \"powerful\" women, or women with a strong presence, are villainized or even suspected to be \"witches\" (the series tricked us into going along with that narrative, when it was Peter pulling the strings all along). \n\nIMO, the main villains are Peter and Bruce (the dad). One intentionally manipulates and tricks people (Peter), and the other was just a neglectful parent who caused irreparable trauma to both his daughters. The main characters are just products of their circumstances. ",
