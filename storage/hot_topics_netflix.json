I\u2019m Nick, director of *MINTED*, now streaming on Netflix worldwide (well, North America, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa!)\n\nThe film is a front-row seat to the explosive rise of NFTs becoming a $40 billion digital gold rush, all the way through the market's dramatic crash. We spent years embedded in the digital art and crypto worlds, from NFT multimillionaires flipping JPEGs to the pioneering artists flipping the script on the traditional art market, plus the critics and journalists digging into the good, the bad, and bizarre of this new frontier.\n\nWhether you love or hate NFTs, I hope the film sparks some big questions about how art, tech, and finance are colliding. Beyond NFTs, it\u2019s about pioneering artists trying to not just survive, but lead the way forward in how we use new technology as a society.\n\nWe premiered *Minted* at the Tribeca Film Festival, and its been a wild ride since. So whether you\u2019re a collector, a skeptic, or just a fellow documentary nerd \u2014 AMA!\n\nproof: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI12rZQz1BX)\n\nnetflix: [https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558](https://www.netflix.com/title/81993558)",

Beck was so shitty towards him and the relationship she didn\u2019t really care. Marianne literally was a homewrecker. Love was crazy as hell I wish they would\u2019ve stayed together. Kate was a hypocrite, a complicit contrite hypocrite. Bront\u00eb was honestly just annoying as hell. Penn played the hell out of this role though.

        "title": "Full Swing needs to be cancelled",
        "content": "As I'm a golf fan I decided to watch Full Swing  which I now regret as it's such a poor production and is just another disappointing Netflix original. The contributors are all crap and add absolutely nothing to the narrative especially Amanda Balionos and Dan Rappaport. The players know they're micd up so are very careful with what they say and the moments that are recorded look so staged and cringe. It also seems to be a platform for the Wags who no doubt want to promote their own brand and Netflix are happy to do so. Drive to Survive was a good addition but this is mostly garbage.",

        "title": "Will changing my billing country cause the sharing rule to kick in?",
        "content": "A few years ago, I moved back to the US. I was living in the UK and that's where I created my Netflix account. I never got around to change the country so I still get billed in pounds. I have premium and I currently pay \u00a318.99. According to the Netflix website, I need to cancel my account, wait till the end of my billing period, then restart my account. A few years ago, Netflix introduced the extra members fee where anyone outside your household has to pay for Netflix or something along those lines. As far as I can tell, this never took affect for me. I have friends in other countries, who use my account with no issues. And I'm still able to use it when I travel and stuff. Maybe I don't understand how it's supposed to work but if I change my billing country, will it mess everything up for me? Will other people outside my household get kicked off my account? ",

        "content": "Over the weekend I was watching a series and as it rolled over from one episode to the next, Netflix stopped playing and provided an error message saying \"You appear to be using a proxy...\", you know the rest. \n\nIt's been that way ever since, on my profile only. My wife can watch whatever she wants with no error message but I can't watch a thing, on the same device. \n\nAny thoughts as to why this is happening on one profile and not another in the same account?\n\nAny idea how to fix it? (Not workaround or bypass but FIX)?",
