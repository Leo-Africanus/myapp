        "content": "It\u2019s new &amp; I had never heard of this guy so I watched it last night. Why is Netflix is giving this guy more notoriety and why do we elevate \u2018influencers\u2019 like this??\n\nToxic &amp; cliche grifter promoting an \u2018All Meat Primal\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 lifestyle gets caught using steroids\u2026 a surprise to no one with eyeballs.  He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

People should be able to use their profile if a family member is paying for the subscription, and I know I\u2019d let my family use their profiles on my account too if that were the case. I\u2019ve seen people who move for military reasons complain, and I am in college out of state so it\u2019s super frustrating to be kicked out of my family\u2019s subscription.\n\nIt\u2019s such an egregious cash grab as well as a petty attempt to discourage password sharing that affects people who aren\u2019t even doing so that unfairly (ie children on their parents\u2019 subscription). It\u2019s a genius business decision and you almost have to give it to em\u2014forcing people into paying for more individual plans just so they can watch makes Netflix wayyy more money\u2014but it\u2019s just sooooo frustrating.

Instead, it became a parade of bronzed narcissists dry-humping on bean bags for the chance to sell flat tummy tea and boner pills to strangers on Instagram. Into this rich tradition steps Netflix\u2019s latest entry, Sneaky Links: Dating After Dark, a show that dares to ask: What if your ex-booty call was also your soulmate? (And what if you were filmed trying to figure that out while shirtless, emotionally stunted, and surrounded by Ikea furniture?)\n\nIf you, like me, are 43 years old and unaware that \u201csneaky link\u201d is Gen Alpha for \u201cbooty call,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. Apparently, the term \u201cbooty call\u201d was too on-the-nose for a streaming platform that also produces prestige dramas about Elizabethan corsets and talking bears.

        "title": "How to find independent movies on Netflix",
        "content": "Back in 2000 I started renting movies from Netflix and did so until about 2015. Netflix movies, mailed of course, had the best catalog of independent movies from anywhere. \n\nIf my local movie rental store didn't have an obscure title then I knew Netflix would. \nI know times have changed but I cannot seem to find many Independent films on Netflix streaming.\n\nI've tried the categories option but that's limited to drama comedy reality etc.. \n\nHas anybody found a way to find Independent films on the Netflix app?",

        "content": "Hey everyone!\nI recently rewatched Control Z and How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast) and loved their mix of teen drama, mystery, and dark humor.\n\nCan you recommend similar shows on Netflix with that kind of vibe? Doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same, but something with suspense, smart characters, and that edgy feel.\n\n\nAlso I don't want really long series with 8-10 seasons with each having 24 eps of 1 hr each\n\nWoukd like 3-5 seasons with episodes about 20-40 mins ?\n\nMaybe there are none based on so many restrictions LAWLLLLLL but kindly help or suggest \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

I can confirm I've set playback settings to highest and my internet is more than sufficient at around 200 down. ",

I know Ken Burns\u2019 is fantastic, but the only place I could find it was on YouTube for $40. Is there anything decent on Netflix? ",
