        "content": "My first example is from the new show Trigger. A man nearly rapes a woman, and the main character (an officer) arrives just in time to stop it. He checks the perimeter and leaves his partner to look at the man\u2019s ankle monitor. The man then tries to kill the partner, but the MC stops him just in time. And guess what happens next? The MC slams him to the ground, then he and his partner just walk away\u2014leaving a man who just attempted sexual assault and murder completely free.\n\nAnother example is in Alice in Borderland. There\u2019s a recurring character who repeatedly tries to rape people, and the group has multiple chances to get rid of him. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but one scene had the main character strangling this guy after he tried to assault what seemed to be his love interest. Yet, instead of finishing it, he just lets him live\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get what kind of message the writers are trying to send here, but it feels like it completely falls flat. Why are they portraying rape like it\u2019s something that can just go unpunished?\n",

I went to the sing along in theaters and noticed a lot of the audio, especially during songs, was really funky. For example, only \"Golden\" had a decent amount of bass, and it was cranked compared to the other songs. A bit jarring. I really wish there had been more bass in all the songs. Another example, during Your Idol (my favorite song), there were often times where the background chants were louder than anything else in the song. I was pretty disappointed by the experience, as the immersive and loud audio was the biggest thing I was looking forward to. I saw that other people were complaining before the sing along, so maybe I just couldn't tell on my TV speakers the first times. Or maybe I have a bad theater. Anyone else feel this way? ",

        "content": "I've been with Netflix since 2012 and as far as I can tell, I've always had a premium account with 4 screens.  I guess at some point it got changed by them to a standard plan with 2 screens.  But now that doesn't matter since my son moved out and my brother could no longer access the account because, well....Netflix.....\n\nBut, I did recently added my brother as an extra member - not realizing that I did so with ads.  It is ridiculous that if I have an account without ads, they would default to the extra member option WITH ads.  The issue is that he casts to watch Netflix - and the ads membership does not let you cast.  I cannot believe how insanely hard it is to get them to charge me more money....\n\nI have done 2 chats and 1 call and I was literally ready to throw the phone.  I got as far as canceling the extra member, but if I try to add it back, and select the tiny print option that says without ads, I get to the next screen and there's no info - no monthly amount, etc.  Even if I still go ahead and click \"add member\", it goes back to my account page and nothing happens.\n\nI'm wondering if this is because technically the extra member account is probably still active until my next billing cycle?  Has anyone successfully changed an extra member from ads to no ads?\n\nThanks :)\n\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s clear Lyle is a sociopath. Here\u2019s what I know and what want to understand shortly follows:\n-Lyle seemed to always have a weird affinity for Merritt since they were teens. \n-When William Lingard hits Harry from behind, both teens realized the mistake. Then Lyle comes in and beats William, saying \u201cif I hadn\u2019t followed you, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d \n-Fast forward to when he was at Godhaven and he\u2019s giving a video interview, he kept on about Sam Haig being his brother bc if he didn\u2019t follow him, he\u2019d be dead. \n-Add in him being thrown in the hyperbaric chamber with Harry AFTER his death, but denies Harry being dead in his video interview.\n-There are moments of clarity for Lyle, returning Merritt\u2019s necklace, saying how he loved her, then showing extreme displays of hatred, blaming her for his brother\u2019s death.\n\n1. Does Lyle have a split personality disorder? I personally thought he did. Why else show compassion for the tooth infection and how apologetic he was when returning the necklace? (giving a needle nose pliers seemed to be the dumbest move but yet he was able to concoct a whole new life as Sam Haig just to infiltrate Merritt\u2019s life?)\n2. Did Lyle love Merritt? Or jealous that his brother wanted to leave to be with Merritt?\n3. Does Lyle accept that his brother actually died? In his teens he denied it.\n4. Why would Lyle assume William would continue to hurt Harry? I thought the teens knew each other unless Lyle was just looking for a reason to hurt someone?\nBONUS question \ud83d\ude02:\nDid the Mh\u00f2r sheriff know Lyle was the one who actually attacked William? I think this is the case, but at what point did he realize this and why not confess it? I can\u2019t accept the \u201cit\u2019s his ego to not admit he was wrong.\u201d\n\n",

It gets tiring after a while.\n\nAlso, she kept talking and explaining stuff to the audience by talking to herself. This show is either for kids or for dumb adults, at least according to the writers. \n",

It already charged me for this months payment so would i be able to switch it to a us card? I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll cancel my subscription if i change it to a credit card.",
