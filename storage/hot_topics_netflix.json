His facial expressions alone are so telling. He definitely pulled off the suave sociopathic part hands down. \n\nNow Claire Danes was something else. I kept wishing she would have reined her face in at least 50%. It was just too much. Too much quivering. Too much warbling. Get it together woman. \n\nBrittany Snow is in everything these days. \n\nThis was one of the best Netflix original series in awhile. They\u2019ve been pumping out a lot of junk lately. I was genuinely excited to hit play on the next episode and see how this all ended up. ",

The female agent working with Cody Banks aka Sutherland, is the most unconvincing agent I've seen. Just the way she walks with the gun. I genuinly wonder how these things even happen. It's such low production quality that gets the green light and makes it's way onto netflix. \n\nThis show's premise is actually pretty cool but the acting and other minor stuff are make this show completely unwatchable. Also, the way Sutherland runs is comical. He runs like he shit his pants. I have zero desire to continue this show future",

I love that she can be fully expressive, she can fully emote, and be comfortable as a woman who is growing and aging. No shade to actresses who do get cosmetic work, the pressure to look young and beautiful all the time must be immense. I was wondering if you noticed how expressive she is as Aggie Wiggs, and if you too felt it refreshing to see a woman in all of her glory take space with her aging face in this show.",

I became an overnight huge fan of this genre, as well as the entire saga surrounding this series. I watched the first three seasons very quickly, and I finished the last one yesterday. I read that there was a change in the main actor, and my expectations for the series didn't change. To be honest, the first three seasons had me glued to my seat, while the last season, in my opinion, wasn't anything special (I hope no one takes offense, that's just my opinion). I have the impression that the series has gone in a different direction, and if it continues to be made, it might not be at a very good, strong level in terms of the story itself!",
