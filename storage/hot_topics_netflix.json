I don't want to imagine the smell or the illnesses people got because of it, but it's not going to last forever.  People have had to put up with worse.\n\nPooping in a bag... It beats pooping on the floor.  It's a logical measure to take when the sewage system stops working.  Poop in bags, it can all be collected, and it can be placed and contained in an appropriate area.  Truck drivers and van lifers poop in bags all the time.  It's no big deal.\n\nThose three women...  So many things about those women...\n\nFirst, the bride-to-be seemed like she was the inspiration for Kristen Wiig's role in The Californians on SNL...she was dripping with an abundance of unnecessary drama.  \"Why isn't the bar open???\"  Then taking the Imodium, doubling down on her fear of pooping without a toilet, and complaining about a soggy lettuce sandwich when there could have been zero food at all.\n\nThen the group talking about peeing in the shower.  It's like they were clueless about the fact they were born as human animals with biologic processes.  They seemed to not have an idea about how they could squat to pee in a shower.  They were disgusted with having to do it, needing a shower after.  Jeez ladies, it's just pee... ever been camping?",

The concept, the animation, the music, the action \u2013 it was such a fun ride with way more emotional depth than I expected. But I really hope this isn\u2019t the end and they continue the story, either with a sequel or (fingers crossed) a full series.\n\nThere\u2019s just so much more they could explore. Like, we never got the full story of how Rumi's mom fell in love with a demon?? That could be an entire arc on its own. Also, how did the girls even meet and form the band? The dynamic is so strong, and I\u2019d love to see those early days \u2013 both as idols and as demon hunters.\n\nPlus, the demon threat is definitely not over. At the end, the new Honmoon wasn\u2019t gold, which I\u2019m sure means demons can still escape into the human world. That feels like a huge open door for future stories.\n\nAnd okay, can we talk about Jinu?? I know he died, but he gave his soul to Rumi \u2013 what if that means he could come back? Maybe not as a human, but as an angel or some kind of spirit warrior? I feel like his story isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just hoping enough people support the movie so the creators get the green light to keep building this world. There\u2019s so much potential!\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

        "content": "Scissor Seven is really an amazing show (a donghua, a Chinese animated show, to be specific) which also has an awesome dub.\n\nSeason 5 was released in China in October 2024, which means 8 months ago. I would understand 6 months later, like I think it happened with season 4. But 8 months and any single announcement or something? At least Netflix could say if they really are going to something or it is cancelled or something.\n\nBasically, this all sums up in: Scissor Seven season 5 on Netflix? Yes? No? And, if yes, when?",

        "title": "Why are so many new Netflix shows making men look weak or stupid to empower women can't they just keep both strong and look good?",
        "content": "Lately, I\u2019ve noticed a trend in a lot of Netflix shows and movies where men are portrayed as either weak, incompetent, or emotionally broken, especially when the focus is on empowering a female character. It feels like the only way they show women as strong is by making every man around them look foolish or irrelevant.\n\nIs this intentional? Why is this becoming so common? Can't strong female characters exist without making male ones seem useless?\n\nJust to be clear, this isn\u2019t only happening on Netflix. I\u2019ve noticed similar trends in movies and shows from other platforms, too. Netflix stands out more because of how much content it releases.",

        "content": "I just finished the documentary and I was pretty disappointed in the quality of this documentary.\n\nGenerally, it seems like an interesting topic, and something that I remember happening but don't really know the details of; and I feel like the events leading up to and the cause of the outage were covered pretty well. And that's kind of where my compliments on this doc stops.\n\nThe crew they interviewed were somewhat interesting.The lady who was the voice of the ship was had some great detail of the event because she was where the action and decisions were happening. The chef had some funny anecdotes. The Russian lady was solely there to be horny and call Americans stupid.\n\nThey seemingly found the absolute worst passengers to comment on their experiences. There was little more relayed than it was gross and upsetting. The bachelorette party was insufferable and somehow 12 years later hasn't changed a bit. They acted like such stereotypical bachelorette \"woo girls\" that I can't tell if they were putting on an act or if that's genuinely how they are. \n\nThe entirety of the father-daughter footage can be summed up in, \"I was scared and this experience was not what we paid for.\"\n\nI don't know if this was just the interviewees in particular or maybe it's a true cross section of the type of people who go on cruises, but all the passengers acted like pooping in the red biohazard bags was the absolute end of the world. The son in law seemed to care for little else except that. His grand victory was finding a working toilet. That's might have been the highlight of his life. I've shit into wag bags before and carried it out with me. It's not the most pleasant thing but you do what you gotta do. And they didn't even have to pack it out, they could put it in garbage cans around the ship.\n\nAdditionally all the passengers acted like they were alone on a raft weathering the elements, forced to hand deliver their turds into red bags. Let's be real, they say on their asses while the crew did actual work amidst spoiled people on their worst behavior.\n\nI would have loved to hear what the crew was doing to help passengers day to day, and they did a bit here and there, but it was never really covered. And I would have loved to hear what went on interpersonally on the ship between passengers. People were doing shitty things like hoarding and claiming territory, was there bartering? Did people form loose alliances? This could have been an interesting study on human behavior and instead the biggest takeaway was poop lasagna.\n\nAlso, there's a tie for biggest piece of shit between the Carnival Marketing guy and the Cruise Lawyer.  \n\n3/10 - Still not as bad as Untold: The Liver King",
