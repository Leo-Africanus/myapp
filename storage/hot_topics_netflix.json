It's been around for a few years.\nLoudermilk is an addiction counselor with a motley crew of devotees that attend his regular meetings in a catholic church.\n\nThe cast are mostly men, and there are some gross moments (doll episode).\n\nAnja Savcic is the only regular woman casted. They manage her presence nicely without being overly sexual, which I can appreciate. \n\nThe show also mingles comedy with hard topics such as living with disabilities, misogyny, and failure really well. \n\nI've rewatched it several times, especially when winding down at night or if there's nothing else to watch (skipping the doll episode). \n\nAnyone else find this show oddly comforting?

The cat episode and the alien episode made me appreciate 3 robots and The Drowned Giant so much more. Night of the Mini Dead is fun and hilarious but Close Encounters in season 4 feels like fanfic. \nCompare How Zeke got Religion to The Secret War, or Shape Shifters to Spider Rose or The Screaming Tyrannosaur. \n\nAm I the only one who feels that Netflix exploits the popularity of a show all the way to oblivion?

Why is Netflix is giving this guy more notoriety and why do we elevate \u2018influencers\u2019 like this??\n\nToxic &amp; cliche grifter promoting an \u2018All Meat Primal\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 lifestyle gets caught using steroids\u2026 a surprise to no one with eyeballs.  He walks around in no shirt and shorts all the time. Seriously - in public, at conventions, multiple clips of podcasts interviews, a Piers Morgan interview\u2026 there is literally 1 scene in the entire thing where he is wearing a shirt. It\u2019s cringy af to watch.\n\nHe makes a ton of money off of selling supplements and making videos that this diet is healthy and his physique is all due to meat &amp; supplements - so Buy Now! It\u2019s terrible advice, in no way healthy and can seriously harm people! If he possesses any qualifications for giving diet advice, or knowledge to create a supplement line (other than working at GNC when he was a teen), they sure don\u2019t mention it.\n\nHe goes from \u2018f you! It\u2019s none of your business if I take steroids\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll just lie again\u2019 to an unapologetic apology to his fans saying he has self esteem issues because his dad died when he was a kid and steroids help. \ud83d\ude44 Then admitting that he has been stealing &amp; grifting since he was 16 - even printing counterfeit money at one point! \nDude\u2026. if that is true, prolly shouldn\u2019t admit that on a Netflix special\u2026\n\nHe and his \u201cqueen\u201d kill a bull and make their kids eat its testicles while per-formatively thanking his \u201cbull brother\u201d and Earth for his gifts like he\u2019s a character in Avatar. Yup, raw bull testicles just out in the middle of a field, still warm.  I mean, I\u2019m not into hunting - not that you can call this hunting because it was a lone bull standing in a field that someone else shot for him  - but I get that some people are. You should not be eating raw animal organs! EVER!!! And you certainly should not be feeding it to your kids! I guess if this guy brings on a new pandemic or the zombie apocalypse, he\u2019ll just bicep curl his way out of it.\n\nAfter taking mushrooms, a shaman shows up (?) for a sweat lodge and he has to think of his next move while of the mean things Internet people said to him are dubbed over the scene\u2026 Not his responsibility or fraud or lies or how his business partners were also screwed over with his fraud. \n\nBut, don\u2019t worry because he realizes he should be eating fruit too (which he thanks before eating) and his new business plan is to open 302 resorts where people can pay to live like him and his family. His 9 Pillar Belief System has become 10 Pillars because he\u2019s not giving up steroids, but he\u2019s definitely done grifting, right guys?",

It only turned up because I looked up _Blood of Zeus_ (stupid, cringey show) and I suppose the name sounds vaguely mythological?\n\nBut it's really well written sci-fi with great voice acting. Just two episodes in and I'm hooked. It's still blowing my mind that I've never heard of it so I think 'heavily underrated' fits here. \n\nEdit: Really hoping the quality doesn't decline but so far so good!\n\n",
