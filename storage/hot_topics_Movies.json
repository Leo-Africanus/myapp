I certainly wouldn\u2019t call it a \u201cgreat\u201d comedy, but we really had fun with it and have watched it at least a couple of times.\n\nEdit: Stuart Saves His Family (30% &amp; 53%) is a movie I\u2019ve watched multiple times. I always liked the Stuart Smalley character on SNL. It is really funny and surprisingly moving, and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio is great as usual.",

That said, there\u2019s a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu quality to much of the new film, a slavishness that goes beyond the caged men forced to fight for their survival, and seeps into the very bones of a drama overly beholden to the original.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-pedro-pascal-ridley-scott-1236204115/) (70):\n\n&gt;Written by David Scarpa (\u201cNapoleon\u201d) and directed by Scott (who, at 86, hasn\u2019t lost his touch for the peacock pageantry of teeming masses thirsting for blood), the movie is a solid piece of neoclassical popcorn \u2014 a serviceable epic of brutal warfare, Colosseum duels featuring lavish decapitations and beasts both animal and human, along with the middlebrow \u201cdecadence\u201d of palace intrigue.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal/) (58):\n\n&gt;\u201cGladiator II\u201d has everything it needs in the action department. The battles are certainly spectacular. It\u2019s the story that falls apart. The whole thing hangs on contrivance and familiarity, not characters, so the fights don\u2019t seem to matter much. Even Denzel Washington, who has all the best scenes and looks like he\u2019s enjoying himself more than he has on screen in years, can\u2019t save this material because the material isn\u2019t focused on him. Macrinus is a lot more interesting than our hero. Come to think of it, so is General Acacius. They could have carried the whole movie themselves, one or the other or both. Which means the thing that\u2019s holding \u201cGladiator II\u201d back is, weirdly, the fact that it\u2019s about a gladiator.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/gladiator-2-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;Not perfect and not a patch on the original film, but the magic of Ridley Scott's direction and Denzel Washington's performance elevates Gladiator 2 into the epic spectacle it needs to be. But best to manage your expectations in comparison to the Oscar-winning film.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-ridley-scott) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Scott\u2019s return to the Roman arena is something of a repeat, but it\u2019s still a thrilling spectacle and Mescal a formidable lead. We are entertained.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-1235064268/) (50):\n\n&gt;Gladiator II\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the first sequel to become bogged down in its resemblance to its forebear, but the various superficial modifications made to characterizations and action sequences operate under faulty bigger-is-better sequel logic.\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott:\n\n&gt;Over two decades after the events of Gladiator, Lucius\u2014the son of Lucilla and Maximus\u2014lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by General Marcus Acacius invade, killing his wife and forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator under the teaching of Macrinus, a former slave who plots to overthrow the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.\n\nCast:\n\n* Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus\n* Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius\n* Joseph Quinn as Emperor Geta\n* Fred Hechinger as Emperor Caracalla\n* Lior Raz as Vigo\n* Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus\n* Connie Nielsen as Lucilla\n* Denzel Washington as Macrinus",
