        "content": "A Complete Unknown - Review Thread\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_complete_unknown): 74% (46 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-complete-unknown/): 68 (26 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-astonishes-young-bob-dylan-james-mangolds-thrilling-musical-drama-1236199254/):\n\n&gt;At the center of this all is a remarkable performance by Timothee Chalamet who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way\u00a0*Walk The Line*\u00a0was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and\u00a0*Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter*\u00a0was all Spacek.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):\n\n&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character,\u00a0*A Complete Unknown*\u00a0offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan\u2019s music and the era in general, that will be enough.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):\n\n&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist\u2019s allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):\n\n&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It\u2019s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet\u2019s Dylan at first; I didn\u2019t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again\u00a0*and*\u00a0go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):\n\n&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It\u2019s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan\u2019s life \u2013 rather than the musician himself, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2013 turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):\n\n&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren\u2019t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan\u2019s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.\n\nWritten and Directed by James Mangold:\n\n&gt;The film follows the life and career of musician\u00a0[Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)\u00a0from January 1961, when he moves from Minnesota to New York City, to his 1965 concert at the\u00a0[Newport Folk Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival), resulting in\u00a0[controversy over the use of electric instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy).",

I'm sad to see it go, as it was a good site with talented writers. It also marks the end of that mid-2000s-2010s blogging era that included sites like Chud, Birth Movies Death, etc. ",

        "title": "Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?",
        "content": "Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?\n\nFirst one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.\n\nAnother example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo. (UPDATE: It's called \"The Firing Squad\")",
