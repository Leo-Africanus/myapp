One night, he gets a customer from a car accident who he is convinced is his former tormenter Eghbal, a man who he never saw but knew by voice and the squeak of his prosthetic leg. Vahid follows him home and kidnaps the customer the next day, but the man insists he has no idea what Vahid is talking about. So Vahid embarks on a journey across the city in his van picking up fellow former prisoners to try to verify that he's kidnapped Eghbal, and then figure out what to do with him.\n\nJafar Panahi's made a dark comic cross between Little Miss Sunshine and Death of the Maiden, and it is often funny, often tragic and very unpredictable. It gives a face to the suffering of the Iranian people and their various responses to their repression.  Also one of the few films I've seen like No Country For Old Men that manages to keep you totally engaged without any music.  We've altered their history now and before, so best to learn a bit about what they go through! \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It\\_Was\\_Just\\_an\\_Accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Was_Just_an_Accident)",

The movie is centered around characters pushing their own agendas and self interests within a greater scheme, with no real regard for all those caught in the crossfire. The movie is absolutely hilarious but what I came away with was that the sense of doom at the end along with the roller coaster of shambles on the way there felt a bit too real. The laugh out loud moments alone though make this movie worth watching, it just ages brilliantly.",

The way he talked while acting in his role and the way he was speaking as the narrator just showed how much in character he was able to be in. What do you guys think? Interesting and always a fun watch I used to watch this as a kid years ago. I think just acting all around.",

        "content": "She is the one who cheats on him, but the movie tries to make it seem as if we should be on her side and that it\u2019s Cal\u2019s fault she did it because he became a \u201cboring partner\u201d.\n\nNot only that, but their family friends: Bernie (reluctantly) and his wife choose to side with Emily and doesn\u2019t receive any emotional support over it until Jacob takes him under his wing to move on from her by teaching him his womanizing ways.\n\nAnd when Emily finds out that he slept with their son\u2019s teacher (who takes him ghosting her too personal), she has the audacity to act so self-righteous and disgusted when she finds out he also slept with nine other women. I get there is her thinking there was a personal motive where she felt this was him getting back at her, but she is the one who wanted a divorce.\n\nHe\u2019s a grown man who\u2019s allowed to explore since he\u2019s no longer married to her. But more importantly, she NEVER once apologizes for hurting Cal first. By the end of the movie, Cal once again has to be the bigger person who makes up for all the \u201cwrongs\u201d he\u2019s done.\n\nThe way this movie tried to tell its messages was very weird. It was an entertaining movie, but it never fails to piss me off at the same time lol\n\nEDIT: Man, I clearly need to work on how I write titles for posts like this. I want to clarify, I don't think Cal is the villain of the story but the point I'm making is that the way this movie tells it's story. It's framing it as if he is. Sure, Emily might be called out for cheating, but she is let off the hook a little to easily compared to Cal. ",

        "content": "So as much as some of the bar customers in this backwater Western Australian Town made me very uncomfortable(especially when placing yourself in the shoes of the two Finnish girls), it also strangely made me laugh at how bizarre these people were. I do feel like the overly sexualized and rude behaviors can be common in many small rural towns across the world that are living in poverty.... but there's just something about these people that are so bizarre lmao\n\nFrom their t-shirts (\"I fucked a goat\" - \"it's not a beer belly, its a grain liquor facility\"), to their mannerisms and rude comments.... it was just quite an experience, and I'm sure these women felt the same way. These people for the most part were trash and they acted like it. The Canman seemed like a decent dude, but he's also just an old poor drunk whose car apparently smells so bad that one of the girls puked a lot because of it. \n\nNow, some of these guys(and women) literally behaved like they gave absolutely zero fucks about anyone or anything. They stated horrible things with zero shame. I was just jaw-dropped at how they say such absurd uncomfortable things without even thinking about it at all. They didn't look like they felt bad for anything they say either. It's like it's just normal to them. How can such a high concentration of assholes all be in one place?? We all know how some trailer trash people behave, but I still think a majority of them are better than this... \n\nI've considered doing an Australia/SE Asia trip at some point in my life, but I sure as shit know where I won't be stopping by at... Coolgardie... shocking I know right...? Hope those girls learned something from their 1.5month bar tending job at the great hotel coolgardie. Travel safely people. \n\nIt's somehow an interesting watch, despite it basically being about bar regulars in the middle of nowhere. 7/10.",

It\u2019s from the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, which might intice you a bit. It also has a pretty great cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Emily Watson, just to name a few. Great film.",
