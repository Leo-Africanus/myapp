        "content": "*Bob is a washed-up revolutionary who lives in a state of stoned paranoia, surviving off-grid with his spirited and self-reliant daughter, Willa. When his evil nemesis resurfaces and Willa goes missing, the former radical scrambles to find her as both father and daughter battle the consequences of their pasts.*\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti, Regina Hall\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [98%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_battle_after_another)\n\n**Metacritic:**  [99 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/one-battle-after-another/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[HighOnFilms - Liam Gaughan](https://www.highonfilms.com/one-battle-after-another-2025-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a hyperkinetic thrill ride that surprisingly never loses momentum throughout its nearly three-hour running time, yet never feels weighed down by its scope. The action has the same eye-popping practicality of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d or \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d with the charm that none of its characters are particularly skilled. DiCaprio often appears as a bumbling hero in the vein of Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, even if he shows a capacity for delivering snarky one-liners not seen since his work in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250917-one-battle-after-another-review) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Salman Rushdie, reviewing Pynchon's Vineland 35 years ago, called it \"a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself.\" And at a Q&amp;A with Anderson several weeks ago, Steven Spielberg praised the film as \"increasingly more relevant than perhaps even when you finished the screenplay\". American society, in all its strengths and missteps, has been a major theme for both Pynchon and Anderson, and it grounds Anderson's dazzler of a film, giving it an emphatic, unmistakable political charge.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/one-battle-after-another/) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Ambitious, urgent and personal storytelling from Paul Thomas Anderson, blending many different genres to create an engaging and vital new masterwork. Relentless pacing, strong performances, technical and visual excellence, with multi-layered depth and inspiring relevance to bring about change for our overwhelmingly dark times.\n\n[IGN - Michael Calabro](https://www.ign.com/articles/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-pta?utm_source=threads,twitter) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Even the things PTA whole-cloth invented for the film, like the harmony transponders, Bob forgetting the code words, the Christopher Reeve Superman poster in Sensei Sergio\u2019s dojo, semen demon, the car chases, the stunt fall off a building down a tree\u2026 There are so many little details, seemingly inconsequential touches \u2013 the filmmaker\u2019s style, if you will \u2013 that all add up bit by bit to turn this amazing movie into a masterpiece.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1235151707/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Anderson concedes that he\u2019s no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-andersons-thrillingly-helter-skelter-counter-culture-caper) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen \u2013 an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream? Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-2025) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s also, crucially, a deeply humanist movie. Anderson cares about these characters deeply. Bob\u2019s frustration becomes our own, as does his concern for Willa. So many \u201cfilms of our moment\u201d have felt angry or cynical, but Anderson\u2019s movie transcends that by being human and even offering optimism. It\u2019s not one loss after another. It\u2019s one battle. Keep fighting.\n\n[The Playlist - Rodrigo Perez](https://theplaylist.net/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-declares-war-in-thrilling-comical-moving-take-on-revolution-personal-evolutions-20250917/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;From one generation to the next, the struggle endures. Fierce and unrelenting, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d burns as both an incendiary action epic and a tender family drama, alive with humor, conviction, and revolutionary spirit. And amid all its pandemonium, Sergio\u2019s reminder that \u201cfreedom is no fear\u201d lingers as the film\u2019s quiet truth, a mantra passed down like a torch. Few films this year feel so vital, so breathtaking in scope and soul. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n, indeed.\n\n[London Evening Standard - Nick Howells](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-leonardo-dicaprio-teyana-taylor-b1247490.html) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;What Anderson has turned out is something of a cinephile\u2019s visual symphony. If there were Proms devoted to films instead of music in the future, One Battle After Another would be one of the first movies to join the repertoire. And yes, Oscars must be coming...\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/09/17/one-battle-after-another-thriller-leonardo-dicaprio/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Eyes shielded by Terminator shades, tatty dressing gown flapping in the breeze, Leonardo DiCaprio tumbles through One Battle After Another looking like he\u2019s fighting several conflicts simultaneously, on physical and mental fronts...This madcap urban warfare thriller has heists, showdowns and two of the best car chases in years.\n\n[Empire - Alex Godfrey](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/one-battle-after-another/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;In years to come, when this appears on TV late at night, it\u2019ll be impossible to switch off. It\u2019s just one of those films. A stone-cold, instant classic.\n\n[Associated Press - Jake Coyle](https://apnews.com/article/one-battle-after-another-review-pta-dicaprio-354b5503260e63ff724a7ab8847d946c) \\- 100 / 100\n\n&gt;\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d as a major studio release clattering with straightforward representations of racism, xenophobia and vigilantism, is an exception in almost every way to modern-day Hollywood. I\u2019m sure that will bring debate, just as any good movie does. And I\u2019m sure some will find its American portrait muddled and chaotic. But those aspects feel true, too, just as does the movie\u2019s abiding fighting spirit.",

        "content": "It's been a couple years since I've seen it so I was nice and fresh for a rewatch. Man it hits so fucking high. I forget how good the dialouge in this movie is. \"That fucking nurse man...she ain't honest\", \"I'm not as big as you Mac\"\n\nIt really, really makes me wanna sit down and read the book. I can just feel how much context is missing from these incredible characters backgrounds. I also assume the book is set in the 50's? Because they never mention a time frame for the movie so I assume it happens in the 70's, but everything about the settting feels like the 50's\n\n\nI wanted to say this is Jack Nichelsons best performance, but I'm conflicted cause I also love The Shining. But honestly, everybody's great in this. I can't think of a single person who wasn't giving a top notch performance.\n\n\nIt's an incredible story. If you judge the plot purely by the events that happen, everything becomes worse by McMurphy arriving to the hospital. Objectively, Mac's a bad person. He has a long rep sheet, he even says I fuck and fight too much. His antics lead to a lot of bad shit happening.\n\n\nAnd yet he's exactly what those poor bastards needed to take a break from that domineering nurse and the cold, sterile enviorment she created.\n\n\nThat said, everybody remembers Nurse Ratched from this movie as the villain, but Washington the orderly is also a pretty good side villain. He takes entirely too much pleasure in pushing these outcasts around and delights in punishing them.",

For whatever reason, under marketed, weird streaming release plan, for whatever reason, a movie just flew under the radar\n\nMy example of this is \"Shimmer Lake\". I knew nothing about it going into it, I can't even remember what made me watch it. Then 10 minutes into the movie, I realized it was going to be in reverse chronological order, which I thought was a gimmick. By the end of the movie, I'm not sure they could have told it in proper sequence, it totally worked. It's was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I recommended it to my friends Whatsapp group, and those that watched it really enjoyed it as well\n\nAny under appreciated movie recommendations out there? I'm hoping to get some good movies from this thread. ",

I am making this post because I think sometimes some people can forget the power of movies.\n\nI just finished a rewatch of Tim Burton's Big Fish after maybe 15 years, which without ruining is essentially a father/son themed film. In the film, Will is estranged from his father for 3 years, and then they get closer as the story goes on. I, myself, have been estranged from my father for a similar stretch of time. As the final scene comes to a close, as the movie transitions to the credits, my phone lights up. It's my father. He hasn't called me in years. Before I could answer, the call disconnects. I stare at my phone for 5 minutes trying to comprehend the situation and I call him back. ...It goes to voicemail.\n\nI can't help but think at the moment the film ended there was a strong cosmic push, an inkling, for my father to pick up the phone and reach out but he quickly ended the call. No happy ending here, but still.....very eerie. The timing couldn't have been spookier. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Movies are magic.",

Westerns ran for years, then disaster movies in the 70s, buddy cop stuff in the 80s, the 90s had big glossy action movies and disaster flicks making a comeback. Then the superhero boom that took over the last decade. You also get smaller runs like found footage horror, YA dystopias, or the live action Disney remakes.\n\nRight now it kinda feels like horror is the only genre really thriving. Low budget, high profit, and people actually show up for them in theaters.\n\nSuperhero fatigue feels pretty real and studios don\u2019t seem as quick to gamble huge budgets anymore. Streaming has also changed how everything works. So what\u2019s next? Do mid-budget thrillers come back? Do video game movies become the new superhero wave? Do we get flooded with AI or dystopia stories? Or something totally out of left field?\n\nCurious where you all think things are headed.",
