        "content": "Every once in a while I\u2019ll remember a movie that got announced years ago, made a bunch of noise... and then just disappeared. Like it was gonna be a thing, people were attached, maybe even a script got written, and then nothing. Either it\u2019s technically still \u201cin development\u201d or it quietly died and no one said anything.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s easily the 21 Jump Street / Men in Black crossover. That\u2019s such a stupid idea but also exactly the kind of stupid I love. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill somehow getting wrapped up in alien stuff? That could\u2019ve been gold. And there was real talk of it happening. Like script written, people attached, it almost existed. What the hell happened??\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of others that pop into my head from time to time, stuff like Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Lovecraft movie, Fincher doing a Jules Verne thing, or all those weird Star Wars spinoffs that probably died the second someone changed jobs at Disney. And then there\u2019s stuff like Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, which sounds insane but apparently almost existed?\n\nAnd there\u2019s so many others. Whole graveyard of weird, wild, or straight-up insane projects that almost happened. Most of them probably wouldn\u2019t have even worked, but I still wish we got to see the mess.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one for you? The movie that got scrapped, delayed to death, or is still fake-alive in \u201cdevelopment\u201d that you\u2019d instantly buy a ticket for if it suddenly came back?\n\n",

They are both so beautyfull and fun, the sets and costumes are top of the line, the actors were perfectly cast, both are infinitely rewatchable. It would be really hard for me to think of similar comedies from recent years, to be fair i dont watch too many comedies in general but it doesnt help that any time one find itself in front of me its either crass or loud or lewd or just cringe and awkward in general. \n\nI can only recommend them to everyone.\n\nIts not exactly old but i just wanna mention Mad Max Fury Road. Its perfect how every little detail comes together like gears in a clock, each time i watch it i notice new details wich just makes me apreciate it more. The behind the scenes just make it all more impressive, they actually did everything they could practically, no corners cut, and it really does make a diference, it actually feels like looking into a whole diferent world.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\nI've been thinking a lot about how film can express emotional isolation, and two movies really stood out to me: Her and Hello, My Name is Doris.\n\nHer shows loneliness in the future, where connection is technically easier but emotionally harder. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character is constantly surrounded by people and technology, yet his longing for intimacy is palpable. The relationship he builds with the AI feels so human because it's rooted in that deep need to be seen and understood. The AI thing feels very prescient to our current times.\n\nOn the other hand Hello, My Name is Doris tackles loneliness from a different angle: aging and grief. Doris is quirky and imaginative, but she\u2019s stuck in a life where she feels left behind. The film blends humor and melancholy in a way that really hit me, especially in how it portrays the quiet ache of wanting something more, even late in life. In a way the movie feels kinda like 500 Days of Summer but with the genders switched where Doris ended up falling in love with the idea she had of a man, not the man himself. \n\nWould love to hear what movies made you feel the weight of loneliness. Any underrated ones I should check out?",

        "content": "I don't see so much about Robert Altman these days. Granted, he's been dead for almost 20 years now (RIP) but he was one of the most talented and creative (IMO) of the \"New Hollywood\" directors, as well as one of the most distinctive stylistically (I don't think anyone can really argue with that). \n\nWould there be any interest in forming a r/RobertAltman subreddit? (EDIT: There *is* a sub but it's only got six members! Let's go, people!)\n\nI re-watched *McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller* recently, and I was really struck by how dedicated Altman was to the idea of \"show, don't tell.\" Most films, even when they don't rely heavily on exposition, still have various cinematic tools they use to \"tell\" you what's going on or direct your attention to whatever is important. \n\nBut Altman, with his wandering camera and overlapping dialogue, literally just drops you in the middle of a scene and lets you figure it out for yourself. The information is all there, and each line of dialogue can be extremely important, but the presentation is (obviously) much more naturalistic than most movies, so it really feels like we're just watching a piece of real life rather than a cinematic artifice. \n\nI found this great quotation from him in the *McCabe* commentary track, referring to Warren Beatty writing his own lines: \n\n&gt;I'm sure that Warren wrote these things. It didn't make any difference because the structure... we knew what the structure was [that] we wanted, and the dialogue in these kinds of films, uh, seems to me is part of the character of the actors and it's not the words that are important; it's not what words are said because, you know, that's too related to theater where you're trying to advance plot by the words. When you have close-ups of people and faces that you can push right up into the audience, it's just better that the words come from the moment or from the actors themselves, I feel. \n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts on Altman or his ideas on cinema? Suffice it to say that I find him to be a genius, and even his most awkward misfires are still more interesting than the best films a lot of directors ever make. \n\nMy favorites by him are *The Long Goodbye*, *Thieves Like Us*, *3 Women*, *The Player* and *Gosford Park* (although I'm long overdue to re-watch *Short Cuts* and a lot of his other movies).

        "content": "I absolutely love Speed Racer 2008 and I find it incredibly creative and unique. I still haven't seen anything truly like it since then. First off, wow is this movie visually unique, and in my opinion visually stunning. It looks like a moving comic book, a live action cartoon or anime. It doesn't just look like one either, everything is very heightened and stylistic, the way characters talk, the cinematography, and all the vibrant colors make it look and feel like a live action cartoon/anime. Another thing the action and racing scenes are crazy, you've got races on hot wheels meets wacky races meets fever dream race tracks, cars can defy the laws of physics and do so constantly, but it's so frenetic yet so smooth and fluid/slick looking. There's this one shot towards the end with speed slickly maneuvered down the track, and there's a split second close up of the 6 on the side of the car. Man, I love shit like that, it's badass and creative to me. Not to mention there is both car fu with cars literally bonking into each other and doing a car version of pro wrestling, there's actual kung fu as well, with full on martial arts scenes.\n\nDespite all the chaos, there is genuine sincerity and it has a heart, and even something to say. It has an anti mega corporation and corruption message, themes about standing up for what's right and what you believe in, and it owns that message. Another nice detail is the family genuinely cares about each other and helps each other through hard times, which I find kinda rare to see done so sincerely in a family movie like this. Also racer X is awesome, and like a batman and daredevil hybrid. Speed is awesome too and just a genuine good person, at least from what I remember. Finally, this movie is just fun man, it's energetic and has good vibes for me. Probably helped I saw it in theaters as a kid, so childhood memories and nostalgia kinda drive it, pun intended, but what do you guys think? Is it underrated? A cult classic? Rightfully rated? Let me know, I'm curious on differing opinions.",
