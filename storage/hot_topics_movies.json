        "content": "We all know the songs, and the sass. I was curious to see the voices behind the best characters in Hercules. And I wasn\u2019t disappointed in the least. These women\u2019s voices should be praised. They hold a huge part of our childhood and we never even knew their names or faces.  So a big shout to (and I\u2019m absolutely copying and pasting this to get it right) Lillias White (Calliope), Cheryl Freeman (Melpomene), LaChanze (Terpsichore), Roz Ryan (Thalia), and Van\u00e9ese Y. Thomas (Clio).\n",

        "content": "I was just watching Death Becomes Her for the bazillionth time and thinking that it may be my favorite ever Bruce Willis performance simply because of how ...not Brucey it is.\n\nHis character is flaaaaaaacid, neurotic, cowardly, fickle for most of the film - so unlike the usually steely or cocky Bruce we're used to.\n\nAnother \"overlooked performance\" I love is RDJ as Wayne Gayle in Natural Born Killers.\n\nIt's not necessarily a stretch for him but it's rarely mentioned when people think about iconic Robert Downey Jr roles, even though he was one of the most quotable parts of the film!!\n\nThat got me thinking...\n\nWhat are some other \"overlooked\" or \"under appreciated\" performances that are somehow not often mentioned when discussing an actors body of work but are your fave?",

        "content": "One for me would have to be Sahara with Mathew McConaughey. A fun cast and limitless source material. If it was a bit less cheesy...it could have been great. If I recall correctly, Clive Cussler wasn't overly happy with how the movie turned out. A great side-kick with Steve Zahn and I'm sure they could have had Penelope Cruz return somehow (I think the books had different female leads?). Thoughts?",

What other iconic movie characters made such an unforgettable first impression the moment they appeared on screen?",

Are there any films from that era now that you'll happily go back and watch again and again? ",

You could have a mid-tier movie with all kinds extra content that really deepened the fan experience. Things like making of documentaries, sfx documentaries, interviews with cast/crew, commentary, short films, were all amazing, especially for a smaller film you loved. Plus getting to hear technical talk from a cinematographer or director always helped understand the process so much better and expanded your appreciation of film in general. ",
