        "content": "Hi Reddit! I'm Kue Lawrence and I've been acting since I was 5 years old. My first movie was Beautiful Boy as a younger Timothee Chalamet with Steve Carell as my dad. You might have seen me as Young Sam in Atypical, getting tricked with magic by Justin Willman on Magic For Humans, or getting a car pulled out of my nose on 911 Lonestar. Additionally I was beat up by Fred Armisen on ITYSL, played a bully on The Rehearsal with Nathan Fielder, and was sassy with Nasim Pedrad on Chad. I had a wonderful time as guest star Mason on Leverage Redemption \"The Date Night Job\" and recurred as Benji playing Allison Tolman's son on Season 2 of Good Girls. \n\nI had supporting roles in the horror films Do Not Reply, Deathcember, and The Amityville Murders with Diane Franklin and Paul Ben-Victor as my parents. This year I voiced Young Dante in Devil May Cry, and I have 3 lead roles in movies releasing. Here are their trailers:\n\nSKETCH - I play older brother Jack Wyatt, in theaters now! Trailer:\n\n[https://youtu.be/kKPcjYX3C40?si=a36ckSIrmJ0gCV0R](https://youtu.be/kKPcjYX3C40?si=a36ckSIrmJ0gCV0R)\n\nMARSHMALLOW - I am the main character Morgan, available on VOD! Trailer:\n\n[https://youtu.be/Or4VqCKPWSE?si=OdbREqEVSDDl2c9X](https://youtu.be/Or4VqCKPWSE?si=OdbREqEVSDDl2c9X)\n\nTHE SCHOOL DUEL - I got the honor of playing Sammy, currently in film festivals!

I'll be answering questions starting at 4 PM ET today. (Wednesday 8/13)",

        "content": "Nobody 2 - Review Thread\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nobody_2): 84% (56 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nobody-2/): 60 (18 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-1236487377/https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-1236487377/) (70):\n\n&gt;For a while, the movie is like \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Vacation\u201d if Clark Griswold had secretly been Steven Seagal. Is it remotely \u201cbelievable\u201d? No. But \u201cNobody 2,\u201d like \u201cNobody\u201d before it, unfolds in its own weirdly grounded action-fantasy universe. Odenkirk has the ability to make behaving glumly fretful seem like a form of slyness; he\u2019s really creating a conspiracy with the audience.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-sharon-stone-1236342504/) (80):\n\n&gt;The filmmakers keep things moving at such a brisk pace (the film clocks in at a mercifully brief 89 minutes) that you go along for the ride, and there are so many terrific action sequences and injections of mordant, deadpan humor that it proves wildly entertaining.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk/) (79):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s like a National Lampoon movie where Chevy Chase is a mass murderer. That\u2019s a great pitch, dang it, and Timo Tjahjanto throws it at 105 miles per hour.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/nobody-2-review/v) (70):\n\n&gt;So while the familiarity is felt throughout, it's hard not to cheer, chuckle, and cringe at all the chaotic mayhem that unfolds in Nobody 2. It's not trying to be anything other than an ultra-violent late summer action flick, and if you go in expecting to watch some gnarly kills, brutal fist-fights, and gun-fu, you'd have to think pretty hard to feel disappointed.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-2-review) (70):\n\n&gt;Though not quite as strong as the first, Nobody 2 still consistently reminds us of how much fun it is to watch Bob Odenkirk unleash the action hero few expected he had within him. \u00a0\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1938864/nobody-2-movie-review/)(70):\n\n&gt;Will Nobody 2 set hearts aflame? No. If this had been the first \"Nobody,\" no one would have been clamoring for a sequel. But it is a glorious Saturday matin\u00e9e, a brisk trifle for the waning days of summer. It's the kind of movie that you'll remember better for the friends you saw it with than the movie itself. And that can be one of cinema's most important functions.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-1235144840/) (C-):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s really no sense of any particular care or passion in the sequel, which frequently feels like the hurried Wikipedia plot summary of a more fleshed-out film that doesn\u2019t actually exist.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDirected by Timo Tjahjanto:\n\n&gt;Workaholic assassin Hutch Mansell takes his family on a much-needed vacation to the small tourist town of Plummerville. However, he soon finds himself in the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator, a shady sheriff, and a bloodthirsty crime boss.\n\nCast:\n\n* Bob Odenkirk\u00a0as Hutch Mansell\n* Connie Nielsen\u00a0as Becca Mansell\n* John Ortiz\u00a0as Henry\n* RZA\u00a0as Harry Mansell\n* Colin Hanks\u00a0as Abel\n* Christopher Lloyd\u00a0as David Mansell\n* Sharon Stone\u00a0as Lendina",

        "content": "I just read an article yesterday, Matthew McConaughey tested for the role of Jack in Titanic. They made it sound like he was the frontrunner, but when James Cameron asked him to do another take opposite Kate Winslet (without his southern accent) he said, 'No. That was pretty good. Thanks.'\n\nTom Hardy was so late to the set of \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" that he kept people waiting for horus for him--finally Charlize Theron had a verbal confrontation with him as a result because he did it so persistently.\n\nRaquel Welch - Apparently, she was constantly late on the set (\"The Biggest Bundle of Them All\"), keeping the cast and crew waiting for hours while she had her hair and make-up done. When co-star Edward G. Robinson went off on her in a 10-minute tirade, she burst into tears and apologized. But she showed up late the very next day.\n\nFaye Dunaway, according to Bette Davis. Reading the Mommie Dearest book, Diana Scarwid and Faye hated each other. Faye was constantly having scenes changed at the last minute, with changes that benefitted her. Diana was so appalled by Faye's behavior that she contemplated quitting the business for good after making the movie.\n\nFaye also got so into filming the scene where she chokes Christina that she wound up hitting Rutayna Alda in the chest. Jocelyn Brando was scared shitless that Faye was going to hit her as well.",
