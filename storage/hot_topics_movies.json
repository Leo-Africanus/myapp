        "title": "Watched The Wolf of Wall Street again yesterday and something clicked about how Scorsese tells the story",
        "content": "It feels like the entire movie is shot from inside Jordan Belfort\u2019s head. All the excess, the money, drugs, parties, sex is exaggerted to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile the truly dark consequencs never feel as brutal as they realistically were. Scorsese easily could\u2019ve shown the damage in a far more disturbing, grounded way, but he doesn\u2019t. And I think that choice is deliberate.\n\nThe \u201cI drove home safely\u201d scene is the clearest example. In Belfort\u2019s mind, he\u2019s a genius who kept it together. Then we see the actual reality total destruction. That one scene tells you everything, the movie isn\u2019t showing the world as it is, but as belfort believes it to be.\n\nThat\u2019s why the film feels like its \u201cglorifying\u201d the lifestyle. It\u2019s not Scorsese glorifyng it its belfort. We\u2019re stuck inside his delusion the whole time. The highs look incredible because he thinks they were. The lows feel softened because he never processed the harm he caused.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the final scene, which I honestly think is a masterpiece. Belfort is reduced to giving sales seminars, but Scorsese frames it like he\u2019s still the king he imagines himself to be. What hit me the most was the audiences faces all staring at him with this mix of hope, desperation, and admiration. It\u2019s Scorseses final punchline that belfort may have fallen, but the world is still eager to be sold the same dream.\n\nThe cycle continues, and people still want what he represents even after seeing how hollow and destructive it is.\n\nTo me, that ending recontextualizes the whole movie. It\u2019s not just a story about Belfort. Its about the audience both in the film and in real life who are still drawn to the fantasy he built.\n\nEdit: A few people pointed out that this idea is already established in the very first shot where jordan corrects the color of the car. And yeah, that absolutely sets the rule for the whole movie.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what I meant. im talking about how Scorsese goes beyond that one meta moment. He builds an entire visual language around Belfort\u2019s warped perception. It\u2019s not just that Jordan changes tiny details, the whole world is filmed the way he wants to remember it, almost like reality is bending itself around his fantasy.\n\nAnd the irony is that the truth only breaks through in brief, jarring bursts like the real version of the driving scene, Naomi throwing water on him, the yacht sinking moments where Scorsese essentially grabs the camera back from Jordan and shows the objective version of events.\n\nso yes, that first shot establishes the rule.  \nbut what im pointing at is the way Scorsese keeps that rule alive throughout the entire film, basically letting us watch a movie that feels codirected by jordans own delusions. Thats why the excess feels so shiny, why the darkness feels blunted, and why the whole thing plays like one long, unreliable flashback.",

However before the movie could start production, Idol got into a very bad car accident, and was heavily injured, hence why Idol didn't end up playing the role of T-1000. That was a weird choice at the time but looking at it now, it's crazy that Idol almost ended up getting the role in the first place since he's a singer and wasn't an actor in terms of film &amp; television in the first place to begin with.\n\nAs of a result, Robert Patrick ended up replacing Idol to play the T-1000 and the rest is history.",

Jake Gyhlenhall's performance in the movie is fantastic but Heath Ledger was truly the best part of the movie for me. the way he portrayed his emotions felt so real to me. \nI have never felt so empty and broken after watching a movie. \nfor years, I always dismissed this movie as just a movie about gay cowboys because growing up, thats all I was really told about the movie. \nI was not prepared for how this movie would make me feel afterwards. \nfor the people who dismiss this movie or hate this movie because the characters are gay, please I beg you watch this movie with an open mind. I promise you will find something about it you love. \n",

There are also multiple tense moments. \n\nMaybe the action scenes are a bit lacking, especially with the later Brosnan and Craig installments.

        "content": "I just finished watching Aftersun (2022) after avoiding it for years and now I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life. I thought it would be nice to finally see it before I leave my 20s. This story will stay with me for the rest of my lifetime. I'm so devasted in all the right ways. \n\n\nI'll be turning 30 tomorrow and I haven't been sleeping well recently. On the bus ride yesterday, I felt so anxious to the point that I couldn't breathe and every moment, I feel like I'm going to vomit, explode and vanish into nothingness. Being 29 feels like drowning, especially if your \"personal progress\" is slow and your socially and economically successful high school classmates are now planning a second reunion after the last one two years ago.\n\n\nI relate to Calum a lot. I've never been diagnosed of depression because we can't afford things like that but I know I have for most of my life. There were moments in the film where I thought he was gonna drown himself. Then he went alone in the ocean. When he almost got run over by a bus and just didn't care. When he didn't join Sophie to sing karaoke even though it's a tradition for both of them because you've already lost interest in doing things that you used to love. \n\n\nIdk. The film is gripping in powerful ways. It genuinely shocked me that I was actually watching a flashback from a kid's little camcoder. \n\n\nAlso, as an asexual, please correct me if I'm wrong but the film was also hinting at Calum's sexuality which is probably a portion of his internal struggles? The interaction with the diving instructor. Sophie observing two boys kissing then cuts to Calum alone in the ocean (or sea?). On the way to the sea, he picked up a secondhand fag (non-derogatory) thrown by a woman from what seemed to be a straight couple. Business partner \"Keith\" and that they'll move in together and have a spare room for Sophie in case she wanted to visit. How Calum suddenly got up from listening to music then his energy lit up when they were playing in the pool with that pool guy. How he said Scotland is not for him because probably homophobia is rampant there during his time. How Calum and Sophie's mother stayed friends after they'd broken up. Straights can be friends with their exes, yes, but perhaps they broke up because Calum is gay/queer. The gentle parenting of \"You can talk to me about anything\". Like, a reassurance that no matter who you are, you're still my kid. Then the film reveals Sophie, all grown, built in a family as a queer woman. I think Calum would have loved to know more about that. \ud83d\udc94 \ud83e\udd7a Under Pressure by David Bowie and Queen. Come on. Please tell me I'm not alone in this?\n\n\nI will think about this film whilst doing my morning walk. Paul Mescal was marvelous in this. The actor for Sophie was amazing, too. I wish I was as cool as Sophie when I was eleven. The film's portrayal of Sophie, a kid, getting exposed to more adult things which leads to self-discovery is so rooted in reality. So impressive!",

One aspect of the movie that's really... different, so to speak, is that literally all but one of the kidnappers are a-okay with killing the kid from the get-go.\n\nThe woman in particular seemed to have a serious personal grudge / vendetta against the kid from their very first interaction (\"I'm scared to shit of this kid\" - why?), and then further on &gt;! she seemed like the most eager one to kill the kid, even after it becomes clear they aren't getting any money !&lt;. This really made me think if there was a deleted sideplot of hers or something or if the movie was just making her out to be a total sociopath. \n\nAny movies made you feel like you're missing something about a character's motivation and/or intentions?",

It\u2019s my favorite of all time. ",
