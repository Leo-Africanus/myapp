        "content": "Hey r/movies, I\u2019m Stephen King. You might know me from Stand By Me, It, or Shawshank Redemption, but my latest project is actually the first book I ever wrote. The Long Walk hits theaters on September 12. Ask me anything about the book or movie. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8)\n\n&gt;In a dystopian United States ruled by a totalitarian regime, a group of young men enter an annual walking contest in which they must maintain a speed of at least three miles per hour or risk execution. The contest ends when only one walker remains alive.\n\nIt stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Ben Wang, Charlie Plummer, Roman Griffin Davis, Garrett Wareing, Joshua Odjick, Tut Nyuot, Mark Hamill, Judy Greer, and Josh Hamilton. \n\nI'll be back on Wednesday 8/27 at 12:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\n",

I know there was a novel, but Jesus, how did he channel this character and his destruction so perfectly. \n\nWas watching videos of Tarantino talking about this movie and his love and respect for it. Watched this scene with fresh eyes and it just reminds me of the few but deranged narcissists I've had in my life. \n\nPerfect scene of a narcissist in full abuse mode.\n\nAlso, the end of that scene where Daniel is fatherly, and they have a close relationship is what makes a relationship with a malignant narcissist so painful. \n\nThere were good times. There were great times. But the narcissists are programmed to discard, and those in their wrath and path are made to feel like actual garbage that can be thrown away. \n\nIts confusing. Lewis just nails it",

        "content": "it's a miserable rainy Tuesday here so I stuck on The Truman Show for the first time in years while working\n\nI've probably seen it 5 or 6 times but the ending just gets me. The bit where he hits the 'sky', finds the door, and Christof is talking to him... it's just perfect filmmaking. The whole concept of the movie is incredible and feels more relevant now than it did back then.\n\nBut it's that final moment that always hits me. He doesn't have a big angry speech. He just smiles and says \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" and then takes a bow and leaves.\n\nThere's just something so hopeful and terrifying and brilliant about it. It\u2019s one of those scenes that\u2019s just permanently burned into my brain.\n\nWhat are some other movie endings or single scenes that have that effect on you? The kind that you think about for days after you watch it.",

The theological/religious/philosophical debates were really fascinating - I particularly loved Hugh Grant's \"iterations\" monologue.\n\nBut I was so surprised by Hugh Grant, himself, as he plays against type. Or should I say typecast? He seems to be having a lot of fun with the role, not to mention excellent in this role.",

Sometimes all it takes is one role that doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nFor me, Gangs of New York is a big one. And surprisingly, Terminator Genisys too. It might have been a bad (or even average) movie on its own, but casting Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, a character meant to be a hardened survivor, just killed it completely. \n\nWhat movies do you think were ruined by casting choices?",

This is not the first time this has happened. At this point, it's less of a surprise and more of a realization 'That makes sense' when I see something was based on King's work. I sort of have two questions. What are your favorite King adaptations? Also, is there an author that has nearly as many adaptations as King? I'm genuinely curious.",
