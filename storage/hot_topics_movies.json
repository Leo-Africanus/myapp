        "content": "Every year, I go to the movie theater as much as possible. It's my favorite place in the world. I first started keeping track/scores/reviews/ticket stubs in 2015. Since then, I've seen 1,827 different movies in theaters: 5 in 2015, 9 in 2016, 146 in 2017, 162 in 2018, 192 in 2019, 44 in 2020, 86 in 2021, 270 in 2022, 325 in 2023, 298 in 2024, and 290 this year.\n\nFor this ranking, I'm only counting movies I saw in theaters, nothing that I watched at home. I'm not counting re-watches. I don't have a specific scoring system, it's just a rating I give to the movie right after watching.  I've included a few re-releases, short films, and TV series, as long as they were seen in a theater (and for the first time). This is all just for fun and not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional movie critic. I just like going to the movies.\n\nI attended 9 film festivals in 2025 for a total of 124 movies. 97 movies had cast and/or crew in attendance for Q&amp;As. There were 26 World Premieres, 11 North American Premieres, 11 Canadian Premieres, 11 East Coast Premieres, 17 Southeast Premieres, 20 Florida/Georgia/Orlando/US/Tampa/South Florida/International Premieres:\n\n* Toronto International Film Festival - 29 Movies in 7 Days\n* SCAD Savannah Film Festival - 29 Movies in 8 Days\n* Fantasia Film Festival - 18 Movies in 6 Days\n* Florida Film Festival - 13 Movies in 5 Days\n* Miami Film Festival - 11 Movies in 5 Days\n* Popcorn Frights Film Festival - 11 Movies in 8 Days\n* Gasparilla International Film Festival - 6 Movies in 3 Days\n* Miami Jewish Film Festival - 5 Movies in 3 Days\n* Rendez-Vous Cinema Quebec - 2 Movies in 2 Days\n\nThere were 11 movies that I re-watched in theaters:\n\n* **One Battle After Another** - x7\n* **Hamnet** - x3\n* **Nouvelle Vague** - x2\n* **Sinners** - x2\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - x2\n* **The Testament of Ann Lee** - x2\n* **Highest 2 Lowest** - x2\n* **The Life of Chuck** - x2\n* **Him** - x2\n* **Twinless** - x2\n* **Sentimental Value** - x2\n\nI have AMC's A-List, Regal's Unlimited, Cinemark's MovieClub, as well as memberships to the Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Toronto film societies.\n\nI saw 290 movies in theaters in 2025. Here is my full ranking:\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n* **The Testament of Ann Lee** - 10/10 - It's a sprawling, intoxicating, and beautiful historical-epic with some of the best dance-sequence choreography I've ever seen on film. All of the performances are perfect, the songs/prayers are all memorable, the narration grabs you from the first second and never lets go, and it's got the most confident directing of the year. I wanted 5 more hours of Mother Ann's story. In a fair world, Amanda Seyfried is the runaway Best Actress Oscar winner. This'll go down as one of the best period-dramas of the 21st century. There's one or two masterpieces per year, *Ann Lee* a no-doubter for one of those spots.\n* **One Battle After Another**\t- 10/10 - Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville Junction.\t\n* **Marty Supreme** - 10/10 \t\t\n* **The Perfect Neighbor** - 9/10 - I've not cried in a movie theater this much since *Moonlight*. It's the kind of movie that will make your blood boil and will make you melt to your seat by the end. The bodycam footage where the dad has to tell his two sons that their mother isn't coming home is something that will leave a scar on your heart forever. It's also very impressive on a technical level, the best documentary editing since *Apollo 11* in 2019. I can't imagine all of the work that went into piecing this thing together. \n* **Sinners** - 9/10\t\t\n* **Brokeback Mountain** (Re-Release) - 9/10 - I'm a bit late to the party here, this 20th anniversary theatrical-release was the first time I've seen this movie, and goddamn was it worth the wait. One of the most powerful love stories ever shot. It's the ultimate \"what could've been\" love story. Heath's performance is generational. I'm now a card-carrying member of the *Brokeback Mountain* Was Robbed for Best Picture by *Crash* Society\u2122. \t\n* **Warfare** - 9/10 - You can't talk about *Warfare* without first shouting out the insanely-great sound design. You could watch this movie with your eyes closed and still be impressed. An impossibly-tense war movie that makes 95 minutes feel like 10 minutes. It's really this generation's *Black Hawk Down* (huge compliment). It's a lot more grounded and believable though, with an outstanding ensemble cast. I love that nobody is a supersoldier in this, just guys in a bad spot in a bad point in time. It doesn't glorify but it also doesn't minimize. This movie will stand the test of time as one of the best war films of the decade. This thing was custom-built in a movie-lab just for me.\n* **Sorry, Baby** - 9/10 - Eva Victor is 2025's major revelation. This movie is heartbreaking, hilarious, bittersweet, and soul-warming. It's probably the best Original Screenplay of the year too. This made me realize how much I really missed Lucas Hedges. So cool to see him pop up again. \n* **Bugonia** - 9/10 - Yorgos doesn't miss.\t\t\n* **Hamnet**- 9/10 - An all-time child-actor performance from Jacobi Jupe. This movie is equally soul-crushing and hopeful. Jessie Buckley's close-up when Hamnet &gt;!dies!&lt; is pound-for-pound the best single scene of the year.\t\n* **F1** - 9/10 - As far as fun-summer-blockbuster movies go, *F1* is as good as it gets. It's this year's *Top Gun: Maverick*. Was it cliche? Yes. Was it predictable? Yes. Did I have a fucking blast for 2 hours? Also, yes.\tKeep pumping these out, Apple.\n* **The Phoenician Scheme** - 9/10 - *Asteroid City* &amp; *The French Dispatch* were slight missteps, but Wes Anderson is officially back. This movie overflows with heart &amp; laughs. (with 10/10 production/set design as usual)\t\n* **Sacrifice** - 9/10 - Anya Taylor-Joy was born to play an Icelandic eco-terrorist and Chris Evans was born to play the narcissitic, A-List actor in a rut suddenty thrust back into the limelight. Gorgeously shot, laugh-a-minute first act. I had a really great time with this one, it reminded me a lot of *Don't Look Up*.\tVery surprised everyone hates it.\n* **The Smashing Machine** - 9/10\t\t\n* **Magazine Dreams** - 8/10 - Jonathan Majors comes in with maybe one of the most physically-demanding performances of all time. Without the real-life drama, this might've been an Oscar-winning role for him. Great movie. \t\n* **Highest 2 Lowest** - 8/10 - If it wasn't for an extremely uneven first act and some classic weird Spike quirks in there, like insane transitions and some \"how do you do, fellow kids?\" moments , this would be one of the best movies of the year. It's still really really great, and the insane score kind of grows on you as it goes. Denzel is at the top of his game. My favorite Original Song of the year at the end. \t\n* **Train Dreams** - 8/10 - It takes a while to grow on you. It might take an hour, it might take 5 days, but it'll eventually hit you like a....train (sorry). It's a beautiful slow burn about appreciating life's fleeting and rare moments of joy. The world keeps going on without you, and that's okay. It's extremely reflective and existential. Beautiful stuff. It did what *A Ghost Story* did for me a few years ago. \t\n* **Presence**\t- 8/10 - Lucy Liu. No notes.\t\n* **It Was Just An Accident** - 8/10 - A lot more humor than I expected. The most impressive longshot of the year with that interrogation scene near the end. Mariam Afshari deserves more attention. And holy fuck does that pin-drop ending hit. There's a few ways you can interpret the ending too which is really cool.\t\n* **The Threesome** - 8/10 \n* **Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie** - 8/10 - If you like satirical comedies (like *Borat*), just do yourself a favor and check it out. You\u2019ll laugh more in the first 30 minutes than in any movie of the past 5 years.\t\n* **I'm Still Here** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Black Bag** - 8/10\t\n* **Nouvelle Vague** - 8/10 - A fun, sweet, breezy, delicate ode to the French New Wave. A movie for movie nerds. Zoey Deutch is a delight and Guillaume Marbeck is one of the year's breakout actors.\t\n* **Left-Handed Girl** - 8/10 - A beautiful slice-of-life family drama that\u2019s right up my alley. Wonderful performances from the 2 young leads (their first major roles) and possibly the catchiest theme track of the year. All fans of Sean Baker should check this one out. Nina Ye killed it at the Q&amp;A. \t\n* **Splitsville** - 8/10 - Hilarious, sharp, sexy. One of the better recent romantic-comedies (big emphasis on comedy). I laughed more during the first fight sequence than probably any other single scene this year. Advice for any shlubby screenwriters out there: co-writing a sharp, funny screenplay where your romantic interestes are 10/10s like Dakota and Adria is a good move.\t\n* **It Ends** - 8/10 - Sometimes you're lucky enough to catch a great movie from a first-time director and you know they'll blow up soon. This is that movie for 2025. \t\t\n* **The Count of Monte Cristo** - 8/10 - You don't get these types of epics much anymore. Really well made and crafted. It's the best Monte Cristo has ever looked on screen.\t\n* **Oh, Hi!** - 8/10 \t\t\n* **Sacramento** - 8/10 - Michael Cera, how I've missed you.\t\t\n* **Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Is This Thing On?** - 8/10 - Career-best stuff from Will Arnett. If only Laura Dern's character wasn't so poorly-written and shitty. Great, improv-like scenes in the comedy club.\n* **Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery**\t8/10 - Doesn't quite reach the peak of the first one, but it's a step up from the 2nd. It's a lot more personal and dark than the other 2, which I really liked, and it keeps the (sometimes-outdated) humor.\n* **Fucktoys** - 8/10 - It's *Anora* on mushrooms. It's weird, it's gross, it's got a ton of sex and some violence. It's kind of a modern nasty fairy tale. It's everything you want. Would recommend. Annapurna Sriram is a major talent to watch out for.\t\n* **Urchin** - 8/10 - Part Safdie, part Glazer, part Leigh. A really confident and impressive debut film from Harris Dickinson. Harry Dillane is magnetic.\t\n* **Eternity** - 8/10\n* **Predator: Badlands** - 8/10\t\n* **A Quiet Place** w/ Live Commentary (Re-Release) - 8/10 - This was the first \"live commentary\" screening I've ever attended. It was with co-writers Scott Beck &amp; Bryan Woods (who also co-directed *Heretic*), moderated by Josh Malerman (who wrote *Bird Box*). A very fun screening, very insightful and amusing. Think Mystery Science Theater 3000, but for an actually-good movie.\t\n* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** - 8/10 \t\n* **Companion** - 8/10\t\n* **No Other Land** - 8/10 - Incredible achievement in documentary filmmaking. almost unfurls like a narrative drama. The only documentary other than *20 Days In Mariupol* that's made me want to look away. It's really impressive how angry it makes you but also weaves in beautiful little funny moments of humanity that bring you back down to earth. You would think that \"pouring cement down village water wells\" was a cartoonish movie-villain move that would never actually happen in real life, but nope, it happens.\t\n* **The Girl with the Needle** - 8/10 - Sometimes you just need a Cristian Mungiu-like hit of depression. This filled that hole.\n* **28 Years Later**\t- 8/10 \n* **The Long Walk** - 8/10 - Not shying away from the brutality/violence is this movie's biggest strength. David Jonsson and Cooper Hoffman are perfect together. It's a very unique post-apocalyptic film, a different feel from the usual YA slop. Mark Hamill is very goofy and bad though. Rough casting there.\t\n* **Sentimental Value** - 8/10 - This was a lot better on 2nd watch. In her limited screentime, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas puts in the best supporting performance of the year. She is the heart &amp; soul of this movie. Truly heartbreaking stuff when Renate reads her the monologue at the table.\n* **The History of Sound** - 8/10 - Shoutout to this movie for introducing me to Silver Dagger, probably the greatest folk song ever. I've had different covers of it playing on repeat since the minute I left the theater. Paul Mescal was amazing in his rendition. Beautiful, *Brokeback Mountain*-like love story about what could've been and regrets.\t\n* **A House of Dynamite** - 8/10 -  It's only fair to score this by act: First Act: 10/10 - Movie-of-the-year potential. Thrilling and engaging. I wanted to cry everytime Rebecca Ferguson was on screen. Second Act: 8/10: The greatest TV pilot episode you've ever seen. Greta Lee keeps getting done dirty though. Third Act: 3/10 - What a fumble nooooooooo Kathryn noooooooo.\t\n* **My Mom Jayne** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Sirat** - 8/10 - Sound design that will have your clothes shaking during the rave sequences and have you jump during the (extremely) unexpected death scene(s). A great (but extremely bleak) odyssey through the desert set against the backdrop of the world falling apart. Good shit.\t\n* **She Dances** - 8/10 - Whenever Steve and Audrey Zahn are on-screen together, the scenes burst with authenticity and genuineness. The script is sweet, funny when it needs to be, and sometimes brings out a few tears. Really great little family-drama. \t\n* **Hamilton** - 8/10 \t\n* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10 - Danny and Michael Philippou should be thrown in fucking jail for that scene of the kid chewing on the knife. \n* **Sovereign** - 8/10\t\n* **Weapons** - 8/10\t\n* **Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair** - 8/10 - Confession: I had only seen bits and pieces of both *Kill Bill* movies prior to this. I had an abolute blast. The 2nd half doesn't quite live up to the first though. \t\n* **Avatar: Fire and Ash** - 8/10 - Oona Chaplin awoke something in me. i'm now a Varangsexual.\t\t\n* **Mile End Kicks**\t- 8/10 - Chandler Levack is Canada\u2019s brightest up and coming filmmaker since Xavier Dolan. Pls keep her on your radar. Now she needs to make a movie without an annoyingly-unlikeable lead.\t\n* **Nuremberg** - 8/10 - Your dad's pick for Best Picture. I had really low expectations, a 2.5-hour WW2 courtroom drama sounds like Oscar-bait 20 years too late, but a really tight script and perfect pacing kept me thoroughly engaged. It's also the best Russell Crowe performance since...*Gladiator*? Good stuff. I'm back on the WW2 movie train. Leo Woodall knocks it out of the pack with his monologue too. Out of nowhere.\n* **The Naked Gun** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Twinless** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Rebuilding** - 8/10 - Lowkey family-drama set in the aftermath of a fire that destroys a man's family ranch. Josh O'Connor is outstanding as usual.\t\n* **Eric LaRue** - 8/10\t\t\n* **The Life of Chuck** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Frankenstein** - 8/10 - It's undoubtedly technically impressive, probably deserves Oscar nominations in most tech categories. The cast and crew is stacked, and it's solid, but there's a major thing keeping it from being truly great/top 25 of the year: an interesting story. It's really good but classic GDT style-over-substance like *Crimson Peak*.\t\n* **Megadoc** - 8/10 - Almost makes up for the actual movie. Almost. The Francis/Shia and Aubrey/Dustin dynamics were really fascinating to watch. Really great doc about the chaos of filmmaking. It's a shame Adam Driver and Nathalie Emmanuel didn't want to be filmed for it, but I can't say I blame them.\t\n* **Jay Kelly**\t- 8/10\n* **Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere** - 8/10 - Everyone else is wrong, this thing was good. Atlantic City forever.\n* **Rosemary's Baby** (Re-Release) - 8/10\n* **Hurry Up Tomorrow**- 8/10 - Maybe throw me in jail for this but I thought this thing rocked?  Part *Vox Lux*, part *Misery*, part *Good Time*. Jenna Ortega absolutely smashes it (wish the whole movie was from her POV tbh) and Keoghan/Abel are pretty solid as well. If you can look over the self indulgence (which is kinda the point) and a bad 5-minute sequence near the end, this is a banger. The score and camework alone make it watchable. Trey Edward Shults fan until the day I die.\t\n* **Together** - 8/10\t\t\n* **Americana** - 8/10 - It does jump the shark a bit near the end when like 45 people die and it becomes a bit unbelievable, but it's a fun Tarantino-like crime story and Sidney Sweeney/Paul Walter Hauser are great together.\t\n* **It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley** - 8/10\t\t\n* **The Fantastic Four: First Steps** - 7/10\t\t\n* **The Damned** - 7/10 - Claustrophobic period-pieces are my shit. An overlooked January-dump movie that deserves more praise.\t\n* **The Ballad of Wallis Island** - 7/10\t\n* **She Rides Shotgun** - 7/10\n* **Christy** - 7/10 \n* **Roofman** 7/10 - A perfectly-solid action-crime-comedy with a stellar Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst. This would've made $200M domestic 20 years ago. It doesn't have the usual emotional devastation that you'd expect from a Derek Cianfrance film, but that's fine. \t\n* **Thunderbolts** - 7/10 - Like most people, I'm kinda \"over\" the Marvel formula, and in general this was a bit more of the same, but Pugh and Harbour commit really hard and keep it very engaging and just-different-enough. It's one of the better recent MCU efforts. I liked Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a Veep-adjacent role.\t\n* **Materialists** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Dead Man's Wire** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Rental Family** - 7/10\t\n* **Sisu: Road to Revenge** - 7/10 - A nice improvement over the first one, rare for a sequel. Some really impressive kills.\n* **Mickey 17** - 7/10\n* **Shin Godzilla** (Re-Release) - 7/10\t\t\n* **The School Duel** - 7/10\n* **Eephus** - 7/10 - A local beer league baseball team plays their final game at the local park. Makes you feel nice and fuzzy and warm. \t\n* **Dangerous Animals** - 7/10 - Some actors are born for a certain role. Jai Courtney is that actor in this movie.\t\t\n* **Ballerina** - 7/10\t\n* **Vermiglio** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Violent Ends** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Good Fortune** - 7/10 - There are some glaring flaws (like Aziz's acting &amp; delivery), but it does a lot of things very well and has a sweet enough ending to keep this pretty good. Keanu's character is a highlight and has a ton of great lines (\"I used to be a celestial being and now I'm a chainsmoker\", etc)\t\n* **Secret Mall Apartment** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Blue Moon** - 7/10 - Ethan Hawke is outstanding and basically shows off and runs circles around everybody for 100 minutes, but chamber pieces just aren\u2019t reaching \u201cgreat\u201d level for me recently.\t\n* **Wicked: For Good** - 7/10\t\t\n* **The Surfer** - 7/10\t\n* **Eleanor the Great** - 7/10 - Pure boomer catnip. Your grandma's favorite movie of 2025. June Squibb is a national treasure. Protect her at all costs.\t\n* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - \n* **An Officer and a Spy** - 7/10 - Polanski still has a bit of juice. Nobody is doing courtroom-dramas like the French recently.\t\n* **California Schemin'** - 7/10 - It gets a bit repetitive but it's a solid directorial debut effort from James McAvoy.\t\n* **A Big Bold Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 \n* **Villes Jacques-Carton** - 7/10 - Quebec represent. (weak year for Quebec cinema I'll admit)\t\n* **Normal** - 7/10 - If you like John Wick and John Wick-like clone films, you\u2019ll like this. Lots of fun kills. Lots of blood. Good popcorn flick. Not breaking any new ground though.\t\n* **The Ballad of a Small Player** - 7/10 - Macau is a sick setting for a film, and I really dug the first hour, a degenerate gambler just digging his own grave, and the score from Volker Bertelmann is a standout of the year, but it loses its way a bit when he &gt;!dies!&lt; (or maybe he doesn't? who knows). Also, more Fala Chen please.\t\n* **Jurassic World: Rebirth** - 7/10 \t\n* **Superman** - 7/10 - There's some funny lines, solid needledrops, and Rachel Brosnahan is great as usual, but it's not enough to make it really pop. Solid movie, another decent entry in the comic book movie category, but it doesn't reinvigorate my enthusiasm for the genre as a whole like I'd hoped it would.\t\n* **Tatami** - 7/10 \t\n* **One of Them Days** - 7/10 - Katt Williams being the highlight of a movie in the year of our lord 2025 was not on my bingo card. We need more crowd-pleasing comedies like this in theaters.\t\n* **The Seed of the Sacred Fig** - 7/10\t\n* **Fackham Hall** - 7/10\t- The *Trainspotting* poster bit was so good. Non-stop bits and easter eggs, a fun time. \n* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 \n* **Caught Stealing** - 7/10 - Zo\u00eb Kravitz is gone far too soon.\n* **I Love LA** (TV Series) - 7/10\t\t\n* **Fight or Flight** - 7/10 - It sequel-baits a bit too hard and the tech-villains are way too cartoony, but some solid kills, great lines/editing, and Josh Hartnett fully committing to the alcoholic, down-on-his-luck assassin bit really keeps it entertaining enough.\t\n* **Jane Austen Wrecked My Life** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Sisters** - 7/10\n* **Parthenope** - 7/10 - It's a gorgeous-looking movie, I could stare at Celeste Dalla Porta for 10 more hours, and I'm a big Paolo Sorrentino fan but this feels a bit more style-over-substance than his usual output.\n* **The Monkey** - 7/10\n* **The Luckiest Man in America** - 7/10 - When an indie budget is stretched to the limit and puts out a good movie.\t\t\n* **Terrestrial** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Two Women** - 7/10\t\n* **Sharp Corner** - 7/10 - I watched this dubbed in French so the performances definitely took a hit, but it was a pretty biting look at the pressures of the workplace and family leading to a man's downward spiral. Ben Foster is always solid (even when he's dubbed in French-Canadian).\t\n* **Sweetness** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Spinal Tap 2: The End Continues** - 7/10 - I have still not seen the original, but this was good enough as a standalone. The final performance scene leaves a bit to be desired, but there's enough humorous dialogue to keep it chugging along (\"in the daytime, ghosts are just rumors\" is my personal favorite\".\t\n* **Almost Popular** - 7/10\t\n* **My Dead Friend Zoe**\t - 7/10\t\t\n* **I Am Frankelda** - 7/10\t\t\n* **The Amateur** - 7/10 - It's basically Bourne-lite, but they don't make these globe-trotting spy movies enough anymore. I enjoyed it. Torture-by-pollen was a wild move though.\t\n* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 \n* **Merrily We Roll Along** - 7/10 - As far as theatrical pro-shots go, it's below *Waitress* &amp; *Hamilton*. At first the constant cuts are a bit annoying/nauseating, but it works itself out. Radcliffe has one really amazing/impressive song number (during the TV interview), Groff is outstanding throughout. Was not a fan of Lindsay Mendez at all. I wanted a bit more emotionally from the whole thing. The theme song is amazing.\t\n* **Heart Eyes** - 7/10 \t\t\n* **No Other Choice** - 7/10 - good but kinda very long, innit?\n* **Freaky Tales** - 7/10 \n* **The Wedding Banquet** - 7/10 - Fun little rom-com brought down a bit by rough acting and awkward line/joke delivery from Bowen Yang and the Korean guy. Lily and Kelly carried them big time. Loved the \u201cwe have to de-gay the house!!!\u201d bit. Great ending too. (never saw the original)\t\n* **Freakier Friday**\t - 7/10\t\t\n* **Rust** - 7/10 \n* **The Ugly Stepsister** - 7/10\t\t\n* **Come Closer** - 7/10\t\t\n* **La Grazia**\t7/10 - Location scouts for Sorrentino movies need special recognition.\t\n* **The Accountant 2** - 7/10 - The story is a bit overcooked (the X-Men-like school for autistic super-hackers is a crazy turn for this movie to take) and it gets a bit too *Sound of Freedom*-y, but the Affleck/Bernthal scenes together keep it from falling apart completely.\t\n* **Rise** (Short Film) - 7/10\t\n* **Tornado** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Inheritance** - 6/10\t\t\n* **The Housemaid** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Anemone** -  6/10 - [Sean Bean stares in amazement at DDL's performance] x10. There's a few good lines (\"god doesn't need undies, cause he's not full of shit like you are\", \"the explosion was so loud you couldn't hear it\"), two amazing DDL monologues, and it looks amazing, but feels kind of empty as a whole. Definitely something missing. \t\n* **Spider &amp; Jessie** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Orwell: 2+2=5**  - 6/10 - Some sequences are truly must-see pieces of documentary filmmaking (like the grilling of the ghoulish tech billionaire fucks and the January 6th bits) but then others are so truly scattered and shoehorned that it disconnects you from the message of the movie. 9/10 potential here if it could get out of its own way.\t\n* **Don't Let's Go to The Dogs Tonight** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Charlie Harper**\t- 6/10 - A cute story about a highschool sweetheart couple (an aspiring chef and an underachieving alcoholic, classic) that\u2019s shot really great and acted well (othet than the non-existent drunk acting from a supposed alcoholic) but ultimately burdened by a mountain of cliches. \t\n* **Song Sung Blue** - 6/10\t\t\n* **The Toxic Avenger** 6/10 - A Troma film should have more nudity. Let's bring nudity back. Put me down for more nudity.\n* **Tron: Ares** - 6/10\t\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10\n* **Anaconda** - 6/10 - One day soon I'll be tired and over and the ironic, meta, big-studio-movie, but today is not one of those days. I had a decent time with this. A *The Legend of Bagger Vance* reference in 2025 deserves some respect.\n* **Death Does Not Exist** - 6/10\t\n* **40 Acres**\t- 6/10\n* **Locked** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Paddington in Peru** - 6/10\n* **Clown In A Cornfield**\t - 6/10\t\n* **Captain America: Brave New World** - 6/10 - Adding this to the never-ending list of good-but-forgettable comic book movies. The genre is stale as hell.\n* **Wolf Man** - 6/10 - Really liked the POV switches, sound design, and creature design, but the rest is by-the-numbers horror flick.\t\n* **Drop** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Blood for Dracula** (Re-Release) - 6/10\n* **Taylor Swift - The Official Release Party of a Showgirl** - 6/10 - The lyric video stuff was whatever/boring/filler but I really liked the behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Ophelia music video. I could\u2019ve watched an entire doc of Taylor directing that video. Great song too. And the closing song rocked too.\t\n* **Fanny** - 6/10\n* **Find Your Friends** - 6/10 \t\n* **All Her Fault** (TV Series) - 6/10\t\t\n* **Fairyland** - 6/10 \t\t\n* **A Nice Indian Boy** - 6/10\t\n* **Eddington** - 6/10 - There's some interesting stuff in here, but overall kind of a mess. That's been Ari Aster's vibe recently.\n* **A Minecraft Movie** - 6/10\t\t\n* **To Kill A Wolf**\t- 6/10\t\t\n* **Keeper** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Waltzing with Brando** - 6/10 - Billy Zane is super convincing as Marlon Brando. The rest is forgettable.\t\n* **Re-Animator** (Re-Release)\t- 6/10\t\n* **Opus** - 6/10 - John Malkovich could not have been more horribly miscast.  There's a good cult movie hidden in here somewhere, but Ayo by herself couldn't bring it out. Needed some more passes at rewrites.\t\n* **Grand Theft Hamlet** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Den of Thieves 2: Pantera** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Novocaine** - 6/10\n* **Barcelona** (Re-Release) - 6/10\t\n* **The Roses** - 6/10 - This was a Dollar Tree *Marriage Story*. Very tonally-uneven. Kate McKinnon is distractingly-bad. Cumberbatch and Colman work well enough together to keep it watchable but it's kinda messy.\t\n* **IT: Welcome to Derry** (TV Series) - 6/10 \n* **Modern Whore**\t- 6/10\t\n* **100 Nights of Hero** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Ick** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Algiers** - 6/10\t\n* **Everything's Going to Be Great** - 6/10 - I really wish Bryan Cranston didn't &gt;!die!&lt; early on in the movie. His character and charisma really kept this afloat at first. It mostly fall flats after he's gone, except a few sweet moments. Weirdly over-religious vibes to the movie. Angel Studios was probably close to landing this one.\t\n* **Abraham's Boys** - 6/10\n* **I Know What You Did Last Summer** - 6/10 - Worth seeing for the Nicole Kidman AMC intro reference alone. \t\n* **Death of a Unicorn** - 6/10\n* **Clorofilla** - 6/10\t\t\n* **I Don't Understand You** - 6/10\t\n* **On Becoming A Guinea Fowl** - 6/10 - It's hard to think of a more recent ending that's so unsatisfying. It's good until that. Fuck those last 5 minutes.\t\n* **Allen Sunshine**\t- 6/10\t\t\n* **Night of the Demons** (Re-Release) - 6/10\t\n* **La Gloria**\t- 6/10\n* **The Legend of Ochi**\t- 6/10 - It's a gorgeous movie and very Wes Anderson-coded, but too childish to make a real impact. If I'm honest, Helena Zengel should've just spoken German (with subtitles) instead of intelligible English.\t\n* **Cleaner** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Bonjour, Tristesse** - Lily McInerny is outstanding, one of my picks for \"breakout\" performances of the year, and I'm a sucker for a sun-drenched Mediterranean setting, but Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is just so bad and sinks the rest of the performances. \t\n* **Love Machine** (Short Film) - 6/10\t\n* **The Shrouds** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Mermaid** - 6/10 - With 20-25 minutes shaved off, this could've been great. It captures some of the gross underbelly of Florida that not a lot of movies can (*The Florida Project* being the best example), but it's dragged down by bad performances and a plot that's too dragged out. I wanted it to end at least 5 times.\t\n* **Dog of God** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Trust** - 6/10\t\t\n* **Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale** - 5/10 - It loses a lot of the charm of the first 2 films.\t\n* **Dead of Winter** - 5/10\t\t\n* **The Friend** - 5/10\t\t\n* **Him** - 5/10\t\n* **Somnium** - 5/10\t\t\n* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 \t\n* **Borderline** - 5.7 - Full disclosure: I saw this in a theater but left about halfway because I saw a big ass rat crawling through the aisle (2nd time I've ever seen one in a theater. Other time was in 2019 for *The Best of Enemies*). That's gonna be a no from me, dawg. Finished the rest at home. All that being said, Samara Weaving is good but she can only do so much to carry a weak story.\t\n* **Hunting Daze** - 5/10\t\n* **The Chronology of Water**- 5/10 - A completely incomprehensible first-45-minutes (by design I guess?), but Imogen poots puts in one of the most daring &amp; brave performances in a while. A huge huge swing by Kristen Stewart for a directorial debut. Sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses hard.\t\n* **www.rachelormont.com** - 5/10 - This movie is fucking disgusting. I'm pretty sure real-life misdemeanors/felonies were actually committed during the filming (seriously). But it's just weird and funny enough (especially during the meta, audience-speaking portion) to keep you locked in. A wild ride that I wouldn't take again but that I'm happy to have taken off of the bucket list.\t\n* **Honey, Don't!**\t- 5/10 - \"My left or your left?\", \"We're facing the same way\" is one of the year's best exchanges, and there's a few of those gems, but ultimately this is one of the most disjointed movies involving A-list talent I've ever seen (looking at you, *Amsterdam*). Too much going on, some really awful performances (Charlie Day, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans). Only Margaret Qualley showed up. She rocks.\t\n* **Swiped** - 5/10 - We have *The Social Network* at home.\t\n* **Bone Lake** - 5/10\t\n* **Black Phone 2**\t- 5/10 - There should be a law capping Blumhouse horrors at 95 minutes. Big drop-off from the first one. Madelaine McGraw was fantastic though.\t\n* **The Woman in the Yard** - 5/10\t\t\n* **Seven Veils** - 5/10 \n* **M3gan 2.0** - 5/10 - I've gotta admit that there's a lot of really solid &amp; memorable one-liners in here, but this movie really needed an R-rating and 25 minutes less of runtime.\t\n* **Fuze** - 5/10 \t\n* **Now You See Me Now You Don't** - 5/10\t\n* **The Running Man** - 5/10 - Edgar no :(\t\t\n* **Ella McCay** - 5/10 - There's some truly baffling stuff going on in this movie (30-year old Ema MacKey unconvincingly playing a 15-year old for a part of the movie being one of them), but I love James L. Brooks too much to give it a lower score.\t#EllaMcCayChallenge\n* **Sketch** - 5/10\t\t\n* **The Well**\t- 5/10\n* **Queens of the Dead**\t- 5/10\t\t\n* **Unmoored** - 5/10\t\t\n* **Last Breath** - 5/10\t\t\n* **Mr. Blake at Your Service!**\t- 5/10\t\t\n* **Hedda** - 5/10 - Aside from the solid costume and set design (and a few moments when I was reminded of Babylon), this was a pretty nothing-movie with a confusing plot and extremely unlikeable characters.\t\n* **The Virgin of Quarry Lake**\t- 5/10\t- Visually striking but much too slow.\t\n* **Mr. Melvin** - 5/10\n* **Armand** - 5/10\t\t\n* **The Bearded Girl** - 5//10\t\n* **Karate Kid: Legends**\t- 5/10\t\t\n* **Test Screening**\t- 5/10\n* **Sounds of Glass** (Short Film) - 5/10\t\t\n* **Invention** - 5/10\t\t\n* **The Penguin Lessons** - 5/10\t\n* **Another Simple Favor** - 4/10 - This might be the most overcooked script of the year. There's just so much going on, you can't keep track of any character motivations, and it just throws in twists for the sake of twists. The original was fine, this was not good.\t\n* **Good Boy** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Hacked: A Double Entendre of Rage Fueled Karma** - 4/10\t\n* **Hot Milk** - 4/10 - There's something good hidden in here, but it's irritating as hell.\t\n* **The Room Next Door** - 4/10 - All of the bad of Almadovar (clunky dialogue, overly-melodramatic, etc), with none of the good. Boring as well\t\n* **Sister Midnight** - 4/10\t\t\n* **The Devil\u2019s Bride**  - 4/10\t\t\n* **After the Hunt**- 4/10 - ???????????????\t\n* **Snow White** - 4/10 - I think Rachel Zegler is great. Whenever she wasn't on screen, I didn't care. Disney live-action remakes have to start caring a lot more about what they're putting out there. The returns are diminishing big time.\t\n* **Of Dogs and Men** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Shelby Oaks** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Nobody 2** - 4/10 - I never want to see Sharon Stone in anything ever again. Take the Oscar nomination away. \t\n* **Wish You Were Here** - 4//10\t\t\n* **The Baltimorons** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Die My Love** - 4/10\t- Shoutout to John Prine.\t\n* **The Carpenter's Son** - 4/10\t\n* **Dust Bunny** - 4/10\t\t\n* **The Rule of Jenny Penn** - 4/10 - Painfully repetitive. Enough lens-flare-induced-blindness to probably qualify for a class action lawsuit. \t\n* **Flight Risk** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Anniversary** - 4/10 - About as subtle as brick to the temple. Jesus christ.\t\n* **Ash** - 4/10\t\t\n* **Reflection in a Dead Diamond** - 4/10 - Zzz...\t\t\n* **Apostasy Blues** - 4/10\t\n* **The Christophers** - 4/10 - A very rare Soderbergh L. Such a bore. Did not help that I couldn't understand a single word Ian McKellen was saying and that Michaela Coel was horribly miscast.\t\n* **The G** - 4/10\n* **Rosemead** - 4/10 \t\n* **Teacher's Pet** - 4/10\t- Coming to a Tubi near you soon.\n* **Ex-Husbands** - 4/10\t\t\n* **The Unholy Trinity** - 4/10 - Bland RedBox (RIP) fodder. Samuel L. Jackson surprisingly cares so that kept it from a rock-bottom score.\t\n* **Away with the Fairies** (Short Film) - 4/10\t\t\n* **Atom &amp; Void** (Short Film)\t- 4/10\t\t\n* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 \n* **Cujo** (Re-Release) - 3/10 - Had not seen it before, and I can still tell you it hasn't aged well. Awful.\t\n* **High Rollers** - 3/10 \t\n* **Auction** - 3/10 - There aren't many things in life more pretentious than art-related French films.\t\n* **The Thing With Feathers** - 3/10 - Man this was a rough watch.\t\n* **The Home** - 3/10\n* **Thank You, Places!** - 3/10 - A valiant effort by a local theater group to shoot &amp; produce a movie during the height of COVID but I could've seen anything else and been more entertained. \t\n* **One Big Happy Family** - 3/10\t\t\n* **Homebound** - 3/10\t\t\n* **Good American Family** (TV Series) - 3/10\n* **The Story of Three Sisters** (Short Film) - 3/10\t\t\n* **First Rites** (Short Film) - 3/10\n* **Love Hurts** - 2/10 - If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and *Love Hurts*, I would shoot *Love Hurts* twice.\t\n* **Kiss of the Spider Woman** - 2/10 - I really enjoyed the 12-minute sequence of Diego Luna graphically and aggressively shitting himself (3 feet away from a toilet for some reason by the way?) while the lead character wipes it all up, that was super cool and cinematic and necessary. This movie was hot ass, in more ways than one. Extremely overhyped out of Sundance, there's one every year. Deserved flop. One of the few times a year I walk out of a movie theater angry.\n* **Nobody Wants to Shoot a Woman** - 2/10 - Amateur hour. The worst *Goodfellas* rip-off you've ever seen. If you told me this was originally a Youtube short from 2008, I would believe you.\t\n* **The Verdict** - 1/10 - The filmmakers should honestly be ashamed for submitting and screening this unfinished soap-opera-masquerading-as-a-film.

Now that I am older, I can really sit back and appreciate/enjoy the story, the great screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, amazing directing by Mike Nichols (his final film), phenomenal acting by 2 of the greatest male actors ever (Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman), with Julia Roberts and Amy Adams both delivering top-notch performances as well, and the beautiful cinematography. I love all of the different locations that were portrayed in the movie.\n\nAnd it being based on George Crile's book\u00a0*Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History*\u00a0makes it feel all the more real (I mean, it is a true story, after all). I know there were some artistic liberties taken, but still, it is a fascinating story of how a U.S. Congressman and a random CIA operative lead the efforts (Operation Cyclone) to organize and support/arm the mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-89). As a history lover, it is interesting as hell being able to look back at how that particular conflict had such a massive affect on future world events. All in all, I'd give it a solid 9/10.",

I loved the colors, the scenes, the writing. It all just had me locked in. It\u2019s been so long since I had a movie keep me interested.\n\nThere were also like settings or idk how you call it but like characters would be talking and the camera would adjust and you would see the whole Sven and background and it\u2019s like it caused the scene to mean something else. For example on the Nile movie, Hercule and Bouc were talking in some wicker chairs. The camera lowered and it was like they were in cages or a confessional. \n\nOverall highly recommend. Only downside was Gal Gadot in the Nile one. Her scenes just kinda fell short for me. Other than that, you should definitely watch them!",

Some exceptional work by Nick Offerman as the narrator and was quite perfect for that role.  I was surprised at how the story broke down in the beginning that made it somewhat confusing, but after watching it all the way through.  I thought it was actually quite brilliant and somewhat cool how everything was broken down how it was.  So without giving too many spoilers away for those who did watch it already.

And the romance with Marie was cool too. Started crazy chaotic and they ended up chilling and really understanding of each other.\n\nThen Ultimatum ties a few loose ends like Pam Landy and Nicky Parson, Noah Vohen and the doctor that coordinated the whole thing. Bourne makes another black ops asset question himself and maybe that guy questions the next and so on and so forth.\n\n",

        "content": "The first time I watched Zodiac I was confused as to why the Bob Vaughn thing (basement scene) existed in the first place. It seemed like an unnecessary red herring that led to nowhere. Upon rewatching, I thought it was actually pretty cool, because it shows how Allen wasn't the definite killer, just the primary suspect. Also shows that Graysmith was going fucking crazy.\n\nBut what still confuses me is the scene right afterwards when Graysmith tries to steer Linda to tell him that the killer was Rick Marshall. She tells him it was \"someone with a common, shortened nickname\" and he keeps insisting it was Rick Marshall. This was right after (scene-wise) he'd run out of Vaughn's house. Vaughn, who'd just made himself a very possible suspect through handwriting. Vaughn, who had a creepy weird basement in his house, who (presumably) had ties to the killer, who had the door locked when Robert was trying to leave, and who just so happened to go by Bob. If Bob isn't the most common shortened nickname in America then I don't know what is.\n\nMy question is, why did Graysmith not at all suspect that it was Bob? I initially thought that maybe he'd just been obsessing on the idea that it was Rick Marshall, so much so that he'd just overlooked the incriminating evidence against Vaughn, but that doesn't line up with the fact that he was obviously terrified when he ran out of Bob's house. He clearly thought Bob might kill him at that moment, so why does he just completely forget about that when talking to Linda?\n\nI know this doesn't really matter since it wasn't Vaughn after all, but I do want to know if there's something I'm not seeing.",

        "content": "Lately I have been rewatching older movies and realizing how much they cared about things that feel rare now. Not just story, but patience, atmosphere, and effort in the small details. Real locations. Practical sets. Letting scenes breathe. Silence that actually means something.\n\nFor me, a perfect example is Alien. \n\nThe movie takes its time. The ship feels real and lived in. The darkness hides things instead of showing everything. The tension comes from waiting, not from constant noise or fast cuts. It feels like the filmmakers trusted the audience to be uncomfortable and pay attention.\n\nI am not saying modern movies are bad, but it feels like something shifted. Faster pacing, cleaner visuals, and less willingness to sit in a moment. \n\nWhat is something older movies did really well that you feel is mostly lost now?",

Their commitment to including both theatrical copies of the movies but also including unrated/directors cut versions of the same movie both converted to 4K UHD. \n\nThese days in the streaming world or on iTunes/Prime where you \u201cbuy\u201d the movie, they tend to only release the theatrical version of the movie in 4K/Atmos and the other cuts as regular HD. But Arrow Video goes out to make sure every cut of a movie is included in their sets of the movies. For example: Robin Hood Prince of Thieves had both cuts in 4K whereas iTunes only has the theatrical cut in 4K. \n\nThey also include amazing special features that are brand new for these older movies. The audio options of movies are amazing as well. \n\nNote: I\u2019m not paid by Arrow for this, just wanted to share my thoughts of their releases, the work they\u2019ve done and hope to buy move from them in the future  ",

        "content": "I just always appreciate when a movie cares about getting the feel of the thing right. The director of this movie had to have worked food service at some point in their life.\n\nThe story line is good, just a movie about nothing really. Every corporate restaurant had these different factions tho, the cooks, the servers, the bus crew, managers, etc. We all bitched about each other, but we were all pulling together when the rush started.\n\nIf you worked these jobs, you know how this movie takes you right back to those days",

        "content": "\nRevenge scenes can land in very different ways depending on how a movie handles them. Sometimes it\u2019s a slow burn where patience and planning finally pay off, and other times it\u2019s messy, emotional, and even uncomfortable to watch. I\u2019m curious which moments really stuck with people and why. Was it satisfying because it felt earned, because it was brutal, or because it flipped your expectations and left you thinking about it long after the movie ended?",

        "content": "Checked for previous posts to mention the use of doors, door frames, and hallways in this film. It seems the characters are CONSTANTLY opening doors, or walking down endless halls, with the camera always framing it in a way to make the audience feel \u201ctrapped\u201d along with the characters.\n\nExamples: as the other family goes upstairs and bangs on the bathroom door to reach their teenage daughter, as Keller gives Loki a \u201ctour\u201d of the rundown apartment building, as Loki checks thru the aunts home before the shootout. And many more instances \n\nThis clearly plays into the theme of the Maze throughout the film. \n\nAnyone else notice this or find any mention of this by the writer or director? ",
