The most famous additions are:\n\nThe infamous \"spider walk\" scene (Regan descending the stairs on all fours and backwards).\n\nA conversation between the priests Merrin and Karras.\n\nAn extended ending that includes a meeting between Lieutenant Kinderman and Father Dyer.\n\nIn addition to a complete restoration and remastering.\n\nTo this day, I still get scared watching her.\n\nGive me your opinion about the movie.\n\nI read you in the comments.\n\nGreetings",

        "content": "As anticipation grows for the final season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d star Finn Wolfhard has lined up another project that takes him back to the \u201980s.\n\nThe \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters\u201d leading man is teaming with his father, Eric Wolfhard, and producer Rich Peete to bring Bob Mehr\u2019s acclaimed biography \u201cTrouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements\u201d to the big screen.\n\nThe father and son will co-write the screenplay, with Peete producing \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d under his Neighborhood Watch banner. Peete recently collaborated with the CAA-repped Finn Wolfhard on A24\u2019s \u201cThe Legend of Ochi,\u201d which made its world premiere at Sundance earlier this year.\n\nPublished in 2016, \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d is widely regarded as the definitive chronicle of The Replacements, the legendary Minneapolis punk band known for shaping American alternative rock. While the band\u2019s influence was undeniable, having paved the way for \u201990s stadium-fillers Nirvana and Green Day, original members Paul Westerberg, Bob Stinson, Tommy Stinson and Chris Mars often were are at the center of drama. Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d following a self-sabotaging profanity-laced performance in 1986 that signaled the band\u2019s coming downfall. (Westerberg did return to \u201cSNL\u201d as a solo artist in 1993.)\n\nWritten by Bob Mehr, a veteran music critic and Grammy-winning essayist, \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d became a New York Times bestseller and earned book-of-the-year honors from NPR and Rolling Stone.\n\nThe project marks another move behind the camera for Finn Wolfhard, who recently co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced the Neon horror film \u201cHell of a Summer\u201d alongside Billy Bryk. At the same time, he has made serious inroads in the music space and is currently on his first solo tour tied to his debut album \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d The fifth and final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d launches on Netflix on Nov. 26 and will roll out incrementally rather than binge-style, wrapping up on New Year\u2019s Eve. \n\nIn a recent Variety cover story, the multi-hyphenate talked about working with his father on a secret music-themed project at their home in Vancouver. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing a lot of music and writing this movie with my dad, which has been really amazing,\u201d Wolfhard said of how he had spent his time since production wrapped on \u201cStranger Things\u201d in December. \u201cIt\u2019s about a band that I think weirdly I have a lot in common with, a lot of the members. I can\u2019t really talk about the actual band because I don\u2019t have the rights officially yet.\u201d\n",

The action is crazy and way bigger in scale than I had realised (I thought it was just gonna be gunfights and parkour).\n\nThe POV aspect is creatively done so it doesn't get boring (which I thought it might), and the story is actually pretty wild and inventive. I think it's severely underrated!",
