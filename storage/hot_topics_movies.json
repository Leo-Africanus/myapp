        "content": "Anyone who saw this movie as a kid, especially in the 80s, can probably remember how shocked they were when this movie ruthlessly killed off the bulk of the cast from the TV series within the first act, including having Optimus Prime, the main hero and symbol of the franchise, getting shot in the gut and perishing on an operating table. This is an insane and seemingly ballsy creative decision (imagine if \"Avengers: Infinity War\" had Thanos killing all the main Avengers in the first act), until you realize why it was done; to sell more toys. The film is a feature-length toy commercial and they were simply clearing out the old line to make room for the new toys. They just did it in the most upsetting way possible.\n\n\"Hey, kids, guess what? Remember all those toys you love and cherish? They're all DEAD! WE KILLED THEM ALL!!!...so how about buying some new ones? We got them right here!\"\n\nOf course, the joke is, they played themselves and not only made what was intended as nothing more than a toy commercial a memorable film, they also were hit with a backlash to Optimus Prime's demise that was so fierce, they eventually ordered the character brought back to life. (The backlash even spilled over to other projects; the similar \"G.I. Joe\" animated movie hastily rewrote a major character death to just going into a coma to avoid a repeat reaction.) Sometimes, the craziest movies can be made for the most cynical of reasons.\n\n",

Sometimes there are themes that make you reflect and ponder over.\n\nThere is a lot written about the future of movies and there is increasing competition from various forms of entertainment for people's time.

        "content": "In an attempt to watch more movies, I decided to watch Empires list of top 100 movies. I take dumb notes and write down my favorite lines then I put them here.

I love it. feels incredibly nostalgic, Wyoming is a beautiful state. The actual story of the movie is simple and complex at the same time, and it constantly pulls you back and forth between what jack and ennis want for and from each other. I was invested in each relationship and dynamic that existed in the story, especially the men\u2019s relationships with their wives. Alma\u2019s performance was incredible and I really appreciate the added complexity and depth that it gives to the love story between the guys. It\u2019s an unfair situation, and nobody is completely in the wrong for the way they feel. \n\nI think this movie does an incredible job at highlighting the frustration, unfairness, and pain that came from being gay in that time period (and even now, to a certain extent). I also just love a good tragedy. Also, SOUNDTRACK! The atmosphere of it was very well crafted. Suffice to say, I really loved this movie, and so far it\u2019s my highest rated film from the list. \n\n- Enjoyment: 10/10\n- Plot: 8.7/10\n- Visuals: 10/10\n\n**Overall: 9.5/10**\n\nDoes it deserve a top 100 spot? What can I say other than a resounding *absolutely* \n",

        "content": "Sorry if I\u2019m late to this, I just joined this sub literally to talk about this movie. I kinda like war movies, whether it\u2019s something like fury or saving private ryan, there\u2019s TONS of Great War movies. I haven\u2019t seen one like this though. I don\u2019t know really what it was about this one, it was just different. And I have read that it was incredibly realistic, and people with PTSD actually had a hard time sitting through it. But watching the end credits was a really cool finish, especially seeing the actual people go through how they would clear a street/area. So am I kinda overreacting here or was this legit a good movie?",

        "title": "\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" gets a bad rep but it's the one movie in the series which offers you the biggest thrills while also being a big fun adventure and a Horror movie at the same time (PG-13 founder?)",
        "content": "We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. \n\nBut as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. \n\nOh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (\"I'm a Vegetarian!!!\").\n\nAnd I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. \n\nPeople bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. \n\nHarrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once.",

Casino over Goodfellas.\n\n",
