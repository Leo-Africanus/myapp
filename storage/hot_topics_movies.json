Bonus points for movies that keep you guessing a bit, where some of the horror maybe comes from being not totally sure what's going on. Gothic vibes and unreality are a plus, such as the main character doubting their own perceptions or wondering if they're imagining things.",

The whole courting of Sara was orchestrated by this woman.\n\nAnd after the nod, Hitch says 'basic principles, there are none' which could mean that everything Hitch explained to Sara about his job was unprincipled at best.",
