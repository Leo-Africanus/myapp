        "title": "One thing I miss from older movies- the slower pacing of scenes!",
        "content": "I was watching some older movies such as Close Encounters, Star wars, and Alien and realized something was different. Something which I don't think many modern audiences would like, but I liked it so to speak. I just couldn't figure out what it was.\n\nI then watched half of an awful Antman multiverse Marvel movie before giving up and realized what it was. It wasn't the lack of CGI, actors actually being big names, or stunts being real back then. It was the slower pacing of scenes!\n\nFor example, I think in 2001 SO there was like a 10 minute scene of a ship docking. I actually got bored of that as a kid and fast forward if my dad wasn't looking lol. In Alien they spent like 5 minutes looking for a cat and then later she spent what felt like 10 minutes looking for the cat again. And they made it work too as they made it interesting. I can see how modern audiences might not like that but to me that is so much better than what they do to pad out movies in the modern area, which is usually lots of table talk-and I'd say there is actually more talking than what they did in the older movies too.\n\nIt might bad take. I just do miss movies that might stick to the plot being one night to a week over it being like the telling of the whole war. Then again you do have to be careful with what you ask for because the Modern Starwars movies have drawn out scenes like the Casino Planet. IDk then again I probably would take the Casino Planet jobber sidequest over adding more table talk in",

        "title": "Watched Tranformers One and as someone who loved Transformers since I was a child and have gotten progressively more and more disappointed in the franchise as I've grown older, I gotta say this movie was amazing",
        "content": "I'll try to keep at least the first section of the review spoiler free. I will give a little bit of background first.\n\nI was 11 years old when I watched Revenge of the Fallen with my friends. The explosions, the action, the music, the cars, THAT Megan Fox scene. I loved that movie and after it I became a big Transformers fan, watching whatever movies and clips I could find online at that age. It even spilled into my other hobbies like gaming and music; I started listening to Linkin Park (still do) and played whatever games had transformers in them. I remember playing Fall of Cybertron a lot on my Xbox 360. Got as many Transformer toys and figures I could get. Just saying I was a fan would be an understatement.\n\nAs I got a couple of years older I started watching the other movies as they released. Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction, The Last Knight, Bumblebee, Rise of the Beasts and none of them after DotM just..... clicked. I blamed it on a couple of things, but mostly age. I thought I had just outgrown the Franchise, maybe a movie filled with explosions and guns and robots are just too childish.\n\nSo Transformers is a series I mostly look back to with happy thought. I still think about the old days where I was at my friends house being blown away by Revenge of the Fallen, I still think about all those hours I sat behind the screen playing Fall of Cybertron, I still listen to Linkin Park imagining Optimus Prime jsut got done giving a speech. But thats mostly in the past. Transformers is not what it used to be for me and I didn't think I would ever enjoy a new piece of Tranformers content ever again, and I still thought that when I ehard about the release of Tranformers One.\n\n''just another Transformers movie, it'll never live up to the old ones.'' That was literally my thought when I first found out about the movie by seeing a promotional poster in the cinemas I was at for another movie. I put off reading anything about it, I put off searching anything about it up. I just was not interested. Until, I saw a short clip of the movie when scrolling on TikTok. It was funny and I remember thinking ''oh so this Transformers One is THAT kind of movie, funny.''\n\nFastforward to today I was bored and I wanted to watch a movie when I suddenly remember that clip, that 10 second clip that entertained me so much and I thought why not. And boy do I have to say I LOVED this movie.\n\nThe plot is interesting enough to make you pay attention. You can guess which direction its going pretty easily but I didnt go in expecting much so I didnt mind. But everything else is truly amazing.\n\nThe characters, the jokes, the writing, the animation, I loved all of it. If you are looking for a movie that will just simply entertain you, without you even being a Transformers fan, give it a chance. If you will like it as much as even halve of the amount I love it, you will not regret it.\n\nSpoilers ahead as I get a bit more in depth of why I love this movie so much.\n\nGrowing up Ive always seen Optimus and Megatron fight and hate eachother, but seeing them 'young' as friends really intrigued me. It was something I have never thought of as possible or even imaginable but the writers pulled off this amazing friendship of soon to be enemies. On screen they share an amazing chemistry and display of friendship, and after every second of enjoyment of them I got this dread, this glooming sense of them one day becoming enemies. I knew we would find out how they would turn into enemies in this movie and I was NOT looking forward to seeing this beautiful friendship ruined, but I mean that in a good way. The introduction of Bumblebee was also amazing. He has always been this 'young wild and free' Autobot in the movies and in this one its no different. He stole every scene he was in and yet again in this movie, became my favourite transformer.\n\nI was just as excited to see Starscream on scene. I thought there were no surprises left and I practically jumped out of my couch when they mentioned his name. The writers keep delivering on these amazing moments that just satisfy you as a Transformers fan.\n\nTalking about delivering, there are AMAZING golden moments of hilariousness in this movie. I have laughed out loud multiple times and basically enjoyed this movie from start to finish.\n\nThis movie just gives you so many amazing moment. D16's (Megatron) descent into evil (I would even say rightfully so, after having seen this movie), Orion Pax becoming Optimus Prime, Bumblee being hilarious as ever, Optimus fighting in a 1v3, moments of friendship and betrayal; you cant help but feel sad for both Optimus Prime and Megatron. And ofcourse this legendary, incredibly nostalgic Optimus Prime monologue at the end. I swear I literally expected to hear a linkin park song when he was delivering it and I maybe would have bursted out into tears if I did.\n\nAs amazing as this all is, the most important thing for me is realizing, knowing that I am NOT too old to enjoy Transformers. I am 26 now and I just got done laughing, crying, watching a Transformers movie full of excitement, something I havent been able to do for almost 15 years.\n\nI am grateful for Transformers One for this reason alone. It has singehandedly changed my opinion on the Transformers franchise of the past 10 years. It may not be the best movie ever, but it has broken into my top list of movies I have ever watched for that reason alone. It has immediately made me love it and I will die holding on to this movie with my heart.\n\nPlease give it watch if you havent yet.",

When the film started, I thought I was going to get a lighthearted romcom starring Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the main character gets a call saying nuclear war is coming in less than 70 minutes, and I'm sitting there thinking someone was playing a prank. I was not ready for the movie to shift into an apocalyptic thriller. The shift in tone was so unexpected that I just sat there watching for the next hour or so, completely baffled.",

Life is still pretty normal, but it's on the brink of falling apart.\n\nThis is very similar to the \"Great Panic\" section from the book \"World War Z,\" but I'm looking for something cinematic.\n\nIf anyone knows of anything like this, please let me know!

I remember the film \u201cThe Italian Job\u201d (2003) showed absolutely every element of the film, including the ending scene, in the trailer, which is a bit...surprising?\n\nAnyway, if you have any examples of good trailers (whether it's a big production or an independent film, whatever the language), I'd love to see them!",

        "content": "Certain movies have the power to completely transform how we approach storytelling, whether through their narrative structure, themes, or the emotional experience they evoke. For me, **Fight Club** was one of those films. On the surface, it\u2019s a dark, gritty exploration of disillusionment and rebellion, but beneath that, it challenges everything about identity, society, and reality itself.\n\nThe way it plays with unreliable narration and keeps the audience questioning what\u2019s real and what\u2019s imagined really opened my eyes to how a movie doesn\u2019t have to follow traditional structures to tell a powerful story. It taught me that sometimes, the most profound stories are those that make you think and reflect long after the credits roll. The psychological depth and the twist ending not only shifted my view on storytelling but also made me more aware of how films can manipulate perception and push boundaries.\n\nOf course, as a teen, I took it a little too literally... I may have tried roleplaying as if I was part of Fight Club for a while (don\u2019t judge me), but hey, it was all part of the journey to discovering deeper meanings in films!\n\nWhat movies had a similar impact on you? Which films made you rethink the way stories are told or even how you view the world?",
