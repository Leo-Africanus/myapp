It's not that it's a bad film, it just was not what I expected. \n\nSequels:\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 was such a bummer after a franchise high with Fallout.\n\nThe Accountant 2 - buddy film molded into the world of \"The Accountant\". It didn't embrace what made the first one a sleeper hit.  \n\nJoker: Folie a Deux - amazing visuals in incredible promotional materials but such a slog. ",

I've heard people suggest the Empire did a 1984-esque campaign to make people forget, but I'm just not buying it. It would be like if some evil dictator wiped out all Hindus, and 20 years later most people thought Hindus never existed, even though there would undoubtedly be people who had Hindu friends and acquaintances still around.\n\nSigns: How water is like acid to the aliens.

This felt like a prestige drama that belongs within a satire, where a well-known actor is playing a totally deranged role and everyone in-universe is pretending it\u2019s Oscar-worthy. That\u2019s the exact energy Capone gives off.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hit me at first. I started off just kind of baffled, then hit the infamous diarrhea scenes\u2014and that\u2019s when I mentally broke. Not in a \u201cthis is bad\u201d way, but in a \u201cwait... this isn\u2019t a real movie, this is a parody of a movie within a movie\u201d kind of way.\n\nAfter that, I couldn\u2019t unsee it. Tom Hardy isn\u2019t playing Al Capone\u2014he\u2019s playing the role that some fictional actor takes on in a movie about Hollywood excess. You can just feel the scene where the camera pans behind the scenes and he\u2019s like, totally serious about the role and the praise is pouring in. \n\nOnce I saw it that way, I weirdly started to appreciate it. I\u2019d never watch it again, but it\u2019s kind of brilliant as a fake movie that accidentally became real. Like an accidental Tropic Thunder moment, just played completely straight.\n\nDo you think they were trolling us?\n",

        "title": "John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man starring Chevy Chase... what a strange movie. What went wrong? And who could have been a better lead?",
        "content": "*Memoirs of an Invisible Man* is such an odd film. There *are* some things that work and it looks great visually (no shock with John Carpenter directing). But tonally, it's a mess.\n\nChevy Chase seems totally miscast. This was that era where he usually looked like he sleepwalks through roles unless it was a *Vacation* movie. He switches between his usual comedy persona and this weirdly bland, serious version of himself.\n\nHis narration is so overwrought too, like it's trying really hard to sell drama but failing miserably.\n\nThe character is kind of an idiot. Keeps making mistake after mistake. \n\nThere\u2019s one scene that actually made me laugh... when he knocks out a drunk guy to steal his cab. That moment felt like the *real* Chevy Chase. But the rest of the movie plays it so straight it\u2019s almost uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s like Chase was trying to make a comedy while Carpenter was directing a straight-up paranoid thriller.\n\nIt reminded me of the behind-the-scenes tension on *Vampire in Brooklyn:* Eddie Murphy wanted to be serious, Wes Craven wanted to make it horror comedy, and neither tone won.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if *Memoirs* had a bunch of reshoots or rewrites. It definitely feels like it didn\u2019t know what it wanted to be.\n\nHonestly, I think another actor, someone younger and more energetic could have made it work better and played more in sync with Carpenter.\n\nCurious what others think. Anyone actually like this movie? Or know more about what went on behind the scenes?",

I'm not a big nautical guy in general, but this movie makes the sea life digestible for even the least seaworthy. I really like the doctor's subplot as he represents the audience a bit since he doesn't understand or connect with the call of duty that the crew feels, since logic is thrown out the window and duty takes priority over everything.",

A horror film with a great premise but they end up showing too much or seemingly tacking on an ending that ruins the vibe of the rest of the film.\n\nWhy do you think this is?

He intentionally sabotaged their scam, was the first to leave him dehydrated in the desert, then lies about the name (Tuco would've backstabbed him here regardless as he wasn't aware he lied, but he was still honest about the cemetery name).\n\nMost of Tuco's backstabbing's were in response to something Blondie did first, or after the cycle of trust had been broken. Is it because Clint Eastwood is cool?\n\nI actually found myself rooting for The Bad because he was an outside force.\n\nThe only good thing that Blondie did was show humanity to the dying soldier, The Bad similarly showed humanity to the guy he gave the alcohol to. I'd say none of them were better than the other.",

He's using their knowledge of where a tornado has recently hit to go and buy up the survivor's land for cheap.  \n\n**Except that information is useless,** because everyone already knows if a town has been wiped out by a tornado, because it's immediately in the news. Shared on social media. Just _freely_ published in weather reporting data online.  \n\nSpending (presumably) tens of millions to know potentially minutes quicker is of absolutely no benefit. It's like hiring someone to let you know if your house has burned down, you'll already fucking know!  \n\n---  \n\n**Easy-fix**; change it so Marshall is funding StormPAR to predict where _future_ tornados are going to happen, allowing him to short companies with resources in the area (e.g. that oil refinery), or to buy up businesses _ahead_ of time, and slapping massive insurance policies on inflated associated assets. As soon as it becomes predictive (rather than reactive) it's an even better \"bad guy plot\" because it would mean they were potentially witholding that information from victims.",

Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \"the Family\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into homicidal nocturnal albino mutants. The Family blame science and technology for their condition and they see Neville, as the last symbol of science, therefore he must die. Neville, uses everything at his disposal in an attempt to survive with the help of Dutch (Paul Kosolo) and Lisa (Rosalind Cash) who he meets which he know he\u2019s not alone. I really liked the film, Charlton Heston\u2019s performance is good and his character has very good chemistry with Rosalind Cash. While The Family are not vampires, they look like druids and they are allergic to the light. Anthony Zerbe as Jonathan as the leader of The Family who wants to kill Neville. If you haven\u2019t seen the film would recommend it.",

        "content": "I've been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I'm halfway through the year now, and I'm loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.\n\nWith that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.\n\nSo I'm trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.\n\nRequirements:\n\n\u26aa The movie has to have a robot in it. It doesn't have to be a starring role. It can even just be one scene. But preferably, the robot would have some significance to the themes of the film.\n\n\u26aa A robot can be a lot of different things, but it needs to have some sense of humanity. Blade Runner counts. Transformers counts. Even Interstellar counts. Sonic the Hedgehog (with the little drone robots) doesn't count.\n\n\u26aa Short films and documentaries are a plus, to space out normal feature films.\n\n\u26aa Bad movies are awesome! Like I said, I'm watching Nic Cage movies this year. My tolerance for bad movies is pretty high.\n\n\u26aa It needs to have a Letterboxd entry. Sorry, that's just how I track my movie habits. If it's not on Letterboxd, I may still watch it, but it won't be part of this.\n\nSo, what do you recommend?",
