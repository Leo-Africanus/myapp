As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he soon rediscovers purpose, belonging, and the quiet beauty of human connection.*\n\nDirector: Hikari\n\nCast: Brendan Fraser, Mari Yamamoto, Akira Emoto, Takehiro Hira\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rental_family)\n\n**Metacritic:** [70/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/rental-family/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Franck Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser-hikari-1236362251/)\n\n&gt;Brendan Fraser's superbly nuanced and expressive performance proves key to the film\u2019s power, and he\u2019s well matched by excellent supporting players, including Mari Yamamoto as one of his role-playing co-workers, with whom he develops a strong friendship (and who thankfully doesn\u2019t turn out to be a predictable love interest).\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser/)\n\n&gt;\u201cRental Family\u201d is, in turns, wholesome and vicious, funny and severe, contrived and elegant. It is after all a film about actors with oodles of range, undergoing the unique challenges of their craft, and these shifts serve the material well but they don\u2019t always work wonders for the audience. It\u2019s easy to struggle with how exactly we\u2019re supposed to feel about all this.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser-1235149619/) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;It\u2019s impossible to watch Fraser\u2019s turn without thinking about the various injuries he\u2019s suffered over the span of his career (physical and otherwise), and that extra-textual layer of personal history goes a long way towards fleshing out the underwritten character he inhabits here. His see-through screen persona makes for a similar advantage, as it allows Phil\u2019s services to perfectly split the difference between the realness of his connection and the artifice of his affect. His relationship with Mia feels real as can be and glaringly fake all at once, which is just as well in a gentle little movie that recognizes truth and performance as two sides of the same coin.\u00a0\n\n",

        "content": "For me, it was Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. I don't think that the movie is bad (it does has some cool scenes such as the Darth Maul fight scene) but I am saying this: we were all excited for the return of Star Wars after a 16 year hiatus, it was constantly hyped up, was the most anticipated movie of our lives and we were curious to know about the rise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader...\n\nInstead, we ended up getting Jar-Jar, a long podracing scene, CGI overload and corny dialogue that was written by a 7 year old. We waited 16 years for this film to come out and also, we get a sci-fi movie, disguised as a children's film for the first 2/3rds of the movie. It was a huge letdown at the time but despite this, I since have cooled down quite a bit on the prequels with the exception of Jar-Jar Binks as at least, it still has the Star Wars feel to it and a cool fight scene to Phantom Menace which is the Darth Maul fight scene with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.",

She might be an author or something like that. There is a younger woman (potentially a man) who is like a mentee who kinds of ends up being her caregiver. She wants to be more and successful but the older woman is sort of dragging her down mentally.\n\nI believe the younger person is engaged, and the older woman is against that I think. The older woman is married and the husband is not around often. A lot of the movie takes place in the house. There are books, I think it ends in a garden.\n\nThe older woman might have dementia or some kind of illness. She\u2019s very snappy and manipulative.\n\nThe closest thing I\u2019ve found is The Lesson but it\u2019s not that.\n\nSlow burn drama. Not a ton happens. English language. Made in the last 10 years.\n\nScenes at dinner table, bathroom, bedroom, flowery garden.\n\nPlease help me.\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU REDDIT! You movie buffs did what AI couldn\u2019t. It was Shirley.

Where the first and second used the murder-mystery as a jumping-off point for some very funny contemporary satire, *Wake Up Dead Man* is much more introspective. In a funny way, it\u2019s a little analogous to *Joker 2*, not because it unloads on its audience in the same acerbic way but because it poses similarly metaphysical questions about its own popularity. Why do people respond so eagerly to stories of murder and betrayal? To answer that, director [Rian Johnson](https://deadline.com/tag/rian-johnson/) goes back to the greatest story ever told, using a small religious community as the setting for the third instalment.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-third-knives-out-1235149631/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;It works, and it\u2019s no big mystery why \u2014 Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.\n\n[Awards Radar - Joey Magidson](https://awardsradar.com/2025/09/07/tiff-review-wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-is-rian-johnsons-best-and-most-ambitious-installment-yet/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Filmmaker Rian Johnson trusts the strength of his franchise to play around with format and theme. The gothic elements on display, as well as the religious aspect, may initially seem like a left turn, but it all ends up fitting like a glove. He knows the must haves for a *Knives Out* flick and absolutely delivers. A few big sequences here at TIFF received ovations once completed. You just can feel that you\u2019re in the hands of a master storyteller, so you\u2019ll follow him anywhere. Johnson knows that and 100% makes the most of it.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-3-finds-god-and-is-so-good-because-of-it/)\n\n&gt;In terms of pure, heady kicks, it outpaces *Knives Out* but falls just short of *Glass Onion*. In the big picture, however, such distinctions are rather inconsequential; more important is that Johnson\u2019s franchise remains a sly and sure-footed delight, as well as demonstrates, with its religiously minded latest, that it\u2019s capable of coloring its Christie-esque mysteries in a variety of shades.",

What if NASA faked an important mission to keep their funding.\n\nWhen CAPRICORN ONE was filmed, there were many conspiracy theories out there that NASA faked the moon landing. The most infamous one involved Stanley Kubrick directing the moon landing. CAPRICON ONE deals with NASA faking a mission to Mars.\n\nCAPRICORN ONE was made during a decade where conspiracies were everywhere and being carried out. The movie makes you think that something like a mission to mars can be faked for a variety of reasons.\n\nBesides showing a possible blue print of how to dupe the public into believing something, this movie is notable for the Hollywood debut of O.J Simpson aka the Juice.\n\nFor anyone not aware, O.J was a major star in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills and later the San Francisco 49ers. He was the 1st Running back to rush for 2k yards in a season. even more impressive since the NFL season was 14 games back then and the Bills sucked, forcing teams to gang up on O.J. \n\nHe would later on have a notable career in Hollywood, starting with this movie and the Naked Gun Franchise. \n",
