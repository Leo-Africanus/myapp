        "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about how insanely hard it must be to give a great performance when the script itself just isn\u2019t there. Most of the time, clunky dialogue or weak storylines kill even the best efforts, but sometimes an actor still manages to make it believable, emotional, or even iconic. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen movies or shows where the writing felt off, maybe cheesy or uneven, but the cast somehow carried it anyway. Performances that made you forget how bad the lines were.",
