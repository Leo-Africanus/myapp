        "content": "Soderbergh fans are eating good this year.\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_bag)\n\n**Metacritic:** [86/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-bag/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-michael-fassbender-b2710141.html)\n\n&gt;While the supporting cast are impeccable across the board, it\u2019s really Blanchett and Fassbender\u2019s film to command, with performances that drip with old-school star power. Fassbender, when he delicately adjusts his glasses or cuffs, evokes the sly, chilled elegance of a Michael Caine or Dirk Bogarde, but with a sliver of vulnerability in the eyes that really begs the question of what exactly is going on in that head of his.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/black-bag-review-fassbender-blanchett-spy-up-a-storm-for-steven-soderbergh/5202447.article)\n\n&gt;Highly entertaining from start to finish, the film benefits from David Koepp\u2019s inventive screenplay and Soderbergh\u2019s storytelling swagger.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/black-bag-review-the-sleek-sexy-spy-thriller-movie-theaters-need/)\n\n&gt;When it comes to sleek, stylish genre movies, Soderbergh remains a maestro at the top of his game. A spy thriller that feels like a cross between John le Carr\u00e9 and Agatha Christie, the director\u2019s latest\u2014written, as was his prior [*Presence*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/presence-review-steven-soderbergh-does-his-own-haunted-house-movie/), by Oscar-winning screenwriter David Koepp\u2014is at once clipped and fluid, as sharp as a dagger and as silky as luxury bedsheets.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett/)\n\n&gt;Human weakness is 'Black Bag\u2019s' greatest strength. It\u2019s an insidiously great spy movie, mature and satisfying. \u201cBlack Bag\u201d digs into the superficially erogenous spy genre and finds inside it a desperate need for therapy. It\u2019s an intricately intertwined tale of sexual strife and political machinations, and a strong reminder at the heart of every drama, personal or political, there\u2019s human weakness.\n\n[TIME - Stephanie Zacharek](https://time.com/7264825/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh/)\n\n&gt;Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George\u2019s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.\n\n[IGN - Siddhant Adlakha ](https://www.ign.com/articles/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-steven-soderbergh)\n\n&gt;Its story of three couples working at the same British agency turns all the right screws with impeccable timing, forcing its characters to examine the flaws in their relationships as its tale of state secrets gradually unravels. A film that projects domestic anxieties onto the espionage genre, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Black Bag is a slick, self-assured, wildly entertaining spy thriller about a husband-wife intelligence duo forced to question their trust.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender-1236329004/)\n\n&gt;Steven Soderbergh dashes off a sleek little genre exercise -- a doodle really, at a stage in his career when he\u2019s clearly just having fun -- that proves to be one of his smartest and sexiest films yet.\n\n[Deadline - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/03/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-spies-steven-soderberghs-stylish-thriller-1236311971/)\n\n&gt;With an A+ cast at the top of their game, a tight 93 minute running time, and dialogue with wit and bite, this finds the director with one of his best opportunities to do what he does so well and give that older audience a reason to go back to the movies.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-and-cate-blanchett-intrigue-in-marital-espionage)\n\n&gt;Steven Soderbergh\u2019s downbeat, affectless tongue-in-cheek spy comedy (\u201ccaper\u201d isn\u2019t quite right) is in this new mode, though taking itself to the edge of self-satire, with a few 007 refugees in the cast, efficiently scripted by David Koepp.",

        "content": "Roger Ebert had this great quote about movies and watching them at different points in your life. Presented in full below.\n\n\u201cMovies do not change, but their viewers do. When I saw La Dolce Vita in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \u201cthe sweet life\u201d represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamor, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello\u2019s world; Chicago\u2019s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello\u2019s age.\n\nWhen I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhat are some movies that had this effect on you? Based on a previous discussion, 500 Days of Summer was one for me. When I first watched it, I just got out of a serious relationship, and Tom resonated with me. Rewatching it with some time, I realized Tom was flawed, and he was putting Summer on a pedestal and not seeing her as a person.\n\nDiscuss away!\n\n",

And while it is cool to see the year by year winners, it is also pretty easy to get burned out. As I\u2019m not only watching them but reviewing and rating every single one as well. Plus the B&amp;W and outdated filmmaking over and over isn\u2019t necessarily ideal for a marathon, not for me at least. So throwing a \u201cfun\u201d movie in there between every few films helps with the burn out. \n\nThe only one I\u2019ve watched so far has been Game Night (2018) and that one fits what I\u2019m looking for perfectly. A fun, interesting, but not too serious movie. What other ones are there?",
