        "content": "I don't like to praise random films that I like, but as I'm rewatching The Manhattan Project, I'm struck every time by how *good* it is. Far beyond what is expected. \n\nChristopher Collett is incredible. His protagonist is smart, way beyond smart in some ways (and oblivious in othes), but also charming, athletic, has good relationships with adults in his life, and he's also a bit of a smarmy asshole. He's like Zack Morris, if he had the brain of Screech but the inability to think past the immediate like Zack often does. He's almost a prototype for the Mark Zuckerberg character in The Social Network.\n\nThe film doesn't rely on stereotypes. Cynthia Nixon's performance is so elegantly subtle. Her mature perception of the situation, her subtle delivery of dialogue,her ability to evoke emotion with a word or a gesture--it all works so well. And John Lithgow is such a smart and likable guy, it's hard to not feel bad for him as the situation gets worse and worse. And John Mahoney is the perfect no-nonsense military man who also is honest and direct about the role people play in the military-industrial complex.\n\nThe main character is a kid who constructed a nuclear bomb not to harm anyone, but just to see if he could. He's a mad scientist in the purest sense of the label. And the schemes he creates to get the materials, to escape once caught, and to deal with the aftermath are both extremely clever and highly realistic. \n\nOh, and the group of nerds are hilarious. And did I mention Robert Sean Leonard had a small role in it?\n\nMy last plug for watching this film: Roger Ebert gave it four (4) stars.\n",

Like, it's wayyy better than JL, but still not great. The story was so drawn out, and the slo-mo in every scene was just so uninteresting/uninspired (sesame seed falling from the trucker's burger, Lois putting down her coffee cup). As one reviewer put it, \"You could cut an hour without affecting the plot even a little.\" Also, why format a film for IMAX full knowing it would be released on the HBO streaming service. (Disclaimer: not hating on ZS, it's just my opinion)",

        "content": "Years ago when Imagine Dragons was at its peak of their popularity, everybody was using their songs in commercials and trailers (e.g. Friction for Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Warriors for Wonder Woman). But for some reason, someone thought that using Believer in the trailer Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was a good idea for a period piece mystery film, set in the 1930s.\n\nAnd that song did not work in the trailer at all. It was way too modern for a film set in the '30s and it was a weird song choice as well too for that trailer. That was definitely a weird moment during that period, before we even had slowed down songs in movie trailers.\n\nI give a special shout-out to Suicide Squad (2016) using Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody too and that was because the trailer was such a huge hit, WB hired the company that edited the trailer, to re-edit the movie as well. And it certainly didn't help the movie's quality at all lol.",

        "title": "Concerns about society and the future seen in older movies but not in the modern day",
        "content": "Movies, like any work of fiction, often tackle concerns that people at the time had about society. Some of these concerns are still as relevant as they ever were, like war, ecological devastation, poverty, racism, sexism, etc. But other more specific concerns and fears of the past are no longer relevant because they're either no longer an issue or no longer perceived to be that big of a problem compared to others.\n\nOne notable example is how a lot of sci-fi movies of the past set in the future like Logan's Run or Soylent Green dealt with worlds ruined by overpopulation, which was a real concern people had at the time. Today, we have over 8 billion people on Earth, yet overpopulation is no longer seen as a concern. In the past the fear was that overpopulation would mean not enough food, but thanks to advancements in agriculture we actually produce more than enough food to feed everyone, we just really suck at distributing it properly. Many countries actually have the opposite problem of low birth rates, making concerns about overpopulation even more of an alien concept to modern audiences. Growing populations actually do have a serious impact on the environment in the real world, but that is sadly not something society or the media care about as much.\n\nChanging socio-political circumstances also make concerns go away. Lots of 80s and early 90s American movies like Rising Sun, Blade Runner, Alien, or even Back to the Future II predicted that Japan would take over the world with their mighty economy because back then the Japanese economy was doing very well compared to the America. But then the Japanese economy crashed and the idea of Japan ever taking over the world is no longer taken seriously, replaced instead by fears of China taking over. And of course, all of the movies made during the Cold War about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism taking over were topical for the time but now no longer a concern.\n\nAnd then there's Birth of a Nation and other racist movies of the time, which showed how racist white people were terrified about the idea of black people having any power in society, as such the KKK preventing black people from voting is seen as a happy ending. Obviously racism is very much still around, but it's nowhere near this bad.\n\nSo what other concerns and fears about society and the future seen in older films are no longer seen as a problem or not as big of a problem?",

If so, I need to ask you a question lol. Every so often I think about this movie and it drives me absolutely freaking insane. Tonight I was thinking about when she said \"And I stopped shooting blanks.\" Do you think that is when she gave birth to herself?",

I don't want movies where they added some extended scenes or polishing or minor added scenes but are really heavy altered. Something like Zack Snyders Justice League or Once Upon a Deadpool.",

It also has a really smart script (not including the zoom-and-enhance trope), and a great score by James Horner. I never hear anyone ever talking about it, and I'm pretty sure it didn't make much of an impression when it released.\n\nSo, what other movies has an impressive cast, alongside great writing and direction, that nobody talks about anymore?\n\n(Also RIP Robert Redford. Charisma personified)",

        "content": "I mean Crystal is always funny don\u2019t get me wrong, and yes I know this was Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s breakout film. But Stern gives arguably the funniest but also moving performance of them all. He has some of the funniest parts and lines. Pretending not to sleep to not talk to his wife, can\u2019t comprehend how a VCR works, \u201cIf hate were people, I\u2019d be China!\u201d And asked what\u2019s the worst day of his life after his wedding day, \u201cEveryday since has been a tie.\u201d But he goes through probably the most trauma and growth out of them all. Mitch is afraid of death and Ed is worried about having kids, but Phil\u2019s entire life has now been destroyed, which wasn\u2019t doing so good anyway. His miserable marriage has finally ended, he\u2019s lost his job, and knows his ex is gonna take him for everything he\u2019s got. Including his kids. So he\u2019s the one who steps up and defends the group from the drunk cowboys. A final breaking point then has an emotional breakdown. Knowing it\u2019s probably not gonna get better. And from the not as good sequel it doesn\u2019t. But he continues on anyway. It hit me since I myself am going through a similar situation. A rough divorce, custody battle, loss of a job. It\u2019s like everything happens at once. So maybe I\u2019m just identifying with him lately. ",

There is also some movie that represent other things quite well but does not fit in the seven sins category such as Insomnia representing Guilt.\n\nWhat movie would you guys pick as the best representation for each sin?\n\nPS: Decided to not include Se7en in any of the list because its just too on the nose.\n\nEdit: Decided to do a thread best picks to compare with my original list:\n\n1. **Gluttony**:\n   * The Menu\n   * The Whale\n   * La Grande Bouffe\n   * Salo or the 120 days of Sodom\n   * Leaving Las Vegas\n   * Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n2. **Greed**:\n   * The Wolf of Wall Street\n   * Wall Street\n   * The Big Short\n   * Margin Call\n3. **Lust**:\n   * Eyes Wide Shut\n   * Immoral Tales\n   * Nymphomania\n   * In The Realm of The Senses\n4. **Wrath**:\n   * John Wick\n   * Oldboy\n   * Kill Bill\n   * I Saw the Devil\n5. **Sloth**:\n   * The Big Lebowski\n   * Schindler's List\n   * Trainspotting\n   * Office Space\n   * Clerks\n   * Garden State\n6. **Envy**:\n   * Black Swan\n   * Amadeus\n   * American Psycho\n   * The Substance\n   * The Cable Guy\n   * One Hour Photo\n   * The Talented Mr Ripley\n   * The Prestige\n7. **Pride**:\n   * Whiplash\n   * There Will Be Blood\n   * To Die For\n   * Oppenheimer\n   * Ex Machina\n   * Training Day",
