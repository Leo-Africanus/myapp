He's more contemplative, but also more of an authority figure. This scene humanizes them both and makes the following sequence that much more shocking.",

It just blows my mind because we've now gotten to the point where movies as we know them have been around for 100 years, right around the end of the silent movies of the 1920's.\n\nBut what's surreal to me like in the movie above, it really does feel like stepping 100 years in the past. I purposely listen to the dialogue to see how things have changed from then till now, and one line in the movie has a police officer say, \"If you play ball, we'll play ball,\" which is still a phrase you hear people say today. Of course I know I'm watching a gangster film so I know some lines will be embellished a bit, but it really feels like a history lesson. Some of the lines of dialogue are still spoken normally today despite this being nearly 100 years ago.\n\nLike just watching a dinner scene seeing the characters talk and pour themselves wine and discuss their day, doesn't seem much different than modern times Then you realize this movie came out before World War II even during the prohibition era and right after the stock market crash of 1929, and it's surreal.",
