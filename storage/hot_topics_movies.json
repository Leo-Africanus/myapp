The last 15-20 minutes was the craziest mindfuck I\u2019ve ever experienced in a movie. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. Is Mulholland Drive even real? Are we real?? I had to stop thinking of Betty and Rita as real people for the longest time.

        "content": "This movie has been on my watchlist for a long time and I finally got around to seeing it tonight.\n\nI thought the special effects were rly well done, especially the CGI given the time this\ncame out.\n\nI also loved the way this is more of a war period piece than a straight up fantasy, and how it blends aspects of fantasy into its very ground story!\n\nI was honestly expecting for it to be like a Tim Burton-esque \u201cLabyrinth [circa 1986]\u201d where after she first goes into the labyrinth it takes her on a magical journey, but I was pleasantly surprised how much of the storyline is just between the drama of fascists and the resistance. The moments of fantasy act as a nice addition to how Ofelia sees the world as a coping mechanism to the trauma around her (war, her mother\u2019s sickness, etc.)\n\nI am so curious as to what was real and what was just in Ofelia\u2019s head, because Vidal physically picked up the baby Groot fetus thing and threw it into the fire\u2026 but then the Pale Man wasn\u2019t there from Vidal\u2019s perspective when he chased her through the labyrinth, so can only she see these spiritual entities or..?\n\nI also just.. I was not expecting for her to die at the end let alone getting shot point blank like that. I haven\u2019t been this shocked watching a movie in a long time, I was lying down and when that happened I shot my head up and sat up in pure disbelief, mouth agape, eyes watering. The ending made me cry fr seeing her in the afterlife reunited with her family and having the \u201cprophecy\u201d fulfilled for the \u201cprincess to return to the land of spirits/leave the land of mortals\u201d wrapped up the fantasy aspects of the movie in such a way that made me rethink the meaning of everything fantasy-related that I just watched. \n\nWhat i didn\u2019t like about the movie was that there are a few little blunders with the audio syncing  and also seeing someone who\u2019s dead breathe for a slit second mildly takes me out of the movie for a sec, but other than that I give nothing but praise for this film. Praise for the costume designers who adorned the rich environments that brought colorful life into each scene, esp. the fantasy set pieces! Praise for the adult acting and the NOT god-awful child acting much\u00edsimas gracias a Ivana Baquero por darnos un gran performance fr. Praise to how Del Toro worked his craft and made such a unique, eerie, curious, intense work of art that pushes boundaries and major took risks with its characters. Mad respect to u for that Sr. del Toro. What a wonderfully melancholic movie, I can\u2019t wait to see it again with actual subtitles this time when i buy the blu-ray\n ",

        "content": "Just finished watching and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say Hans\u2019 betrayal didn\u2019t make sense but to me this ending was practically perfect.\n\nIn the first scene Hans harps on the importance of perception. The difference in treatment between rodents (rats and squirrels), and he also revels in the nickname awarded to him by the french (the jew hunter).\n\nHe also describes his ability to think like two different beasts, the hawk and the rat, which make him perfect for his role. For most of the film, he is positioned as a hawk as it\u2019s beneficial but by the end we see his ability to align his identity with that of the rat to carve his name on the right side of history.\n\nI also noticed the constant readjustment of his badges throughout the film which I attributed to his receptivity to public opinion and general desire for respect. It makes why he\u2019d prefer to be seen as a double agent rather than a soldier turned halfway through the war.\n",

        "content": "I been a longtime fan of these paperbacks.  But only one of them, Relic, was ever made into a movie.  Not great but not bad.  But that was a long time ago and nothing since.  These authors have a wide selections of mysteries, some with interesting reoccurring characters, set in places from the frigid Arctic to the deepest jungles.  Better yet, these  stories usually end up having twist endings with rational explanations, more or less, for the unspeakable horrors encountered.  And yet no movies to groove on.  The unconventional FBI agent Pendergast would have made an interesting franchise character.  (I think he could have been played by a young Johnny Depp twenty years ago.)  I really like Thunderhead and Still Life with Crows.  Which books would you like to see made into movies?  ",

        "title": "The rights for Bourne are up for grabs, how should they proceed with the character in your opinion? Should it stay on the big screen or move to the small screen?",
        "content": "I love The Bourne franchise. The  mystery, slowly uncovering who this mysterious character is, high ocatine chases, brutal hand to hand combat, lavish globe trotting locations. Its true Legacy and Jason Bourne did not live up to the first three, but they weren't that bad. But they really sqeezed a lot out of the character so is there more to squeeze? Matt Damon is up there age-wise and it would make no sense to continue the franchise with him as the lead. Problem is they already tried a passing of the batton with Legacy and the box office returns just weren't there. They tried a short lived show called Treadstone. In terms of format I believe the character should stay on the big screen. One of the best parts of the movies was the pacing. I think with a show the pacing would be a bit off. In terms of the content...I think they need to go the Legacy route again. Keep the lore and focus on a new character. Jason Bourne is Matt Damon, Matt Damon is Jason Bourne. Recasting feels weird. But they need to move beyond the scop story-wise. We've already had the whole, agent realizes he works for bad people, goes on the run, they try to kill him cause otherwise its all gonna come out bla bla. Like get a room of really imaginative writers and craft a new direction. What do you guys think?",

This sort of comment has become cliched in its own right.\n\nTo me, this has never bothered me; usually henchmen are killed in self-defense while the antagonist is typically disarmed and vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally: maybe killing the villain in cold blood is the \"right\" move to protect others, but I can't really fault the protagonist for not wanting to do that. I know I wouldn't want to have to deal with the psychological ramifications of that.\n\nAny other tropes you don't mind that Reddit really seems to hate?",
