        "title": "Juno is totally different as an adult",
        "content": "I recently watched Juno for the first time since I was about 13 or 14. I was in junior high I believe when the movie first released, and seeing it as an adult really blew my mind. The creators somehow perfectly captured the awkward and intense feelings of not being a kid, but not quite an adult yet either. \n\nFirst note, Mark was a massive creep and weirdo. Kissing a teenage girl when you\u2019re an adult is creepy and gross all on its own. Then you throw in that SHE WAS CARRYING THEIR ADOPTIVE CHILD. What the actual fuck! What a disgusting pathetic man. Watching the scene when he took Juno to the basement to show her the comic of a pregnant super hero was so disgusting. Their relationship in general was coming off very grooming, then he was seducing a pregnant 16 year old girl who was extremely vulnerable. In my young teenage mind, I thought Vanessa was such a wet blanket, suppressing his creative side and making him and Juno both feel like losers. In reality, she was a saint who should have kicked him to the curb way sooner. He deserved no grace. I cannot imagine my partner not only cheating on me, but cheating with a teenager. And not just a teenager, a pregnant teenager who is carrying my adoptive son. Vanessa was such a great person and didn\u2019t deserve anything that pathetic excuse of a man put her through. \n\nSecond note, Juno(and company) is extremely immature and the creators did a great job of showcasing it. I love her quirkiness, but the way she did not understand why it was inappropriate to be popping up at Mark and Vanessa\u2019s house was very telling. There are two sides to that coin, because she may have known it was inappropriate but was too young and naive to see the long term outcome of the situation. She definitely didn\u2019t understand why a man of his age shouldn\u2019t be chumming it up with her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy the fact that he was even giving her attention at all. It helped that he liked the same things, so in her mind it was confirming she was cool. It just shows exactly how immature she was, unable to look past your own bubble to see the rest of your life. \n\nOn another note, it was implied that she and Bleaker were way better friends than what we saw in the movie. It seemed that they were hanging out everyday, had all the same interests and hobbies. But, when Juno came up pregnant Bleaker fell off the map. He never seemed pressed when she would stop and say hey, but he did absolutely nothing to try and help her in the situation. He also didn\u2019t understand why it hurt her so much he was taking someone else to a dance. At that point in the plot, we really got to see how the normally confident and abrasive Juno was becoming self conscious and confused by the weight of her feelings. Highlighting how juvenile everyone was, while dealing with such a serious situation was just top tier writing. The whole movie did such a great job of capturing exactly how it feels to be 16. Too old for childhood, but nowhere near an adult yet. Even though every single 16 year old in the world thinks they\u2019re an adult. It takes growing up to realize exactly how childish you still are at that age. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worth mentioning how great of parents her dad and Bren were. Bren was her step mom and they didn\u2019t seem particularly close, but she didn\u2019t hesitate when it came to Juno. Of the jump, she was getting her to a doctor, coming to her defense when needed, and making sure she had everything she needed. And her father, who was obviously uncomfortable with emotional bridges with his teenaged daughter, made sure she knew she was loved. The scene of her in hospital after giving birth brought tears to my eyes. \n\nAs a whole, the movie is great. I\u2019m not sure what category you could out this movie in, but they somehow captured a vibe of nostalgia I didn\u2019t know I was missing. And just to bring it in again, we should all beat Marks ass if we ever happened to see his character out in the real world. ",

Something that has impacted me a lot more than COVID... \n\nI opt out of watching a lot more movies now than ever in a theater because of the prevalence of people in the theater who should not be there. \n\nIt seems like there used to be a degree of self awareness and respect for the fact that you're in a room for a specific reason - to watch a movie. Not to talk. Not to look at your phone. Not for a running commentary on the movie. Not as a babysitter for your kids. \n\nI legit do not understand it. I've been more annoyed and walked out of more movies in the past 5 years than my entire life. Never because of the movie itself. But the people who are ruining the experience. And this is not the exception - this has become the norm.\n\nThere's also no winning. No solution. Say something and get in a fight - or worse? Miss part of the movie by complaining to the theater? \n\nThe best I can hope for is to pick a showtime when the theater is almost empty. ",

        "content": "Now that the awards season is over, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to vent about. While most of the discussion surrounding the Oscar-nominated movies revolved around the likes of Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave, and Emilia Perez, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that I\u2019m Still Here was overlooked by most moviegoers. For instance, Fernanda Torres, the lead actress of I\u2019m Still Here, delivered a performance that was every bit as Oscar-caliber as anyone else\u2019s. However, in the outcry over Mikey Madison\u2019s victory, I struggled to see anyone mentioning her in the Oscar\u2019s threads as a potential contender, especially compared to Demi Moore, who many people thought deserved the award (though Fernanda was my first choice).\n\nThe reason for this is simple: not many people bothered to watch I\u2019m Still Here in the first place. And I\u2019d like to encourage you to do just that. I\u2019m biased, of course, as a Brazilian, but I\u2019m Still Here tells a unique story (that of Eunice Paiva and her family) in a very special way (kudos to Walter Salles, who is a national treasure). I have yet to meet anyone\u2014Brazilian or not\u2014who watched the movie and didn\u2019t like it. So, please, give it a chance! You won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nBTW, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m Still Here didn\u2019t get any recognition at all. I read a couple of articles (NYT, for example) in which it was mentioned as a frontrunner for the Best Actress award. Furthermore, it won Brazil\u2019s first Oscar with its Best International Feature award victory, and first Golden Globe with Fernanda Torres\u2019 victory. I just felt, from what I could read here on Reddit and other social media platforms, that not many people were talking about it as much as I felt it deserved, given its quality vis-\u00e0-vis the other nominees.",

        "content": "SPOILERS: I genuinely used to not understand the hype when I was younger and I only judged the film on a couple of clips and never saw the whole thing, I can now say that I was ignorant. I saw the film a bunch of times in the last few years in it\u2019s entirety, and I grew to absolutely adore the film, it\u2019s now in my top 10 of all time, everything about it, the whole idea of hope and believing that one day things will be better. Morgan Freeman\u2019s narration is absolutely perfect and he has so much soul in his voice, they couldn\u2019t have picked a better person for Red. The entire scene with Brooks\u2019s monologue and him committing suicide after being in prison for 50+ years has brought a tear to my eye every time I see it. The setting, the acting, the characters, the message, it is all top notch, and the cherry on top is the ending. The ending is so satisfying, after all the misery and hardship, Andy and Red reuniting on the beach in Mexico. It is such a beautiful, touching film with so much soul in it, and it is one of those few films that is just perfect in every way. It is the perfect film to watch if you\u2019re in a dark place in you\u2019re life, watching Andy getting his life ruined, but never giving up and always relying on hope, to have it all pay off in the end, whenever I watch this, by the end of the film, I always feel happy to be alive, because of the hopeful message, this film is optimism personified. The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece, and I genuinely believe it should\u2019ve won best picture in 1994!",

The majority of the film was getting to know the characters and their burgeoning relationship, with horror sprinkled in amidst it all.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other movies that do this well? I really like romance, and I really like horror (especially monster/body horror), so I'm hoping to dig deeper into this subgenre that squishes them together.",

I think they were filmed with that intention in mind. But are there any movies that were never intended to be black and white but still could benefit from a viewing that way?",
