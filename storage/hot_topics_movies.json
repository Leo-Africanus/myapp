        "content": "A few weeks ago I made a [post about a great box office fantasy game a redditor has been perfecting for the last few years.](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pk1m27/introducing_the_fantasy_box_office_game_two_years/)\n\n# www.FantasyBoxOfficeGame.com\n\nThis is a year-long fantasy game that involves three seasonal drafts. It's a great low-key way to add some excitement to each movie release and as someone who's been playing it the last two years with coworkers/other redditors I can attest it's an absolute blast. \n\nEven though 2026 has begun you can still have your first draft any time. My leagues are drafting this week but January is so slow release-wise there's still plenty of time to put a good league together. \n\nIf you want to know more about the game check out the reddit post I linked above or just head over to the site to check it out! It's **totally free** to play and the UI is very intuitive. Big shoutout to /u/Chris_Tennant for making the site over these past few years!\n\nSo check it out and let us know if you have any questions! Happy New Year!",

Critics and audiences loved them. \n\nAction goes through trends like any other genre; The Raid/John Wick style action is/was all the rage for awhile, and while those are good, they just don't feel as memorable or well written as the stuff in the 80s and 90s. The Joel Silver, Joel Schumacher era, I guess? \n\nWe can point out several things from increase in CG explosions &amp; gunshots, to the rise of superhero cinema to streaming channels taking the smaller budget action films, but there's a specific type of big Hollywood action film we just don't get anymore.

The moment he lets his partner die just to get exclusive footage genuinely made me angry, which says a lot about how effective the film is.\nJake Gyllenhaal was incredible. The calm way he plays Lou, the forced smiles, and the lack of empathy feel disturbingly real. I hated the character, but I have a lot of respect for the performance.\nIt\u2019s not a fun watch at all, but it\u2019s a powerful and uncomfortable one. Curious how others felt about it.",

My friends wanted to see it, then I went with family, then I went with my cousins or something. But overall I watched it like 4 times. One time I had to sit in the front row, was forced to do it, because of how many people were there. Never sat in the front row again lol.\n\nIn hindsight though it was a really unique experience because it was my own personal phenomenon. That was like peak Carrey too ... Miss his movies ... Miss comedies in general",

        "content": "I went into Lawrence of Arabia expecting a stuffy, tedious, dated film where I'd probably give up after 20 minutes. Instead it felt incredibly fresh, relevant, and endlessly exciting, and I ended up glued to the screen for the full 3 1/2 hrs or so. I haven't stopped thinking about it since. The story, the fascinating intracacies and emerging contradictions of the character, and how incredible the filmmaking was. I love how Lawrence's attitudes and ideas were shaped by the responses he gets to various events, his innocent, pure idealism slowly crumbling into this cynism and bitterness.    \n\nIt was just incredible. Like Barry Lyndon, every shot is just beautifully framed and interesting. Then the huge scenes of people, with hundreds of camel mounted arabs galloping across the desert, or hundreds of unmounted horses escaping a traincart. I just have no idea how they were able to create some of these shots, and in such remote places of the world.   \n\nIt was absolutely mind-blowing to me now, so I can't imagine how audiences would have received it back in 1962, when they probably hadn't even seen colour footage of desert before? It must have been far more impactful than any spectacle films we have today (e.g Avatar etc). And so much more mature and complex. I'm sad we'll never see anything like it again.   \n\nIf you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, and on the biggest screen possible. \n\n",

Megatron is killed and the Transformers are hopeful for the future as Sam's character arc is wrapped up. You think that they could end it on Dark of the Moon, with a perfect ending. And that's coming from someone that wasn't even big on Bayformers in general besides for the first one.\n\nBut no, they did two more Michael Bay Transformers movies (Age of Extinction and The Last Knight), while recasting LaBeouf with Mark Wahlberg and undoing the ending of the third film. By that time, it had approached into the ridiculous and overdone territory with a Transformer that could age old. I mean, really. That baffled me a lot. It was clear that by the time Last Knight came out, the whole franchise had run its course and realistically, there was no coming back from it. The Transformers movies has since improved overtime but holy smokes, that franchise was just going downhill bigtime for a while with no signs of improvement until Bay stepped down from the director's chair.",

        "title": "Perfect Days (2023) touched me deeply",
        "content": "I started off my 2026 in cinema with Perfect Days, a movie that\u2019s been on my list for quite some time.   I\u2019m not all that familiar with Wim Wenders\u2019 work - I\u2019ve watched and really like Paris, Texas but haven\u2019t seen anything else by him. Perfect Days seemed right up my alley though - a slow-burn slice of life film based in Tokyo, so I decided to check it out.\n\nIt really is a very restrained and low-key story, even moreso than Paris, Texas, but it has a way of creeping up on you. I\u2019m finding that as much as I enjoyed it when I initially watched it, Im starting to appreciate it more afterwards as various scenes keep creeping up on my head. \n\nWhat really stands out to me is that I found the story simultaneously uplifting and sad. There\u2019s something beautiful and inspiring about how Hirayama lives his day to day life, following the same routine of going to work, listening to his favourite songs, finding the joy and simple pleasures in going to his favourite bars or watching the sunlight peek through the top of the trees while enjoying an egg sandwich. It\u2019s contemplative and asks questions about what constitutes a meaningful life for someone. It seems like Hirayama may be from a well-off family based on the small scene with his sister, and her reaction to him cleaning toilets - but this is what brings him joy, the little mundane routines of everyday life, finding the beauty in the ordinary. \n\nOn the other hand, there seem to be some hints that maybe everything Hirayama is doing is almost a kind of coping mechanism. Something happened in his family life which made him run away and lead this solitary, insular lifestyle. Are these \u201cperfect days\u201d something he\u2019d always dreamed of or are they something he had to create to deal with whatever happened? I think this is where the narrative can be interpreted as more tragic than it initially appears to be.\n\nI can\u2019t speak highly enough of Koji Yakusho\u2019s performance. The movie relies entirely on him to make it compelling considering how sparse (nonexistent actually) it is from a plot perspective and he really carries the whole thing. What\u2019s really impressive is how quiet and restrained of a performance it is. There\u2019s no big emotions, big speeches or gestures here. The dude barely says more than a few words in the entire movie - he just conveys it all through his eyes and facial language and it\u2019s incredible. You get a full picture of his inner life and who he is as a person in the here and now.\n\nRegardless of what the true meaning behind the story is, I personally found it to be very poignant and thoughtful, and it made me reflect on my own life and the things I often convince myself will make me happy. Its a reminder to be present in the moment, appreciate what you have and find the intrinsic pleasure in the act of doing something. \n\n\u201cNext time is next time. Now is now.\u201d",

        "title": "\"The Apartment\" (1960) gets better with age.",
        "content": "I finally watched Billy Wilder's \"The Apartment,\" and I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for how heavy and emotionally complex it would get beneath its clean, witty exterior. Going in, I expected a light romantic comedy. What I got instead was a surprisingly honest exploration of loneliness, moral compromise, and even suicide, all wrapped inside one of the most deceptively simple premises I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nAt first, the setup feels almost sitcom-like. Jack Lemmon lends his apartment to higher-ups at his insurance company so they can carry on affairs, hoping it\u2019ll help him climb the corporate ladder. It\u2019s clever, funny, and absurd. But as the film unfolds, the simplicity of that idea spirals into something nuanced. His apartment stops being a joke and becomes representative of his isolation, a space he technically owns but never truly gets to live in.\n\nJack Lemmon's performance is absolutely perfect. He plays Baxter as the ultimate everyman, he is awkward, well-meaning, quietly desperate to belong. Lemmon\u2019s performance makes Baxter\u2019s loneliness feel painfully real without ever becoming too melodramatic. You can see how Baxter\u2019s small moral compromises slowly eat away at his sense of self, even as he keeps smiling and cracking jokes.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how directly the film confronts despair and suicide, especially for a mainstream Hollywood movie from 1960. Shirley MacLaine\u2019s Fran is treated with genuine compassion, and the film never trivializes her pain. Instead, it frames loneliness as something systemic created by power imbalances, emotional neglect, and a culture that rewards selfishness.\n\nThe film features an exchange of dialogue that is among my favorites in film now:\n\n*The mirror... it's broken.*  \n*Yes, I know. I like it that way. Makes me look the way I\u00a0feel.*\n\nBy the time the movie ended, it stood out for feeling far more layered than its premise suggests. It has its humorous moments, but it\u2019s also deeply human and sad. For a film over 60 years old, it feels shockingly relevant and I imagine it speaks more so now to people than it did when it was introduced as a \"comedy.\"",
