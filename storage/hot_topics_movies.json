        "title": "February 21-23 Box Office Recap: Despite repeating at #1, 'Captain America: Brave New World' collapses 68.3%, the third worst second weeekend drop in the MCU. Meanwhile, 'The Monkey' opens with $14 million, the second best debut in Neon's history.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xec8micb16le1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9aaf2ff9ae07e359ef5b9d59ed8b9fd2eb6025\n\nWell, the inevitable happened. ***Captain America: Brave New World*** was still on the top spot, but it had one of the worst MCU second weekend drops. Neon decided to release ***The Monkey***, and it deliver their second biggest debut ever. The other newcomer was Zachary Levi's ***The Unbreakable Boy***, which unsurprisingly bombed.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $71.1 million this weekend. That's up 38.6% from last year, when ***Bob Marley: One Love*** repeated atop.\n\nRepeating in the top spot, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $28.1 million this weekend. That represents a brutal 68.3% drop from its opening weekend. That's the third worst drop in the MCU, behind ***Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania*** (69.9%) and ***The Marvels*** (78.1%). This drop is insane, considering there wasn't much competition this weekend. But it's a sign that its weak word of mouth is already spreading.\n\nThrough ten days, the film has made $141.1 million. Its opening weekend was $18 million behind ***Quantumania***, and now its numbers are $26 million behind. That gap is only gonna get wider. $200 million is dead for this film, and it could also miss $190 million at this point. That's gotta hurt.\n\nDebuting in second place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** earned $14 million in 3,200 theaters. This is Neon's second biggest debut ever, just behind ***Longlegs*** ($22.4 million). Kinda crazy to think Osgood Perkins now has the top 2 debuts for Neon. It's also the best horror debut of 2025 so far.\n\nAll in all, this is a great start. Neon mounted a very successful marketing campaign, which was reportedly relying on digital ads. While horror titles often cost $40+ million to market, Neon kept things simple: they spent just $10 million in prints and advertising. A sign that a film doesn't need to spend a lot on marketing to open this high. Neon also emphasized the connections to ***Longlegs***, which was a smart call, and also highlighting Stephen King's involvement. Reviews were also good enough (78%) to convince others in giving this a chance.\n\nAccording to Neon, 58% of the audience was male, and 65% was 25 and over. They gave it a very middling \"C+\" on CinemaScore, which is also the same score for ***Longlegs***. That's not a death sentence for a horror tho; generally, these titles land in the C range. There's a lack of horror till ***The Woman in the Yard*** in late March. It won't hit ***Longlegs***' domestic total, but it should still hit $40 million, which is a big win for Neon.\n\nSony's ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.5 million this weekend. That's a 49% drop, which is steeper than both prior films. Through ten days, the film has amassed $25.2 million and it's probably gonna miss $40 million if it continues dropping like this.\n\nDreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 40%, adding $5.8 million this weekend. That's still quite rough for an animated title. The film's domestic total stands at $78.7 million, and it looks like $100 million might be out of reach.\n\nIn fifth place, ***Ne Zha 2*** fell 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has earned $14.8 million, but again, this market is not truly important for the film.\n\n***Heart Eyes*** had a boost last week thanks to Valentine's Day, but that's pretty much over. The film collapsed 73% this weekend, earning $2.7 million. The film has made $26.6 million, and it won't make it much further than $30 million.\n\n***Mufasa: The Lion King*** dropped 40%, adding $2.5 million this weekend. The film has made $245.4 million so far.\n\nIn eighth place, Lionsgate's ***The Unbreakable Boy*** debuted in 1,687 theaters, where it flopped with just $2.3 million this weekend. That's not a surprise, given how long it took the film to escape development hell; this was filmed back in 2020. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely it lasts long in theaters. Another L for Zachary Levi.\n\nThe Indian film ***Chhaava*** added $1.5 million this weekend, which was just a 21% drop. The film has made $4.8 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which dropped 53%, grossing $1.3 million this weekend. With a $45.9 million domestic total, the film has now amassed a 4x multiplier. Truly impressive.\n\n***Love Hurts*** indeed. The film collapsed 74%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. The film has earned a meager $14.5 million, and it doesn't have much gas left in the tank.\n\nQuiver Distribution released Martin Campbell's action thriller ***Cleaner*** in 378 theaters, and unsurprisingly, it flopped with $403,560. It will disappear quickly.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $35.3 million this weekend, for a $289.5 million worldwide total. That's a steep 60%, and its numbers are $75 million behind ***Quantumania*** through the same point. The best markets are the UK ($16.7M), China ($13.5M), Mexico ($10.7M), Korea ($9.1M) and France ($8.9M). Without any other markets left, it looks like the film will struggle to hit $400 million worldwide. That's flop territory.\n\n***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** has now hit $72 million overseas. The best markets are the UK ($34.5M), Australia ($6M), Poland ($4.2M), Netherlands ($3.3M) and Spain ($1.9M). And it still has some big markets left.\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.7 million this weekend, and the film has crossed $150 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Nosferatu* | Dec/25 | Focus Features | $21,652,560 | $95,608,235 | $178,719,280 | $50M\n*Wolf Man* | Jan/17 | Universal | $10,897,495 | $20,707,280 | $34,383,593 | $25M\n\n- It was time for ***Nosferatu*** to turn off the lights in the Krusty Krab. The film has closed with a fantastic $95 million domestically and $178 million worldwide, easily becoming Robert Eggers' highest film. Just wonderful. Wonderful all around. Focus wants to stay in business with him, which is why they greenlit ***Werwulf*** for Christmas Day 2026.\n\n- Hey, we were just talking werewolves, what a coincidence. Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** has closed with a terrible $20.7 million domestically and just $34.3 million worldwide. That's a pathetic 1.90x multiplier, and it's crazy to believe it only made it to just four weeks in theaters. Blumhouse is known for printing money, but this was the rare theatrical flop. Leigh Whannell was unable to replicate the success of ***The Invisible Man*** here. The final nail in the coffin: ***The Invisible Man*** made more in its opening weekend ($28.2 million) than what ***Wolf Man*** did in its domestic lifetime. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWith the Oscars on Sunday, there's just one single wide release this weekend. And it may struggle to hit $10 million.\n\nIt's Focus Features' ***Last Breath***, which stars Woody Harrelson, Simu Liu, Finn Cole, and Cliff Curtis. The film is a remake of the 2019 documentary and tells the story of seasoned deep-sea divers who battle the raging elements to rescue a crewmate who's trapped hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a neat little trick Steven Spielberg uses in his movies, starting with\u00a0*Jurassic Park*. There's a scene where Alan Grant is having raptors explained to him, while in the background, John Hammond is having a separate conversation. Both conversations are audible, but as the audience, you naturally focus on Grant\u2019s, which is more relevant to the plot. This layering of dialogue makes the world feel more lived-in, like we\u2019re overhearing real people rather than just following a scripted exchange.\n\nIn\u00a0*Saving Private Ryan*, that moment with the translator, Upham, works similarly. His nervous, clumsy energy contrasts with Captain Miller\u2019s (Hanks) composed discussion, reinforcing their dynamic. The overlapping dialogue makes it feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping rather than being spoon-fed exposition, adding a level of realism that pulls you deeper into the scene.\n\nSpielberg does this in\u00a0*Jaws*, too\u2014think about Brody, Hooper, and Quint talking over each other on the boat. The chaotic energy makes their interactions feel natural and unfiltered, pulling us deeper into their world.\n\nIt\u2019s such a clever way to enhance immersion without drawing attention to itself. Has anyone else noticed this in his other films? Would love to hear more examples!",

        "content": "I was pleased when Gene Hackman won the Academy Award because  Bill Daggett isn't a easy character because of his complexity as an amoral character, he's someone who's trying to end the problem by not bringing justice against the men who scarred a local prostitute, because he's afraid of the impact it will degenerate, yet the more he insists on going after the vigilantes the prostitutes pay for, the more cruel and psychotic he becomes, getting to the point you just realize he's a bad guy. \n\nYes, you do see Bill is problematic early on, when he shuts down Alice (Frances Fisher), and he gets worse and worse. The glee he gets from torturing English Bob (Richard Harris) and Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is where you truly see the monster he is. \n\nIt's also curious how Will Munny (Clint Eastwood) is the former murderer who is reformed and is currently a widowed family man who has enough empathy to comfort Delilah (Anna Thomson), the victim of the slashing, whereas Bill Dagger, the law of the land, is sparing criminals and killing anyone who tries to avenge the victim of a knife attack.",

        "content": "So somehow, we're now in the far flung future of 2025. Back when I was a kid, an \"old movie\" typically meant a black and white movie from the 30's, 40's, 50's, etc. Even 60's and early 70's movies seemed \"old\" back then when we were in the 90's.\n\nHowever, we're now....somehow, in the far flung future of 2025. That means 80's movies are now over 40 years old and 90's movies are over 30 years old. For a teen growing up today, a movie that came out in 2005 like Batman Begins would be considered \"the old Batman movie.\"\n\nSo what do you consider an old movie these days?",

        "content": "We all complain about how modern trailers have a tendency to spoil everything about the movie except maybe the big twist or the ending, and sometimes even those are not safe. Which is why it's surprising when something completely unexpected happens in the movie, not because it's something actually unexpected, but because the trailers and marketing completely omitted it. Sometimes even entire characters will be mostly absent from the marketing but turn out to be more important than some celebrities in the film that got top billing. Often this isn't even intentional, the people in charge of marketing just prioritized other things.\n\nSo what plot points/characters were you surprised weren't spoiled by the trailers?",

        "content": "I'm 40 years old and checked it out this morning, the perfect movie for a lazy Sunday morning. I'm not sure why I avoided this one for so long. Right out of the gate, the opening hostage scene at the grocery store pulls you in with its serious 80's action movie vibes. Whereas a movie like Commando purposely hit you with funny one-liners, Stallone's sleepwalking expressions through this movie allows his one-liners to come across with a more serious intention. We learn absolutely nothing about Stallone's character other than the fact that he means business when taking out bad guys. And the main henchman in this flick, I swear was a bad guy in every other 80s and early 90s movie. At times, this movie reminded me of a horror version of Robocop. Looking it up, looks like it came out a year before Robo. There were some serious horror vibes in this movie, especially the hospital chase that reminded me of Halloween 2 with Michael Myers. Cherry on top is when Brigitte Nielsen's character asks Stallone's character what he will do next after getting through this ordeal, and he says something like, probably work on another case.",

        "content": "It was a case of extreme bad luck because she got in a major accident which left her traumatized. Those crucial years she could have taken advantage of the fame and exposure didn't happen and when she did come back, she got a rhinoplasty which modified her face and made her unrecognizable. \n\nI watch \"Dirty Dancing\", a formulaic yet engrossing romantic dance drama, and as sexy and charismatic as Patrick Swayze is, it is Jennifer Grey who keeps it together. She's the main protagonist, she's playing the \"ugly duckling\" who blossoms as a dancer and sizzles with Swayze onscreen, their relationship going from tense and hostile into affection, admiration and love. Grey's Baby is easily identifiable, any girl (or boy) can connect with her character.\n\nThe more I watch Dirty Dancing, the more I like Jennifer Grey. You don't see many heroines like her on film today. Some of her lines are cheesy and corny but Grey commits to it. I couldn't dislike her. I kept wanting to know what she'd do next, her character's clumsiness made her endearing instead of unapproachable like Cynthia Rhodes' Penny.",
