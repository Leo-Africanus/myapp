        "content": "We are **Janty Yates** (Costume Designer) and **David Crossman** (Costume Designer \u2013 Military Costumes) and we had the pleasure of working on Ridley Scott\u2019s new film, Gladiator II. We\u2019ve both spent decades working in the industry, garnering awards, and working on some of the biggest movies in Hollywood.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on Ridley Scott projects previously, and between the two of us, we\u2019ve worked on franchises like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Alien. With an eye for detail, and a love of storytelling, our passion for outfitting the right actors in the perfect wardrobes is very special to us both.\n\nIf you want to know more about the process, the methods, and the artistry of costume design for big, epic movies, we\u2019re here to take your questions.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\n\n* [Janty Yates](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946765/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703178&amp;usg=AOvVaw3l_HfawFgp6Rgx07DWbfZl), Costume Designer. Yates has worked in this field since 1989 and has two Academy Award nominations, including one win.

        "content": "**The Birdcage** is my favorite comedy. Funny thing, my PASTOR loves it too. He's the reason why I saw it. \n\nI was looking at 1/2 star reviews on Letterboxd because looking at bad reviews of movies you love is funny. Anyways, a bunch of negative reviews of this say that Val, the son, is the biggest villain in cinema history and he's homophobic to his own gay parents and such. \n\nI've seen the movie a handful of times, and I don't see it that way. \n\nVal clearly loves his parents, he gives them a kiss when he comes home, he doesn't show hatred to them, or anything like that. Sure, he gives them little time to redecorate their home, but he doesn't call them slurs or such. \n\nVal has also clearly never made his family change before. He mentions to his Dad that when he was a kid, he was told that he should tell teachers that his father is a businessman, not the owner of a gay drag club. So, it was his fathers who have made him change in the past. \n\nIt's always been clear to me that Val loves his 2 fathers, and that the changes are to not turn away his to be father-in-law. If Val's fianc\u00e9's family was much more accepting of gay people, he wouldn't have done that. \n\nI've never seen Val as the jerk. Kevin always was. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nNote: I'm not saying that Val is completely justified in every action he does.  I don't morally approve of Val kicking Albert out, for instance. Like all good characters (in terms of writing), he has a character arc. But the Letterboxd reviews that say he's the worst villain ever? Come on, he's not Cruella De Vil! \n\n",

Looking for movies that keep you on the edge of the seat the whole time and are next to impossible to predict. The only rule is it can\u2019t be a horror movie as my gf doesn\u2019t like horror. Preferably post 1990 but open to older movies if they\u2019re that good. Limited series suggestions are also welcome. TIA!",

        "content": "Having recently both become and adult and moved to NYC with enough money/time to see a movie more or less whenever I want in a theatre, I\u2019ve come to realise how much I adore midnight movies. Idk how much of a \u201cthing\u201d they are anymore (in relation to the heyday of midnight movies in the 80s I mean) but it\u2019s easily become my favourite kind of moviegoing experience. There\u2019s something so special to me about seeing some batshit movie at half past midnight with a bunch of strangers who wanted to be there enough to show up during that time. In a world where the \u201cmoviegoing experience\u201d seems to have changed so much, seeing The Thing in 35mm in a packed midnight showing or swinging by the IFC on a Friday night to watch some crazy foreign thing I had never previously heard of\u2026 easily my fav thing that I\u2019ve been able to do - especially in NYC (I\u2019m from the UK and midnight movies/art house theatres aren\u2019t as much of a thing anymore over there). The biggest joy of adulthood for me has been the ability to see my fav cult classics at midnight showings. Here\u2019s to weird movies - may they never die.",

The robot turns out to be the protagonist's mother.\n\nSeriously though, this is a movie full of twists and turns, but that's the only thing that makes it great. \n\nIt checks all the boxes, be it editing or the haunting musical score. And yes you got your violence and nudity, if that's what you want.\n\nThe story itself, as I said, is full of surprises and keeps you engaged to the end, even if you're not a scifi fan. \n\nThe acting is terrific, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and of course, Alicia Vikander, all give it their best.\n\nI love the setting and Rob Hardy's cinematography, Most of them shots are stationary with shallow depth of field but the composition is wonderful. I particularly enjoyed those shots that were filmed through the glass and with slow but fluid camera movements and soft lighting. \n\nAnd one last thing that really elevated the movie is the themes it addresses. It's Frankenstein, existentialism, consciousness, what it means to be human, etc. \n\nTotally worth checking it out.",

        "title": "Favorite movie by european country: Kosovo",
        "content": "Hello there,\n\nfollowing the official list of european countries by the Council of Europe, I've been asking you every day for more than 20 days about your favourite movie set in a given country. Sometimes this leads to confusion and personally, for example, I have now also found a solution to the paradox that the UK is a country made up of several countries (stay tuned!). A little bit of politics just can't seem to be avoided here - and this leads my directly to the next country.\n\nYesterday I asked about Italy and I'm not going to announce a winner here just yet. I'm still a bit early, but I'm going on a trip to the cinema later (\u2018Gladiator II\u2019 - wish me luck!) and still wanted to continue here in the list today. But the question was: Where to? In fact, the country I'm talking about now is not recognised as such by all other European countries. But I decided at the beginning that if in doubt, I would stick to the Council of Europe: And lo and behold, it is currently even considering accepting it as a member state. And so it won't make everyone happy, but it's all about movies set in **Kosovo** now. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: Since the competition for Italy is still running, I will refrain from updating the list here, which otherwise still follows, and instead I would like to draw your attention once again to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).",

I usually find when I'm in a bad place I don't actually want to watch a \"feel good\" movie as I can't force myself to feel things I can't right now. But I also don't have the head space for anything heavy or difficult of course. I find often the best things to watch are really good escapists fluff lol. \n\nI am watching Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets right now and it's surprisingly good for this so far lol. It's decidedly not a great film lol but it's fun to look at. It doesn't ask much of me but it's very well done for what it is. ",

        "content": "Just watched for the first time a few days ago so I'm late to the party but wow. I could go on and on about the cool intricacies of the time loop paradox but what hit me the most was how sad Jane/John's story is.\n\nAll her life she wishes to be loved. The only time she experiences it, she is quickly abandoned by the man. The next time she experiences that love is as John when he comes back in time and realizes he is the man she falls in love with. John gets to experience the same love all over again, but is forced to abandon her knowing the pain it will cause. Then as a temporal agent, he has to set Jane and John up, knowing the outcome.\n\nThe final scene of the movie where he says \"you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I miss you dreadfully\" hit me the hardest. Realizing that he's talking about him/herself. The only love Jane/John have ever and will ever experience is from themselves. It's so strange and sad. \n\nI would argue that he goes insane and becomes the fizzle bomber to maintain the paradox, not out of self-preservation but because he wants to make sure the love he experienced happens. idk y'all it's just sad to me. The majority of Jane/John's life is spent in isolation, orchestrating some cosmic self-cestuous love story that barely lasts a few weeks. ",
