        "content": "Hi r/movies,\n\nI\u2019m Mark Dossett, creator of The Town That Cried Bigfoot \u2014 a lost 1978 documentary about a small-town Bigfoot hoax that spirals into murder. But the deeper you dig, the stranger it gets \u2014because none of it\u2019s real. Not even the town.\n\nI built this film completely backward \u2014 starting with real 1970s news footage I found, then reverse-engineering a fictional murder, a cryptid hoax, and a made-up southern town buried inside real news footage.\n\nLet\u2019s just say... if you Google \u201cWeyburn, Virginia\u201d while watching, you might start to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAsk me anything about editing the truth into lies, creating fake towns, tricking Google, Bigfoot folklore, Blair Witch-style worldbuilding, or how the hell any of this even worked. Or anything else you want to discuss.\n\n**Film info:**\n\nThe Town That Cried Bigfoot\n\nGenre: Faux Documentary / Mystery / True Crime (kinda sorta)\n\nRuntime: 47 minutes\n\nWritten, Directed &amp; Edited by: Mark Dossett\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\nIn the winter of 1978, four desperate councilmen in Weyburn, Virginia staged a fake Bigfoot sighting to save their town from economic ruin. The plan worked \u2014 until someone turned up dead.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker\u2014 none of this ever happened. The footage is real. The town is fake. The hoax is real enough to show up on MapQuest. This is a hoax within a hoax \u2014 crafted to feel like a lost documentary buried in public access archives.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg)\n\n**Where to Watch:**\n\nAmazon Prime Video: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN)\n\nGumroad (Download the full film for $5 and support the filmmaker):\n\n[https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film](https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film)\n\nOfficial Merch: [https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com](https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com)\n\nAlso streaming on select free platforms: Stash TV, Fawesome TV, and Xumo.\n\nAsk me anything!

        "title": "A work-copy of the \"Lost\" Jerry Lewis film \"The day the clown cried\" has now been sold.",
        "content": "A quick AI translate from Swedish television:\n\n**\"After the Revelation: Hans Crispin Has Sold the Legendary Jerry Lewis Film**  \nUpdated yesterday at 22:31, Published yesterday at 10:03\n\n\u2013 I received a modest sum, says Hans Crispin to Kulturnyheterna. But I can't tell who bought \"The Day the Clown Cried.\"\n\nHans Crispin's pirate copy of the legendary Jerry Lewis film is the only known complete version.\n\nSwedish actor and TV personality Hans Crispin recently revealed to the magazine Icon that in 1980 he stole a film reel of the legendary Jerry Lewis film \"The Day the Clown Cried\" and made a pirated copy, which he has kept for 45 years.\n\nAfter that, he also invited SVT Kulturnyheterna to view the film.\n\nThe news gained international attention and was covered by Newsweek and Vulture, among others.\n\n**Only Known Copy**  \nThe film, which is about a clown in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, has never been publicly shown and is considered a \"holy grail\" for film enthusiasts. It has long been regarded as lost; the copy Crispin has is the only known version with intact editing and sound.\n\nHans Crispin, who at the time worked copying porn films to VHS at Europafilm, stole the film along with a co-conspirator and kept it in secret for decades.\n\nIn the Kulturnyheterna interview a few weeks ago, he said he was now done with the secret and ready to pass it on to the next generation. And he has done so.\n\n\u2013 I have sold it. For a modest sum. I can't reveal more. They came here and watched it. They made an offer. I accepted it, signed a paper, and promised not to tell anything more.\n\n**\"You're not supposed to do that\"**  \nWhen asked how he feels about having sold something he in a \"J\u00f6nssonligan-like\" scheme stole and pirated so long ago, he responds that he has reflected on it over the years.\n\n\u2013 Yes, I stole it. I did. And I've thought about it \u2014 you're not supposed to do that. That's how it is. But I really wanted to preserve it. And I looked up the statute of limitations a long time ago. Two years. And the rights to this film are so tangled that no one really knows who has rights to this copy.\n\n**How does it feel now, that your big secret is out?**\n\n\u2013 A bit empty, actually. I mean, I can't watch the film anymore. I\u2019ve always been able to before. Or show it to someone. You and Caroline Hainer were the last to see \"The Day the Clown Cried\" at my place.\n\nKulturnyheterna's freelance critic Caroline Hainer shared the story of Hans Crispin in the magazine Icon. However, she believes that the film will likely be accessible to a wider audience in the future.\n\n\u2013 Of course, there are financial interests. Jerry Lewis was one of the biggest comedians in the US in the 1950s. I guess it has fallen into the hands of someone who wants to distribute it. I would say there\u2019s a risk that the public might see it. It\u2019s a bad film.\"\n\nSource:\u00a0[Hans \u201dJ\u00f6nssonligan-kupp\u201d blev en v\u00e4rldsnyhet \u2013 nu har han s\u00e5lt den legendariska filmen | SVT Nyheter](https://www.svt.se/kultur/efter-avslojandet-hans-crispin-har-salt-den-legendariska-filmen)",

He was lucky the one guy joined him, otherwise the kid would have gotten the chair.\n\nThen he brings up all the holes in the evidence, and breaks the others one at a time. Why didn\u2019t he do that before even the first vote? Or at least before agreeing to the second one? Much of the evidence was questionable, and he was clearly prepared to talk about it.\n\nOtherwise I loved it.",

The rodent is believed to have survived, but **that didn\u2019t stop groups like charity The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) from taking steps to have the scene removed 36 years ago.**\n\n&gt;The scene was **subsequently cut by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) under the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937, which means it must be cut for any theatrical use**. The BBFC **also cut the scene under the Video Recordings Act 1984, meaning it must not be included on releases on formats such as Blu-Ray and DVD. Similarly, the scene should also not be aired on traditional TV in the UK.**\n\n&gt;Despite this, a **version of the film that included the banned scene was added to Disney+ a few months ago in April**. In response, the RSPCA called out what it described **as a \"loophole\" that enabled the banned rat scene to make it onto Disney+ in the UK, pointing out that streaming platforms are not bound by the same standards as film releases in cinema, DVD, or on traditional television.**",

It becomes a comparison game.\n\nSo it'd be really refreshing to have some movie recommendations where the characters are literally perfectly okay with living in a humble, simple life.\n\nEdit: I realise there's probably lots of movies that demonstrate this, but could you just give me some movie recommendations. Because this societal materialistic concept is something I struggle with. I dont want to go with the societal flow. I want to be okay with a simple life.",

        "content": "There\u2019s been a bit of an epidemic, especially in recent years, where movies are unnecessarily long to the point where it\u2019s a bit indulgent on the director\u2019s part and the film\u2019s narrative doesn\u2019t justify the XXL run time and it becomes a bit of a drag.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a big musical fan but I grew up watching the Sound of Music as a kid, so I decided to rewatch tonight (it\u2019s probably been around 15 years) - and for a movie that is 3 hours long, wow does every piece still feel so important.\n\nMaria and Von Trapp get together PAST the two hour point in the movie, yet the build up was so necessary to have you involved in the romance, and certainly didn\u2019t feel as long as it actually was in run time. The pacing is actually incredible for the narrative and building that emotional buy in, which is shocking and rare for a film so long.\n\nWhat films do you think genuinely justify an extra long run time and benefit from it? (and to throw a wrench in it, what movies utterly fail here?)",

        "title": "I'm Still Here (2024) was fantastic",
        "content": "Just finished this movie and wow, what an emotional gut punch. I saw a lot of critical acclaim for the movie last year, especially for Fernanda Torres' performance, and it's all very much deserved. Really, you can't talk about this movie without talking about Torres because she absolutely carries it on her back. It's one of the best acting performances I've seen in the past few years, especially because of how unshowy and restrained it is. It's all in the gestures, the expressions, the way she's barely holding it up to try and keep her family together after Rubens' disappearance. Just an absolute clinic in acting craft and technique. \n\nBut tbh the performances are stellar across the board, especially the girls that play the daughters. It all just comes off as so naturalistic, grounded and real. It often felt like I was watching a documentary of a Brazilian family's life. \n\nIt's ultimately a movie where the payoff is less about catharsis and more about acceptance. I knew the movie was based on a true story so I did a bit of reading beforehand to give myself some historical context, and knew what was coming. Even so, the writing and the performances make the characters feel so human and vulnerable that it's impossible to not feel their shock and pain, which overtime turns into a distant sadness and melancholy. \n\nI saw the main theme as using memory as a form of resistance. Rubens is gone, but Eunice and the children keep him alive by constantly going back to their photo and video memories of each other. The final frame of the movie seemed purposefully reflective of the earlier photo taken at the beach, at a time when the family was at their happiest with Rubens still around.\n\nIf I have one minor nitpick, it's that the 2 codas in the 90s and 2014 don't have quite the same level of impact as the first 75% of the movie - although the ending is quite powerful with old Eunice finally seeing Rubens being vindicated in the present day. But overall this is still a very powerful, poignant experience anchored by an absolutely incredible central performance by Fernanda Torres.",

I binged the whole series over the summer of 2011 and decided to get back to the original.\n\nI think it\u2019s because, relative to the other later films, Dr. No is quite simple that it\u2019s aged well. I don\u2019t know how its budget compares to Thunderball and the like, but this is a more standard 60s thriller with Bondisms added on top.\n\nHalf of the movie feels like a Caribbean detective adventure, and that just fits brilliantly. I do like the campy and more epic later films, but this format works, and I think it\u2019s why Casino Royale is such a strong film too. \n\nObviously it has its \u201cyep, definitely a \u201860s movie\u201d moments, but as a spy thriller from 1962? Holds up pretty damn well. \n\nI have no clue why, I remembered this as one of the worst Bond movies. Connery is, of course, a huge part of why the movie works. ",

But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1888624/elio-pixar-movie-review/) (75):\n\n&gt;The frenetic pace may keep kids hooked, but parents will appreciate the sequences when Elio hits the pause button and allows audiences to sit in the silence \u2014 of complicated ideas, of emotionally challenging conversations, and of the wonders around us we too often fail to appreciate.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/elio-review-pixar/) (70):\n\n&gt;But despite how charming and fun Elio is, it still falls prey to some of Pixar\u2019s occasional problems. Yes, this is a story of intergalactic adventures and a wide universe of possibilities, but it still can get a bit convoluted at times.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/elio-review-pixar):\n\n&gt;Overall, it\u2019s an entertaining bit of summer fun.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/elio/) (80):\n\n&gt;Robert Zemeckis\u2019 Contact for kids.

The cosmic misadventure introduces Elio, a space fanatic with an active imagination and a huge alien obsession. So, when he's beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide, Elio's all in for the epic undertaking. Mistakenly identified as Earth's leader, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and somehow discover who and where he is truly meant to be.",
