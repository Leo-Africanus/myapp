        "content": "I subscribe to Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and a few smaller services like Dropout and Nebula.\n\nAnd yet every time I think of an older movie I want to watch, it's not on any of them. Sometimes it's on one of the services I don't subscribe to, like Peacock, but a lot of the time it doesn't seem to be available for streaming anywhere without \"renting\" it. \n\nAre we really back in the 90s where I've got to rent movies and make sure i finish them within 48 hours before my rental is up? \n\nI certainly prefer to watch movies straight through in one sitting, but I'm busy. I have a life, a toddler, and things that demand my attention. I'm lucky if I get an hour of uninterrupted time in an evening to watch stuff. I already pay for too many services; I shouldn't have to pay-per-view and still worry about finishing a movie before it expires. \n\nThis sucks. \n\nAs for buying physical media, that's a great solution... sometimes. But like a lot of people these days, I don't want to be tethered to my couch. I watch across a series of devices, from my TV in my house, to the TV in my shop, to my phone.\n\nAnd yes, I know about the high seas, but that's not for me. I *want* to stream content legitimately, but damn if they're not making it difficult. ",

        "content": "It\u2019s weird how sometimes I can find out supposed \u201ctrue stories\u201d play a little fast and loose with the facts and it just doesn\u2019t bother me. The film is so good and entertaining I don\u2019t care. Catch Me if You Can? It\u2019s not one of those films. \n\nMan, is a damn good film. Great music, script, acting, directing. It\u2019s incredible. It fires on all cylinders. Except one. The \u201ctruth\u201d cylinder(I can\u2019t believe i just wrote that. It\u2019s late. Give me a break). And this one gets to me. A lot. \n\nMany of you know by now Frank Abagnale is/was full of it. Most of the crap he claimed to do he never did. But the real story is how he was conning people all the while he was a supposed \u201cstraight arrow\u201d. He was never a cheque expert. Never worked for or with the FBI. He holds no patents. All his company does is peddle a shady cyber security subscription program that got caught selling its users data. \n\nThe real story is how this huge blockbuster movie came out, nominated for Academy Awards, made by the biggest names you could ever get for a movie at the time. Spielberg, Hanks, DiCaprio? Frank himself even did press for the movie!\n\nAnd not a single MAJOR newspaper, TV network or magazine looked into the shit Frank spew. How is that possible? Oh a few small papers did here and there. They went nowhere. Frank was still making insane speaking fees as of a few years ago. Telling the same lies. If this happened today? That shit would be everywhere. Spielberg conned by a small time crook? Hanks? Leo? JOHN WILLIAMS???\n\nThankfully his BS is a lot more well known, but all most people know is that most of the movie didn\u2019t happen as they say it happened. Most people can forgive that. They don\u2019t know about the real victims. The ones he was conning even after the books came out. Or the women he assaulted. \n\nI suggest everyone give this link a watch to find out the real truth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVe-NF75-2s\n\nSo I say a sequel deserves to get made. \u201cCatch Me If You Can, Again\u201d. If Zuckerberg &amp; Social Network are getting one, why not Frank &amp; Catch Me if You Can?\n\nIt should be about the failure of the mass media to do the thing they should be doing. Looking into and verifying unbelievable claims. That this guy was able to go as long as he did, as publicly as he did? It\u2019s a real indictment on the western media. Yet another one.",

        "content": "\u201cThe original ending of American History X was Derek shaving his head again\u201d \n\nThis was confirmed false by the director pretty recently. The ending of the workprint version which was rejected by the studio is the same aside from a few shots. The original script has the same ending with a very melodramatic scene between Derek and Sweeney (Avery Brooks) added on at the end.\n\n\u201cThe machines used humans as processors in the first draft of The Matrix but the studios made them change it to batteries\u201d \n\nEvery version of The Matrix script has dialogue comparing humans to batteries. A comic by Neil Gaiman published as a tie-in with the first movie portrays the matrix this way, which was an artistic liberty on his end.\n\n\u201cDarren Aronofsky purchased the remake rights to Perfect Blue to steal a shot for Requiem for a Dream.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t even plausible. He could barely afford to make his previous movie (which cost less than 100k) and wouldn\u2019t have conceivably been able to purchase remake rights to a coveted film out of pocket so he could copy two shots which he could do for free anyways.",

There's a jump cut and the conversation carries on as normal.  When you think about it, it really doesn't make any sense.\n\nA good example of this is a scene from Hot Fuzz where Angel is theorising about who's murdering thr villagers.\n\nOr, during a training montage, they keep switching locations to do training for seemingly no reason.",

To quote Christopher Lee, every actor has to be in a bad film, but the important thing is to not be bad in it.\n\nSo, alas, what is the best time a great actor delivered an amazing performance when they really didn\u2019t need to in a bad movie? \n\nMy answer will always be Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Along Came Polly. Tragically gone before his time, there is no denying PSH was trying way harder than the material needed in this movie. \u201cRAIN DANCE\u201d will never escape my vernacular and I am totally fine with that",
