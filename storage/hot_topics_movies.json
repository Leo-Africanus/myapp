All three of them went on to be movie stars. I had to choose between them, and I did a series of screen tests. First, it was sort of a straight audition. Then I set up real screen tests in sets. Like there was a lab set, and there was a jungle set. And Zoe came in and read with everybody or tested with everybody 'cause she was now our baseline.\n&gt; \n&gt; And Sam was the one I kept going back to. And the studio disagreed. The Fox guys liked the other guys better. You know, I'll say one of 'em was Channing Tatum. So it's like, \"Okay, Channing did, well.\" You know, we're all good with Channing Tatum, right? You know, it could have been Channing Tatum.\n",

        "content": "First, *El Mariachi*. How cool is it that he made this movie on a $7k budget? Yeah, it looks like it in a lot of ways. It's grimey. Some of the camera angles are grotesque and awkward. But there's something just so enthralling about knowing that it really was just a dude with a camera seeing his dream come to life, crafting this larger-than-life folktale. I had watched it as a teenager years ago and always understood it as kind of the shitter film of the three. That has changed. It's also much more of a pure comedy than I remember: little things like the hotel clerk dialing up the cartel literally at x2 speed, but also the whole premise of a mistaken identity never really clicked as a farce until now. With that in mind, all the absurd action sequences of the whole series suddenly made sense. But then it also has this whole trippy, dream- premonition thing going on. \n\nThen the farce continues in *Desperado*, especially with the villain who is essentially one giant punchline. Of course the action scenes are ramped up to 11, with a ton more polish than the first. And my God, Banderas and Hayek have legandary chemistry. I can't think of a hotter woman on film, ever. Maybe Marissa Tomei in *My Cousin Vinny*. Maybe.\n\nAnd the *Once Upon a Time in Mexico*. Wow. I think the most impressive thing about this film is how almost no second is wasted. It's an ensemble cast of characters, and you get *just* enough of each to understand the character. None of it seems forced or abruptly introduced in a hamfisted or awkward way. Depp carries the load of the farce with the 3rd arm gag and the blind shooting, amongst other things. I've probably seen this movie a hundred times and it never gets old.\n\nI also love how 2 and 3 both open with these larger-than-life stories about our hero, but we know in 2 Steve Buscemi's character is doing a bit and playing it up, and that Cheech in 3 is actually *wrong* about the love triangle; he mixes up the general with Bucho, as Carolina was never \"with\" the general like the version he tells. It's all part of the mythos of mystery and rumors.\n\nI'm left almost saddened by the idea that I don't believe a trilogy quite like this might ever be made again. It's just pure entertainment: funny, sexy action with great music and adventure. Very, very few directors can reign all those elements together, and movies these days just can't seem to find a tasteful balance of these things without overdoing the effort and underperforming the execution.

There are lots of bad movies which still are very beautifully shot, but how about good films where the image on screen are the only element missing.\n\nI would count films like the Dogme 95 movies where there some might say the cinematography is not conventionally attractive, even if it was still deliberate.\n\nA couple of suggestions I\u2019d throw out are the Kenneth Branagh Agatha Christie adaptions which are reasonably entertaining, but have both glaringly bad CGI, and particularly in the case of Haunting in Venice, some super bizarre shot choices. The Hobbit movies also easily lose a star or two each because of how bad the CGI and lighting is in those films\n",

However, it has occurred to me recently all the classic films from the 80s, 90s and 2000s they watch together are pretty male centred. Think star wars, Indiana jones type things. All great films! But not the only things out there. So we have started watching some things together that are a bit more women  centred. So far she has really enjoyed oceans 8, miss congeniality, the devil wears prada and practical magic. Any suggestions for some others to include on the list? \n\nEdit: Some great suggestions, thanks guys. Too many to respond to individually now, but I appreciate all your thoughts and effort. ",
