I've honestly been skipping school a bit so watching movies will be a nice way to pass time. \n\nI'll probably reply to the comments and just rate the movies you guys suggested me if anyone is even interested in that. Anyways thank you to anyone who reads this and gives me an recommendation, literally means the world to me right now.",

These include Qui Gon Jin/ Rob Roy, Legalus/ Paris, Jaime Lannister, Lucius Vorenus, and Remus Lupin haha. All that to say just a really really good movie and this is stale news obviously but the directors cut is so much better than theatrical so I encourage anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it to give it a watch. \n\nTo me this is only a touch \u201cworse\u201d than Gladiator and one of Ridley Scott\u2019s best movies. If gladiator is a 9/10 then kingdom of heaven is 8/10. Excellent story excellent action excellent acting and the cinematography is beautiful too. It\u2019s such a shame to me they don\u2019t make historical/ancient epics like this much anymore nowadays. I guess that\u2019s because everybody wants superhero movies and Hollywood does whatever will make them the most money. I miss the days of movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, etc being popular and getting big budgets. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s more interesting about recycled and unoriginal superheroes constantly being made into \u201cnew\u201d movies but I guess it\u2019s all subjective. Still would LOVE to see more movies like this one being made in the years to come but I ain\u2019t holding my breath lol. Cheers ",

        "content": "For those that haven't seen that movie, I can really only recommend it to people who are in a good enough place emotionally to handle it, because oh boy... that was a very tough watch.  Fantastic movie though.\n\nWondering what other movies come to mind for you that are in a similar vein.  I think \"Funny Games\" somewhat approached that level of bleakness, but \"Out Of The Blue\" just felt so *real* in comparison that it really reached in and wrenched my heart in a way that a movie never has before.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a 23-year-old guy, and I absolutely love romance movies. I\u2019ve enjoyed them since I was a kid, and my love for the genre has only grown over the years. My mom introduced me to romance movies when I was young, especially Nicholas Sparks films, and over time, I developed a real appreciation for them. I genuinely enjoy watching the dynamic between two people falling in love, seeing their connection grow, and admiring the emotions and chemistry between them.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had a strong idea of what romance should be. Even when I was 8, I saw something beautiful in how two people could love each other, and that perspective hasn\u2019t changed. Romance movies give me that feeling of admiration, both for the relationship itself and for the way different characters evolve emotionally.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people, especially other men, tend to call me \u201cgay\u201d for liking romance movies. I\u2019m not, but it\u2019s frustrating that people assume that just because I enjoy love stories. It makes me wonder if a lot of guys out there secretly enjoy romance movies but just don\u2019t admit it because of how others might perceive them.\n\nSo I wanted to ask\u2014are there any other men here who genuinely love romance movies? If so, what got you into them, and what do you love about them? Would be great to hear from others who feel the same way!",

First time I watched an Al Pacino film (yes, I know, uncultured swine I am). Him and Robert De Niro stole the show, played off of each other very well. \n\nI know there are plenty of Al Pacino gems that I need to watch on the list, but what\u2019s a performance of his that you hold in the highest regard? I\u2019m stuck between wanting to view \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Advocate\u201d or \u201cScarface\u201d next before I dive into \u201cThe Godfather\u201d Series\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated, thank you!",

Like discovering another dimension or something that makes an attempt at unfolding the mysteries of the universe. Annihilation, is another great one for this. Arrival was excellent. For Tv- Dark, Black Mirror, The OA on Netflix were all thought provoking and interesting to me. The Leftovers I enjoyed. Especially the last episode. That ending! \n\nI would love a recommendation for a  movie/show.",
