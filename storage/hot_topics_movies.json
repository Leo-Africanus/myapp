        "title": "March 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Mickey 17' flops with an underwhelming $19 million domestically and a weak $53.3 worldwide total, against a $118 million budget. 'Ne Zha 2' crosses $2 billion in China.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/aofa0t30pxne1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=367e3fc800286c66b0f76329f8703a94f53e9972\n\nIt was a very weak start for the month of March.\n\nWith incredibly weak competition, Bong Joon-ho's ***Mickey 17*** topped the box office, but it still proved to be the latest sci-fi flop at the box office. There were 3 other wide releases, all of which flopped as well. Needless to say, it was brutal.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $49.2 million this weekend. That's an awful 62.4% drop from last year, when ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** topped the box office. This weekend is also barely up from last week, when there was just one wide release.\n\nOpening at #1, WB's ***Mickey 17*** flopped with just $19 million in 3,807 theaters. These numbers are eerily similar to the box office failures of other sci-fi films like ***Jupiter Ascending*** ($18.3 million), ***Ad Astra*** ($19 million), and ***The Creator*** ($14 million). The only comfort is that it was Bong Joon-ho's biggest debut, but that's not saying much considering his prior films all opened in limited release. And it cost more than all his films ($118 million).\n\nThe failure of ***Mickey 17*** isn't surprising. There's a risk in opening a new sci-fi film, citing the failure of the previously mentioned titles. Even though ***Mickey 17*** is based on a book, it was treated as an original title anyway. So the film's disappointing numbers are another hit at the argument that audiences crave for new and original films.\n\nBong is popular with the cinephile audience; there was enormous interest in seeing what he would do after the colossal success of ***Parasite***. But it's been 5 years since that film won Best Picture, and it appears that the public moved on. This film was originally set for March 2024, but it faced many delays. WB reportedly spent $80 million in marketing the film, and while it properly sells the film, many were taken aback by the film's humor and tone. Even though this is consistent with Bong's films, perhaps the audience was expecting something more serious, as sci-fi comedies are very niche. \n\nThis also brings up the topic of star power. Robert Pattinson is definitely popular, thanks to his roles in franchises like ***Harry Potter***, ***Twilight*** and ***The Batman***. But the thing is that his roles as leading man in non-IPs have not translated to box office success. Most of his films have been limited releases, and his last box office hit besides the three previously mentioned was ***Water for Elephants***, which came out back in 2011. This is not something exclusive to Pattinson, given that a lot of actors have struggled to open original titles. Reviews were positive (78% on RT), but not strong enough to convince those skeptical.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 65% of the audience was male and 71% was 25 and over. They gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore, which is neither bad nor great. There's a strong chance ***Mickey 17*** could be front-loaded, given that its Thursday previews ($2.5 million) should've guaranteed a $20+ million debut and it fell far short of it. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Mickey 17***, marking the latest box office misfire for WB.\n\nAfter topping the box office for three weekends, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** had to go to second place. It dropped 44%, adding $8.3 million this weekend. That's a fine drop, although it would've been ideal if it happened far sooner. Through almost one month, the film has earned $176.4 million, and it should get close to $200 million. Better than its second weekend suggested, but still not really a win.\n\nIn third place, Focus Features' ***Last Breath*** dropped 48%, adding $4 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has amassed $14.5 million so far, and it should finish with over $20 million by the end of its run.\n\nIn fourth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39% this weekend, adding $3.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $31 million domestically, and it has already passed ***I, Tonya*** ($30 million) to become Neon's third highest film ever.\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** had its best drop yet. It eased just 18% this weekend, adding $3.7 million. The film has earned $36.8 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.\n\nDreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dipped a light 20%, earning $3.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $88.6 million so far, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.\n\nAfter earning 5 Oscar wins, Best Picture winner ***Anora*** got expanded to 1,938 theaters. The film earned $1.8 million, taking its domestic total to $18.3 million. Quite impressive, considering it has been on digital platforms since December.\n\n***Mufasa*** refuses to leave the Top 10. It eased just 16% this weekend, adding $1.6 million. With this, it has crossed $250 million domestically.\n\nAngel Studios also opened ***Rule Breakers*** in 2,044 theaters, but it flopped with just $1.5 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,000 theaters, and translates to a very poor $736 per-theater average. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was another flop. It was Paul W.S. Anderson's new film, ***In the Lost Lands***, which debuted with a meager $1 million in 1,370 theaters. That's Anderson's worst debut ever, even below ***Monster Hunter*** ($2 million), which came out during terrible conditions in December 2020. Expect this to fade quickly.\n\nWhat's worse than 3 wide releases flopping? 4 wide releases flopping. Viva Pictures released ***Night of the Zoopocalypse*** into 1,400 theaters, but it earned just $804,370 this weekend. Pathetic.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mickey 17*** also made its appearance worldwide, but it was very unimpressive. The film debuted with $24.5 million overseas; adding its South Korean numbers from last week, the film has earned a weak $53.3 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in France ($2.9M), the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Its biggest market, unsurprisingly, is South Korea with $14.6 million so far. With these numbers, it's clear ***Mickey 17*** won't be a box office success.\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** has added $9.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $371 million. The best markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and South Korea ($11.2M). The film might actually cross $400 million, although it's still far from breaking even.\n\n***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** added $7.3 million, allowing it to cross $103.8 million in the overseas markets. Its best marekts are the UK ($51.1M), Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). \n\nBack in China, ***Ne Zha 2*** made history by crossing $2 billion in the country. In the process, it already passed ***Avengers: Infinity War*** to become the sixth highest grossing film worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Conclave* | Oct/25 | Focus Features | $6,601,995 | $32,580,655 | $104,360,856 | $20M\n\n- ***Conclave*** has ended its run with a fantastic $104 million worldwide. That's a great result for an adult drama, and a sign that there's an audience for films like this. Whether you like the film or not, it's great that a film like this could find an audience instead of being sent to straight-to-streaming.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe've got three wide releases this weekend, and there's a strong chance that there won't be a single film hitting $10 million this weekend.\n\nThe first is Paramount's action comedy ***Novocaine***, which stars Jack Quaid as a bank executive with the inability to feel pain who goes out to rescue his coworker after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film has already screened for critics, and reviews are quite solid (89% on RT). A possible sleeper hit?\n\nThe other release is Steven Soderbergh's newest film, Focus Features' ***Black Bag***. It stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan, and follows an intelligence agent who suspect his wife might be a traitor. Soderbergh is coming off ***Presence***, which made just $9.2 million, becoming one of his lowest grossing titles. Focus has emphasized action and intrigue, and the reviews are currently on fire (91% on RT), so this should have no problem in opening far higher.\n\nFinally, there's ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie***. In a twist of fate, WB is not handling this movie, deciding to sell it off instead. The distributor is Ketchup Entertainment, a recent company that hasn't had box office success in the past few years. And it's unlikely this movie changes that trajectory.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Deleted scenes are a common thing in movies, but not as common is when an entire character is cut out and every single scene they were meant to be in is removed or edited. The actor still got paid at least, but all of their efforts were for naught.\n\nFor example, all of Christopher Lee's scenes as Saruman were left out of the Return of the King theatrical cut, meaning his character never got any closure. Christopher Lee was understandably not happy about that. Fortunately his scenes were restored in the Extended Edition.\n\nPeeves the Poltergeist from the books was meant to be in the first Harry Potter movie played by Ril Mayall, but his scenes were cut, never even shown on the DVD release, and he never appeared in any of the sequels either. He did still pop up in the videogame adaptations though.\n\nSo what other notable cases are there of entirely cut characters?",

This movie has insane rewatch value and every scene still hits perfectly.\n  \n   \nStephen Chow really created something. The mix of martial arts, comedy, and action is just top notch. The fight scenes are ridiculously well done, the humor is on point, and the cinematography makes every moment feel iconic. The soundtrack also perfectly fits the vibe. And the cast delivers both comedy and surprisingly emotional moments effortlessly.\n  \n   \n\nAnyone else still rewatching this classic?",

Who are some on the other side of the spectrum where if you closed your eyes, you wouldn't even know it was them? And I don't mean like how Hugh Jackman can effortlessly change accents, but someone who can play different characters with the same accent but can still make them sound convincingly difference. Voice actors excluded since that's their whole job. ",

        "content": "Anyone remember this movie? I'm an '85 baby so it was right in my wheel house as a kid, but rewatching with my kids has been a lot of fun.  \n\nFirst of all, it's wild through our lense today that you can make the richest family on earth likable. Mr. Rich has 70 billion by the way.  A pittance in today's world of the richest.  Not only that, but his claim to fame is he's never fired anyone before and he won't start now. All the bad guys want to fire people, and Richie wins over the public by making cuts in pay to the board members. How quaint!\n\nSome other fun points. Mr. Rich is played by Edward Hermann who goes onto play another famous rich Dad as Mr. Gilmore years later.  All the fun elements of the movie land with my kids, especially having a McDonald's in your house and a roller coaster in your back yard. \n\nThe most interesting thing to me though was \"Dadlink\".  In 1994 Richie basically had a life360 for his Dad in his room, and the ability to FaceTime.  His Dad even has a cell phone sized device for video communication. It's done super casually to show us how rich they are, but the execution feels like it's predicting the future right on the nose. The only sign of the times is it takes 10 seconds to locate him. \n\nAnd finally Makaualey Culkin is at the peak of his powers. He's crushing it the whole movie. Overall I think the movie has aged surprisingly well!",

        "content": "&gt; After his family relocates from London to rural Devon, sullen British teen Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) spends most of his time moping about the house. When he inadvertently discovers an incestuous relationship between his older sister, Jessie (Lara Belmont), and their father (Ray Winstone), the revelation threatens to have dire consequences. The mother of the family (Tilda Swinton), unaware of the dark secret, has recently given birth, and the siblings must contend with the harrowing situation.\n\nI just want to know why, I watched it years ago and it still haunts me. Why was this ever created? \n\nYou can't tell anyone you've seen it. \n\nYou can't tell anyone to watch it. \n\nYou can't tell anyone anything about it. \n\nIt just cannot be publicly discussed because the subject is just so unbearable.\n\n&gt; At a public screening of this movie during the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival, one viewer was so upset and devastated that he rose to his feet and shouted that he couldn't take any more, then headed for the exit, intending to pull the fire alarm.\n\n&gt; According to director Tim Roth, the bunker scene was so difficult to film that the sound man almost ruined a take by crying into his microphone. \n\n&gt; The bunker scene was very difficult for Ray Winstone, also because Lara Belmont was the same age as Ray's real life oldest daughter. \"I was great until I got to the scene, I couldn't do it. I went, 'what the fuck am I doing here in this movie, what are we making this for?' And my bottle completely and utterly went, and I'm having a go at Tim, I said, 'there's something wrong with you, you know. You're fucking making films like this, what do you call this?' And I became my dad for a minute you know, 'you call this entertainment? This ain't fucking entertainment.' I went right kind of like a film critic for a minute.\n\nWe discuss many other movies that are scary or sad or cover difficult topics, but none of them have had those sorts of reactions... \n\nThis is why I think this is the actual most messed up movie. Not just because the subject is so hard but because the filming was so awful and the movie leaves you so depressed and alone because you wouldn't want to discuss and share the sadness with anyone else.

Or those friends that are just always there when you need them.\n\n  \nTime is the key factor here. Not looking for movies about friendship per se, but about how a friendship has evolved (either good or bad) or stood over time.\n\nMaybe an example would be Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as two friends who were always there to the very end, but maybe i'm looking more for movies where the friends drift in and out of each other's lives. But whatever you've got, give me your recs.\n\n  \nThanks!",
