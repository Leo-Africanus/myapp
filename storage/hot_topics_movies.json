Even though the movie uses identical portions of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, this integral version omits cliffhangers and introduces alternate angles and additional anime footage. As a result, it alters the tone and experience of the original theatrical cuts. After all, the director intended to release the film as one part--a complete, unrated, epic version of Kill Bill.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 100% (9 reviews)\n\nIMDb score: 8.7/10\n\nDirected by: Quentin Tarantino\n",
