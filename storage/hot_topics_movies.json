Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Benedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor, but I just don\u2019t think he should play Khan. The fact that they were playing coy in who Cumberbatch was playing in the marketing didn\u2019t help, it just makes me feel like they picked someone the complete opposite of Montalban just so they could do an underwhelming \u201ctwist\u201d reveal.

        "content": "Recently watched this documentary about the 2018 Texas Boys State, an annual event where hundreds of young men from around the state of Texas come together to build a representative government from the ground up. This documentary is incredible. It weaves narrative threads that follow multiple characters, who are REAL teenage boys with their own ideas of how to play the game of politics, and it's fascinating seeing how they engage with one another on a human level but also as \"politicians\". In one scene they're joking around trying to pass a bill that relocates Prius drivers to another state, the next they're debating gun control and abortion. Running throughout this entire movie is this undercurrent of dread. You get an authentic, cringe-worthy, and sometimes unsettling close-up of the American youth Post-MAGA. The choice to set this in a red state like Texas really helps the movie investigate Gen Z's slow but steady shift to the far right. Highly recommend this gem. Really engrossing movie, frustrating at times but very insightful.",

But everyone is saying that it could've done better if the marketing had been different. A lot of reviews from people said that it was marketed as one thing and turned out to be something different. \n\nThe movie was marketed as a rom com. But it turned out to be mostly romance drama. People who know Celine Song from Past Lives would know that she is a deeper writer than what it was being marketed as. Someone said that the marketing made people who would not like the movie interested in it and people who would like it disinterested.\n\nHave there been any other cases where a movie could not reach its potential at the box office, just because of misguided marketing which affected the reviews?",

        "content": "I must say Psycho was in my Top 1 spot. Followed by Rear Window, North By Northwest, Dial M For Murder, and The Birds.\n\nVertigo was nowhere to be seen in my Top 5. Then slowly but surely Rear Window took over the top spot knocking Psycho down one. And for years it\u2019s remained Rear.\n\nThen the 3rd Act of 12 Monkeys incorporated scenes and music from Vertigo, intermingling its narrative with Monkeys. That piqued my interest to give it another shot.\n\nI listened to the music of Vertigo before I ever watched it. One afternoon I decided to throw it on. And everything clicked. It wasn\u2019t slow anymore, it was dream-like. The plot itself snapped into place. And the themes of loss and obsession hit harder. \n\nI can throw on Vertigo in the background and go about my business. It\u2019s bursts of dialogue but mostly music. And I usually look up when the nightmare sequence begins. It may be my favorite 30 or so seconds of cinema ever.",

        "content": "Recently rewatched Bully (2001) and it still holds strong after 24 years. I've always enjoyed Larry Clark's honesty in his films. Scenes feel very uncomfortable and surreal. \n\nEdit: I had no idea he didn't write either of those movies, which would strictly make it his *direction* \n\nI'm not much younger than these kids (being a teen from around 03' and graduating 07') but they talk and act like the same exact people I went to high school with. Same with Larry Clark's \"Kids\" which is another great film.\n\nWe certainly didn't murder anyone like Marty and his friends did, but everything else I'm afraid was spot-on. The underage drinking, really really young kids smoking weed, sex, the slang, fashion, music, everything feels like a direct callback to myself and friends alike. Terrifying at hindsight if you ask me. \n\nIt *was* that bad, Larry Clark was just the only director with the balls to make these kinds of films. I heard someone say once that they thought the party scenes felt overdone and I just grinned to myself thinking \"Man you should have seen how bad we were in like 06'-07', we're lucky to even be alive.\" A lot of kids overdosed or ended up in prison like Marty.\n\nI get it. When you're young you're angry so your immediate thought in your undeveloped brain says you want to KILL this person. You think you mean it but you have no grasp on killing or what it's really like because you're just too young and stupid. I think Marty's friends fell into this trap and the girls just sort of tagged along for the ride thinking there would be no repercussions to being an accessory to murder \ud83d\ude02 \n\nA lot of directors try making realistic teenage films and they don't have the same firepower as Clark's films do. For years I've said LC is the only director who can get this genre right. \n\n",

        "title": "\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" is a very messy and uneven movie, but I have to give it credit for having one of the most spectacular and satisfying villain demises ever.",
        "content": "Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett is an undeniable highlight of both \"Pirate\" movies that he's in, both because of his relentlessly evil actions (the guy hangs a kid at the start of the third film and that just is one example of his vile behavior) and his non-stop air of smug self-satisfaction. So it is EXTREMELY satisfying at the climax to see him and his ship get blown to bits by the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, especially because of his reaction to his demise. Does he panic or rage at his defeat? No, he completely shuts down in shock and disbelief, unable to believe that his plans have gone astray and he's doomed. All he can do is whisper \"It's just good business\" while practically going catatonic as his men abandon ship and leave him to his fate. And then you get the spectacular sight of him numbly walking down the steps as the ship is blown apart around him until a final explosion engulfs him. The movie itself is an overlong and unwieldy mess, but that sequence is worth the wait as it's a completely satisfying end for an arrogant A-hole who simply cannot handle defeat.",
