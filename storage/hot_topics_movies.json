The movie is entirely driven by dialogue, not relying on even one single flash back, and even still, the dialogue is so rich and effective that you feel as though you know just as much as anyone in the jury. It\u2019s so refreshing to watch a movie that understands and respects its premise and delivers in a unique, unexpected way. Each character is complex and layered, some are despicable, some are reasonable, and their interactions among one another are unforgettable. An absolute must watch, it would take pages and pages to fully discuss how incredible this movie is but I urge anyone seeing this to not be afraid of its age; it\u2019s utterly timeless and could pass for a movie released in the 90s.",

I know it was a hit when it came out, but I rarely hear people talk about it now, especially compared to to other crime thrillers of the era, like The Usual Suspects, Heat or The Departed.\nThe cast is stellar, great dialogue, moral ambiguity, meta commentary on movie making and the film industry. My only gripe is that the twist is pretty predictable. Overall, I had a lot of fun, and I think it easily stands alongside with other Noir classics.",
