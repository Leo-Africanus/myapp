        "title": "April 4-6 Box Office Recap: 'A Minecraft Movie' massively over-performs, debuting with a colossal $162.7 million domestically. Worldwide, it earned $313.4 million, the second biggest debut for a video game movie.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/3kitircrohte1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e79a33892ca9682412307a2d502234da9c8839\n\nAfter some very weak months, the box office finally picked up steam with April.\n\nAnd that's practically all because of ***A Minecraft Movie***, which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as the biggest debut of the year.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $190.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 135.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed on top, while ***Monkey Man*** and ***The First Omen*** underwhelmed.\n\nDebuting atop, WB's ***A Minecraft Movie*** surpassed all expectations, earning a colossal $162.7 million in 4,263 theaters. That's even bigger than WB's ***Barbie*** ($162 million), and it's only behind ***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*** ($169 million) for the studio's biggest debut. The opening is also higher than the previous video game record, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($146 million), although ***Mario*** debuted on a Wednesday and burned off demand.\n\nSimply put, it's a fantastic film. Especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the film's trailers. And a much needed win for WB after a slate of disappointing performers like ***Joker***, ***War of the Rohirrim***, ***Companion*** and ***The Alto Knights***.\n\nBack in September 2024, when the teaser trailer debuted, the film earned poor reception, with many criticizing the VFX. To win over audiences for the other trailers, studio marketing suits added more VFX and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their Minecraft will stay true to the game. But that's perhaps the key; people will talk badly about a product, but that buzz translates into awareness, which builds into curiosity.\n\nOf course, not all negative buzz translates into curiosity (***Snow White*** waving in the distance). But the advantage for this film is simply ***Minecraft***. Despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago, the stats say otherwise; ***Minecraft*** is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as of 2024. Clearly, there's already an audience awaiting for a film, and they happily paid tickets for this. Even lukewarm reviews (48% on RT) didn't dissuade fans from checking it out.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 67% of the audience was male, and 78% was under 25 years old. They gave it a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is very mediocre for a family film. While word of mouth among children is very positive, adults are less thrilled with the film. We'll see in subsequent weeks how much it drops, but for now, a $450 million domestic total is in the cards for ***A Minecraft Movie***.\n\nLast week's champ ***A Working Man*** added $7.3 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is slightly worse than ***Beekeeper***'s 48% drop. Of course, that film had incredibly weak competition, but it's a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $27.8 million, and it should finish with around $40 million domestically.\n\nIn third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 2*** earned $6.9 million this weekend. That's down 42% from ***Part 1***'s performance last week. Let's see how ***Part 3*** fares this weekend.\n\nWith the arrival of a big blockbuster, ***Snow White*** had another terrible drop this weekend. It fell a rough 59%, earning just $5.9 million this weekend. The film's legs appear to be running out. Through 17 days, the film has earned a terrible $77.3 million and it's gonna finish with less than $90 million domestically. That's absolutely pathetic.\n\nBlumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** added $4.5 million this weekend. That's a 52% drop, which isn't that bad considering the film's poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned $16.6 million, and it should pass $20 million by next week.\n\n***Death of a Unicorn*** earned $2.6 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is quite rough for a comedy. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $10.7 million and it will struggle to get to $15 million by the end of its run.\n\nWith the arrival of ***Part 2***, ***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 1*** collapsed a horrible 84% this weekend, earning just $1.8 million. That took its domestic lifetime to $17.9 million after 10 days.\n\nThere was another wide release this weekend, Neon's ***Hell of a Summer***. Debuting in 1,255 theaters, it earned an okay $1.7 million. With weak word of mouth and horror/thriller competition on the way, it's gonna disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nIn ninth place, Bleecker Street's ***The Friend*** expanded to 1,237 theaters and earned $1.6 million this weekend.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***Captain America: Brave New World***, which fell 54% and added $1.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $199 million and it will crack the $200 million milestone sometime this week.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** also took over the rest of the world. The film earned a huge $150.7 million overseas, for a $313.4 million worldwide debut. That's the second biggest debut for a video game movie, behind ***Mario***. The best debuts were in the UK ($19.9M), China ($14.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), Germany ($10.6M) and Australia ($8.3M). It still has other markets left, including Japan. We'll see if the film can be strong enough to hit the $1 billion mark.\n\n***Snow White*** is running out of steam and it's already its third week. It added just $9 million overseas, which takes its worldwide total to a terrible $168.6 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe're getting FOUR wide releases, and none stand a chance in dethroning ***Minecraft***.\n\nThe first is 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***, which stars Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wife's killers. With ***A Working Man*** slowing down, this could be a main attraction for old-school action fans.\n\nAnother release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop***, which stars Meghann Fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date, or her family will be murdered. The film already premiered at SXSW and it has received strong reviews (89% on RT). Can it be the hit that Blumhouse wants and needs?\n\nAnother is A24's ***Warfare***, which follows in real-time a platoon of Navy SEALs on a mission through insurgent territory in 2006. It's directed by both Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (although the latter states his role is more secondary), and it has earned great reviews so far (93% on RT). It's unreasonable to expect numbers similar to ***Civil War***, but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for A24.\n\nAnd finally, there's Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***, an animated film about the life of Jesus Christ. Angel Studios has delivered a big marketing for the film, and pre-sales are reportedly strong here. Maybe it could surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

I totally bought him as a regular working class dude in Out Of The Furnace. He gained weight and nailed his role in American Hustle and as Dick Cheney in Vice. The guy is just brilliant and he nails every role he does! He will go down as one of the greats, I can\u2019t wait to see him as Frankenstein in The Bride, because I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll nail that performance too!",

        "content": "\n\nSo I just watched stand by me and it was an amazing ride. I think my favorite character throughout the entire film had to be Chris. I feel like each character brought their own little charm to the group but Chris really stuck out but in the best way. Seeing him support Gordie and the speech he gave him about his writing and how he believes in him was amazing but it was also sad hearing him talk so badly about his self later on and even a teacher using him as leverage all cause she knew they wouldn\u2019t believe him.\n\n Thing is I want to say each grew but I\u2019m not sure Vern and teddy did but that\u2019s not knocking them since I enjoyed them but by the end they seemed to have grown slightly but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s do in fact to seeing a dead body. Gordie having to come to terms with his brothers death and even speaking to the dead boy like he was his brother was really heartbreaking. Everybody was always comparing him to his brother and the only people who ever seemed like knew the real him was his friends or the only ones who wanted to see the real him.\n\nI could go on but I feel like I\u2019d have too much to say but each character seems to have their own trauma or struggles they have to get through and by the end it feels like they go from boys to men. It feels like based on the stares and somber attitude they realize this isn\u2019t a joke, someone lost their life and it\u2019s fleeting and should be taken seriously, a childish adventure turned into a road into adult hood. Sorry if I sound like an idiot and reading into what happened wrong but it\u2019s either trauma or growing up and I hope it\u2019s the latter. Even the ending caught me off guard but it feels real to me, how life is fleeting and it can be taken away at any given moment no matter how good your intentions or you as a person may be. \n \n Also side note and I know their kids so it\u2019s odd to ask but did anybody else get the vibe that Chris or Gordie may have had feelings for each other, some scenes with them just felt oddly close like more than best friends?

        "title": "How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice",
        "content": "In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone\u2019s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she\u2019d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. \n\n\nOne day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben\u2019s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. \u201cOh, hey, that\u2019s Ben,\u201d she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said \u201chi\u201d, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.\n\nWhat I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn\u2019t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain\u2019t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the \u201cOn your left\u201d portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader\u2019s origins nearly two decades earlier.\n\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized that \u201cBen\u201d wasn\u2019t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2\u2019s beeps, Indy\u2019s whip, Darth Vader\u2019s breathing, and even secretly inserted the \u201c[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)\u201d into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn\u2019t watched any of those films, he was just \u201cBen\u201d, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. \n\n\nI gasped, \u201cHoly cow, that\u2019s *Episode III*,\u201d and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. \n\n\nAt the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:\n\n\nAt that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar\u2019s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the \u201c[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)\u201d screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.\n\nAt the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that \u201cFriends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks\u201d. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben\u2019s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the \u201cFriends and Family\u201d screening.\n\n\nThe day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben\u2019s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. \n\n\nAfter the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug\u2019s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph\u2019s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. \n\n\nWhen I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the \"Cast and Crew\" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney\u2019s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that \u201cwe\u2019ll be in touch\u201d were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben\u2019s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.\n\n\nOver the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson\u2019s workplace, and that he\u2019d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben\u2019s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I \u201cdid not see what I thought I saw\u201d months before.\n\n\nI kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn\u2019t what I thought it was.\n\n \nYears later, I\u2019m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as \u201cEv-a\u201d with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt\u2019s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. \n\n\nSadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother\u2019s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.\n\nTLDR; OPs grandmother walks her neighborhood every day and is friends with her neighbor \"Ben\". During a shared walk, OP meets Ben and realizes he is Ben Burtt, sound designer for all Star Wars films. OP invites Ben to a Pixar screening of The Incredibles and they meet the people who are making WALL-E. Ben is hired by Pixar for WALL-E years later.",

Both represent the industry way too well, especially the downward spiral. The ending was super well, to me it was super relatable. The desire to be great-to be just be so great that people will remember you even after 100 years. \n\n  \nThe ending to me was such- Neille and Manny wanted to be part of something great, something bigger than human life. This was their connection. For Manny, the dream ended because he chose to get away from the screen, or to put it better, found satisfaction off-screen. Manny, on the other hand, found herself in the spotlight. Her character was obsessed with attention. She, too, wanted greatness. When watching the film, Manny realized that while Neille might have died at 32, but was still alive in people's memories, so was Jack (Brad Pitt) He remember his words-maybe felt regret but this filmns throws light on many things- To move on, Cycle of life, and also the price of greatness.",

        "title": "The Gamble New Line Cinema made making the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy was INSANE",
        "content": "Imagine being New Line founder &amp; head honcho Bob Shaye. It\u2019s circa 1998 &amp; you\u2019ve just been shown a presentation by a kiwi filmmaker most people have never heard of it. You\u2019re shown costumes, weapons, cgi tests, miniatures, all funded by a rival studio that decided it can\u2019t make this project because it\u2019s just too expensive. So said Rival studio boss has given kiwi filmmaker a chance to pitch the project elsewhere. Every studio in town has turned the pitch down since there are some very large strings attached. Rival studio boss must be reimbursed for the millions in spent development costs, he must be given a % of the box office and you only have a 24 hours to decide. You were kiwi film makers last stop before heading back to New Zealand in defeat.\n\nThe kiwi filmmaker is pitching you a two film adaptation of perhaps the most well known book trilogies in existence. Your film company needs a hit, badly. After the presentation everyone looks to you for a reaction. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d you say. You see the faces of kiwi filmmaker and his team go white with dread before adding \u201cit\u2019s 3 books? It should be 3 movies\u201d. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the start of one or the biggest most insane gambles in Hollywood history. The price tag? 270 million. That number will go up before all is said and done. \n\n\nJust think about it for a minute. New Line funded the production of 3 films shot back to back in a tiny country halfway around the world, by a director whose never had a hit movie, using unproven technology, with no A List star and if none of it works, the movie doesn\u2019t succeed? You might lose your company. \n\nThe production goes way over budget, loses a main actor after a few days of filming, New Line is constantly trying to mitigate its risk by cutting the runtime down, selling foreign distribution rights(boy will they come to regret that) \n\nThe press is all over New Line. \u201cThis is insane\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fail\u201d. \u201cWhat are they going to do when it does fail\u201d etc. But then\u2026\n\n\n\nMay 2001 hits. Newline decides to preview 20 minutes of the first movie at the Cannes film festival. This is where everything changed. The public and press got its first real look at the film and the response is better than anyone could hope. New Line loosens up. Gives more money to finish the movie. There some actual buzz &amp; hype now. \n\nBut then 2 things happen. \n\n\nOne is another highly anticipated book adaptation is coming out a month prior. Basically the hottest property on the planet not named Star Wars or Pokemon. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d. And when it does come out? It has the biggest opening weekend of all time. \n\nThe other thing? Tragedy. 9/11. Do audiences even want to see a movie about wars and elves and hobbits? Will anyone care? \n\nBoy did they ever. December 2001 the gamble pays off. Whats more? They get 13! Academy Award nominations. It\u2019s now officially a phenomenon.\n \nAnd you\u2019ve got 2 more movies to release. Each more successful than the last, an unheard or rarity for sequels of that era.",
