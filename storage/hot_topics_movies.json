Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.\n\n\"What's it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?\"\n\nThere\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties, that was rare.. anyways I just find it refreshing and think the movie has aged remarkably well!",

Aside from being very good movies, and Tarantino films, they both do something really unexpected. I'll avoid spoiling them, but they both very deliberately change the outcome of a historical event for the sake of the plot. Are there any other movies that do something like that? I know there's *C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America* (2004), which is an alternate history movie. What I'm talking about is a movie where something happens like Lincoln goes to Ford's Theatre and gets home safely with Mary, or the Titanic arrives in New York City unscathed. Anyone?",

Just thought I\u2019d see if anyone wants to watch the same stuff and yap abt it :) I go through like 4 movies a day rn and I\u2019m open to recs. I like most genres but especially sci fi, psychological horror like 10 cloverfield lane, and slower more raw emotional stuff like minari.",
