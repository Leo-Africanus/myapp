        "content": "I was thinking about this in the wake of the teaser for the final season of \"Stranger Things\" coming out and thus hearing all the tired old jokes/complaints about \"the kid actors are too old for their roles!\" (FYI, for the final season, the kid actors are 19-22 playing 16 year old, which is pretty normal for film/TV.) Those people don't get how this is a time-honored tradition in high school movies, going back to the 50s (\"Grease\" openly mocked it). The 80s films that \"Stranger Things\" draws inspiration from had some especially egregious examples. James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink\" looks like a Wall Street yuppie trolling a high school for jailbait. Alan Ruck was pushing 30 in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off (a decade older than Mia Sara who was an actual teenager when they made it). And to use a \"Stranger Things\" cast member as an example, Matthew Modine was a married dad when he played a high school senior in \"Vision Quest.\" The list goes on.",

(The first time, my aunt and uncle took me to see it in the theater when it came out in 2006, but they hated it so much that we ended up walking out halfway through, though I didn't want to!) In any case, I've loved this movie since I first saw it. I have to say that it's probably the funniest movie from the past 20 years, plus it exposes a lot of what's wrong with this country, like our various forms of prejudice and Christian nationalism. I wish we'd learned our lessons since it came out, but unfortunately, I'd say these things have only gotten worse since!",
