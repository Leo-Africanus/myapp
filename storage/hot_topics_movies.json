Primal Fear\n\nInteresting that The Usual Suspects and Primal Fear both had the deceiver acting with a disability to throw everyone off, including the audience.    They also had a little more of a diabolical nature to them compared to Sixth Sense.\n\nWhat are yours?\n\n  \nEdit:  apologies for weird formatting of this post; tried to correct.  Didn't work.

He was simply trying to repel him and get him to leave him alone.",

Every character felt so real and grounded that I was captivated the whole time in pure awe of everything going down.\n\nAnd lastly, the ending man\u2026 I won\u2019t spoil anything but what a note to leave off on\u2026\n\nAmazing movie, no doubt one of my favorite foreign films ever",

I love how raw and unfiltered they are, I love how gritty and dirty they are, I just love that grainy low budget look they have. They really have a certain charm that you can\u2019t find anywhere else. Movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House On The Left etc. I just love how the 70s weren\u2019t afraid to go as dark and gritty as you could get, even more mainstream 70s films had that vibe, like Taxi Driver, Deliverance, A Clockwork Orange etc. the 70s are hands down my favorite decade for films, I love all of that stuff and you don\u2019t see movies that push the envelope as much anymore.",

There would be a large Starbucks type seating area where I could grab breakfast while I look at my laptop. An hour or so later, I go see an early screening. Once that\u2019s done, I go for a walk or hit the gym. I then go back to the theater but need to get some work done before seeing my next movie. I reserve a sound proof work booth where I can zoom into a meeting. \n\nOnce done I\u2019m ready to see another movie, but this time order lunch which is delivered to my seat in the movie theatre. \n\nWhen that done, it\u2019s time to meet a friend who\u2019s also a big fan of a show on Netflix. We get some beers and head over to semi private booths that have 32 inch screens and watch an episode or two together. My friend has to take off for a party but asks if I want to join. \n\nIt\u2019s been a long day but I say sure. Turns out the party is right here in my dream theater complex. We walk over to one of the private screening rooms.  Big enough for no more than 20 guests at a time but also good for socializing. It\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday and everyone chipped in to pay to for a screening room viewing watch a the guest of honors two favorite movies, \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d. \n\nWe laugh. We cry. We vomit. I meet a girl who\u2019s really impressed with my extensive knowledge of found footage horror and she gives me her number. But soon we have to leave because the room is reserved for Karaoke at 10 pm. \n\nI go home, go to bed. And do it all over again the next day. \n\n",
