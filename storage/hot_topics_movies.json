And that is a solid commitment for a casual watcher to make.\n\n\nWhat I liked: \n\nAfter minute 55, the movie is friggin rivetting. I didnt want to stop it to get up to pee. \n\nThe acting is excellent. And I mean excellent. There was one point where I teared up a little. And another where I chuckled along with the characters just because it was just a good moment. The character building and relationship building is top notch.\n\nEven the small characters do well. If you dont watch westerns you forget that &gt;!anyone can die. and goodamn it characters drop like flies in this film.!&lt;  And that really sells a story to me.\n\nRussel Crowe. You forget how good of an actor he is.\n\nMusings: \n\n\nI fell asleep watching this movie back when it came out and I just kinda forgot about it. I've heard many people say its a good movie so its been on my list for a long time. Just took me around 18 years to get around to watching it. Oddly enough, I fell asleep watching it this time too. So I watched the rest of the movie today. And I'm happy to have watched it. I'm already excited to watch it again. \n\nThe good part is things makes sense at the end. There were a few things that bothered me after I watched it so I read up the reddit posts about the movie and that cleared it up for me. I watched the scenes redditors talked about and I found that, yeah, it all adds up. In a convincing way. \n\nIf you liked this movie, I will recommend you watch Appaloosa, if you havent already.",

It has certain \"cartoonishly macabre\" tone to it and \"the snobbish high society is dumb\" social commentary, both of which are pretty typical in Burton's movies. It helps that the movie to this day stands-out from the rest of Zemeckis' filmography, which is more known for fun adventures and grounded dramas, so it never comes to my mind first, when thinking about his movies.",

        "content": "We often talk about localization of movies in foreign markets when it comes to weird title changes, but that's only the most visible form of localization when translating movies to other languages. The whole point of localization isn't to just translate everything, it's to make the product understandable, non-controversial, and entertaining to foreign cultures, which doesn't always work with a purely faithful translation, so changes are often made to the dialogue and plot.\n\nFor example, in Inside Out Riley doesn't like broccoli, a common trope with Western children, but in Japan this was changed to bell peppers, which is a more common disliked food trope in Japan. They even changed the animation for those particular scenes.\n\nA common one we often hear about is when a movie has gay characters. Foreign markets will often change the dialogue where it is stated that a character is gay, and if there's a scene of them kissing someone of the same gender they'll just cut it out. \n\nBut one of the most infamous localization changes was what happened to the Castilian dub of the movie Mogambo. In the film, Grace Kelly and Clark Gable are in an adulterous relationship, which was a big no-no to the Catholic censors of the time. To rectify this sinful plot, the married couple were instead changed to being siblings, thus Grace Kelly was free to be in a relationship with Clark Gable. The problem was that they didn't cut the scenes where Grace Kelly kisses her \"brother\" and is quite close to him, so they accidentally replaced adultery with heavily implied incest.\n\nSo what are some other interesting localization changes?",

Post edited cause the list below was originally covered as spoilers but it's annoying to click them all individually in a list this long, so if you don't want to know what movies have twist endings you should probably stop reading:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n* Shutter Island\n* The sixth sense\n* the others\n* fight club\n* oldboy\n* No way out\n* the prestige\n* the game\n* the mist\n* The usual suspects\n* The book of Eli\n* Primal Fear\n* Hide and Seek\n* Mulholland drive\n* Jacob's ladder\n* Cabin in the woods\n* frailty\n* Psycho\n* the crying game\n* predestination\n* saw\n* arrival\n* memento\n* Orphan\n* Identity\n\nProbably others but these are all I can think of at the moment.",

        "content": "This was one of my favorite movies as a kid... full disclosure, I still enjoy it as a grown ass man lol. Looking for other movies that might scratch that same itch. Here are some of the elements I love about it, to help with matching:\n\n-The atmosphere of like 1930s mob gangsters, jazz music, big city, almost noir-like feel to it.\n\n-Pulling off a great balance of being both fun and sincere (Stanley Ipkiss is the best of both worlds Jim Carrey).\n\n-Good believable performances by side characters like Cameron Diaz, whoever plays Dorian Tyrell, and even the annoying detective character.\n\nAnyway, I could keep rambling on, but hopefully you get the idea. I'm sure theres nothing quite the same, but if anything comes to mind that matches this style that I could enjoy as an adult, I'd love to hear it. \n\n",

        "content": "When it came out, I was super stoked to see Napoleon based on the very promising trailer. Scott, Phoenix, what could go wrong? Well, turns out a lot. It felt empty, incoherent, jumping from event to event without being embedded in a proper story arc that connected everything. It was a huge disappointment for me. Now I just noticed that a Director's Cut exists, which leaves me twisted: I'm kinda interested to see whether that cut makes up for the weaknesses of the original... But then again I wouldn't wanna waste yet another 3,5 hours. Has anyone been able to compare the two versions yet? ",

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent even counts cause of Nic Cage's relationship with himself and his films.  \n  \nFilms that I haven't seen that may fit are Adaptation, Bowfinger, Being John Malcovich...?   \nThey do not have to be very funny or very dark, but surreal is encouraged.   \nForeign film recommendations are encouraged too, of course.

        "content": "For context I grew up on Hong Kong and other Asians film that outside of your big hits like Protect A etc. are b grade flair even the cast and crew fully admit that many of those films were shlock but as many of them said those films were made with a shoestring budget, tight time tables and a lot of times incomplete scripts they had to wing it. None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn't phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.\n\n",

        "content": "Weird way to make a movie. My wife and I enjoyed the ride, it's at least fun and riveting to watch and figure out what it's leading up to\n\nThe movie has some issues in my opinion, and obviously the whole Shutter Island plot is obvious from the get-go basically as soon as you know he's both a recovering alcoholic after having driven drunk.\n\nMy maim things are\n- What's actually real? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Were the police real people involved in the investigation, or did they just happen to be there when he was leaving? They were too agreeable to not be Shutter Island-esque plants. But prior to that it doesn't seem like the hospital is at all trying to push any investigation. \n\nIt seems like the therapist lady was guiding the investigation, but it was unclear at what point that was the *purpose* of him being there, since finding the bodies didnt seem like an important or relevant point until she showed up. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he lock them in the gas station? How the frick does he steal the cop car? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he actually kill the security, break in and manage to kidnap a guy? And no one stops him?! What??? Did he actually shoot the oxygen tap and blow up the OR and shoot Bruce? Or is that in his imagination?\n\n\n- Why are there so many small seeds they plant that are more of poor misdirects rather than intentional red herrings?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; besides some message of masking trauma and parallels to him losing a wife and child, as well as tying in his alcoholism, how does the previous wife plot have any relevance? Not saying I don't get it, but they could've basicslly.cut that whole thing and it wouldn't make a difference to the main plot.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The LL floor thing is wacky to me. What are the chances that it actually IS the organ donation floor?? I mean, he saw them go down there assuming it was cor a CAT scan and is none the wiser, he finds out at some point that they genuinely harvest organs, AND it's ACTUALLY on the floor he saw them going to? Puh-leeease!!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; How was Peri's scarf in there? He brought it in when he got treated? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If he was coming in being treated for a car crash, why would no one have checked his car out? Looked out the window even? \n\nTons of other things to point at, but these are some of the glaring flaws. \n\nI feel like because of some things they did in thus movie, they missed some good opportunities. In some areas, it's utterly predictable. In others, they do a weird twist that contradicts something established earlier in the plot.\n\nIt would've been better if they didn't show MC having fallen into the pit. The viewer knowing that he has untreated head trauma makes it obvious that everything is in his head. It's been said before, but it would've actually been better if they made him seem delusional to trick him into not realizing it was a REAL evil organ-harvesting hospital.\n\nNonetheless, San Worthington is STELLAR in this movie, and it definitely had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what exactly is going on and what'll happen next.\n\n\n\nHoly frick that was long.",
