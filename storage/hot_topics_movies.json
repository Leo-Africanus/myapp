I\u2019ve already watched and loved Interstellar, Severance, Moon, and I\u2019m really excited about The Three-Body Problem.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated by stories that dive into deep concepts like time, space, consciousness, and the mysteries of existence while wrapping them in captivating narratives and stunning visuals. The kind of content that keeps you thinking, \"What if\u2026?\"\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing out on some hidden gems or even well-known classics that I haven\u2019t come across yet. So, I\u2019m turning to the community for help.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for sci-fi movies or shows that are:\n\nMind-bending and thought-provoking?\nVisually stunning or have a unique storytelling style?\nFocused on deeper themes rather than just action?\nThey don\u2019t have to be super recent; I\u2019m happy to explore older classics or lesser-known titles too.\n\nWhether it\u2019s something like Arrival, Dark, Primer, or even lesser-known works that deserve more recognition, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Also, if there are international titles or indie projects in the same genre, feel free to share those as well!\n\nLooking forward to building a new watchlist based on your suggestions. Thanks in advance for helping me dive deeper into the sci-fi world!\n\nCheers",

The dramatic pause as old girl is walking out of the banquet room right before yer boy hits her with the truth, the subtle score crescendo, right up to \"you're so fucked\", it's the best. Then, the best film outro I've ever seen, dude just processing his shit in the cab, then that creeping satisfaction before the cut, knowing he won &amp; did a righteous act, shit is dope.

Would he have sold his company, holdings etc? Don\u2019t care that much just one of those post movie thoughts that\u2019s always stayed with me.. \n",

        "title": "Wild Strawberries: The Title's True Meaning",
        "content": "I recently rewatched *Wild Strawberries* (Smultronst\u00e4llet), Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1957 classic. Since my Netflix is set to English, it displayed the English title, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice how the translation loses the symbolism of the original Swedish one.\n\nThe Swedish title, Smultronst\u00e4llet, literally means \"a wild strawberry patch,\" but it\u2019s more commonly used idiomatically to refer to a special, idyllic place. It could be a place that holds nostalgia or simply somewhere where you feel safe and happy.\n\nThis symbolism is woven beautifully into the movie. Isak Borg, the protagonist, revisits key moments of his past, including a visit to his childhood home. One particular memory involves the girl he loved picking wild strawberries. However, instead of this being a moment of joy, it\u2019s ironic, as she\u2019s seen picking strawberries while cheating on him, turning his *smultronst\u00e4lle* (both childhood home and a wild strawberry patch) into a symbol of loss and missed opportunities.\n\nI think the original title adds depth to the film, especially as it underscores the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and memory. It\u2019s a clever piece of symbolism that doesn\u2019t quite come through in the English title.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this small piece of trivia about an excellent movie!",

        "content": "I\u2019m about 2 months from a long term relationship ending and was looking for a movie to help me just work through some feelings. This thing fucking delivered and hit me like a ton of bricks. Just an absolutely hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. Well acted, well written, well crafted movie. The last scene, fuck man. Genuinely the best drama about relationships I\u2019ve seen in a while. Watching two extremely flawed characters, people from broken homes, fall in and out of love with each other was just heartbreaking yet completely understandable. It was inevitable, it was never going to work but it still was painful to watch. Familiar to so many people whether through first hand or second hand experience. Childhood trauma, different communication styles, different styles for dealing with emotions, different outlooks on life, ambitions and love that just could never last. If you\u2019ve never seen it I would highly recommend it, and if you\u2019ve seen it and have similar movies I\u2019d love to hear about those as well \n",

I used to watch it dubbed and for a while I wanted to be able to watch it again, but I can't find anywhere online where I can watch or buy the movie, either dubbed or even in the original German with subs.

        "content": "Yes, these are broad metrics so this'll get gray quickly. To me, though, it's just strange to find movies where the filmmakers spent so much time detailing all the aspects of a new reality only to never realize how dull the end product would be. With all the pre-viz cinematics, table reads, and rough edits only to lose sight of the sum of all the parts. Obviously no one knows everything and it's great to take these risks, it's still fascinating.\n\nFor example, [City of Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHf7UhHpmE).\n\n[Mortal Engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsFc2gguEg).\n\n[Tomorrowland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ7O-RrATY).\n\n[Renaissance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ftZhphGgwo) (bit of a cheat since it's animated but the new whiz bang tech for it demanded a solid story idea)",

        "content": "The way different disorders are shown as well as the camera work just feels so real. You feel like a person actually watching everything while your there. As a mentally ill teen this is literally the best way mentally ill teens have been shown in media that I have ever seen. The actors do an amazing job of actually showing pure emotion not just some made up barely trying acting, It's actual pure emotion.\n\nMy favourite characters where Lyle(played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Dr David monroe(played by Don Cheadle) and Chad (played by Michael Bacall). You can tell they actually cared about this project and that they understand the emotions there characters are feeling. None of the characters are good or bad they all have flaws they all have done bad things and you can't help but feel like in some way you relate to them. It discuses topics like SA and how that can affect children to believe those actions are normal, Abusive households, Bipolar disorder, SH and so much more. It deals with these topics without even trying to shy away or just allude to it. It tells you and shows how broken the characters are because of it. I genuinely beg all of you to watch it, it is genuinely one of if not the best movie/film I have ever seen.\n\nIt's is free to watch on YouTube (not the best quality but it adds to it) So please watch manic 2001 it is a masterpiece.",
