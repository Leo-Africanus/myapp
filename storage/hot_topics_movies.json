Sunshine (2007). first two acts are tense, beautiful, brilliant sci-fi about saving the sun. and then the third act shows up and\u2026 suddenly it\u2019s a slasher flick with a burnt zombie mutant. it just jumps from genius to B-movie nonsense in a blink and almost ruins everything i just watched. seriously, my brain was like \u2018wait, what\u2026\u2019",

But the reveal never felt earned to me. Gorgeous craft, great performances, sure. But that last turn? Felt less like payoff and more like misery-for-shock.",

        "content": "I finally watched 'A Real Pain' as one of those films I feel I should watch but could never get round to starting. I just finished it and now I'm desperate to talk about Kieran Culkin's performance so here I am. \n\nCulkin's portrays a character who rampages through extreme emotions from scene to scene, one moment he's calm and in control, the next he's angry and confused, the next he's hurt and vulnerable, the next he's pleading with the world to make sense. He wraps all this together into a believable character that is magnetic to watch. I've watched performances  before that I thought commanded the screen but I'm not sure I've ever seen a performance that showed such range and craft. I didn't know he won the Oscar before watching the film, afterwards I checked to make sure he had as anything else would have been a travesty.\n\nThe film ends with a close up of Culkin's face that brings everything together that  we've been watching for the last 90 mins and instantly explains who he really is. It is simply magnificent and I can't recommend A Real Pain enough.\n\n",

        "content": "On its original broadcast, on Sunday, November 20, 1983, more than 100 million people, watched the film when it first aired on the ABC television network.\n\n**The Day After** received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide. ABC and local TV affiliates opened 1-800 hotlines with counselors standing by.\n\nABC then aired a live debate on Viewpoint, ABC's occasional discussion program hosted by Nightline's Ted Koppel, featuring the scientist Carl Sagan, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elie Wiesel, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Brent Scowcroft, and the commentator William F. Buckley Jr. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, but Buckley promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe film was broadcast on Soviet state television in 1987, during the negotiations on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n\nCensors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. \n\nIn July 2018, a rough cut of the film appeared online, although rumors had long circulated that a second, even more dramatic version of the film existed, but it had never been released. The rough cut contains several new scenes as well as longer takes of scenes already included in the film. The rough cut contains almost fifteen minutes more footage.\n\nThe film received 12 Emmy nominations and won two Emmy awards. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the film received the Goldene Leinwand Award for reaching three million viewers in the cinema.\n\n\n\nThe same theme was also the subject of the British film Threads in 1984 and When the Wind Blows in 1986.",
