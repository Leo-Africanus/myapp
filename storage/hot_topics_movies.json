With ever increasing shock value or whatever. In an attempt to be shocking and wacky is horrible.\n\nLike when there's two characters insulting another character and they alternate and scale up the the same insult, like: \n\n\"You look like a turd\" \n\n\"You look like turd that all the other turds don't like because you live in your turd-mom's turd-basement.\"\n\n\"You look like a turd that banged another turd and then had a turd baby out of its butt.\"\n\nEtc... they usually do five or six. I kept it to three.  They keep scaling up the same joke but are still saying the same joke over and over.  Yes, he's looks like turd haha. Let's move on.  \n\nThese are things that they used to do in movies and then pick the best one and use that in the movie and now they just leave them all in there and it's pathetic. \n\nWatching hot tub time machine 2 and they they keep doing this and then they're actually making references to the fact that they keep doing this which doesn't actually make it any funnier.  Hanging a lamp on laziness and stupidity is not comedy. \n\nJudd Apatow turned this into the regular and it's horrible. He's done some good stuff and it was fine that he was doing this in his movies. We don't need it in every other comedy movie made since. It's what comprised about 65% of the 2016 Ghostbusters movie's dialogue.  \n\nI want well-written comedy, not a brainstorming session on film.",

        "title": "Perfect Days hit me harder than I expected...pure life lessons hidden in silence.",
        "content": "So today I watched *Perfect Days* (Japanese movie) and honestly...I didn't expect it to leave such a strong impact.\n\nAt first, it feels so simple... just a guy living his everyday life, cleaning toilets, listening to old cassettes, taking pictures of trees. But the more you watch, the more you realize how much peace and depth there is behind his routine.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how he smiles at the sky every morning. Like he\u2019s genuinely grateful for another day. No rush, no complaints, just...existing with full heart.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk much unless necessary, but when he does interact (like with his niece or that random guy he plays shadow games with), you can feel how much he enjoys human connection too. He\u2019s not *avoiding* people...he just doesn't *need* noise to be happy.\n\nThere\u2019s this beautiful bittersweetness. He\u2019s not \"choosing loneliness\" in a sad way...it's more like, life took him down this path, and instead of fighting it, he embraced it with full acceptance. That\u2019s powerful in today\u2019s world where everyone feels pressure to chase something constantly.\n\nThe scene where his niece leaves... and he quietly cries...man, that hit different.  \nNot because he's weak or regretting, but because even the strongest hearts carry a little sadness somewhere deep.\n\nAnd that final drive...the way he smiles and then tears up while listening to music, that was pure *life itself*. Happiness, sadness, memories, gratitude...all flowing through him at once.\n\nHonestly gave me the same vibe I felt after watching Shawshank Redemption...the idea that freedom and peace are an inside job. No matter what life gives or takes away.\n\nOne of the most beautiful movies I\u2019ve ever watched without trying to be \"loud\" about it. I liked the whole silent treatment vibe\n\nAlso, I\u2019m surprised how not many people talk about this movie.\n\nWould love to hear what you guys felt after watching it.",

But what's a movie that you thought was gonna get talked about for a long time, but now nobody seems to talk about it at all. \n\nFor me it's gotta be Sin City, when I first saw that at the theater  I thought it was not even just a movie, that it was an experience. I thought it was just gonna be a movie that people talked about for ages. But I can't remember the last time I  heard Anyone talk about Sin City.

        "content": "Done originally and brilliantly in Great Escape, showing how Steve McQueen would take his ball and glove into the \u201chole\u201d giving him something to keep from going mad. \n\nI\u2019ve seen it redone so many times, my favorite was Saul Goodman, stuck in his cell phone store, sitting and bouncing a ball against the window. Great way to show the tedious boredom he was going through. I have seen it many many times I just can\u2019t remember all the movies.\n\nWhat show shows the movies have you seen them do this in? ",

        "content": "I love this film, I\u2019m a huge fan of both Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, and they are both fantastic in it. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, same guy who wrote Se7en, and you can definitely tell it\u2019s the same guy. This film, is so dark and disturbing, but at the same time, so rewatchable. I love slowly watching Nicolas Cage solve the mystery of the snuff film. All the performances are great as well, James Gandolfini is so good in this film, he was such a great actor and made even small roles memorable. I love dark thrillers and this is one of my favorites!",

The movie isn\u2019t just about rebellion or violence, it dives deep into identity, consumerism, and the search for meaning in a world that feels empty. Every time I watch it, I find something new to appreciate.",

Feel free to add on to the list! \n\nAlways enamoured by the work that goes into these openings - although Marvel has some good lead ups, personally think only the title portion was cool to see, no super huge impact.

It\u2019s a beautiful piece of music and I\u2019d love to find out. Current guesses are soprano saxophone or piccolo trumpet. Please enlighten me!!!",
