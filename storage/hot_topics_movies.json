How many rewrites and add-ons go these scripts through and how many people throw in a few more puns during writing and filming.",

        "content": "And this is coming from someone who isn't even a Transformers fan. IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).\n\nTrailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.\n\nAfter having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.\n\nSadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. \n\nOne way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.\n\nBy no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. \n\nBut overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, this might sound harsh but whoever done the marketing and trailer deserves to be fired. Whoever you were, you ended up dooming this amazing movie to fail.\n\nP.S.: I didn't think Brian Tyrian Lee of all people could have pulled off a great Megatron.",

        "content": "So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.\n\nThere's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.\n\nThere's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.\n\nIf you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. I'm trying to avoid giving anything away because I do feel as though it's best experienced mostly cold, but I also expect it'll only be in theaters for another few days. ",

My top trilogies would be: \n\nToy Story 1-3 (I know there are 4 but I'm talking Andy's story as I've never seen 4 because 3 ended perfectly). I grew up with Andy and was going to college when he was, so Toy Story 3 hit especially hard. Pixar is just a freaking behemoth when it comes to animated films. They honestly might be the most consistent studio in terms of quality for their films. \n\nHow to Train Your Dragon are the best movies DreamWorks has put out, and that includes Shrek. HTTYD might have some of the best music I've heard in animated film since Land Before Time (James Horner made some INCREDIBLE music for that film). \n\nBack to the Future is perfect and I love it. I'm also very happy that the original director holds the rights and refuses to let Hollywood remake them. Good on you, sir. \n\nLord of the Rings. No explanation necessary lol. In my opinion, the greatest films ever made in Hollywood. ",

They deserve more attention.\n\nThe lore, the way they do Gamera's character and origin notably his designs throughout the three films.\n\nLegion and Iris are also some of the coolest looking kaiju with unique and original designs and the films also makes Gyaos out to be arguably the most terrifying kaiju due to their ability to reproduce at a fast rate and without the need the mate.\n\nAwesome movies, my favorites of all time. Gamera is such an underappreciated character. Started as a Godzilla knock-off sure but then the the Heisei Trilogy gave him his own character and origin, one that was very original that sets him apart from Godzilla. ",
