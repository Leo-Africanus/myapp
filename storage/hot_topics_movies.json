        "title": "\"The Rock\" (1996) had such a well-written, well-acted, &amp; well-directed (Michael Bay) switch up of the main antagonists/bad guys.",
        "content": "General Hummel (Ed Harris) was portrayed as the main antagonist, obviously along with the other 17 marines that went rouge with him. But he wasn't a normal \"bad guy\". We dont find out until way later that his true intentions were to bluff the Pentagon (with the threat of those 15 VX-gas warheads aimed at the heart of San Fransisco + the tourists they were holding hostage) into paying out $100 million dollars (from a shady slush fund full of proceeds from illegal arms sales that the pentagon makes) so he could distribute $1 million dollars to each one of the 83 marines families that had died under his command over the years, and then pay the other rogue marines a mil each. Pretty noble agenda, but at the same time, not so much.\n\nOur first inkling of who the REAL bad guys are was revealed when the Navy Seals entered the shower room, got surrounded, and then slaughtered.\u00a0[Captains Frye and Darrow](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCHteEFvEum8Xu7sQZGIP8Waow1OLitqJfweF-Pq3Ods3oCPKD2bNjsRZGtW2gWr1rlTMu9Q_S94br0FqDhH8Fa40gaT-nsI_YmE0MjWqzMcQ2meV8m6HpYNqfQV8ZQPLmKPuEo3DtQO0/s1600/vlcsnap-2014-03-10-16h04m01s12.png)\u00a0(Gregory Sporleder and Tony Todd) both have a moment during\u00a0[that scene](https://youtu.be/-PNJ5e8Qq3g)\u00a0where they are both shown, how do I put this, to be enjoying slaughtering those navy seals a little too much???\n\nAs the movie progresses, it still kind of feels like Hummel is the bad guy. But then after he gives the ok to launch the first VX-gas rocket bc the pentagon missed the deadline, and then changes the landing coordinates of the rockets mid-flight, shifting it from heading right for the football stadium full of people out to the open ocean, his true intentions are finally revealed. He was just trying to bluff the pentagon.\n\n[And then we get one of the most intense scenes from all 90's action movies.](https://youtu.be/hiJUZjv7xP4)\u00a0(In my opinion). \"This mission was based on the threat of force. I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I am out of my fucking mind? We bluffed. They called it. The mission is over.\" And then Captain Frye busts out such a creepy reply, revealing that HE is the true antagonist of the movie (Captain Darrow as well); \"Who ever said anything about bluffing General?\" That was such an eerie scene. He also was the last rouge marine to go down (I think??), suffering\u00a0[probably the most gruesome death](https://clip.cafe/the-rock-1996/im-gonna-choke-million-bucks-out-of-youre-gonna-die/)\u00a0of them all. (Well,\u00a0[Captain Darrow becoming \"The Rocket Man\"](https://youtu.be/DNg8OCIMZgI?t=31)\u00a0was pretty freaking brutal too, fitting for the movie's 2nd leading antagonist.) I love this movie, and the very well-written switch up of the main antagonists.",

I feel like as a young teen this movie doesn\u2019t hit, and it\u2019s really just another film, but as an adult with children I really feel like it\u2019s worth the time with your little ones.

        "title": "Do younger generations watch/like it's a wonderful life?",
        "content": "I'm watching this movie now for the first time after seeing bits and pieces of it on TV over the years around Christmas time. I'm in my 30s and I really like movies of all genres and time periods but movies before the 80s I have not seen many besides the Bond movies and some of the classics Godfather, Jaws, Alien etc. and yet this movie is very very good. Couple of times it got me choked, made me laugh a little and smile quite a few times.\n\nI can't say it feels very Christmasy, it does have a cozy feeling probably because of the black and white and always seeing it associated with the Christmas season on TV. It has a lot of heart (I haven't finished it yet), feel for George Bailey missing out on life, Id say many of my generation probably feel similar, shit I can't even get a job or build a future.\n\nThe only real critique I have is that the warmness, kindness in this film does not exist in the world today if it ever did. Potter and his cruel and cutthroat ideals are really what society is like today.\n\nHave younger people watched and or liked this film? Like under 30? I would expect this movie to be largely forgotten for most under 40.\n\nUpdate.\\*\\* I just finished the second half. it's a very good movie but it really isn't a Christmas movie. the Christmas tone wasn't only really squeezed in at the very end. The gratefulness of George at the end was satisfying and you can see he really is the richest man once he sees his family and friends. he's actually happy at the possibility I'm of being arrested because he is grateful for all the people in his life. If I had been drinking I may have teared up towards the end. I'm surprised how many small moments in this film made me laugh out loud. a great movie that somehow is about a sad man with a depressing life but with some small happy moments and a very happy ending makes up for it. it's weird. this movie is not a Christmas movie, it's not a happy movie, it's not particularly exciting yet everything comes together to create a classic. I'll definitely be watching this again around Christmas or a cold, cozy, snowy night. The only regret is I knew the plot of the movie from seeing so many pieces over the years. This is a great movie to go in cold, no trailer, just go in thinking it's a holiday movie.",

The scene when Ian says were you married made me question first time and then when he said do wanna make a baby forced me to believe she was seeing the future but still i was sceptical because the starting scene of movie had left mark on me.\nBut the scene where louise describes to the officials that learnig the alien language can make humans feel the time in non linear way said it all.\nAnd yeah i am still thinking why would Ian have left her after knowing her daughter's disease.",

The scene after he corners Dre in the alleyway is especially brutal. Dude *literally* beats the shit out of the kid (yes, you can see the poop stain afterward), and the entire time he\u2019s giving him a mafia style beatdown with his fist sinking into Dre\u2019s gut harder and harder each time, you can see the absolute sadistic glee on his face.\n\nDidn\u2019t stop at Dre either. This kid wanted the smoke with Jackie Chan (Mr. Han), a grown man, and treated a tournament with twelve year olds like this was his audition for the next Street Fighter role! \n\nIt was entertaining and all for a bad guy but the sudden switch as soon as he was defeated with that flip kick just didn\u2019t feel believable to me.

A similar thing happened with Heath Ledger. Even though he was known as an incredibly talented actor, he was primarily known for more tender, vulnerable roles in films such as Brokeback Mountain and 10 Things I Hate About You. Both castings ended up working incredibly well. What are some other unexpected, seemingly ill fitting castings which similarly worked brilliantly?",

        "content": "I recently watched Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts and The Cooler with William Macy and Alec Baldwin, both pretty average movies from the '90s and '00s but I was struck by how much better they look compared to most modern Hollywood and streaming services content. The texture, colors and overall feel just draw me in. Both films have these perfect night shots: dark, moody and full of detail unlike a lot of new movies where night scenes look either flat, overly brightened or way too dark to see anything.\n\nAnother thing in general, not just in these two films, is how alive the environments feel in older movies. There\u2019s wind, movement and atmosphere in almost every scene, which makes the world feel real and immersive. In contrast a lot of modern movies seem weirdly still with no wind, no rain, barely any movement in the background and sometimes even the shadows on actors faces or in the set decorations look fake, almost like they\u2019ve been airbrushed or Photoshopped for a magazine cover.\n\nThese advances in technology should be making movies look even better and help improve the overall production and not result in the flat, lifeless visuals we often get nowadays. It\u2019s frustrating to see all this potential wasted when older films with fewer resources managed to create such rich and immersive worlds.\n\nWhat do you think about it?",

When eye-witness video emerges, it sparks a far-reaching investigation from a border checkpoint to Washington D.C. CRITICAL INCIDENT chronicles journalists\u2019, lawyers\u2019, and family members\u2019 efforts to explore the Border Patrol\u2019s involvement in the incident, ultimately pointing to cover-ups, and uncovering the existence of a little-known unit inside the agency that had been involved in other border related incidents. In 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the case and recognizing that Hernandez-Rojas\u2019 human rights had been violated during his arrest.\n\n  \nTrailer: [https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y](https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y)\n\n",

No other movie will tell a story like this, no other movie going into the future will be able to portray human emotions like this one. I cant even begin to imagine it, not even Spirited Way which before i watched Kaguya was my favourite film of all time, not even that amounts to this its not even close. \n\nI need to know if anyone else feels like this whether its with Kaguya or another movie you consider utterly transcendent. The last time i felt like this was when i watched The Promised Neverland (S1) for the first time, and even that doesnt amount to Kaguya atleast in my opinion.\n\nIm almost afraid to ask, are there any other movies like this one? If anyone has an answer please tell me it, i need to know. I honestly dont know where to start when it comes to movies this good, this well animated, or in general just a movie with a story this complete and transcendent. Words arent enough. ",
