        "content": "I know I'm pretty much saying the grass is green here and this isn't even my first time watching the movie, but wanted to add my 2 cents anyway after seeing it again tonight for Halloween season while it's fresh.\n\nThis movie is great and only is really scarier as I appreciate it more, if that even makes sense. It's because given Freddy has only about seven minutes of screen time in the entire movie, that's only beneficial because you can still feel his presence even when he's not actually there in the moment, but the impact he puts on everything as it all progresses. \n\nIt's definitely a less is more type situation. And it seems like how of the slasher elites like Ghostface, Chucky, Michael, Jason, Leatherface, and the new addition Art the Clown, although maybe he's the closest to Freddy.......Freddy is the most powerful because he obviously comes after you when you doze off...\n\nAnd sleep, ain't no avoiding that shit....at some point you'll fall asleep no matter how how you try not to, eventually it's gonna happen, which means it's pretty much impossible to escape Freddy.",

Maybe you didn't idenitify with a character, or it was a matter of taste, not quality.  Others liked it, so you gave it a go.\n\nOne for me is The Big Lebowski.  I just couldn't get into it even after two viewings, but I understand why it's a cult classsic.   I enjoyed the characters, the story just didn't do much for me.",
