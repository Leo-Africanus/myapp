It\u2019s easy to guess the worst, but skip that and give your one BEST. No close seconds etc. just the very best. Personally I think the answer is obvious, but since there are different generations here, I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t get a consensus of the ONE. But maybe we will!",

        "content": "For me The Naked Gun Trilogy has only one really funny &amp; good movie but apart from that it's just a series of diminishing returns. Police Squad is the superior version of what Naked Gun wanted to be like really it's jokes, gags &amp; sight gags as much more funny &amp; better than the movies. I'll give the movies this credit they do work standalone despite being a spin off of Police squad, however I don't know man it seems like the fact they were restrained because of Network censorship the show had to be clever &amp; actually put effort into being a specific parody rather than just pointless references. \n\nOn another note it seems like the diminishing returns of The Naked Gun Trilogy as well as Spy hard with their heavy reliance on pointless pop culture references really foreshadowed the type of Parody movie we were about to get.\n\nThat's my thoughts tell me yours because I really wanted to discuss it.",

This it does not by trying to reinvent the wheel but, rather smartly, by addressing the elephant in the room, locating the action in a kitsch yet somehow timeless retro-future more befitting *The Jetsons* than *The Avengers*. It also benefits from a smart script and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this \u2014 really quite moving performances from its four charismatic leads, being arguably the best of Pedro Pascal\u2019s releases this year.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1236466922/) (80):\n\n&gt;True to its subtitle, the film feels like a fresh start. And like this summer\u2019s blockbuster \u201cSuperman\u201d reboot over at DC, that could be just what it takes to win back audiences suffering from superhero exhaustion.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/) (80):\n\n&gt;With an exemplary cast and shiny new alt-universe to enjoy, this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar\u2019s too low for you, then it\u2019s also the best Marvel movie in years.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/) (90):\n\n&gt;The Fantastic Four: First Steps is set in a world that I wouldn't mind living in. Even if there are occasional, ineffable cosmic deities plotting to devour me, and terrifying silver aliens ripping my soul apart with their eyes. \"First Steps\" is a superhero movie where we're already better. And I love that.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/07/22/fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-movie-review/85302239007/) (75):\n\n&gt;After two mediocre 2000s film featuring Marvel\u2019s legendary superhero family, and an atrocious third outing in 2015, the foursome makes its Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in a combo sci-fi/disaster flick full of retrofuturistic 1960s flavor.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-leads-team-back-retro-future-11776476) (75):\n\n&gt;From its Saul Bass-inspired opening credits to its callbacks to Saturday morning superhero cartoons, it practically vibrates with its sense of time and place.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-ebon-moss-bachrach-joseph-quinn) (70):\n\n&gt;These First Steps might not be the great strides I was hoping for, but they are sure footing for the Fantastic Four to officially leap into the MCU.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/fantastic-four-first-steps-review-b2793808.html) (60):\n\n&gt;In fact, all the ingredients are perfectly lined up here, and, in the right combinations, and with the pure wonderment of Michael Giacchino\u2019s score, The Fantastic Four: First Steps does shimmer with a kind of wide-eyed idealism. And that\u2019s lovely.\n\nDirected by Matt Shakman:\n\n&gt;On the 1960s-inspired retro-futuristic alternate universe known as Earth-828. the Fantastic Four must protect their world from the planet-devouring cosmic being Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer.\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic\n* Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman\n* Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm / The Thing\n* Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm / Human Torch\n* Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal / Silver Surfer\n* Paul Walter Hauser as Harvey Elder / Mole Man\n* Ralph Ineson as Galactus",
