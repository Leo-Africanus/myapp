One of the characters was this extremely violent ghost haunting in the subway system, played by Vincent Schiavelli. \n\nThat character scared the crap out of me. His appearance was one thing, but the other thing was his mental state and awful afterlife situation. He was able to speak rationally, even kindly, to other characters for a little while, before his paranoia overcame him and he would be violent and terrified again. He was killed because he was pushed into an incoming train, or maybe he jumped. Who knows how long ago - maybe a very long time ago. It was like he went mad from being in limbo for so long, or maybe he was a crazy homeless person before, but he was wearing really beautiful clothing. So we are maybe supposed to doubt it. I was always very upset by and afraid of him.\n\nDid you ever watch a movie not designed for scares and just get totally frightened of a character? Maybe you were a kid too, or maybe it was something else that got you. Who was the character? Why did you get scared?",

        "content": "For me, it\u2019s Ryan Reynolds, many people think he\u2019s bad and plays the same character over and over again, and I definitely agree that he\u2019s typecasted.\n\nBut in my opinion, he\u2019s genuinely a really good actor, his performance in Buried (2010) was fantastic and honestly worthy of an Oscar nomination. It was such a realistic performance and it would be exactly how I would be acting if I was stuck in that situation.",

        "content": "What's a movie you think had great potential (a great story idea, cool character, a really neat mythology, something like that) but which failed horribly to live up to that? I'll go first (because obviously I'm making this post as an opportunity to share this specific opinion).\nStriking Distance (1993). I always thought the premise, the ending, the entire plot could have made a really fantastic movie. Rumor is that Bruce Willis got all \"Hollywood\" and messed a lot of it up, but I think his casting was good. This movie could have been really great. It's still...entertaining, I guess. But I always feel a little sad about what it could have been.",
