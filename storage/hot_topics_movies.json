That last point currently has customers up in arms.\n\nCurrently, any Alamo Drafthouse social media post\u2014no matter the subject\u2014is accompanied by an onslaught of comments about the theater's plan to kill its classic paper-and-pen ordering model and replace it with a QR code-based platform, effectively ending its longstanding \u201cno phones\u201d policy. The shift is seen as a betrayal of Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s promise of a viewing experience with limited distractions. People have called it a bellwether of staffing reductions. And what better way to justify the development cost of a new ordering platform than by cutting expenses?\n\nAlamo Drafthouse\u2019s current predicament notwithstanding, there is no reason a theater cannot implement mobile ordering technology without sacrificing its soul. In fact, another Texas-based chain has done exactly that over the past several years. ",

I still prefer Airplane and The Naked Gun but a lot of the background sight gags in Top Secret are more clever and witty (Check out the Dove statue in the park!).\n\nI wonder if kids these days will get that Blue Lagoon spoof though? Nobody talks about that one these days.\n\nAnyone want to go Skeet Shooting later?",

        "content": "Not necessarily indicative of a great film, but certainly the first few minutes are important. So, what movie has the best opening scene(s)\u2014loosely defined (by me) as the first 15 minutes or so. For my part, and having thought about it for bit, it is Apocalypse Now. The montage of the napalmed jumble, helicopters, ceiling fan and Willard\u2019s haggard presence and hallowed soul, combined with The Doors\u2019 haunting song The End just sucks you in. The transition to the general\u2019s trailer park HQ and strerile explanation of the operation establish precisely the point of the file: the absolute hypocrisy of it all. Not that I\u2019m just into military films, but second for me might be Saving Private Ryan, for the sheer visceral brutality and reality of its depiction of combat\u2014but it falls short for me in only in its its single dimension; the movie itself has far more to offer. Your turn!",
