Still good, still hopeful - but already wrestling with fear, anger, and pride. \n\nYou could see the seeds of his downfall forming:\n\nFlashes of protectiveness turning into aggression\n\nDeep attachment to his mom and Padm\u00e9\n\nResentment toward slavery and the Jedi\u2019s cold detachment\n\nAn early desire to control what he can\u2019t stand to lose\n\n\nIt would\u2019ve made his arc so much smoother - and honestly, more tragic. He\u2019d feel real. The romance in AOTC would also land better, instead of feeling like a weird jump.\n\nLet us see him struggle from the start. That way, the fall actually hurts.",

        "content": "Back in 2018 or 2019, I hit a low point and didn't know where to turn to. It felt like nothing was going right and my depression was crippling. I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.\n\nDuring this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Ant-Man,\" and \"Prisoners,\" I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn't alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.\n\nFor an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like \"The Suicide Squad,\" \"Dune,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" or \"Late Night with the Devil,\" I just think about how deserved it is. I'm so happy he has had continued success. It is deserved!",

        "content": "\nI\u2019m looking for some \u201cboy power\u201d movies for young boys, preferably animated action movies/series. I want ones that really portray themes of heroism,  bravery, and honorable male characters with healthy masculinity for my 10 year old nephew to look up to. \n\nSome examples are: Lion King, How to Train Your Dragon,  Legend of the Guardians: Owls of Ga\u2019Hoole, Brother Bear, Tarzan, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda, Rise of the Guardians, Ice Age, Kubo and the Two Strings, Avatar the Last Airbender. \n\nI have a lot of them for my younger sisters/nieces (Brave, Mulan, Totally Spies, etc),  but since I wasn\u2019t really interested in \u201cboy\u201d movies growing up, I\u2019m drawing a blank here. Thanks!",
