It uses a lot of natural lighting and my first thought was that Heat was shot digitally in the same vain as Collateral and Miami Heat. Compare to another 1995 Robert De Niro film, Casino, they look like two totally different movies. My main question is am I imagining Heat looking different? If so what techniques were used? Because scenes like the rooftop moment where robert De Niro shares a moment with the love interest, and Al Pacino\u2019s character going to meet his informant at the junkyard,the water tank scenes, and the shootout, all look almost like they were shot digitally.",

Everyone quotes the \"It's a bold strategy Cotton\" line, but I don't think that one gets enough credit.\n\nAnother is in Tropic Thunder when Les Grossman has just finished screaming and swearing at someone down the phone then casually says \"Could you uh...find out who that was?\"\n\nAgain, it's so funny the way it gets slipped in there.  That he was ranting away like that and genuinely didn't know who he was talking to.\n\nWhat are some of your favourites?",

And he is led off along with other captured natives, as they are taken to a large city, along with captured natives. While the women are sold into slavery, the men are taken to top of a pyramid, where they are sacrificed to appease the Gods. Jaguar Paw however manages to avoid being sacrificed, due to the appearance of a solar eclipse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8667o4k3ghg1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f61f27e315cf5ed2e0136e795eb9e463fe47f56e\n\nHe takes advantage and escapes his captors, setting off a large chase in the thick jungles. For Jaguar Paw, it's not just a dash for freedom, he also has to reunite with his wife and son.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k31qqh4v3ghg1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7299b38de369bcfd0a74686cab608f7d49432e\n\nOne of  the main criticisms of Apocalypto has been the violence in it, and yes the movie is not meant for weak hearts.  Especially the scenes showing the human sacrifice, hearts being ripped out, can really make you flinch. But this is not the torture porn kind of violence, where it's just killing for killing's sake.  There is a strong emotional core, of Jaguar Paw's dash for freedom and his desire to reunite with his family.\n\nYou root for Jaguar Paw, want him to meet his family and that to me differentiates this movie from an average slasher flick.\n\nMel Gibson is one great director, knows how well to tell a story. While the movie is great in many scenes, the entire part from when Jaguar Paw escapes to the reunion with his family, is absolutely rivetting. Non stop action that just keeps you on the edge of your seats.  And parallel narration of Jaguar Paw's wife and son trying to come out of the well, just elevates the tension. \n\nThe opening hunt scene is superbly filmed, as well as the scenes set in the Mayan city, the raid on the village, the captives being taken along.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxzkfvky3ghg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e572df49eea8f05f5c6fa7a5b65b60621a9637bb\n\nAnd of course that waterfall jump scene, has to be one of the greatest movie scenes ever, brilliant shot taking and editing.  It's just what we go to theaters for.\n\nThe use of Yucatec Maya language and casting of Native Indian. Hispanic actors gives it an authenticity, of having been set right there.  The detailing is perfect be it the Mayan City, the pyramids, the costumes, taking you right into that period.\n\nJames Horner BGM elevates the mood and atmosphere, this is just the kind of epic cinema, right up his lane, and comes out with a memorable soundtrack, especially in the chase scenes.\n\nRudy Youngblood who played Jaguar Paw is of Comanche descent, and he is brilliant, especially in the chase scenes.\n\nRaul Trujillo is suitably nasty as Zero Wolf, and Gerardo Taraceno who passed away recently radiates pure evil on screen as the sadistic Middle Eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I haven't watched it in decades and had been putting it off but I finally decided to watch it and...I'll tell ya...if you're wishy washy about watching, do yourself a favor and put it on. It's such a good movie with one of the best alien encounter story ever. \n\nThe conversation scene at the end had me grinning like a damn fool. The entire sequence near the end is just lovely. \n\nI remember people being upset that Roy abandoned his family but earlier the beings did something to his brain when they gave him that burn. He *had* to go, it honestly didn't feel like he had a choice...it was his destiny lol. ",
