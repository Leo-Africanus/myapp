        "content": "I went into Lawrence of Arabia expecting a stuffy, tedious, dated film where I'd probably give up after 20 minutes. Instead it felt incredibly fresh, relevant, and endlessly exciting, and I ended up glued to the screen for the full 3 1/2 hrs or so. I haven't stopped thinking about it since. The story, the fascinating intracacies and emerging contradictions of the character, and how incredible the filmmaking was. I love how Lawrence's attitudes and ideas were shaped by the responses he gets to various events, his innocent, pure idealism slowly crumbling into this cynism and bitterness.    \n\nIt was just incredible. Like Barry Lyndon, every shot is just beautifully framed and interesting. Then the huge scenes of people, with hundreds of camel mounted arabs galloping across the desert, or hundreds of unmounted horses escaping a traincart. I just have no idea how they were able to create some of these shots, and in such remote places of the world.   \n\nIt was absolutely mind-blowing to me now, so I can't imagine how audiences would have received it back in 1962, when they probably hadn't even seen colour footage of desert before? It must have been far more impactful than any spectacle films we have today (e.g Avatar etc). And so much more mature and complex. I'm sad we'll never see anything like it again.   \n\nIf you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, and on the biggest screen possible. \n\n",

        "title": "\"The Apartment\" (1960) gets better with age.",
        "content": "I finally watched Billy Wilder's \"The Apartment,\" and I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for how heavy and emotionally complex it would get beneath its clean, witty exterior. Going in, I expected a light romantic comedy. What I got instead was a surprisingly honest exploration of loneliness, moral compromise, and even suicide, all wrapped inside one of the most deceptively simple premises I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nAt first, the setup feels almost sitcom-like. Jack Lemmon lends his apartment to higher-ups at his insurance company so they can carry on affairs, hoping it\u2019ll help him climb the corporate ladder. It\u2019s clever, funny, and absurd. But as the film unfolds, the simplicity of that idea spirals into something nuanced. His apartment stops being a joke and becomes representative of his isolation, a space he technically owns but never truly gets to live in.\n\nJack Lemmon's performance is absolutely perfect. He plays Baxter as the ultimate everyman, he is awkward, well-meaning, quietly desperate to belong. Lemmon\u2019s performance makes Baxter\u2019s loneliness feel painfully real without ever becoming too melodramatic. You can see how Baxter\u2019s small moral compromises slowly eat away at his sense of self, even as he keeps smiling and cracking jokes.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how directly the film confronts despair and suicide, especially for a mainstream Hollywood movie from 1960. Shirley MacLaine\u2019s Fran is treated with genuine compassion, and the film never trivializes her pain. Instead, it frames loneliness as something systemic created by power imbalances, emotional neglect, and a culture that rewards selfishness.\n\nThe film features an exchange of dialogue that is among my favorites in film now:\n\n*The mirror... it's broken.*  \n*Yes, I know. I like it that way. Makes me look the way I\u00a0feel.*\n\nBy the time the movie ended, it stood out for feeling far more layered than its premise suggests. It has its humorous moments, but it\u2019s also deeply human and sad. For a film over 60 years old, it feels shockingly relevant and I imagine it speaks more so now to people than it did when it was introduced as a \"comedy.\"",

What hits me is not the famous speeches. It is the system behind them. \n\nAttention matters more than truth. Anger gets rewarded. Calm voices get ignored. People slowly turn into content through small compromises, not evil plans. \n\nEveryone is just doing their job too well. That mindset feels normal now, and that is the scary part. That is why it feels so accurate today.\n\nWhat movie feels way more real now than it did when you first watched it?\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "For me, it's the Michael Bay Transformers movies. Even though Dark of the Moon wasn't a very good film, you could tell that it ended perfectly. Megatron is killed and the Transformers are hopeful for the future as Sam's character arc is wrapped up. You think that they could end it on Dark of the Moon, with a perfect ending. And that's coming from someone that wasn't even big on Bayformers in general besides for the first one.\n\nBut no, they did two more Michael Bay Transformers movies (Age of Extinction and The Last Knight), while recasting LaBeouf with Mark Wahlberg and undoing the ending of the third film. By that time, it had approached into the ridiculous and overdone territory with a Transformer that could age old. I mean, really. That baffled me a lot. It was clear that by the time Last Knight came out, the whole franchise had run its course and realistically, there was no coming back from it. The Transformers movies has since improved overtime but holy smokes, that franchise was just going downhill bigtime for a while with no signs of improvement until Bay stepped down from the director's chair.",

Before the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead\n\n2. The Purge\n\n3. First Reformed (ah-mazing !!! )\n\nWhat is everyone\u2019s fave Ethan Hawke movie? \n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts and input.

        "content": "Last month I got an urge to see some classic western. I had seen The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly before when I was doing a greatest movies of all time watch. So I decided to go and check out the other two entries of the Man With No Name trilogy, a Fistful of Dollars &amp; For a Few Dollars more. And finish the whole thing with Unfrogiven.\n\n\n\nI fucking loved a Fistful of Dollars. It's straight up a Yojimbo rip off. But I fucking love Eastwood's performance as the Man With No Name. Nobody has worked a cigar as good as he does in those movies.\n\n\n\nA Few Dollars more, I liked a little less, it's still great movie but it drags a little bit with the pacing and the story becomes a bit too conveluted there in the middle. Still, amazing ending.\n\n\nAnd I also rewatched Good, Bad &amp; Ugly. Which I still think it's a masterpiece. One I thing I noticed watching this Sergio Leone trilogy is how he uses the same acting troupe for different roles in the movies, it's pretty neat. That big bearded guy plays a goon in all three movies.\n\n\nWatching this trilogy is kinda nuts cause it's like, everything I've ever known about westerns has come from these movies. It'd like watching every westeren ever made all at once. Which is a testiment to how great they are cause it means everybody else stole from them.\n\n\n\nAnyway, after all this I finally sat down and watched Unforgiven. The difference between the movies is instantly felt in the presentation. The Man With No Name trilogy are crime action movies, Unfrogiven is a slowburn drama. It takes all the way to the end of the movie for a big action scene. And it's so well worth it.\n\n\n\nI like to head canon that Will Munny is Eastwood's Man With No Name. Finally settling after years of gunslining. He ends up &gt;!exorcising his demons, quitting drinking and swearing off violance!&lt; and when he &gt;!snaps and goes back to his old ways, it's not with the flair of a badass gunslinging hero. He looks like a terrifying stone cold murderer!&lt; the same way everybody else felt around the Man With No Name when he was gunning down people with his quickdraw skills as the audiences cheered.",

        "content": "I get it in a world of endless remakes and rehashes we want something different but for me it is more important to me that a film is well made and that I find it worth my time and enjoyable. For example, She's out my league is a very run of mill rom-com. The only thing that it does different is the hot girl falls in love with the nerdy nice guy, and he spends the whole movie trying to wrap his head around it. Another example is the Roundup series of films which is pretty much the Korean Lethal Weapon but instead of shootouts and things blowing up it is Ma Dong Seok who is pretty much Sammo Hung if he was an MMA fighter built like a brick house knocking out fools in the name of justice. None of these films are groundbreaking but are well rounded, well-made and the actors gave it their best while respecting the viewer. That all I can ask for.",
