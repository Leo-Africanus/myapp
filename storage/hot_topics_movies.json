Both castings ended up working incredibly well. What are some other unexpected, seemingly ill fitting castings which similarly worked brilliantly?",

When eye-witness video emerges, it sparks a far-reaching investigation from a border checkpoint to Washington D.C. CRITICAL INCIDENT chronicles journalists\u2019, lawyers\u2019, and family members\u2019 efforts to explore the Border Patrol\u2019s involvement in the incident, ultimately pointing to cover-ups, and uncovering the existence of a little-known unit inside the agency that had been involved in other border related incidents. In 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the case and recognizing that Hernandez-Rojas\u2019 human rights had been violated during his arrest.\n\n  \nTrailer: [https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y](https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y)\n\n",

Last year, the second movie was Seven Psychopaths, not a Christmas movie but does have a message of \"love\" and \"peace,\" some what. This year, my second movie is Eyes Wide Shut, Criterion 4k which is amazing, which is set around Christmas. So is there any specific movies you watch on Christmas Eve in the late hours? Also, what are you drinking? I'm drinking Scotch and Ginger Beer.",

Keep it in the era of the original and play off that it is retelling of an American disaster that was covered up.\nThe level of detail in the book could give Denis Villeneuve a real script to redevelop.\nOf course this is just a dream, but I just love this movie.",
