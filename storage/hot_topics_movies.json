With ever increasing shock value or whatever. In an attempt to be shocking and wacky is horrible.\n\nLike when there's two characters insulting another character and they alternate and scale up the the same insult, like: \n\n\"You look like a turd\" \n\n\"You look like turd that all the other turds don't like because you live in your turd-mom's turd-basement.\"\n\n\"You look like a turd that banged another turd and then had a turd baby out of its butt.\"\n\nEtc... they usually do five or six. I kept it to three.  They keep scaling up the same joke but are still saying the same joke over and over.  Yes, he's looks like turd haha. Let's move on.  \n\nThese are things that they used to do in movies and then pick the best one and use that in the movie and now they just leave them all in there and it's pathetic. \n\nWatching hot tub time machine 2 and they they keep doing this and then they're actually making references to the fact that they keep doing this which doesn't actually make it any funnier.  Hanging a lamp on laziness and stupidity is not comedy. \n\nJudd Apatow turned this into the regular and it's horrible. He's done some good stuff and it was fine that he was doing this in his movies. We don't need it in every other comedy movie made since. It's what comprised about 65% of the 2016 Ghostbusters movie's dialogue.  \n\nI want well-written comedy, not a brainstorming session on film.",

Aubrey Plaza. I'm in. \n\nAnna and the Apocalypse (2017) - Such a fun take on the zombie genre. \n\nVampires vs the Bronx (2020) - Great horror-ish comedy. \n\nSo many others I can't remember. Seems like 2010 - 2020 what the sweet spot for this weirdness. \n\nEdit - Wow! I love Reddit. So many great recommendations here.

        "content": "So today I watched *Perfect Days* (Japanese movie) and honestly...I didn't expect it to leave such a strong impact.\n\nAt first, it feels so simple... just a guy living his everyday life, cleaning toilets, listening to old cassettes, taking pictures of trees. But the more you watch, the more you realize how much peace and depth there is behind his routine.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how he smiles at the sky every morning. Like he\u2019s genuinely grateful for another day. No rush, no complaints, just...existing with full heart.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk much unless necessary, but when he does interact (like with his niece or that random guy he plays shadow games with), you can feel how much he enjoys human connection too. He\u2019s not *avoiding* people...he just doesn't *need* noise to be happy.\n\nThere\u2019s this beautiful bittersweetness. He\u2019s not \"choosing loneliness\" in a sad way...it's more like, life took him down this path, and instead of fighting it, he embraced it with full acceptance. That\u2019s powerful in today\u2019s world where everyone feels pressure to chase something constantly.\n\nThe scene where his niece leaves... and he quietly cries...man, that hit different.  \nNot because he's weak or regretting, but because even the strongest hearts carry a little sadness somewhere deep.\n\nAnd that final drive...the way he smiles and then tears up while listening to music, that was pure *life itself*. Happiness, sadness, memories, gratitude...all flowing through him at once.\n\nHonestly gave me the same vibe I felt after watching Shawshank Redemption...the idea that freedom and peace are an inside job. No matter what life gives or takes away.\n\nOne of the most beautiful movies I\u2019ve ever watched without trying to be \"loud\" about it. I liked the whole silent treatment vibe\n\nAlso, I\u2019m surprised how not many people talk about this movie.\n\nWould love to hear what you guys felt after watching it.",

However it is then edited (reversed) to make it so the character looks up from looking down originally. \n\nPersonally i find it very obvious but have never understood the reasoning. Is it intentional to give a surreal/irregular feel? Or is it because they didn\u2019t have the shot they needed so just sort of butchered an already existing shot to fit the narrative? \n\nTheir eye movement and blink just its really unnatural but i\u2019v not seen any evidence or articles mentioning this besides a couple of Reddit posts asking the same thing. \n\nWhat prompted me to post this question was i noticed it on Nicholas Hoult\u2019s character in The Menu. If that helps the explanation of scene. \n\nI have included the shot in question, watch how his eyes flick. This is obviously reversed. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Rl7kq3N",

Some that come to the top of my head are most of Saramago's work (especially his most critical works on religion), and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream by Harlan Ellison.\nAny other stories that come to mind?",

        "title": "Movies Emphasizing Good Character",
        "content": "Looking for movies that exemplify the empowerment, practical importance &amp; inherent rewards of having good (or improving/redeeming) character. \n\nSubjects like honesty, changing/growing, hard work, sacrifice, productivity, faith, being the bigger man, honor, working toward the greater good, respecting others &amp; oneself, following through, overcoming obstacles of every kind, achievement, teamwork, helping and building up others, valuing family and friends, goodwill, etc. \n\nEspecially movies that would engage an very intelligent young man. My son is nearly 9 years old but I've recently been selecting &amp; allowing him to watch more mature content (sometimes including rated R) in my company/supervision. I make an effort to answer any questions or put things into context as necessary. He won't watch any bits he finds uncomfortable, and I end the viewing if it could be harmful or I don't think the value is there. \n\nI'm looking for movies that men, children of solo moms, and/or only children found positively formative. \n\nThere isn't a father in my son's life, and he has been in trouble off and on for years by reacting violently- mostly to students/friends who tease or are unfair with him.  He is in a special needs program for children with emotional/behavioral challenges. Of course he has therapists, learns emotional regulations techniques, and other support. He often deeply struggles with his sense of the unfairness &amp; difficulty of everything. \n\nBut stories really speak to him, and I feel a lot of the \"children's\" media doesn't example much good. My son reads a whole lot of books and graphic novels/comics (and they certainly benefit his language &amp; literature skills) but I feel the immaturity, entitlement, rudeness, smart-assery, disobedience, poor attitudes and rule-breaking that saturate those stories he finds so entertaining need to be combatted with better messages. He has only been allowed directly supervised video media for a long time, due to the same and much worse problems.\n\n ",

        "content": "Now there's those movies that just seem to be timeless that no matter how old they get, they always seem to come up in topics of discussion or get referenced or come up in to top Ten lists. Good examples of this are Back to the future, wizard of oz, and even a movie like office space. But what's a movie that you thought was gonna get talked about for a long time, but now nobody seems to talk about it at all. \n\nFor me it's gotta be Sin City, when I first saw that at the theater  I thought it was not even just a movie, that it was an experience. I thought it was just gonna be a movie that people talked about for ages. But I can't remember the last time I  heard Anyone talk about Sin City. And in fact, it's not even a movie I would wanna go back to, maybe it was just too mid 2000s.",

I'm still trying to process it.\n\nWhen the same term is used in other mainstream movies (like [*Teen Wolf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Wolf)) it seems offensive.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlso...Jason Bateman is a terrific actor, but I forgot how frickin' long he has been acting until I accidentally stopped on Pluto TV's \"Little House on the Prairie\" channel and there he was as a kid.",

It's not helped that he IMMEDIATELY prioritizes attention on his new adopted daughter and neglects his son, and even TELLS off Sister Abigail who visits to warn them of Esther's presence near questionable situations. They were obviously just trying to make him the cliched idiot horror character to advance the plot.",
