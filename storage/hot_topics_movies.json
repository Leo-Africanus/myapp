        "content": "I re-watched The Arrival (2016), and it\u2019s probably the most meaningful movie I\u2019ve ever watched. Now in my late 30s, it sounds cliche, but it hits with a different weight compared to when I first watched it 10 years ago.\n\n*Arrival* is one of the rare science-fiction films that treats intelligence, empathy, and restraint as its true spectacles. Beneath its fucking amazing and moody visuals and measured pacing lies a meditation on language as a technology, one capable of reshaping not just communication but cognition itself. Villeneuve avoids the genre\u2019s usual obsession with conquest or catastrophe, grounding the encounter instead in linguistics, uncertainty, love, and grief.\n\nThat idea mirrors real life as you age. By this point, you\u2019ve learned that understanding does not come without cost. The film\u2019s most unsettling truth is not that the visitors are unknowable, but that truly understanding them permanently alters how time, choice, and loss are experienced. At this point in life, you recognise these patterns in your own life, relationships, careers, and love. You see how earlier decisions quietly encoded both joy and pain, and how awareness doesn\u2019t free you from consequence, it deepens it.\n\nIn that sense, *Arrival* is less about extraterrestrials than about maturity. It asks whether knowledge, love, and connection are still worth pursuing when you can already foresee their endings. The film\u2019s answer feels profoundly adult: meaning isn\u2019t found in avoiding loss, but in choosing fully, consciously, even when the outcome is known.",

Will Sasso and Joan Cusack as the heads of rival families locked in a multi-generational war. Jason Schwartzman as a postman sent to get an icy hellscape ready for postal service (against his will), and Rashida Jones as the local school teacher who catches his eye.\n\nThe movie has a wry sense of humor that never becomes cynical and, in fact, is a sort of cure for cynicism: it shows what it looks like to overcome cynicism and find hope, or connection.\n\n\nWatch it if you haven't; rewatch it if you have.

        "content": "Disclaimer: I am 100% biased as this is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time but good lord the sheer craftsmanship of this film gets buried beneath the goofy tone and anime aesthetic way too much. \n\nSeriously, just go watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and tell me it doesn't pack an absurd amount of exposition, emotion, and character building into that time while managing to keep it tense and exciting. The opening race tells you everything you need to know about pretty much every character. \n\nSpeed is the best of the best but loves his older brother so much he'll slow down so as not to beat his record. Trixie loves Speed for who he is, even if who he is is an oddball kid who is so into racing that she's a (very close) number 2 in the loves of his life. Ma Racer is simultaneously scared shitless and entirely in awe by what her sons can accomplish but absolutely, totally loves her family no matter what. Pa Racer is principled, has capital-O Opinions about racing and how to do it \"right\" but still torments himself about how things went down with Rex. Rex WAS the best of the best, but gave it up for... something we don't know yet, and it destroyed him.\n\nIn 15 minutes we know more about 5 characters than most movies manage to tell in their entire runtime - all while a visually stunning and exciting race is going down.\n\nAnd it's not like the movie slows down from there. It's never boring, consistently funny, and the finale race is one of the single best things ever put to film. The Wachowski sisters peaked here. I mean it.\n\nWatch this god damned movie",

        "content": "Over the years I've watched Blade Runner a couple of times, but it never sat right with me. I kind of understood why it is considered a masterpiece, but I also kind of didn't.\n\nI watched it again yesterday, and it finally clicked and I also know why: I watched the theatrical version for the first time. The one with Deckard's voice-overs. I don't remember ever having voice-overs in this movie, so it must be that before I've always watched Ridley Scott's Director's Cut or the Final Cut.\n\nI now understand that what I was missing was context. Blade Runner has always been awing me with its imagery and music, but I also found the dialogues to be on the philosophical rather than the logical side and I didn't understand why certain things were happening as they were. This took me out of the movie pretty early, thus I couldn't really appreciate what I was seeing. Now, with Deckard's voice-overs, I do. And the film finally works for me. And it makes me happy, because I too can now fully appreciate a milestone of filmmaking as much as so many other people do.\n\nEDIT: Based on some comments below, I'd like to add that I'm not claiming the voice-over version of the movie is better than the later cuts. I am just glad to now have the context that is given in the voice-overs. Now that I have this context, I will probably watch the \"purer\" Director's Cut or the Final Cut again in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if I prefer them over the theatrical, too. I just needed to context given in the theatrical to better understand the movie in general.",

'Ella McCay' flops with just $2M, the fifth worst debut in 2,500 theaters, and James L. Brooks' worst ever debut as director.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/ljqm8bop8g7g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cce48dc1521f1120d43688a1ff73aa813941687\n\nWith very minimal competition, ***Zootopia 2*** reclaimed the top spot on its third weekend. But its real story was overseas, where it not only crossed the $1 billion milestone, but also became the second highest grossing film of the year. The week's new wide release was ***Ella McCay***, which posted one of the worst ever debuts in wide release.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 20.5% from last year, when ***Moana 2*** stayed at #1, and ***Kraven the Hunter*** and ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** flopped.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** reclaimed the top spot with $25.8 million, which was down just 40% from last week. This drop is better than ***Moana 2***'s third weekend (48%), and its weekend take isn't far off. The film has earned $258.5 million domestically, and while it will take a sizeable drop due to ***Avatar***, it should still continue holding well through the holidays.\n\nAfter topping the box office last week, ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** earned $19.3 million this week. That's down a brutal 70%, which is the bottom tier for horror films. At the very least, the drop is better than the 76.2% drop of the original, although that film was released simultaneously on Peacock. This suggests that the film will really struggle to appeal beyond its core fanbase. Through 10 days, the film has earned $95.3 million. It will probably take another heavy drop this week thanks to a bunch of newcomers, but it should still make its way to $130 million domestically.\n\nOn its fourth weekend, ***Wicked: For Good*** had another bad drop, showing that it's not stabilizing. This time, it dropped a rough 51%, earning $8.5 million this weekend. Somehow, this rough drop has also been its best so far. For contrast, the original ***Wicked***'s fourth weekend drop wasn't just 37%, but it was almost thrice as high ($22.6 million). ***For Good*** has earned $312.1 million, and it continues losing steam at a quick pace, running $47 million behind ***Wicked***. With heavy competition on the holidays, ***For Good*** will probably miss $350 million domestically.\n\nThe Indian film ***Dhurandhar*** cracked the fourth spot on its second weekend. It managed to increase, earning $3.5 million (from just 377 theaters) this weekend. That took its domestic total to $7.8 million.\n\n***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** dipped 32%, earning $2.3 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $59.3 million. \n\nIn sixth place, ***Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution*** unsurprisingly collapsed 79%, earning just $2 million. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.4 million.\n\nIt's not until seventh place where we find this week's wide release, 20th Century Studios' ***Ella McCay***. It's James L. Brooks' first film in 15 years, but unfortunately the audience wasn't anticipating it. The film debuted with a terrible $2 million in 2,500 theaters, for a brutal $808 per-theater average. This is Brooks' worst ever debut as director, even unadjusted for inflation, managing to open below ***Terms of Endearment*** ($3.4 million, or $11.4 million adjusted). And it's also the fifth worst ever debut for a film playing at 2,500+ theaters.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a surprising result. Brooks is certainly a Legend, partly due to his films ***Terms of Endearment*** ($108 million DOM, $165 million WW), ***Broadcast News*** ($51 million DOM, $67 million WW), and ***As Good As It Gets*** ($148 million DOM, $314 million WW). But the thing is that these films are at least 28 years old, and the two films that he released afterwards, ***Spanglish*** and ***How Do You Know***, weren't good at all. The former bombed despite Adam Sandler's star power, while the latter became one of the century's biggest failures, earning just $48 million against a colossal $120 million budget. Brooks had clout, but the key word is *had*.\n\nSo what did ***Ella McCay*** had to offer? While there's some recognizable names in the cast, none are exactly box office draws, much less Emma Mackey in the lead role. But the film's tone and premise (a political comedy-drama) aren't things that attract audiences to theaters. With an unappealing premise and low trailer buzz, there wasn't much to save this film. Maybe some positive reviews would've helped, but it looks like Brooks sadly couldn't bounce back after his two previous duds: the film is sitting at a horrible 22% on RT, making it his worst rated movie on the site. Pure yikes.\n\nAccording to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was female, and 59% was 45 and over. They gave it a poor \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore, a very poor sign for legs. Even with the holiday season, the film opened so damn low that theaters will drop it as soon as possible, especially with competition on its way. Whatever the case, ***Ella McCay*** is set to become Brooks' least attended film, probably finishing with less than $5 million domestically. But hey, at least Disney got a new ***Simpsons*** movie out of this, so perhaps it's a loss they're willing to take.\n\nUniversal re-released ***How the Grinch Stole Christmas*** for its 25th anniversary, and it earned $1.9 million in 2,250 theaters. That took its lifetime gross to $262.2 million.\n\nA24's ***Eternity*** dipped 35%, earning $1.7 million. The film's domestic total stands at $12.9 million.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was WB's re-release of Stanley Kubrick's ***The Shining***. It earned $1.56 million in 400 theaters, taking its lifetime gross to $47.1 million.\n\nFocus Features' ***Hamnet*** dipped 38%, adding $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $6.9 million so far.\n\nThere was another wide release. Cineverse's remake of ***Silent Night, Deadly Night*** made its way to 1,640 theaters, but it could muster just $1 million this weekend. One of the worst debuts at over 1,000 theaters. It might not last long in theaters.\n\nLionsgate also released Bryan Fuller's directorial debut ***Dust Bunny*** in 402 theaters, earning just $341,283 this weekend.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Zootopia 2*** has hit three milestones. It officially crossed the billion milestone, overtook the original's lifetime gross, and also overtook ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** to become the second highest grossing film of the year (just behind ***Ne Zha 2***). That's mainly thanks to a fantastic $131.1 million overseas this weekend, which took its worldwide gross to $1.137 billion after just 3 weeks. In China, the film officially passed ***Avengers: Endgame*** to become the most attended Hollywood title in the country, although the exchange rate is hurting a little bit.\n\nThe best markets are China ($502.4M), France ($36.4M), South Korea ($35M), Japan ($27.7M) and Mexico ($24.9M). Even though ***Avatar*** is coming up, ***Zootopia 2*** should continue holding well over the next few weeks.\n\n***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** collapsed 58%, earning $19.1 million overseas and taking its worldwide total to $173.6 million. The best markets are Mexico ($11.7M), the UK ($7M), Brazil ($5.2M), Spain ($4.6M) and Australia ($4.4M). Based on these numbers, it's clear it won't outgross the original's $291 million worldwide gross, but its low budget pretty much guarantees it's already profitable.\n\n***Wicked: For Good*** continues losing steam, earning just $7.7 million overseas for a $468.3 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($53.6M), Australia ($17.9M), Germany ($9M), Korea ($6.4M) and Mexico ($6.3M). With heavy competition killing its overseas prospects, look for this to finish with less than $550 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Black Phone 2* | Oct/17 | Universal | $27,332,040 | $77,378,880 | $132,039,863 | $30M\n*Sisu: Road to Revenge* | Nov/21 | Sony | $2,408,490 | $4,544,481 | $7,844,481 | $12.2M\n\n- Universal/Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2*** has closed with a pretty good $77 million domestically and $132 million worldwide. Given the very poor state of Blumhouse's 2025, this is a much needed win (and now ***Freddy's 2*** is keeping that streak), showing that audiences were mostly on board with an idea. Assuming they keep the budget low, Blumhouse might try to make a third version.\n\n- Sony's ***Sisu: Road to Revenge*** has closed with a poor $7.8 million worldwide, failing to recoup its budget. While the original was a surprise success, the sequel's numbers suggest that audiences were content with just one movie. \n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nA busy weekend, but only one winner.\n\nAnd that's James Cameron's ***Avatar: Fire and Ash***, the third installment in the franchise. Only 3 years after ***The Way of Water***, but the film will still offer (and pretty much deliver) spectacular visuals. Both ***Avatar*** films have cracked $2 billion worldwide, so ***Fire and Ash*** has some high standards to keep. But even if the opening weekend isn't anything impressive, the real story will be the legs on the incoming Christmas season.\n\nParamount is also releasing ***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants***, the third theatrical installment for the iconic character. The first two films were box office hits, with the latter earning almost twice as much despite the show long past its peak. But with Paramount sending a third film to Netflix, along with other spin-off films, it seems like the brand's name could take a dive in theatrical interest. But as it's the last animated option for families through the holidays, it should be a big attraction.\n\nLionsgate is releasing ***The Housemaid***, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried. It's based on a very popular novel, which bodes well for its prospects. Even if Sweeney has been the face of controversy and a string of box office duds for the past months, the novel's popularity should be enough to help it succeed.\n\nSearchlight is releasing Bradley Cooper's ***Is This Thing On?*** in limited release. It stars Will Arnett, Laura Dern, Bradley Cooper, Andra Day, Amy Sedaris, Sean Hayes, Christine Ebersole and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, and it's loosely based on the life of British comedian John Bishop. It will have a wide expansion later on, but with promising reviews (91% on RT, 74 on Metacritic), could we have a sleeper hit?\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
