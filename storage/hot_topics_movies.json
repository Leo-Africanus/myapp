        "content": "I consider the Star Trek reboot trilogy, especially Star Trek (2009) to be among the very best action movies made in this IP era. The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.",

I remember really liking \"Pet Detective\" and feeling let down by \"When Nature Calls\" because it failed to improve upon or at least be as good as it's predecessor.\n\nThe Miami and detective mystery setting of PD lends itself better to Ace Ventura. In PD, Ace Ventura is annoying and strange to everyone around him, but he gets away with it because he is actually a good detective\u200b. Also, Ace isn't as much of a bad ass in WNC. He can catch a bullet with his teeth, but he can't dodge a sphere? His character just seemed inconsistent in the sequel.\n\nDoes anyone agree? Disagree? Let me know!\n\nEdit: I do agree that WNC has a lot of great lines and some great scenes. It did get a few cackles from me. I guess I just prefer PD overall.",

        "title": "\"Manchester by the Sea\" is the perfect depiction of how depression kills even when the outcome isn't suicide. A lot of times, there is no escape from mental illness or grief.",
        "content": "I just watched this movie for the first time and I'm both in awe and absolutely devastated.\n\nI've seen a lot of comments from people asking \"What was the point of the movie? There was no progress or character growth\"...yet that was exactly the point of the movie. A lot of movies these days depict depression or mental illness as something that a character wakes up one day and snaps out of it. Movies treat mental illness as something that eventually has a complete resolution and that \"character growth\" is depicted as the character resolving their mental illness. But a lot of times, the reality is there is no escaping mental illness and there is no resolution. You're stuck. You \"can't beat it\".\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder, which is a long-term form of depression with highs and lows, life feels like you have a dark cloud hanging over your head endlessly and permanently. Lee's sunken eyes and spirit and the feeling of a man just waiting to die resonated very deeply with me and which is why this movie affected me to the core. Lee was in a state of psychological paralysis.\n\nThe harsh reality is that depression requires immense effort on behalf of the person to treat. I was in therapy for around 3-4 years and progress was very slow before things got better. Yet even now I don't think I'm cured but depression and mental illness didn't win. Before therapy, life felt exactly like Lee's in the movie. Were it not for therapy and a support system of family and friends, I might have ended things a while back.\n\nIn Lee's case, and in a lot of cases for so many people, depression and mental illness do win. They win even if the person doesn't resort to suicide. Suicide isn't the only depiction of mental illness winning. Lee was a dead-man walking. When Randi tells him \"you can't just die\"...she didn't mean literally. She meant Lee's soul was dying. And Affleck's acting nailed the \"dying on the inside\" reality for so many people. No ambition, no goals, nothing to look forward to, and lack of ability to commit to anything that requires any sort of emotional or mental effort on his part.\n\nI also understand the janitor job. It's a job that doesn't require any degree of investment yet at the same time I think the janitor job gives Lee a sense of helping other people when he himself couldn't help his own children. I don't think picking the janitor job was random. I think the janitor job perhaps made Lee somehow feel better about himself subconsciously because it involves a certain degree of fixing different issues people have inside their homes which could contrast the helplessness he felt not being able to save his children from the fire inside their home. It also gave Lee a sense of organization or routine, which a lot of depressed people need to feel somewhat in control.\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to what many people say, Lee did show character growth and progress. Lee saying that he wants to get a house with an extra room for Patrick to visit is growth. Lee at first somewhat considering accepting guardianship and then seeking out better guardianship for Patrick shows growth and responsibility. Lee taking care of his brother's funeral processions, quitting his old job to be with Patrick, attempting to look for a new job in Manchester before deciding to move back to Boston are all signs of growth. But the reality is that growth with mental illness is very slow that is almost seems non-existent.\n\nNot to mention, the hope his nephew gave him for a better and more hopeful life mirrors my own experience with how my own nieces bring hope into my world despite everything and reminds me of lyrics by Sufjan Stevens: \u201cMy brother had a daughter, The beauty that she brings, illumination\u201d\u2026Nephews and nieces are a blessing to our world and what we carry from our siblings after they\u2019re gone.\n\nIn Lee's situation, continuing to exist is the most beautiful and commendable form of resistance. \n\nWhat a beautiful masterpiece. Easily one of my favourite moves of all time.",

I'm not sure if it's just how times have changed for horror in the last decade but I was dumbfounded at how bad I considered most of the movie to be. The funniest part to me is they harp on the two paranormal investigators showing people all this supernatural spooky shit (legit exorcisms in grainy cam 4K somehow) but always adding \"Normally, there's a reasonable explanation for things and it's not ghosts or anything.\" Then, they get to the family house and immediately are like \"Yeah, it's ghosts.\" without a single ounce of investigating otherwise. It wasn't all bad with a couple of decently paced scenes but overall, super messy with jarring choices. Any other films you felt like this with?",

Their mission sparks a chaotic road trip filled with car chases, deadpan humor, and legendary soul and blues performances.",

I'm sure we'll still get glimpses of his old stunt crazed Ethan Hunt persona in Top Gun 3 or the rumored Days of Thunder sequels if or when they finally move forward but I wouldn't mind seeing a return of the Tom Cruise from Last Samurai, Tropic Thunder or Mangolia. The dumb action stuff is great but I think everyone wants to see him do something different and fresh. ",

Along the way, he gets trained by a completely unhinged coach who also happens to be a former legend of the sport, faces off against an over the top, arrogant villain, and falls for a love interest who initially works for or sides with the antagonist. To top it all off, the mentor dies unexpectedly right before the climax, emotionally pushing the protagonist to finally win. Different sports and different jokes, sure  but the story skeleton is almost identical, and now I can\u2019t unsee it.\n\nBoth great movies btw",

It could\u2019ve been a powerful story about perspective and identity as a man literally learns to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes. However, there is one pretty big detail about this movie I have neglected to mention:\n\n\nIt\u2019s an Adam Sandler comedy.\n\n\n I\u2019m not saying Sandler is a bad actor or unable of delivering an amazing lead performance in a drama (*Uncut Gems* debunks that entirely*) but I can\u2019t help but feel like this movie would\u2019ve been way better off if it had a lead actor behind it way more focused on taking the story seriously and making some richer out of the key conflict.",
