Thompson. \n\n\"The film follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio del Toro) as they embark on a drug-fueled road trip to Las Vegas. The story explores themes of the American Dream, the failure of the 1960s counterculture, and the chaotic nature of their drug-induced experiences.\"",

It always feels like someone is watching you or following you. \n\nIt\u2019s a film set in NYC but it\u2019s an Italian production. I love when foreign films are set in the states. They\u2019re always so bizarre. But it\u2019s interesting to see what foreign studios do with their films set in the states. I imagine it is how foreign countries view Hollywood productions set in their countries. \n\nThe actor they cast to play the murderer was genuinely creepy. ",

        "content": "It was a realistic and true ending, especially in the\n80s teen sex comedy genre. \n\nAwkward guy has an attractive friend who screws over girl. Awkward guy likes girl. Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

I\u2019ve already seen *The Conjuring*, *Insidious*, *Hereditary*, and *The Exorcist*. I\u2019d love to hear about some underrated, international, or truly scary movies that gave you chills. Any suggestions are welcome!\n\nAlso, if you recommend a movie, it would be awesome if you can give a short explanation about why you liked it or what makes it scary. That would really help me decide which one to watch first. Thanks!",

It was just that that kept me watching and entertained. Kudos to Rip Torn who definitely brought the needed cachet to the role and movie! I acknowledge Kirsten Dunst &amp; Jason Schwartzman for giving it a good try!  I did appreciate the throw in of the modern sound track in selected scenes. I certainly ended up feeling the need to Google the life &amp; times of Louie &amp; Marie at Versailles to compare with any hint of historical accuracy which was apparently slight. But hey overall the costumes, cinematography and my love for the splendor of Versailles kept my attention and was entertaining for a Saturday night movie and a bottle of Pinot Noir! \ud83c\udf77 Cheers!",
