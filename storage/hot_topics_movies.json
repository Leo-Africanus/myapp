        "title": "The Gamble New Line Cinema made making the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy was INSANE",
        "content": "Imagine being New Line founder &amp; head honcho Bob Shaye. It\u2019s circa 1998 &amp; you\u2019ve just been shown a presentation by a kiwi filmmaker most people have never heard of it. You\u2019re shown costumes, weapons, cgi tests, miniatures, all funded by a rival studio that decided it can\u2019t make this project because it\u2019s just too expensive. So said Rival studio boss has given kiwi filmmaker a chance to pitch the project elsewhere. Every studio in town has turned the pitch down since there are some very large strings attached. Rival studio boss must be reimbursed for the millions in spent development costs, he must be given a % of the box office and you only have a 24 hours to decide. You were kiwi film makers last stop before heading back to New Zealand in defeat.\n\nThe kiwi filmmaker is pitching you a two film adaptation of perhaps the most well known book trilogies in existence. Your film company needs a hit, badly. After the presentation everyone looks to you for a reaction. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d you say. You see the faces of kiwi filmmaker and his team go white with dread before adding \u201cit\u2019s 3 books? It should be 3 movies\u201d. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the start of one or the biggest most insane gambles in Hollywood history. The price tag? 270 million. That number will go up before all is said and done. \n\n\nJust think about it for a minute. New Line funded the production of 3 films shot back to back in a tiny country halfway around the world, by a director whose never had a hit movie, using unproven technology, with no A List star and if none of it works, the movie doesn\u2019t succeed? You might lose your company. \n\nThe production goes way over budget, loses a main actor after a few days of filming, New Line is constantly trying to mitigate its risk by cutting the runtime down, selling foreign distribution rights(boy will they come to regret that) \n\nThe press is all over New Line. \u201cThis is insane\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fail\u201d. \u201cWhat are they going to do when it does fail\u201d etc. But then\u2026\n\n\n\nMay 2001 hits. Newline decides to preview 20 minutes of the first movie at the Cannes film festival. This is where everything changed. The public and press got its first real look at the film and the response is better than anyone could hope. New Line loosens up. Gives more money to finish the movie. There some actual buzz &amp; hype now. \n\nBut then 2 things happen. \n\n\nOne is another highly anticipated book adaptation is coming out a month prior. Basically the hottest property on the planet not named Star Wars or Pokemon. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d. And when it does come out? It has the biggest opening weekend of all time. \n\nThe other thing? Tragedy. 9/11. Do audiences even want to see a movie about wars and elves and hobbits? Will anyone care? \n\nBoy did they ever. December 2001 the gamble pays off. Whats more? They get 13! Academy Award nominations. It\u2019s now officially a phenomenon.\n \nAnd you\u2019ve got 2 more movies to release. Each more successful than the last, an unheard or rarity for sequels of that era.",

I think fire was involved (im not 100% sure tho)\n\n\\- The toys were going to atack the main characters.\n\n\\- It was either an action, or a horror.\n\n\\- May have been a series as it may have ended on a cliff-hanger (for the next episode) or there was an ad break idk.\n\n  \nI would really want to rewatch this.\n\n",

That makes the ending even more creepy cuz Joe took bills soul but his daughter didn't even make sure to look for her father's body. And I know she knew she was dead cuz she said to the guy who was Joe \"I wish you could have known my father\"\n\nIt's so messed up to know your father is dead and to not make sure his body is properly taken care of, instead she just goes back to the party ",

        "title": "The Secret Of NIMH is probably the single greatest American work of animation",
        "content": "It's America's answer to Hayao Miyazaki, and I personally prefer it to Miyazaki. I grew up as an anime kid with a strong bias against anything Disney, and it was partially because of movies like this that surpass anything they've ever made tenfold. It blows my mind that Don, (in my opinion) would never again create a work of cinema anywhere near as compelling as The  Secret Of NIMH. I can't think of an other animated movie like it. I consider it to be the greatest children's movie ever made.\n\nThe sheer depth of the characters and their relationships, colors, situations, the densely layered and imagined environments the characters live in. The theme music. Back plot and narrative of events we never see that unfolded just before the start of the movie, and connect with the events during the course of the movie. The dark and violent scenes meant to show children the ugliness of blind greed. The mystery element of the necklace, and especially the animation. There's no doubt these are the most expressive and human feeling animal characters ever in a film. I have no idea how they were able to animate them that way. Amazing to see these mice and rats move, speak and behave exactly like human beings. All of the characters are deeply thought out, and balance perfectly against one another. The movie, among many other things, is an allegory of how corrupted, powerhungry people hold down the struggling and the poor. Sure, familiar tale, especially in animation, but it's done so flawlessly in this movie. I feel terrible for any fan of animation who has never seen this. You MUST watch it. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and I feel so lucky that I got to experience it as a child. I remember it moved me to tears even then. I can't believe this is the same guy who made stinkers like Titan AE and A Troll In Central Park. Very sad",

        "content": "I've seen interviews with the director Srdjan Spasojevi\u0107 who defends himself by saying the entire movie was a commentary on the effects of the Yugoslav wars. I don't buy it, I think he makes a mockery of it to be honest, and I think he went out of his way to just create one of the most disgusting horrible films that has ever been made.\n\nThere's no deeper theme to the movie, he literally just conjured up in his sick little mind whatever the most fucked up thing he could think of.\n\nHowever i'm open to people disagreeing, I know it has love in the disturbing movies community, although even there i've seen hatred for it.",

We would've had a three-legged anklyosaurus and instead of what I assume was an oversized rauisuchian, it was going to be a triceratops which would had been better to showcase herbivores aren't always peaceful and can be aggressive, the idea the triceratops would've been like a territorial hippo or wild boar.\n\nFinally we had a threatical dinosaur film that wasn't another Jurassic sequel and I loved the concept and idea of ancient astronauts landing on earth during the dinosaur age trying to survive. It should've been so much more.\n\nI'm hoping Primitive War which is releasing this year makes up for it. Hear that one is suppose to be r-rated and so far promising since it gives me Apocalypse Now, Kong: Skull Island and The Lost World vibes.",

There are so many amazing actors who disappear in roles, thanks to not only their own talent, but also the number of people behind them who assist with various aspects necessary to create the character\u2026it\u2019s one of my favorite things about movies - how many people come together to create art that is totally unique even when the \u201cmaterials used\u201d to create it are the same. \n\nWhat other movie combos should I watch that will break my brain that the same actor plays a role in each?

I am ready to change it up a bit, but am having a bit of choice paralysis. I am looking for something either super scary, very suspenseful, or so heartwarming I'll be crying tears of joy instead. Something that is incredibly engaging and will rope me in. Preferably, stay away from heart wrenchingly sad movies (although those do have a place in my grieving process, not tonight :)).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: So many people with amazing suggestions! I\u2019ve saved this post so I can come back and refer to it many times. I will slowly work my way through this list, thank you so much you kind souls!",

        "content": "Question, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?\n\nI've been on a binge of watching George C. Scott movies &amp; show and I must say, George C. Scott really is a great actor. He has such a commanding presence when he is on screen, but he also manages to give such a vulnerable side to what character he plays. To me his best roles are Dr. Strangelove &amp; Patton. Dr. Strangelove, for the sheer fact that he (&amp; Also Slim Pickens) managed to outplay Peter Sellers and Patton, which is just a great performance and I consider it the best role he has ever played. He also deliver great performances in Anatomy Of A Muder, The Hustler, The Bible, The Hospital, Hardcore, The Changeling, A Christmas Carol.\n\nI will say though, while George C. Scott is a great actor, some of the films he is in are probably not so great, which is why I think his film career stalled after the 70s, with films like The Last Run, Rage, The Day Of The Dolphin, Bank Shot, The Savage Is Loose, Island In The Streams, &amp; The Formula being very mid, but saved by Scott. I also read that Scott turned down lead roles in In The Heat Of The Night, McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller, The Cowboys, The Godfather, Deliverance, Network, The Shootist.\n\nHowever, what impresses me with Scott is that he managed to juggle both his film career and television career, which was a little frowned upon when trying to make a successful film career.\n\nBut all in all, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?",

We need more people of his talent to be willing to make movies that aren\u2019t wildly ambitious and 2 1/2 hours long.
