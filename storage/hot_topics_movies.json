        "content": "Is *LA Confidential* a love letter to Hollywood's Golden Era and the film noir genre?  Probably according to somebody.  Lots of movies have been called love letters and it's been discussed in that capacity here in this subreddit many times over the years.  But it raises other questions.  If there are love letters, are there booty calls?  Pickup lines?  I'm not even being satirical, really, since there's an element inherent in the idea of a love letter that is over the top and maybe a little much.  Meaning maybe the booty call is all people really need sometimes? Maybe? Like I'd say that if *Tombstone* was a love letter, then maybe *Desperado* was a booty call.\n\nI feel like I'm stepping on the conversation, but the sub requires a body of text.",

        "title": "What movie is just too long?",
        "content": "What\u2019s a movie that isn\u2019t all means good, but just could cut 20-30 mins out either with a couple senseless scenes or 30-60 seconds from a bunch of scenes. Of course long movies can be good, but it can also act as a roadblock. The first two that come to mind for me are Knocked Up and American Pie. Really I think comedies should never exceed 2 hours, you need stamina for a comedy. \n\nKnocked up (133 min) is by all means a good movie. It has a killer cast and tells a story that is engaging but when I catch it front to back, it is an arduous watch. It becomes a chore. It is one of those movies where there are 15 scenes to take a couple minutes out of. I am a big fan of apatow but cmon, bring us 90 min comedies! \n\nAmerican Pie is another one that some of the scenes just hang on just too long. It\u2019s obviously not a movie with a ton of substance but there\u2019s ten mins tha can come off of this a min or two at a time. ",

They are dipicting the same scene that Sinbad and Arnold do at the end. I have no idea how I didn\u2019t realize that  before\u2026 made me think of if there were any other movies like that. Does anyone know of any other movies like that OR did you not also realize that about the beginning scene in JATW??",

        "content": "Hi everyone, as mentioned in the caption, I am a big fan of animation in general. I find that it is a very flexible and powerful medium to convey emotions. The animation style in itself is a character/story element and I'l always on the lookout for animated movies.\n\nThey can be old, in your own language (as long as I can find them subtitled), or newer. I'm always happy to reminisce about more mainstream animated movies by Studio Ghibli, Pixar, Dreamworks ot Disney but I'm mainly hoping to discover movies I haven't seen or haven't even heard about. Looking forward to your answers :)",

But beyond Cameron, James Horner brought life to Honey I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Apollo 13, The Pagemaster, Braveheart, he wrote Sarah's song in Hocus Pocus, Casper, Jumanji... This man made the music of our childhoods.\n\nGood for him that he died doing what he loved (flying planes) but dammit... Miss hearing you in the movies, James.",

        "content": "Caddo Lake is a good movie with superb cinematography. The swamp lands is simply breathtaking. It's every photographer's dream spot for pictures. The movie itself reminded me so much of the Netflix series \"Dark\".\n\nThere are 2 things that at first I did not quite get. But at the end I got it.\n\n1. Why did Celeste said that Paris abandoned his family and ran away with another woman and that she met that woman and had a confrontation with that woman. Then I realized that that woman that she was talking about is actually her daughter, Ellie (when Ellie took the necklace from her truck, and asked Celeste where she got it from).\n2. What cut the alligator into half? I realized in the end that it what when the time warp closed (at certain time) that the alligator must be swimming half way through it.\n\nThis movie makes you think. And I love that.\n\nIs there anything that you don't really get in that movie. Let's discuss.",
