        "content": "*Bob is a washed-up revolutionary who lives in a state of stoned paranoia, surviving off-grid with his spirited and self-reliant daughter, Willa. When his evil nemesis resurfaces and Willa goes missing, the former radical scrambles to find her as both father and daughter battle the consequences of their pasts.*\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti, Regina Hall\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [98%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_battle_after_another)\n\n**Metacritic:**  [99 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/one-battle-after-another/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[HighOnFilms - Liam Gaughan](https://www.highonfilms.com/one-battle-after-another-2025-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a hyperkinetic thrill ride that surprisingly never loses momentum throughout its nearly three-hour running time, yet never feels weighed down by its scope. The action has the same eye-popping practicality of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d or \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d with the charm that none of its characters are particularly skilled. DiCaprio often appears as a bumbling hero in the vein of Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, even if he shows a capacity for delivering snarky one-liners not seen since his work in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250917-one-battle-after-another-review) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Salman Rushdie, reviewing Pynchon's Vineland 35 years ago, called it \"a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself.\" And at a Q&amp;A with Anderson several weeks ago, Steven Spielberg praised the film as \"increasingly more relevant than perhaps even when you finished the screenplay\". American society, in all its strengths and missteps, has been a major theme for both Pynchon and Anderson, and it grounds Anderson's dazzler of a film, giving it an emphatic, unmistakable political charge.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/one-battle-after-another/) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Ambitious, urgent and personal storytelling from Paul Thomas Anderson, blending many different genres to create an engaging and vital new masterwork. Relentless pacing, strong performances, technical and visual excellence, with multi-layered depth and inspiring relevance to bring about change for our overwhelmingly dark times.\n\n[IGN - Michael Calabro](https://www.ign.com/articles/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-pta?utm_source=threads,twitter) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Even the things PTA whole-cloth invented for the film, like the harmony transponders, Bob forgetting the code words, the Christopher Reeve Superman poster in Sensei Sergio\u2019s dojo, semen demon, the car chases, the stunt fall off a building down a tree\u2026 There are so many little details, seemingly inconsequential touches \u2013 the filmmaker\u2019s style, if you will \u2013 that all add up bit by bit to turn this amazing movie into a masterpiece.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1235151707/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Anderson concedes that he\u2019s no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-andersons-thrillingly-helter-skelter-counter-culture-caper) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen \u2013 an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream? Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-2025) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s also, crucially, a deeply humanist movie. Anderson cares about these characters deeply. Bob\u2019s frustration becomes our own, as does his concern for Willa. So many \u201cfilms of our moment\u201d have felt angry or cynical, but Anderson\u2019s movie transcends that by being human and even offering optimism. It\u2019s not one loss after another. It\u2019s one battle. Keep fighting.\n\n[The Playlist - Rodrigo Perez](https://theplaylist.net/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-declares-war-in-thrilling-comical-moving-take-on-revolution-personal-evolutions-20250917/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;From one generation to the next, the struggle endures. Fierce and unrelenting, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d burns as both an incendiary action epic and a tender family drama, alive with humor, conviction, and revolutionary spirit. And amid all its pandemonium, Sergio\u2019s reminder that \u201cfreedom is no fear\u201d lingers as the film\u2019s quiet truth, a mantra passed down like a torch. Few films this year feel so vital, so breathtaking in scope and soul. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n, indeed.\n\n[London Evening Standard - Nick Howells](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-leonardo-dicaprio-teyana-taylor-b1247490.html) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;What Anderson has turned out is something of a cinephile\u2019s visual symphony. If there were Proms devoted to films instead of music in the future, One Battle After Another would be one of the first movies to join the repertoire. And yes, Oscars must be coming...\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/09/17/one-battle-after-another-thriller-leonardo-dicaprio/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Eyes shielded by Terminator shades, tatty dressing gown flapping in the breeze, Leonardo DiCaprio tumbles through One Battle After Another looking like he\u2019s fighting several conflicts simultaneously, on physical and mental fronts...This madcap urban warfare thriller has heists, showdowns and two of the best car chases in years.",

I am making this post because I think sometimes some people can forget the power of movies.\n\nI just finished a rewatch of Tim Burton's Big Fish after maybe 15 years, which without ruining is essentially a father/son themed film. In the film, Will is estranged from his father for 3 years, and then they get closer as the story goes on. I, myself, have been estranged from my father for a similar stretch of time. As the final scene comes to a close, as the movie transitions to the credits, my phone lights up. It's my father. He hasn't called me in years. Before I could answer, the call disconnects. I stare at my phone for 5 minutes trying to comprehend the situation and I call him back. ...It goes to voicemail.\n\nI can't help but think at the moment the film ended there was a strong cosmic push, an inkling, for my father to pick up the phone and reach out but he quickly ended the call. No happy ending here, but still.....very eerie. The timing couldn't have been spookier. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Movies are magic.",

But i'lll be damned if [if the dude straight up flipped a switch](https://youtu.be/u2YbMUcdElc) in his character's personality that is pretty rare in movies these days. He was just chilling by himself in a cafe, eating some pie, minding his own business, and all of a sudden that random dude cramps up in his space, pissing him off and causing a switch to flip, revealing his character's true, extremely dangerous  personality. Top-notch, in my opinion.",

        "content": "*Through a surprising twist of fate, single strangers Sarah and David get to relive important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present.*\n\nDirector: Kogonada\n\nCast: Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [55%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_big_bold_beautiful_journey)\n\n**Metacritic:** [39/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-b2827639.html) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;Kogonada neither wrote nor edited A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, and so we\u2019re largely lacking in the sophistication department, or the soft musicality he\u2019s been able to construct in his earlier films.\n\n[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/a-big-beautiful-journey-review) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;Is *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* a piece of wannabe creativity with a yawning hollowness at its center, or an A-list romance with some welcome aesthetic sensitivity? Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-and-colin-farrell-play-the-game-of-love) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;This film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well \u2026 or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge\u2019s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no. The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.\n\n[Variety - Tomris Laffly](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-1236520085/)\n\n&gt;The film\u2019s tonal inconsistencies hurt its impossibly talented co-leads considerably. Most of the time, both Farrell and Robbie seem detached and surprisingly cold when they are supposed to be embracing intimate, vulnerable feelings audiences know they\u2019re more than capable of projecting.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-kogonada-1235151392/) \\- 'D+'\n\n&gt;\u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey\u201d is miscalculated as a romance and a fantasy, and while I\u2019m loath to blame a craftsman as intelligent as Kogonada entirely for the outcome, he did, after all, agree to direct this lousy script. A big, bold, beautiful bore indeed.",
