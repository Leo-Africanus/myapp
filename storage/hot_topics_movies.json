They look different, the physicality is different, and their delivery is completely different. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Benedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor, but I just don\u2019t think he should play Khan. The fact that they were playing coy in who Cumberbatch was playing in the marketing didn\u2019t help, it just makes me feel like they picked someone the complete opposite of Montalban just so they could do an underwhelming \u201ctwist\u201d reveal.

        "content": "Recently watched this documentary about the 2018 Texas Boys State, an annual event where hundreds of young men from around the state of Texas come together to build a representative government from the ground up. This documentary is incredible. It weaves narrative threads that follow multiple characters, who are REAL teenage boys with their own ideas of how to play the game of politics, and it's fascinating seeing how they engage with one another on a human level but also as \"politicians\". In one scene they're joking around trying to pass a bill that relocates Prius drivers to another state, the next they're debating gun control and abortion. Running throughout this entire movie is this undercurrent of dread. You get an authentic, cringe-worthy, and sometimes unsettling close-up of the American youth Post-MAGA. The choice to set this in a red state like Texas really helps the movie investigate Gen Z's slow but steady shift to the far right. Highly recommend this gem. Really engrossing movie, frustrating at times but very insightful.",

        "content": "I think Hollywood didn't use her properly. She had a perfect knack for comedy which was rarely taken advantage of, she would have shined as a Jean Harlow type in the Golden age of Hollywood. \n\nShe was fantastic in Something Wild, Working Girl and I also liked her in Night Moves. She was the best thing about the abysmal Two Much, she was good in The Bonfire of the Vanities. I don't really know what else she could have done as she did what was asked for. \n\nShe could do drama as well and did accomplished work in two underrated movies, Paradise and Another Day in Paradise. She tried hard but was painfully miscast in Sidney Lumet's A Stranger Among Us. I'm in the minority, I liked her work in Lolita, though she was too beautiful for the part of a frumpy, sex-starved woman. \n\nBut my absolute favorite performance from her was as Honey Withlock in Cecil B. Demented. She was hilarious in it.",

But everyone is saying that it could've done better if the marketing had been different. A lot of reviews from people said that it was marketed as one thing and turned out to be something different. \n\nThe movie was marketed as a rom com. But it turned out to be mostly romance drama. People who know Celine Song from Past Lives would know that she is a deeper writer than what it was being marketed as. Someone said that the marketing made people who would not like the movie interested in it and people who would like it disinterested.\n\nHave there been any other cases where a movie could not reach its potential at the box office, just because of misguided marketing which affected the reviews?",

        "content": "https://www.cracked.com/article_46062_christopher-walken-has-been-secretly-playing-bugs-bunny-in-a-bunch-of-his-movies.html\n\n&gt;\u201c(Walken) said that Bugs Bunny is one of his favorite actors ever,\u201d Stiller revealed. \u201cAnd he was saying this kind of with a twinkle in his eye, but not really. And he said, \u2018A lot of times I\u2019ve played roles as if I was Bugs Bunny, but nobody knew.\u2019 Now, which character, which movie, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Back in a 2001 profile for The Washington Post, Walken surprised his interviewer with his love of the cartoon rabbit, again citing Bugs as a major influence on his artistry. \u201cHe\u2019s so smart, he\u2019s so funny, he\u2019s got such a great attitude. Bugs Bunny is the spirit of New York,\u201d Walken proclaimed of his idol. \u201cYou can\u2019t fool Bugs Bunny. That\u2019s all I have to say. He\u2019s on to everybody.\u201d\n\nI couldn't make sense of this until the second quote about Bugs Bunny being on top of everyone's tricks and suddenly a LOT of Walken's character work makes sense. He's always managed to portray that sense of perception in his characters.\n\nI'm curious if any of his characters immediately leap out at you as inspired by Bugs Bunny, now that you know this. I can see that devious energy in almost all his characters, but nothing more Bugs Bunny-ish than that.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed something with a lot of people, especially friends. Right after a movie ends, they feel the need to immediately have an opinion. They\u2019ll say the acting was bad, or the pacing was off, or the script didn\u2019t make sense. Those can be valid points, but most of the time it just feels like they\u2019re grasping for something to say because not knowing what to think would make them feel dumb.\n\nBut that quick judgment cuts off something important. It makes it harder to engage with the movie from a subjective, open place. Some films take time. Some don\u2019t fully hit you until later. Some you don\u2019t understand until you\u2019ve changed a little. Rushing to define them too quickly flattens the whole experience.\n\nI try to give movies space, and honestly I end up enjoying a lot of them more because of that. But my friends tease me for it. They say I like everything or that I\u2019m trying too hard to find meaning. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. I just think if a bunch of people love a movie, even if I didn\u2019t connect with it right away, there\u2019s probably something there worth looking for.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? Do you ever feel like people are more interested in proving they\u2019re smart than actually engaging with what the film is doing?",
