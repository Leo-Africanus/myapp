The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin\u2019s parents. \n\nIt begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin\u2019s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films? ",

These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):\n\n&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first \u201cMoana,\u201d at its best, transcended.\n\n[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.\n\n[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. \n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but \u201cMoana 2\u201d is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, much like \"Frozen II,\" \"The Incredibles 2,\" and \"Toy Story 4,\" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):\n\n&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There\u2019s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.\n\n[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):\n\n&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):\n\n&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here\u2019s a second movie that\u2019s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. If not, well: It\u2019s one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):\n\n&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn\u2019t feel richer or more exciting.\n\n[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): \n\n&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it\u2019s necessary to write 'there\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):\n\n&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :\n\n&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n&gt;\u201cMoana 2\u201d reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she\u2019s ever faced.\n\n**Staring**:\n\n* Auli'i Cravalho as Moana\n* Dwayne Johnson as Maui\n* Alan Tudyk as Heihei\n* Temuera Morrison as Chief Tui\n* Nicole Scherzinger as Sina\n* Rose Matafeo as Loto\n* David Fane as Kele\n* Hual\u0101lai Chung as Moni\n* Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda as Simea\n* Awhimai Fraser as Matangi\n* Gerald Ramsey as Tautai Vasa\n\nDirected by: David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nWritten by: Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nProduced by: Christina Chen and Yvett Merino\n\nEdited by: Jake Roberts\n\nMusic by: Mark Mancina (score and songs), Opetaia Foa\u02bbi (score and songs), Abigail Barlow (songs), Emily Bear (songs)\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes",

        "title": "Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films",
        "content": "When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like \"Title 2\", \"Title II\", \"Title Part 2\", \"Title: The Revenge\", \"Tit2e\", etc.\n\nThis can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.\n\nSometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.\n\nSo what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",

He must know that by the end he's either Angier #100+ or Angier #2, which I think is why he breaks down about sacrifice, not the 100+ murders. He knows the original is long dead.\n\n(Before you get started, I'm *sure* people picked up on this but I did some googling after a recent viewing and I never saw anyone spell it out directly.)",

In television there's a scene in Workaholics where Anders is wearing a Paddy's Pub shirt and even Good Girls and Superstore are connected through Cloud 9. \n\nNowadays there's the MCU, DCU or the Monsterverse connecting movies together but before all that, were there any movies or tv shows that got connected because of a character or maybe even a location?",

Its only this year I've really payed attention to its message and how it never lost its relevance. The message on the TV at the start says   \"the poor and the underclass are growing. Racial justice and human rights are non existent. They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices, their intention to rule with the annihilation of the consciousness. We have been lulled into a trance. They have made us indifferent to ourselves,to others. We are focused only on our own gain. They want to keep us asleep, keep us selfish and keep us sedated\"\n\nHow did it take over 30 years for me to see the obvious parallels to real life?",

So I thought. \n\nI recently found out who my biological father is. It's very complicated and in the weeds, but we met a few times when I was a kid. He seemed really nice and I really liked him. I barely understood he was my real dad, but something deep within me felt safe and okay around him, like an intution. Due to my mother and a whole mess I never got to see him since I was 6. \n\nBut those few moments I had were hard to describe. It's hard to describe the emotion that come with a father you have a few moments with. A father you love and resonate with but remain obstructed and seperated from. The few moments where you feel peace and love that's paternal and true, and good. It was just a few moments that I never had the words for but Aftersun captured it perfectly.",

Like say if a movie like whiplash got a sequel with a brand new director, would you watch it? Or would you watch it if it had the same director as the first one?\n\n(Yes I know all sequels are motivated by studio greed but there are cases where a director genuinely wants to make a sequel)\n",
