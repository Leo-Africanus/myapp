The original cut was soooo good - everything was *just right* but in the DC they overexplain everything and kill the pacing of the movie somehow.\n\nOn another note, the Justice League 2017 sucked so bad it should have never been made, but ZSJL's stretched 4h+ runtime was just *okay*. Like, it's wayyy better than JL, but still not great. The story was so drawn out, and the slo-mo in every scene was just so uninteresting/uninspired (sesame seed falling from the trucker's burger, Lois putting down her coffee cup). As one reviewer put it, \"You could cut an hour without affecting the plot even a little.\" Also, why format a film for IMAX full knowing it would be released on the HBO streaming service. (Disclaimer: not hating on ZS, it's just my opinion)",

        "content": "Years ago when Imagine Dragons was at its peak of their popularity, everybody was using their songs in commercials and trailers (e.g. Friction for Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Warriors for Wonder Woman). But for some reason, someone thought that using Believer in the trailer Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was a good idea for a period piece mystery film, set in the 1930s.\n\nAnd that song did not work in the trailer at all. It was way too modern for a film set in the '30s and it was a weird song choice as well too for that trailer. That was definitely a weird moment during that period, before we even had slowed down songs in movie trailers.\n\nI give a special shout-out to Suicide Squad (2016) using Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody too and that was because the trailer was such a huge hit, WB hired the company that edited the trailer, to re-edit the movie as well. And it certainly didn't help the movie's quality at all lol.",

Mitch is afraid of death and Ed is worried about having kids, but Phil\u2019s entire life has now been destroyed, which wasn\u2019t doing so good anyway. His miserable marriage has finally ended, he\u2019s lost his job, and knows his ex is gonna take him for everything he\u2019s got. Including his kids. So he\u2019s the one who steps up and defends the group from the drunk cowboys. A final breaking point then has an emotional breakdown. Knowing it\u2019s probably not gonna get better. And from the not as good sequel it doesn\u2019t. But he continues on anyway. It hit me since I myself am going through a similar situation. A rough divorce, custody battle, loss of a job. It\u2019s like everything happens at once. So maybe I\u2019m just identifying with him lately. ",

Something visually striking, and full of symbolism and themes.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: I\u2019m a high school English teacher, and I\u2019d love to use it in class with my honors-level seniors. So while I\u2019m looking for something thought-provoking and a bit edgy, it still needs to be school-appropriate: no nudity or sexually explicit content. Rated R is okay if it does not have nudity/sexually explicit content. It should also be a film that would interest teens. \n\nFor context, we started the semester by analyzing the Black Mirror episode \u201cNosedive,\u201d and I\u2019d like to end the term with another piece of media that invites strong discussion and analysis.\n\nAny recommendations for films that strike that balance between artistry, symbolism, and classroom-appropriateness?",

By the end, Cooper and company have crafted a winning dramedy that has elements of what makes any good rom com work. Wrapping up NYFF on a pleasant if unspectacular note, it\u2019s destined to be a very easy watch for folks, once it comes out later on this year.\n\n[Vulture - Alisson Wilmore](https://www.vulture.com/article/is-this-thing-on-review-bradley-cooper-made-a-crowd-pleaser.html)\n\n&gt;We\u2019ve seen Arnett play variations on his character before, sardonic and self-deprecating. It\u2019s Dern who\u2019s the revelation as a woman who truly doesn\u2019t know what she wants, and who is figuring it out in real time in a way that\u2019s a delight to watch.",
