        "content": "I'm watching Crimson Tide right now on Hollywood Suite and having a blast. Got me thinking about the best Naval movies of all time, which unfortunately there aren't really \\*that\\* many of unless you include Titanic or something\n\nWhat's your favorite Naval movie of all time? And why in the damn hell has there not been a Master &amp; Commander sequel (money and so hard to film with water, I know) or a proper Blackbeard or great real-world Pirate movie been made??\n\nAnyways, My list:\n\n1: Master &amp; Commander\n\n2: Das Boot\n\n3: Hunt for Red October\n\n4: Pirates of the Caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl\n\n5: The Bounty\n\nHM's: U-571, Crimson Tide, Dead Man's Chest/At World's End\n\n(edit 1: Greyhound was dope as hell but way too short)\n\n(edit 2: Down Periscope totally missed my brain, it's the #1 Naval Comedy hands down unless you also count Top Gun)\n\n(edit 3: Best recommendation I've never heard of by far is ***The Final Countdown*** starring Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen ; \" a 1980 American\u00a0[science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film)\u00a0[war film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film)\u00a0about a modern, nuclear-powered\u00a0[aircraft carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier)\u00a0that travels through time to the day before the December 7, 1941,\u00a0[attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor)...The film was produced with the cooperation of the\u00a0[United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy)'s\u00a0[naval aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_aviation)\u00a0branch and the\u00a0[United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense).\")\n\n(edit 4: Finally because I didn't see any love for The Bounty; WATCH THIS MOVIE! EXCELLENT movie starring Anthony Hopkins/Daniel Day-Lewis/Mel Gibson/Liam Neeson/Bernard Hill/Dexter Fletcher and one of the most famous and important Naval journeys/stories of all time)\n\n  \n(edit 5: Finally Finally, I totally forgot about The Terror, a very good series (with some slight mystical elements) about the doomed Franklin expedition in the Canadian North to try to find the Northwest Passage. It's a whopper)\n\nWhat am I missing??.",

        "content": "I would be ecstatic if we got a true sequel to The Craft with the OG cast back together. They could totally make it work. Even a Cobra Kai type of series would be a hit considering how popular Charmed was. \n\nEvery time I re-watch The Craft, I'm blown away by how phenomenal Fairuza Balk is. Nancy isn't your conventional villain, you do feel for her and I still think Nancy was corrupted by Manon and became a monster through the possession. \n\nThe cast was amazing, the chemistry between the 4 girls made their friendship so convincing that I really wanted them to make amends by the end and work things out. \n\nA sequel would be cool with Sarah turning bad when life goes awry for her and she goes in full self-destructive mode while destroying everything around her. A reformed Nancy with Bonnie and Rochelle decide to reunite and save Sarah.",

        "content": "I was randomly thinking about Inception today and am 99% confident the entire movie is a dream. While different actors, the clothing worn by his children in both the flashback and the end of the movie are nearly identical in addition to their location in the backyard. The girl is wearing a pink dress in the flashback and subsequently is wearing a pink dress over a white t-shirt. Similarly the boy is wearing a plaid shirt with shorts in both scenes. After not seeing his kids for \\~2 years, the chance that his kids are wearing nearly the same outfit and are in the same location in the backyard is nearly impossible.\n\nWith most directors I think you can let this slide, but Chris Nolan is particular about every detail of his movies. This was an intentional choice that is unlikely to happen in reality.\n\nPs. I think the totem was always a red herring and constructed to give the dreamer the outcome they want.",

I watched The Lone Ranger (2013) which was directed by Gore Verbinski and received backlash for casting Johnny Depp as Tonto the Comanche Indian. \n\nDespite that, this movie is beautifully shot, there's some really funny bits with the Spirit Horse sprinkled throughout, and the final train robbery sequence was one of the most fun I've ever seen in a western film. \n\nIt felt very much like an old western movie in the vain of John Wayne. \n\nWhat's your favorite \"problematic\" movie?",
