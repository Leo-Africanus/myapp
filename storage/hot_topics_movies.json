The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze. The rat was a former pet of a ninja master and therefore uses his skills to train the four turtles in martial arts.

It just doesn\u2019t score as rollicking Rube Goldberg personality-transplant comedy.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-leads-sequel-millennials-deserve-11784813) (A-):\n\n&gt;It's a heart-on-its-sleeve ode to strengthening and forging bonds, the power of deep and unconditional love, and the warmth and safety of one's chosen family, most especially when it's at its freakiest.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/freakier-friday-review-1235143006/) (B+):\n\n&gt;Curtis and Lohan\u2019s commitment naturally extends to some bouts of dizzying physical comedy.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/freakier-friday-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;With Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis in perfect form, Freakier Friday is a legacy sequel done right that will make you laugh and cheer equally.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s still sweet, it\u2019s still funny, it\u2019s still freaky, and it\u2019s still Friday. Thank God.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1931316/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis/) (8/10)\n\n&gt;When it comes down to it, \"Freakier Friday\" is lively, fun, charming, and just plain delightful.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-q6335qmhk?region=global) (4/5):\n\n&gt;In the end, I missed the storytelling honesty and the mother-daughter dynamics of the original. But only just.\n\n[Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/freakier-friday/freakier-friday-review-disney-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-nisha-ganatra) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;All Freakier Friday really has to do to live up to the 2003 movie is be sweet and funny, and in that sense it succeeds.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/freakier-friday-review-hilarious-jamie-lee-curtis-steals-the-show/) (See This):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s no novel reinvention, but it\u2019s cute enough to at least partially overcome its strained and uneven structure and performances.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/05/freakier-friday-review-jamie-lee-curtis-freaky-friday-franchise-lindsay-lohan) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s Curtis who embodies the story\u2019s wacky spirit.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/freaky-friday-lindsay-lohan/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;The film is an Etch-a-Sketch wiped clean; unobjectionable fun, if a trifle anodyne.\n\n[The A.V. Club] (https://www.avclub.com/freakier-friday-review) (C):\n\n&gt;When this nearly two-hour movie enters its intentionally laughless final stretch, Freakier Friday feels more and more like the extended encore of a reunion concert\u2014not least because that\u2019s essentially where it takes place.\n\n[Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-b2802082.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Instead, the talent of tomorrow has to play second fiddle to a generation\u2019s inability to let go of the past. And that\u2019s something a quick body swap can\u2019t solve.\n\n---\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;22 years after Tess and Anna endured an identity crisis, Anna now has a daughter and a soon-to-be stepdaughter.

(In a just universe we'd have had a half-dozen of these instead of those Jack Sparrow movies, but anyway.)  This is one of those titles that maybe wasn't a box-office smash at the time, but it remains very highly regarded, and its reputation as the ultimate \"dad movie\" has only grown over the years. It's based on a long-running series of books, so the setup could clearly support an ongoing franchise if the box-office was there. Or even just a one-off \"Aubrey and Maturin's Last Adventure\" movie would be welcome.\n\nWe still have Crowe and Bettany. I know Weir's retired, but I could see a Villeneuve, or even a Robert Eggers with his devotion to historical accuracy, picking up the reins, if he wanted to take a break from horror movies. Anybody else up for a legasequel or two? I mean, why not? We've had multiple movies about a guy who can talk to ants, why not one more voyage with Captain Jack?",

        "title": "I watched all 6 Sharknado movies, and here are my thoughts.",
        "content": "I always make sure to watch at least one dumb shark movie every summer, but since *Sharknado* has 6 movies in total,  it took me a few years to get ready,  and this summer, I finally gave them all a shot. Here are my thoughts on it.\n\n## **Sharknado (2013)**:\n\nBro thinks he's Mitch Buchannon. I think it\u2019s pretty much what I expected: not good, but it does the job and is easy to sit through. I'm not trying to be ridiculous, but the quality felt more like a cancelled 90-minute TV pilot about some average Californian dude who thinks he can save the world.\n\nI wasn\u2019t really a fan of the cast. Ian Ziering as Fin didn\u2019t do a great job in the lead. He's just kind of blah. And Tara Reid mostly stood around looking like she was waiting for the paycheck.\n\nI think the first 20 minutes were probably my favorite part. It felt just chill until the CGI sharks crashed the party. And honestly, it just keeps getting worse from there. The CGI was ridiculously bad, but I didn\u2019t mind it too much until the way it was executed made it kind of less watchable. I didn't find the final act satisfying, either.\n\nAll in all, I still enjoyed it. I just needed a bad shark movie to watch this summer, and this one was worth my time. I'll give it credit for that.\n\n## **Sharknado 2: The Second One (2014)**:\n\nIf I'm watching a disaster movie, I'd always prefer it to be set in NYC, but this one was, unfortunately, worse than the first one.\n\nThe first one was rough, sure, but I still expected at least some improvement for this one. It just didn't work. It has a lot of cringe dialogue, a script that sucks, and scenes so obviously staged that you can feel the set in the background. The Mayor of NYC and the fire chief literally wanted this one guy to deal with flying sharks in a tornado, like, they weren\u2019t doing the jobs they were meant to do. That part was so bad it was hilariously cringe.\n\nThe acting was just so bad. Seriously, how did Vivica A. Fox go from being a badass in *Kill Bill: Vol. 1* to being annoying in some dumb shark sequel? At least Ian Ziering and Tara Reid were better in this one than in the first.\n\nAside from everything else, I enjoyed the last 10 minutes. Random people from the street battling sharks as they fall from the sky, a guy who thinks he is a hero riding a shark through a tornado, and the chainsaws as weapons. That whole sequence was great for a bad movie.\n\nOverall, I think it\u2019s just marginally worse than the first, but still watchable if you\u2019re in the mood for some dumb movies. There are a bunch of ridiculous moments you have to sit through, sure, but in the end, it\u2019s just harmlessly dumb fun.\n\n## **Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015)**:\n\nNow, this definitely gives me \"*It\u2019s all about family*\" vibes.\n\nI actually watched it, like, a decade ago. It was my first Sharknado, and I just happened to catch it on TV. I remember Frankie Muniz being in it\u2026 and it being terrible. Now that I was making my way through the entire Sharknado franchise, it felt definitely slightly better on a second viewing, but that\u2019s not saying much. It\u2019s still bad, cringey, and ridiculous, but also an easy watch.\n\nI still liked the first two movies better. This one just felt\u2026 kind of lazy, I guess. It\u2019s definitely because I didn\u2019t enjoy the Washington setting. The atmosphere felt cold, and the action started in less than 10 minutes, which made me think they were filming a Sharknado-style movie or something. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the film\u2019s execution, but the second half was fun because it had a lot of ridiculous moments.\n\nNo surprise the acting was bad, but maybe I'm just such a *Baywatch* fan, I thought David Hasselhoff was definitely one of the best parts of the movie. I\u2019m also a fan of *Malcolm in the Middle*, but Muniz\u2019s performance was pretty forgettable.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s definitely safe to say it's worse and dumber, but it\u2019s still not completely terrible if you just want to sit down and continue watching something dumb.\n\n## **Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens (2016)**:\n\n\"*It's a cow-nado!*\"\n\nIt's crazier, feels bigger, and is more ridiculous. It's honestly the best one since the first Sharknado. The franchise has just turned into something supernatural now, which makes it even more entertaining.\n\nI mean, the quality was still on the same level. It never tried to improve anyway. However, it's the execution that worked better than the last two movies. It has some fun ideas and a few especially surprising moments. I'm not trying to say it's a must-see. It's still a bad movie, but it's slightly better than the others and created some great \"so bad, it's good\" vibes.\n\nThe fact that Caroline Williams, the leading actress from *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2*, was in it as a worker in a chainsaw shop, and that I've just found out now that two actors who played Leatherfaces, especially the original, were also in it, may be one of the nicest surprises they have brought to the franchise. It's such a fun reference.\n\nI've mentioned before that I'm a *Baywatch* fan, so it was also really nice to see David Hasselhoff with the other two Baywatch stars in one scene together. Christine being credited as herself is ridiculous, too.\n\nOverall, it has some fun references, flying cows, a flying human-robot, and solid entertainment. There\u2019s no reason to skip this one.\n\n## **Sharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017)**:\n\nIn my opinion, this was definitely the worst Sharknado so far. The previous one was entertaining enough, like, we had everything else, but this one is trying too hard to be cool. Honestly, after 5 bad movies in a row, I think it's just getting tired. Yes, the concept about the world being destroyed by a Sharknado sounds fun for people who enjoy bad movies, but the plot is just kind of boring once you get 5 movies in. I wasn't much of a fan of the London setting, either.\n\nThe fact that they cast a bunch of women with cosmetic plastic surgery and probably aren't even actors just makes it worse. I think the actors who play Fin and Nova do a good job for the most part, but Tara Reid\u2019s acting was worse than anything else. She really couldn\u2019t show any emotion, like, she just didn\u2019t seem to be having fun acting, even since the first.\n\nThe last few minutes were actually the most fun part of the movie, especially the twist ending. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to the next one because of it, but honestly, the next one being the last feels right at this point.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s still not that bad as entertainment. It was fine. What matters is that the formula is almost exactly the same as the rest, which helped keep it still watchable. That was enough for me.\n\n## **The Last Sharknado: It\u2019s About Time (2018)**:\n\nWell, let me guess... first it was just sharks in a tornado, and now we've got time travel, dinosaurs, a robotic shark, and a robot head that shoots lasers from its eyes. Man, this final ride was such a blast! It's weird to say that about a bad franchise.\n\nIt\u2019s the last Sharknado, but it really belongs in my top 3. It was really dumb and all over the place, like they were prepared to make it as ridiculous as possible because it\u2019s the ending, but it was such a fun movie. It even gave me the vibes of *Army of Darkness* and *Back to the Future 3*.\n\nOne of the most ridiculous things was when they brought back the original actor who played the son, after he had been replaced by someone else in the previous movies. Whether that was meant to be satire or not, it was great. The acting wasn\u2019t terrible this time around. Vivica A. Fox was annoying in the second movie, but actually grew on me in this one.\n\nI really liked how they used the time machine to jump into the very first scene of the first movie. The final sequence was so absurd, but really kind of awesome. I feel the ending didn\u2019t bother tying up everything, but I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a dumb franchise, and I\u2019m just glad I saw it through.\n\nOverall, it's been a fun ride, I'll admit. I'm just glad all 6 movies stuck to pretty much the same formula. If you enjoyed the first one enough, you're safe to enjoy the rest too.\n\n**Finally, here's my ranking**:\n\n1. *Sharknado* (2013)\n\n2. *Sharknado: The 4th Awakens* (2016)\n\n3. *The Last Sharknado: It's About Time* (2018)\n\n4. *Sharknado 2: The Second One* (2014)\n\n5. *Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!* (2015)\n\n6. *Sharknado 5: Global Swarming* (2017)\n\nI rated the first 3 three and a half out of five, and the last 3 three stars. Just wanted to add that [this shot](https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/1mfa4lz/sharknado_3_oh_hell_no_2015/) from *Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!* is my absolute favorite one, lol.",
