I started writing at 18, completed it after years of filming at 22 (with 30 days on the Channel) and at 23 had one of the top indie films in the UK. AMA!\n\n*VINDICATION SWIM* tells the inspiring true story of Mercedes Gleitze, who in 1927 became the first British woman to swim the English Channel. Battling unforgiving seas, societal expectations, and relentless challenges, Mercedes becomes a symbol of resilience. However, her achievement is soon questioned by skeptics, forcing her into a fight for recognition. As Mercedes embarks on a grueling vindication swim, she faces both physical and psychological trials that test her determination. Highlighting the beauty and peril of open water swimming and the obstacles women continue to face in the pursuit of equality, VINDICATION SWIM vividly brings to life the pioneering spirit of Gleitze, who would go on to become a trailblazer for women\u2019s open water swimming around the world.\n\n**Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0L0g-DBpE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0L0g-DBpE8)\n\n**Featurette**: [https://vimeo.com/1121810753/592c84c8be](https://vimeo.com/1121810753/592c84c8be)\n\n*VINDICATION SWIM* opens in US theaters (NYC, NJ, CT, LA, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Toronto) beginning October 17; the markets/dates/theaters are below.  On 11/18, it will be available on VOD, all leading digital platforms and DVD.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Bio:** \n\nElliott Hasler is a 24 year old award-winning British filmmaker, best known for his debut feature, Vindication Swim. The historic biopic underwent three years of production with filming taking place in the English Channel itself, followed by a year of post-production at Warner Bros. De Lane Lea Studios. Upon its UK theatrical release Vindication Swim broke into the top 10 at the UK Box Office and played in over 300 cinemas across the UK, Ireland and Malta for a whopping 18 weeks.\n\nHasler\u2019s passion for filmmaking began at a young age, with the production of WII: The Long Road Home. Made whilst at school and completed in 2017 when Hasler was just 16 years old, the film garnered praise from New York film critic Graham Fuller who described the film as \"a miracle achievement for a schoolboy Director.\u201d The film went on to receive a UK, US and European release, earning a spot in the top 50 UK DVD sales and a place on Sky Cinema\u2019s Top 25. In 2024 the film was acquired by Paramount+ for France, Italy and the UK. In 2017 Hasler also founded the UK based independent film company, Relsah Films.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back at 4 PM ET today (Tuesday 10/21) to answer any questions.  \n",

        "content": "The entire production history of this movie is incredibly bizarre so it\u2019s forgivable if people have misconceptions but I can\u2019t find a reliable source that the movie had an \u201calternate ending\u201d or \u201coriginal ending\u201d of Derek shaving his head again in the mirror. The theatrical cut, workprint, and screenplay all follow the same beats. The screenplay by David McKenna ends with something I was surprised by: an incredibly melodramatic, overwritten scene where Sweeney (the principal played by Avery Brooks) talks Derek out of going after the killers before they join the mother and sister in mourning. It\u2019s ambiguous, but so is the actual ending only with no need for dialogue. The workprint version of the film is available online and has the same ending as the theatrical albeit with a couple gruesome shots of violence. I can\u2019t find anything about any version of the movie or the script with a \u201cDerek shaves his head\u201d scene nor can I find statements by the cast or crew verifying this. I suspect it\u2019s one of a few movie myths which originate from IMDB trivia submissions which have been sitting there for decades. (\u201cDarren Aronofsky owns the rights to Perfect Blue\u201d is laughably false and not even plausible but people keep repeating it)",

        "content": "I will start this with saying that I understand that there are probably more films that are traditionally scary, or the acting was better, the writing was smoother, etc.  \nAs a horror buff, I\u2019ve become pretty numb to scares. I enjoy horrors for films, not necessarily for the fear. \n\nHowever, I have recently moved with my fianc\u00e9e. We\u2019re in a whole new location, we\u2019ve gone from living in an apartment in the middle of a city to a house in the suburbs, from a studio to having actual bedrooms. \n\nThe scene where we &gt;!first see the Man in the mask!&lt; had me pausing the film for a minute to just recover. I can see my open bathroom door from where I\u2019m sitting, and that quickly had to close. \n\nI think my biggest fear is being the victim of a home invasion, and I think that was brought up very quickly from this film. \n\nCurious though, are the sequels worth it?

        "content": "The Movie itself is pretty good. Not without some issues, but I really appreciate this thing swinging for the fences. One of the most legitimately beautiful films I've seen in some time with some strange editing choices that can't all be easily explained away as stylistic.\n\nIt's divisive for a reason.\n\nThat said... the ending should be one of the least controversial aspects of the film and online criticisms in spaces like this have me wondering if my whole face should be wrapped in a strait jacket.\n\nVAGUE SPOILERS\n\nIf you didn't know that there's supposed to be a follow up film... *maybe* I could understand having pure tonal whiplash. But even then... it's clear the Power Rangers montage wasn't the ending. This was more of a post-credits/epilogue scene further expanding the world.\n\nBut even in the context of the film alone; it earns this supposedly hysterical idea. It's evident from the film itself that there are disperse communities in this post-apocalyptic UK and segregation would engender sociological differences in how they adapt to this hostile world.\n\nThis is Mad Max, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi world-building 101.\n\nThis particular band of roving, Sentai-simulating crazies isn't any more outlandish than an isolated doctor making a tower of babel out of human skulls.\n\nFinding the tone off-putting is one thing (it would likely have worked better as a post-credits scene overall) but I've seen many occasions of people stating that the scene put them off the film and the sequel entirely, which I find to be *completely* mental, personally.\n\nThere are other aspects of the film that I find to be *far* more outlandish than the ending (\"*the magic of the placenta*\"???).\n\nBut maybe it's just me.\n\nDownvote away.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI honestly thought this would just be downvoted and forgotten about in minutes. Or even more likely - closed.\n\nReddit is so random.\n\nMight as well plug some shit, if that's okay?\n\n[If you care about health and fitness please sub to the Youtube channel!](https://youtu.be/aWERcKIhHow?si=uZaHmB0gI4ctTa4n)\n\nAlso, follow on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theoriginalkye/?hl=en)!\n\nFinally, I do online training!
