        "title": "An appreciation for the dying art of practical Blood Squibs. There\u2019s just something different about them. It\u2019s one of the last things I feel CGi hasn\u2019t been able to replicate 100% correct. What are some of the greatest blood squib effects in film?",
        "content": "I love blood squibs. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, these are practical blood packs put on an actor or stunt person to simulate bullet hits. Are they realistic? No. But there is something visceral and cool about them. And they are becoming a lost art. \n\nYou can see why CGI blood hits have taken over. Blood squibs take ALOT OF TIME. There\u2019s the rigging, the safety, the clean up. There\u2019s none of that with digital. Add it in post and you are good to go. There\u2019s way more control with digital. Far more safety.  \n\nImagine blowing a take during the final big shootout of Django Unchained? Those were legit blood squibs. And the room\u2019s walls are painted red. The clean up to start again? Hours. That\u2019s a lot of $. \n\nBut for some reason, unless there\u2019s an example I don\u2019t know about, I haven\u2019t seen CGI replicate what a blood squib does. With CGI you get the red mist, but I don\u2019t see the chunks or clothing. There\u2019s a look to squib hits. And I\u2019m sure cgi maybe could get it exact if they really tried, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s treated as seriously or something important enough to spend precious R&amp;D time on. \n\nBut I also think squibs affect the actors performance. Think of Al Pacino in Scarface. You feel those bullet hits and his body reacts to them. There\u2019s a physical reaction the actors have. When you watch John Wick and John is blasting these guys left, right and centre, you don\u2019t see the actors reacting to them too much. And look I love those movies. But the bullet hits don\u2019t have much of an impact. It\u2019s not visceral. \n\n\n Of course digital makes it easier to remove for ratings. Look at Die Hard 4. Released as PG13 and got an unrated cut for dvd. They added the blood in digitally and it looks awful.  Same many of the \u201cunrated\u201d cuts of movies that originally had PG13 ratings. Awful blood hits. It\u2019s like they all use the same digital file to render the blood. \n\n So you can see why it\u2019s dying. For a filmmaker to use legit blood squibs in today\u2019s filmmaking world? I feel that needs to be celebrated. Because everything is going against you. Time, money, and yes safety. To set off a blood pack is requires a small explosive charge. They can hurt.\n\nWhen I watch John Wick 1-4, or the Deadpool movies, I\u2019m hoping for some legit blood squib action. \n\nSo. In celebration of practical blood squibs, What are your favourite blood hits in cinema? I already mentioned Django Unchained. What else? \n\nBad Boys 2 has some great squib work. In the opening scene especially. \n\nPredator 1 &amp; 2? Jesse Ventura\u2019s death is *chefs kiss*. Total Recall has some beauties. \n\nOf course one of the GOAT\u2019s and one of the first major uses of a squib was in Godfather. The when Michael avenges his father\u2019s death. Man. The hang time of that blood in the air is beautiful. In fact Godfather has a few great blood sequences. Sonny\u2019s death is amazing. His body must have been riddled with squibs(I think they even get his face)",

He quoted this one *a lot* (specifically, \"I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating\"). Those quotes often led to the realization that his delivery sometimes was considerably better than the reality of whatever movie he was quoting, LOL\n\nThis, this right here, is the #1 exception. \n\nWhen I finally sat down and watched it at 16 or 17 (early aughts), I remember being blown away. This is one of the only movies that has retained that wonder for me over 20+ years now - I turn 40 this year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't absolutely valid criticisms. There are. But this post is just about appreciating a film where, IMHO, the actors and the script and the cinematography are all nearly perfect.\n\nAnd the LINES. Just... I could quote this film forever. Which is wild because the script is in itself pretty sparse.\n\n\"I CAN'T SWIM!\"\n\"Who ARE those guys?\"\n\"You just keep thinkin', Butch, that's what you're good at.\"\n\"Rules!

Jerry asks, \u201cHow\u2019s Jean?\u201d Carl pauses and goes, \u201cWho\u2019s Jean?\u201d\nKilled me. \nHe didn\u2019t even know the name of the woman he kidnapped.\n\nAll the \u2018yeaaaah\u2019\u2019s always stuck. The accents also did play a huge part in making the movie so loveable. \nThey should do a serious sequel with Scotty (the son) and how he grows up all messed up. \n\nI love Steve Buscemi and William Macy together. (They\u2019ve done a few more movies together but I haven\u2019t watched any of them)\n\nI\u2019d love to watch more classics like this. Please recommend.\n",

I re-watched it last night and you know how there are movies you saw as a kid and you revisit them as adults and they end up sucking. \n\nNot The NeverEnding Story. I still get emotional in the right parts, I still have my heart pumping when the score by Klaus Doldinger comes up, I'm still in awe at the VFX and sets and the movie is so deep, it's got a genuine message which continues to be current to this day. Gmork's explanation, for one.\n\nThe performances are superb. Noah Hathaway is extraordinary, he carries most of the film, conveying his acting with great committment. Barrett Oliver is believable as a boy dealing with loss and bullying and fully wrapped in the book. Tami Stronach's Child Empress is a brief but memorable presence. Everybody does a good job. Sure, some parts are a bit off but even back then, I caught the scenes I found cringy and I still loved the film. \n\nWhy can't modern Fantasy movies be like this? I feel like too many today pull the same tired shtick from The Lord of the Rings.",

        "title": "The Lives of Others (2006) is incredible",
        "content": "The Lives of Others, or *Das Leben der Anderen*, is a German movie that came out to a lot of critical acclaim in 2006, and eventually won the Best International Film Oscar over Pan's Labyrinth. I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances\n\nThe summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to\u00a0Christa-Maria.\n\nWhile the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary. There are some thriller-esque elements to it, and the movie *can* be pretty tense at times - this isn't really the focus however, as it's more concerned with making a point about the impact of a political and socially repressive regime on its people, whether they're against it or are complicit in supporting it. \n\nThe performances are what really make this such a great experience. Ulrich M\u00fche as Wiesler is fantastic, especially considering how restrained and low-key the role is. He expresses so much with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. It almost feels like he created this entire person on screen without saying a single word about his personality, because pretty much all of his dialogue is strictly about the work he does. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are really good in their roles as well.\n\nThis is definitely a slow-burn narrative that grows in power and impact as it moves along. Honestly, for the first hour or so, I thought it was just \"good\" - well-acted and directed, but not really exceptional in any way. But halfway through, it hits another gear, the screws are tightened around the characters and it gradually transforms into a tense, anxiety-inducing story before eventually ending up as a bittersweet tragedy. \n\nI also have to applaud the ending, as it's one of the most cathartic and emotional conclusions to a movie I've seen in a while. The scene in the bookstore, with Wiesler going \"it's for me\" and the camera freezing on his face for a while - just beautifully done.\n\nAny other fans of this movie?",

The way he tells it, laughing through it, Damon's performance in that bit was incredible. The way it feels so real, just so heartbreaking. They only exist as a memory, and for Private Ryan to immediately recall something like that through the grief is really touching",

He joins Pfizer, get beaten up by the ex-marine, Trey *but also* gets the main gurl - Maggie whe has Parkinson.\n\nNow what I loved about this movie was \u2014\n\n- Randall wanting sex only gradually fell for her\n- his anxious proposal which she turns down ergo\n- his life becoming mundane and him waiting for her bus which moved Maggie\n- their budding relationship; the cherry blossom stage all good all sweet\n- comes the convention and acceptance phase altogether and \n- him taking her around to get her cured and her breaking up with him\n\nOkay, everyone wants to feel love but the burden and responsibilities that come with it, fewer wish to tackle them. \n\nPs.- I really liked how they got together in the end.\n",

It had the most expensive production at roughly $175 mil in 1994 and was a box office flop.\nIt would ultimately become profitable via tv and  cable distribution and with movie rentals and purchases.\n\nIs it a bad movie? It depends on your perspective. I like it as a guilty pleasure movie. It\u2019s flawed and nearly drowns under Costner\u2019s ego, but it is entertaining.\n\nIf you like Mad Max or the Road Warrior type of action movies, you will enjoy this. Waterworld is basically the same thing, but on water.\n\nMotorcycles are replaced with jet skis and boats.\n\nThis movie also features Dennis Hopper as the main bad guy and leader of the \u201cSmokers\u201d\n\nKevin Costner almost died during production via an accident while filming a scene in open water.\n\n\n\n \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cjAqTXwNkng?si=4prDfMLa40K4bPaL",
