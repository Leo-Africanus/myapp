The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze. The rat was a former pet of a ninja master and therefore uses his skills to train the four turtles in martial arts. They befriend a local journalist and with her help attempt to find the group behind a crime wave in New York City.\n\nAdapted from the early \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics\u201d with characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the movie achieved the then-seemingly impossible feat of bringing its reptilian heroes to full live-action with a team of puppeteers and a voice cast led by Brian Tochi (Revenge of the Nerds, Police Academy 3: Back in Training) as Leonardo, Corey Feldman (Stand By Me, The Goonies) as Donatello, Josh Pais (The Station Agent, A Beautiful Mind), as Raphael, Robbie Rist (Balto, \u201cDoc McStuffins\u201d) as Michelangelo and Kevin Clash (\u201cSesame Street,\u201d Muppet Treasure Island) as Splinter, the Turtles' master. The film also features Judith Hoag (Zodiac, Fallen) and Elias Koteas (Armageddon, Cadillac Man).\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* \u2022 Judith Hoag\n* \u2022 Elias Koteas\n* \u2022 Brian Tochi\n* \u2022 Corey Feldman\n* \u2022 Josh Pais\n* \u2022 Robbie Rist\n* \u2022 Kevin Clash\n* \u2022 James Saito\n* \u2022 David McCharen\n* \u2022 Michelan Sisti\n* \u2022 Leif Tilden\n* \u2022 David Forman\n* \u2022 Sam Rockwell\n* \u2022 Scott Wolf\n* \u2022 Skeet Ulrich\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAsk us anything!

Peter's vague and hand-wavey explanation of it is almost insulting:\n\n&gt; \"It can analyze, design, construct basically anything.\"\n\nThat's it. Magic box can just do everything, no questions, no issues. The story needs Peter to develop a cure for everyone's villainy, so here's the Box That Develops Cures for Everyone's Villainy.\n\nWhat other examples are out of there of outstandingly lazy plot devices?",

        "content": "Zodiac as a film is a bit of an anomaly. The first half of the film functions as a standard serial killer film: the bad guy is shrouded in mystery and we see him carry out his gruesome acts while the police and reporters hunt him down. The standard formula of a serial killer movie is the \u201cbig twist\u201d in the third act. You find out who it was all along, and they engage in a final confrontation with the main character. \n\nHowever in Zodiac, this never happens. The film seemingly meanders along, getting more and more frustrating with every false lead, and every instance of \u201cit\u2019s not him\u201d makes us feel worse as we watch.\n\nOn first watch, I identified with Robert Graysmith - I had invested almost 3 hours into this film! I *need* to know who it is. Just tell me the answer, even if it\u2019s unfounded or unconfirmed. I just need to know! \n\nBut Fincher refuses to give in and forces us to sit in the uncomfortable reality of not just Zodiac, but every unsolved murder case in real life. There are no clean answers, no \u201cAha!\u201d moments. If there are, it\u2019s usually something we\u2019ve created for ourselves to feel better.\n\nNot many directors could engage an audience for 2 hours and 40 minutes on an increasingly unsatisfying journey that ends with a fizzle. But I found myself completely engrossed again, falling back into the mystery despite knowing how it ends (or rather, doesn\u2019t).  ",

        "content": "\n\nHonestly, I was quite disappointed. I expected a movie revolving around the cloning plot. Specifically, the idea of two Mickeys existing at the same time due to an error. That would have been a great movie! Instead, what was advertised as the main concept feels like a subplot in the movie. Essentially the entire thing revolves around the intelligent aliens. And then there was also the plot with Mark Ruffalo being an obvious stand in for Trump. But then there was also the subplot with Steven Yuen.\n\nI finished the movie feeling incredibly confused, because how did they mess up the initial concept like this? The idea of a guy who is constantly sent on deadly missions and is revived is an absolutely golden idea. It also leads to an interesting discussion about consciousness and if a copy of you is still really you. But that\u2019s barely even brought up. The whole plot with two versions of Mickey is completely sidelined. Which makes no sense at all. That should have 100% been the main conflict in the movie, like it was advertised as. Instead, we got a mess.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the movie horrible, but I definitely didn\u2019t like it as much as I hoped I would.",
