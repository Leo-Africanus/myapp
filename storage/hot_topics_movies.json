        "content": "There was criticism back then that the movie wasn't gory but I didn't mind because I feel the movie works so well as a martial arts meets Enter the Dragon kind of movie that it doesn't matter. \n\nSub-Zero is still a cool villain. I thought the fights were well-choregraphed. I thought Robin Shou was a strong male lead as Liu Kang and I'm even surprised MK didn't lead him into being a martial arts movie star. I thought Linden Ashby was pretty good as Johnny Cage: handsome, witty and resourceful. \n\nBridgette Wilson was okay as Sonya Blade. I found her believable in her quest for revenge and her fight scene with Kano worked. I do feel her subplot was quickly rushed out. The one thing I liked about the new MK was that it gave us more Kano and Sonya. \n\nChristophe Lambert was pretty good as Raiden and I loved Cary Hirowuri-Tagawa as Shang Tsung, reverential and evil until he drops the cloak and he's all buffed up and menacing. \n\nI hated HATED Talisa Soto as Kitana. What a waste.",

        "title": "The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One",
        "content": "So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&amp;t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light &amp; Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. \n\nDuring quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.\n\nThey went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. \n\nHow do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well. ",

        "content": "I just watched it for the first time and\u2026 oh my god. I had to watch it twice because I loved it so much. It wasn\u2019t necessary what they were doing but how they acted it out and I was just stunned at the amount of detail in it. Like when at the beginning the secretary leaving had the note in her mouth, I just felt like it was so well planned out. I forgot her first name but the female lead, something gyllenhaal, was such a good actor and I feel like she represented her character\u2019s mental health struggles so well. Also this movie made me realise how bad my grammar and spelling is because it would take me awhile to realise how she spelt something wrong lol",

        "content": "I just discovered this movie a couple days ago, watched it yesterday. It was emotionally overwhelming, the first time in years that I've shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best experiences I had in a while. Then I check out IMDB just to see a baffling 5.7 rating.\n\nIt's a really slow burn, very different from a usual Adam Sandler movie, Paul Dano is otherworldly, the visuals are not grandiose but excellent for this scale. I think it all fits together very well to bring home some powerful messages about loneliness, guilt, connection, what it's like to be a flawed human.\n\nThe grainy looks and old-new tech gives it some realism that usually is missing from modern movies.\n\nI'll keep this spoiler free, if you got curious, please go in blind. I just wish we had more films like this, it hurts to see such low ratings, basically telling studios to keep going with shiny slop.",

For example, I only realised when watching a review afterwards that &gt;!she became a vampire after being bitten by the fly at his cousin's wedding!&lt;\n\nI love watching films where the woman is all about stuff that is nothing to do with pleasing other people and Radhika Apte is amazing! She uses her body and facial expressions so well. I really liked the way so much of the story was visual rather than using dialogue.\n\nI just didn't know what the hell was going to happen next!",

        "content": "*Charlie Heller is a brilliant CIA decoder whose world comes crashing down when his wife dies in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, his intelligence becomes the ultimate weapon as he embarks on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible.*\n\nCast: Rami Malek, Rachel Brosnahan, Laurence Fishburne, Jon Bernthal\n\nRotten Tomatoes: [66%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amateur_2025)\n\nMetacritic: [55/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-amateur/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-gripping-global-spy-thriller-bourne-for-computer-nerds-1236362892/)\n\n&gt;Production values are top notch, with a shout out to the special effects team for a spectaular set piece involving a pool collapse in Berlin that serves as the highlight of the action sequences. The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli tries its best to avoid the cliches of the overworked spy genre and manages to help create a worthy character for Malek to run with, maybe not as fast as Jason Bourne, but no less memorable.\n\n[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-1236362272/)\n\n&gt;This is the third thriller that Rami Malek has made since becoming a star in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d and it nudges his tense, twitchy moodiness even closer to the center of his brand. He\u2019s the right actor to play a digital geek turned mindhunter; those eyes of his glare like lasers. Mostly, though, Malek plays out his methodical mission of vengeance as if it were something almost theoretical. The conceit of \u201cThe Amateur\u201d \u2014 that Charlie must do all this himself \u2014 remains, at heart, a conceit. That\u2019s why the movie is okay but never, you know, killer.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;There is a fundamental problem concerning how ruthless Charles is supposed to be in killing his wife\u2019s murderers in cold blood and the final confrontation with the homicidal mastermind involves a very muddled exchange of views.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;It at least looks and feels like a real movie. That might sound like not much of a distinction. But in this age of assembly-line streaming originals that play like bland knockoffs of a dozen multiplex hits you\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s not nothing, either.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \\- C+\n\n&gt;An aggressively competent spy thriller that has less use for logic than its lead actor does for his smile... the film makes a compelling enough case to sustain itself across the entire television season\u2019s worth of plot that it packs into two hours.\n\n[awakeinthedark - Brent Leuthold](https://awakeinthedark.com/2025/04/the-amateur/) \\- 2.5/5\n\n&gt;*The Amateur* isn\u2019t a bad movie from a technical perspective. Despite some misjudged shaky cam, it\u2019s well-shot and edited in a way that makes its 2-hour runtime move along briskly. It\u2019s just not a film that distinguishes itself enough from other revenge or spy films we\u2019ve seen already. Its release comes just a few weeks after *Black Bag*, already one of the year\u2019s best, which also follows spies chasing spies but does so with much more panache and thematic heft.",

With one of my favorites being Chef. Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. The only person that wasn't a super star was the child actor player the son. It was a great movie.",
