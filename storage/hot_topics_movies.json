        "content": "Lifelong Alien franchise fan, hear me out. \n\nI realize Prometheus was confusing and weird and some parts were straight nonsense, but I love the way they told the story of existence and evolution. It\u2019s a high-concept story that was only made better by the wistful musings of the characters, especially Fassbender. His search for humanity in media, philosophy, and poetry is a thing of beauty. Even though it ends well for exactly no one, just the fact that they tried to tackle this subject in the context of a horror-thriller-sci fi was so ambitious and creative I can\u2019t hate it. \n\nTo me, this movie is an extension of concepts explored by Bladerunner and other films, stemming from \u2018Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u2019. It\u2019s about creation and evolution and the pursuit of the soul, by a creature that can neither create, nor evolve, nor has a soul. \n\nThis was the David show, for me, 100%. He steals every scene he\u2019s in. \n\nThe cinematography, score, and ambition of this film deserves way more respect than it gets. ",

        "content": "Typo in the title, my bad. It's ***Crocodile Dundee (1986)***\n\n\nWho hasn't heard the \"that's not a knoife, this is a knoife\" line? It's like one of cinema's most famous lines lmao. But it's also not a good represantation of this movie. I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching this and the pacing was quite mellow without much comedy, atleast for the first half.\n\n\nIt's a slow Tarzan &amp; Jane type of chemistary between Dundee and the girl, it's adorable seeing them interact.\n\n\nThis movie is so 80's. From the fashion sense to the music and the cityscape, the second half of the story is like a window into the past lol. Being so 80's, some jokes are a bit dated too. Not too many, but a couple things here and there won't fly today.\n\n\nThe ending is so adorable, it's the quintessential rom-com ending.\n\n\nI'm gonna be honest though, the Editor Finace guy &gt;!got completely fucked over lmao. His only crime was being a slight bit of a douche, some crocodile leather wearing backwater idiot stole his girl and cucked him out of a fortune. Worst part is, he sent her out to him in the first place lmao!&lt;\n\n\nLast observation, Linda Kozlowski is fucking smoking hot. Goddamn, that red dress in the party scene. Woof.\n",

Younger viewers should eat it all up, and those weaned on the original film will appreciate the numerous shout-outs.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/lilo-stitch-review-live-action-remake-1236390982/):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a sweet film, succeeding where other remakes have failed, namely in adhering closely to the core message of what inspired it without falling too deep down the rabbit hole of computer-generated slop.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-review-1236404657/):\n\n&gt;Somehow, \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d has lost its unpredictable sense of anarchy in the retelling. For all intents and purposes, it could be a Hawaii-set sitcom.\n\n[The Consequence] (https://consequence.net/2025/05/lilo-and-stitch-review-disney-live-action/) (B+)\n\n&gt;While it may never fully replace the original in the hearts of its fans, this new Lilo &amp; Stitch manages to capture the real emotion embedded in this story, while also nailing all the fun that comes from an agent of chaos discovering he has a heart.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/lilo-stitch-is-finally-a-disney-remake-that-isnt-a-total-travesty/) (See This):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s jovial, zany, and sweet, and it recreates its adorable title alien via CGI (and a Sanders voice performance) with pitch-perfect accuracy.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/lilo-and-stitch-live-action-adaptation-whimsical-heartfelt-upgrade-11738389) (B+):\n\n&gt;Now 3-D rather than mere pen and ink, [Stitch] looks instantly huggable, so much so that I can\u2019t even begrudge Disney the thousands of stuffed Stitch toys this is bound to sell.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/lilo-stitch-remake-review) (8/10):\n\n&gt;Lilo &amp; Stitch is one of the stronger results of Disney\u2019s non-stop remake campaign, taking the emotional core of the original and amplifying it in a stirring manner.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/lilo-and-stitch-2025-review/):\n\n&gt;I guess when you take something that works and make it work slightly less, it still kinda works.\n\n[Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/lilo-and-stitch-review-2025/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;Here, \u201cohana\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean family but community, and the film does moving and spirited work in showcasing how crucial it is for us to lift each other up.\n\n[The Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/lilo-stitch-review-disney-hawaii/) (3/5)\n\n&gt;No prospective customers are going to feel alienated by anything here, from the aliens down. That makes it feel more like a product than its predecessor did, but at least it\u2019s a sturdily built one.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/lilo-and-stitch-movie-review-2025/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Audiences want to be moved and given a reason to revisit the emotions sparked by the story, and Lilo &amp; Stitch delivers.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1864754/lilo-and-stitch-movie-review/) (6.5/10):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, this new \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\" isn't trying to compete with its source material, and boldly refocuses the emotional heartstrings in a new direction.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/05/20/lilo-and-stitch-2025-movie-review/83698024007/) (2.5/4):\n\n&gt;This \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d is \u201cbroken but still good.\u201d Even if it's ultimately an unnecessary new take on a chaotic masterpiece.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/lilo-and-stitch-review-live-action-remake-1235124603/) (C+):\n\n&gt;The heart of this story remains firmly intact, but there\u2019s something about seeing it rendered in live-action that takes away its inherent magic.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/lilo-and-stitch-review-live-action/) (4/10):\n\n&gt;Chris Sanders and Maia Kealoha have enough charm to keep families entertained, but it's also hard to deny that these two characters are just as, if not more, endearing in a film you can watch right now on Disney+\n\n[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/lilo-and-stitch-review) (D):\n\n&gt;The Disney Channel Original aesthetic and a handful of wrongheaded decisions make this film just the latest in a string of soulless, cut-rate copies.\n\n[Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-review-remake-live-action-disney-b2754278.html) (1/5):\n\n&gt;These half-hearted substitutions prove entirely pointless in practice, shot and cobbled together as they are with the hasty quality of a reality TV show.\n\n[Associated Press] (https://apnews.com/article/lilo-stitch-2025-movie-review-f12f0cf0e8d1d3ceb24f6602de57cc1c) (1/5)\n\n&gt;Disney should have left the original alone.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/20/lilo-stitch-review-disney) (1/5):\n\n&gt;All told, there\u2019s hardly a single smile in Lilo &amp; Stitch \u201925 not generated through the stolen valor of the earlier screenplay, and hardly a poignant moment that\u2019s not more admirably raw in the G-rated version.\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;A live-action reimagining of Disney\u2019s 2002 animated classic, \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d is the wildly funny and touching story of a lonely Hawaiian girl and the fugitive alien who helps to mend her broken family.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai\n* Chris Sanders as the voice of Stitch\n* Sydney Elizebeth Agudong as Nani Pelekai\n* Zach Galifianakis as Dr. Jumba Jookiba\n* Billy Magnussen as Agent Pleakley\n* Courtney B.

Then I put it on the player and when it started with the orchestra and all, I was like, uh???!! THen it got weirder and less fun. The classical music, the scary mountain, the forest, the hippo. Even when Mickey showed up, it wasn't what I expected so I was like Homer and Bart when they realized Paint Your Wagon wasn't a bloody Western. I was pissed!!!",
