        "title": "Eric Stoltz made me understand the tragedy of the ending of Back to the Future and the inhumanity of the American Dream.",
        "content": "I think a good part of here knows the story behind the first casting of the protagonist of \"Back to the Future\". Michael J. Fox was not available and Eric Stoltz was chosen. But his type of acting was not suitable for what was a comedy, he was fired and MJF who had become available was called. The rest is history.\n\nBut recently I saw an interview with Lea Thompson (who plays Marty McFly's mother, Lorraine Baines).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-\\_lWQhgLYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-_lWQhgLYA)\n\nHere she tells an interesting anecdote. After the first reading of the script with the actors they are all enthusiastic, the story is great everyone laughs etc etc. Then they ask Eric what he thinks and he says it is a tragedy. Because at the end of the film Marty remembers a past and a family that no longer exists. His new family are strangers who have lived a totally different life. And this new family has lost a son, because at home they have a stranger who coincidentally has the same name.\n\nAnd I add, the movie tells us that all this is perfectly okay why? Because now Marty has a nicer house, he has a new car, he has so many *things*. Marty has lost his whole life but in exchange he has so many new material goods. And this is the essence of the American Dream, as long as you have things (goods, money, power, fame), everything else (love, family, beliefs) can be sacrificed.\n\n(I think that even Crispin Glover - who played Marty's dad, was very critical about the movie message: money and financial success = happiness)",

        "content": "There's some comedies from my childhood and teens that I watch now that I still have nostalgia for, but I look at them and I go yeah this is dated or this isn't as funny as I remember. I had that feeling a few years ago with American Pie where I watched it again and it really started to feel dated which is alarming for me because it seems like yesterday I was watching that movie as a kid on HBO behind my parents back. Superbad to me from start to finish is as perfect of a comedy as you're going to get. A very funny, relatable script from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Really cool locations and sets by Greg mottle and all the characters are so perfectly cast and portrayed. Not one missed joke in the entire movie and it's genuinely a movie that even at 32 I still laugh at damn near every frame now as I did at 14 when I saw it in theaters. ",

        "title": "Rewatching The Social Network in 2025",
        "content": "One of my all time favorite movies. I especially love the breakdown of each main character and their ideologies:\n\nAt the top, you have the clashing between Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker. \n\nEduardo is a good guy with bad ideas. He tries to monetize the site too early, and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Despite this, he is a team player and is the only person to put his money where his mouth is and fund the company. It\u2019s this naivety that ultimately gets him ousted from his own company by Mark and Sean. \n\nSean Parker is his exact opposite - a bad guy with really good ideas. He is able to predict the path social media is on, and even calls out the success of photo/video based sites while coked out of his mind. He knows how to influence Mark, but he is a creepy leech who ultimately enjoys lurking after college girls more than he enjoys creating companies.\n\nOn the other side, you have the Winklevii and Divya. The very definition of \u201cborn on third base and think they hit a triple\u201d. \n\nThey are suing Mark mostly based on what they feel their site could have been, vs. what it ever actually was. They never had a website or a product to compare to Facebook. They had a lot of money and influence which they used to consistently fail upwards while thinking they were \u201cplaying fair\u201d the whole time. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s Mark caught in the middle. He reminds me a lot of Louis Bloom in Nightcrawler, when Jake Gyllenhaal says \u201cwhat if my problem wasn\u2019t that I don\u2019t understand people, it was that I don\u2019t like them?\u201d \n\nIMO, Mark understands people better than he\u2019s ever given credit for. He understands the insecurity that drives much of a person\u2019s actions, and the innate desire everyone has for intimacy. This is demonstrated in the beginning of the movie with his facemash site. He knows everyone will use it, because it lets them compare themselves to people they know. This is essentially what Facebook and social media became in the 2010s - a way to compare your whole life to everyone else\u2019s highlight reels.\n\nHe also knows that the Winklevii are onto something with their website idea, but he resents them because they don\u2019t even understand why it\u2019s so valuable. He hates how little they crave any kind of companionship or intimacy, since they have grown up in an abundance of both. \n\nUltimately, the movie is about a bunch of rich kids arguing with each other. 15 years later, everyone involved is richer than they were, and nothing really happened. Sorkin and Fincher took the most boring premise ever and turned it into one of the most fascinating movies I\u2019ve ever watched.",

And I don\u2019t understand why he is so highly regarded as an actor, apart from his reputation as a nice guy, and his role as beloved Dr. Doug Ross in E.R.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - I enjoyed E.R. and I liked his character. I\u2019m NOT saying he\u2019s a bad actor. It\u2019s just that when I see him in a movie it feels like I\u2019m watching George Clooney act, rather than the character he is portraying. \n\nSo which actors do you feel this way about? ",

It's not easy to stand out in a film with Robert DeNiro, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino but Joe Pesci was excellent, he nailed the part. \n\nI hated Tommy but I was also fascinated by him. This was a guy who was kind to his mother and knew how to draw a audience for himself but he also knew how to put the fear of God on anyone. I think the scene where he shoots Spider's foot for fun and then kills the kid because Spider cursed him out is where one realizes how genuinely awful he is. He was already bad just for being a mobster and had a temper but Spider was just a kid, probably another young Henry, which is why Henry looked down at Spider's body with sadness because he saw himself in Spider. He could have died like Spider, had he been faced with someone as nutty as Tommy. Even Jimmy chided Tommy for shooting the kid. When Jimmy Conway thinks you've gone too far, it's really bad. \n\nI definitely think Tommy DeVito is one of the most charismatic but heinous gangsters in American Cinema and Joe Pesci played him brilliantly.",

        "content": "And I mean that in a good way. When I was younger I always viewed movies through a critic's lense. I would pay attention to details that may or may not make sense. Continuity errors. Realism. Plot details. Etc. If they checked off certain boxes (character growth, realistic action scenes if any, a flow to the plot that made sense, etc) then I would say I just watched a good movie. If not, I would just say the movie isn't good and dismiss it completely while trashing it if it ever came up in conversation. I wanted to \"have good taste\" and to me that meant it had to somewhat align with award season nominees or the general public's opinion. \n\nOver the past few years, though, I realize I've been doing it wrong. I have loosened this criteria I had in my head and began to soak up movies in the way they were primarily intended...to just have fun. Yes, I can still technically recognize when a movie is doing an amazing job conveying a message, shot well, well written, etc, but those things are not required for me to just have fun. As an example, I know many of us would agree the Michael Bay Transformers movies aren't considered quality filmmaking/storytelling. I won't be led down a rabbit hole of soul seeking questions pondering what it means to struggle morally, financially, etc. But...I will walk away having been wowed by the visuals, sound design, and over the top action scenes. I will have walked away doing what most of us want to do, escape reality for a bit.\n\nSo, all this to say, I've grown to appreciate a lot more movies than I did before because the lenses I'm wearing aren't meant to judge anymore. I just sit along for the ride, laugh at how a dumb teenager investigates a weird noise during a horror movie, and just accept that no one aims for John Wick's head or hands while he covers himself with the bulletproof suit jacket. Also, I accept that a suit jacket is plausible. The only lenses I'm wearing are prescription because without them I won't see crap \n\nPS: I still have standards and The Strangers Chapter 1 was  one of the dumbest, nonsensical movies I've seen in recent years. Couldn't have fun. Was just angry the whole time.",

Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, The Good the Bad and the Ugly are some of my most favorite movies and all have stellar soundtracks. For me, even mediocre movies like Interstellar and Scarface get major bonus points because of their amazing soundtracks. Guys like Morricone, Zimmer, Williams, and Herrmann don't receive enough credit for how much they elevated the movies they composed for. I couldn't have been more ecstatic than when Morricone finally won an Oscar for Hateful Eight after so much brilliance.  Anyone else feel this way?",

I loved the dichotomy between the Sheriff and Foster, where they both reach a breaking point with bullshit and go past the point of no return.\n\nAlmost all of the points are still relevant today.  The overpriced goods, the screwed up politics and bureaucracies, liars prospering, Nazis, people getting rich off useless and empty services, wasting land and wealth on the few while the majority are suffering.  \n\nWhat a great goddamn movie.",

So if there's any other film fans out there who ever struggle to find something interesting to watch, I just wanted to say: take a scroll through the archives of these services, and I think you'll find at least a few things that catch your eye.",
