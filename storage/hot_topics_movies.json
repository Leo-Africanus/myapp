Of course long movies can be good, but it can also act as a roadblock. The first two that come to mind for me are Knocked Up and American Pie. Really I think comedies should never exceed 2 hours, you need stamina for a comedy. \n\nKnocked up (133 min) is by all means a good movie. It has a killer cast and tells a story that is engaging but when I catch it front to back, it is an arduous watch. It becomes a chore. It is one of those movies where there are 15 scenes to take a couple minutes out of. I am a big fan of apatow but cmon, bring us 90 min comedies! \n\nAmerican Pie is another one that some of the scenes just hang on just too long. It\u2019s obviously not a movie with a ton of substance but there\u2019s ten mins tha can come off of this a min or two at a time. ",

        "content": "What would you consider the best 1v1 fight you\u2019ve seen in a movie? Whether it be because the story, choreography, or just the straight hype it had. \n\nOnes that come to mind are Hector vs Achilles(Troy), Voldemort vs Dumbledore, Bruce Lee vs Chuck Norris, Anakin vs Obi-Wan. \n\nMy personal favorite(not what I think is best) is Jake Tyler vs Ryan McCarthy from Never Back Down(2008) mostly for nostalgia and hype.",

        "content": "Sometimes an actor feels like they are playing a different film than everyone else. Not in a bad way, but in a way that adds depth the movie itself never fully reaches.\n\nFor me, Joaquin Phoenix in Joker felt like this. No matter how you feel about the movie, his performance felt fully formed. The body language, the silence, the slow breakdown all felt intentional. It felt like he understood the character at a level deeper than the script around him.\n\nAnother example is Adam Driver in Star Wars. Even when the story felt messy, his performance carried real conflict and emotion. It felt like he knew exactly who Kylo Ren was, even when the film did not.\n\nThese performances make me wonder how often actors carry a movie further than the direction or writing allows.\n\nWhich performance felt like the actor understood the film better than the movie itself did?\n\nThank you.",
