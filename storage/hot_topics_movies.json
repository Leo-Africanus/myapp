But that charm from the early scenes is lost with the addition of each new plot point.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-turns-origin-story-into-rousing-action-adventure-buddy-movie-1236205310/):\n\n&gt;Though James Earl Jones is impossible to follow, these voice actors give it all a game try.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-1236250945/):\n\n&gt;Jenkins has not sold out; rather, the studio bought into his vision, which respects the 1994 film and recognizes the significance that its role models and life lessons have served for young audiences.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-disney-prequel-xfksllzbq) (5/5) :\n\n&gt;Disney has gone back to the drawing board with this dazzling animated musical, a film that matches photorealistic spectacle with hummable earworms and, mostly, a genuinely mythic sense of story.\n\n[RogerEbert.com] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa\u201d never quite bursts free of the constraints placed upon it, but those constraints never stop it from moving, or from being moving.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins) (8/10):\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins\u2019 Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight directors involvement in a CGI-heavey Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s in little danger of becoming a classic but it\u2019s gratifying to know that Barry Jenkins made this film his own, telling a fine story with genuine emotion and visual aplomb.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/17/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/77020873007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;Thanks to Jenkins\u2019 inimitable grace and Miranda\u2019s tuneful swagger, it continues to feel vibrant.\n\n[Chicago Sun-Times] (https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/12/17/mufasa-review-lion-king-disney) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The voice work from the outstanding cast is rich and warm and vibrant, and while the songs from the great Lin-Manuel Miranda (with Lebo M. making valuable contributions) might not make for a generational catalog, they\u2019re still infectious and clever.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Even with a few flaws, Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King has enough heart and depth to stand on its own feet and surpass its 2019 predecessor.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235194304/):\n\n&gt;We tell ourselves stories in order to live. Corporate movie studios tell you stories in order to keep their board happy and make their bottom line. Find the Venn diagram center between the two, and that\u2019s where this Hakuna Matata 2.0 lies.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235077385/) (C+):\n\n&gt;Mufasa has hidden charms that are arguably best described as Jenkins released straight to VHS.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins\u2019 verve only faintly shines through in an origin story that is mildly, not wildly, entertaining.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It's no Hakuna Matata, that's for sure. And it's far from Jenkins' best work, but in any other hands, a lot of Mufasa's intentions would have completely misfired. Thankfully there are some stellar vocal performances and VFX \u2013 but it could have been so much better.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1740391/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5.5/10):\n\n&gt;\"Mufasa\" will satisfy, but it also feels ultimately useless. Like Disney is once again spinning its wheels, trying to wring billions of dollars out of old ideas while they brainstorm new ones. Fans of \"The Lion King\" may be slightly moved. At the very least, you'll finally know how Rafiki got his stick.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Fans of the franchise and younger generations will find a lot to like about Mufasa: The Lion King, but it's hard to imagine it will have a legacy comparable to the original animated classic that started it all.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241217-mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (2/5):\n\n&gt;This series of unfortunate events raises more questions than it answers.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;While Mufasa is never as actively depressing as 2019\u2019s Dumbo or 2022\u2019s Pinocchio, the exercise has perhaps never felt as craven or pointless as it does here.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lion-king-2-barry-jenkins-review-b2665329.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, finding the Jenkins in Mufasa is like putting a blindfold on in the Louvre and trying to feel your way to the Mona Lisa.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka\u2014the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny\u2014their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Aaron Pierre as Mufasa\n* Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka\n* Tiffany Boone as Sarabi\n* Kagiso Lediga as Young Rafiki\n* Preston Nyman as Zazu\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros\n* Thandiwe Newton as Eshe\n* Lennie James as Obasi\n* Anika Noni Rose as Afia\n* Keith David as Masego\n* John Kani as Rafiki\n* Seth Rogen as Pumbaa\n* Billy Eichner as Timon\n* Donald Glover as Simba\n* Blue Ivy-Carter as Kiara\n* Braelyn Rankins as Young Mufasa\n* Theo Somolu as Young Taka\n* Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala\n\nDirected by: Barry Jenkins\n\nScreenplay by: Jeff Nathanson\n\nProduced by: Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak\n\nCinematography: James Laxton\n\nEdited by: Joi McMillon\n\nMusic by: Dave Metzger, Nicholas Britell (score), Lin-Manuel Miranda (songs)\n\nRunning time: 118 minutes\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2024",

        "content": "I grew up knowing Tom hanks from Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Toy Story, You\u2019ve got mail, saving private Ryan. He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn\u2019t come to accept his early films. \n\nI saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren\u2019t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren\u2019t made for me at that age and I wouldn\u2019t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I\u2019m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. \n\nYou are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas. There is a rare blend of grounded humanism and over the top performances in these two films that I feel was lightning in a bottle. \n\nAs a Joe Dante fan I have to say other than gremlins 2 and perhaps beyond it felt like the movie most representing the distillation of his spirit as a filmmaker. The cast is top to bottom perfect. It felt like both a love letter to late 50s early 60s tv like Ozzie and Harriett, leave it to beaver, the munsters and 80s hijinks comedies while altogether becoming its own thing. \n\n Tom Hanks masters over the top comedy in this movie. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, his outbursts, monologues, and physical comedy are unmatched in their ability to play to the levels of gonzo Joe Dante asks of him while simultaneously feeling endearing and believable. Which leads to the reason the ending was changed from a twilight zone like twist to a double twist where he HAS to win in the end. But albeit in the wrong way. \n\nAlso props to Bruce Dern, I don\u2019t know how he ended up in this movie but I\u2019m damn glad he did. What a driving force and \u201cstraight man\u201d if this movie could even have one. \n\n",

Like I can probably rewatch this movie more than once or have it playing on the background at some point and appreciate the writing and execution.\n\nOther movies that come to mind would probably be The Hateful Eight. Heck I think most Tarantino movies are actually dialogue driven. \n\nHow do you feel about movies like this? Which is your favorite? Any other movies you would care to recommend?",

They might as well have been cut from the films altogether for all they contributed. \n\nIt\u2019s astounding to me that for as much material was gutted from the David Lynch film, he still managed to portray Piter and Thufir more faithfully and more compellingly than Denis.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most disappointing adaptational change you\u2019ve seen from book to film?",

A lot of elements were implausible, even by 2006 standards, but I got completely distracted by the dog. \n\nLet's suppose you put enough trust in a complete stranger from another country to let them have free rein of your house and car without even meeting them. But you leave your DOG with them too? Did the Cameron Diaz character know the dog was part of the deal? Is the dog just accepting of complete strangers arriving at its house unaccompanied? Also, when the brother shows up there's no hint that he knows the dog, that it's happy to see him or anything, and he doesn't inquire about  how it's doing. (Does the dog even have a name?)\n\nIf that's not enough, Cameron Diaz decides just to bail after the first day and makes it as far as airport security before changing her mind. She was abandoning the dog?? I mean, come on, this is just lazy writing.",
