I've recently watched Django Unchained again and he was really briliant in it.\n\nHe was obviously also great in The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road, etc but those are his stand-out performances in my personal opinion\n\nedit: not sure why some people want to argue with me and are downvoting this? I can still think he deserved Oscar wins for his other roles, especially because him not winning an Oscar for so long became a meme for the longest, his smirk when he finally won for The Revenant at the Oscars said everything.

Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. \n\nAfter rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. \n\n1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but\u2026\n\n2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven\u2019t aged at all. \n\nAnyway that\u2019s where I\u2019m leaning now - he\u2019s still dreaming. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo\u2019s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. \n\nI will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I\u2019m even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in \u201cthe real world.\u201d Hmmm \ud83e\udd14 ",

        "title": "Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo'",
        "content": "Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic \"stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen\" narrative. \n\nThis is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. \n\nThe film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. \n\nWhat I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.\n\nThe story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.\n\nThis is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",

What he\u2019s all about, how he\u2019s managed to survive. \n\nAnother scene like that is the famous Jaws scene with Robert Shaw where he talks about his encounter with sharks as a WW2 soldier after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk in shark-infested waters: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs\n\nAnother one of the most famous is Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, relaying his visions and experiences of horror in war - the disturbing aftermath after he and his group inoculate a village - and using that to justify and rationalize his own brutality:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mPPGMNOLaMw\n\nIn all of those cases the actors are so good you feel like they\u2019re retelling a genuine memory, you can almost even see it in their eyes. \n\nWhat are some other similar ones? 4-5 minute (or however long) monologues where the actors and the writing are so good the scene just transfixes and transports you, and you can so easily visualize everything.

        "content": "night of the zoopocalypse\n\nclive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.\n\ngrendel\n\njohn gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.\n\nhigh and low\n\nwhen it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.\n\nthe long walk\n\nin addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.\n\nthe lost bus\n\n\"A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the\u00a02018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history.\" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. \n\neddington\n\nari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.\n\nthe battle of baktan cross\n\nwhen it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.\n\nwildwoods\n\nwildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.\n\nthe phoenician scheme\n\nleave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.\n\nwake up dead man a knives out mystery\n\nknives out and glass onion were both very well recieved murder mystery stories and fans have been eager to see what benoit blanc would get up to next. well, next year, we may have our answer. the next film in the beniot blanc film series is entitled wake up dead man a knives out mystery. rian johnson will once again serve as writer and director with daniel craig once again playing everyone's favorite southern detective. and like the other films in the series, there is a stacked supporting cast. josh o connor, glenn close, josh brolin, mila kunis, jeremy renner, kerry washington, andrew scott, cailee spaeny, daryl mccormick, and thomas haden church. while the plot is unknown at the moment, if the previous two movies are anything to go by, it will be a compelling mystery that will inherently need to be rewatched.",

(Unless it\u2019s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) \n\nThese days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there\u2019s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). \n\nIn the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?\n\nIn my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.
