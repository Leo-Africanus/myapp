        "content": "We will be back today Wednesday 4/17 at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\nWe are Andrew Ahn (co-writer/director) and James Schamus (co-writer/producer) of THE WEDDING BANQUET\u2014 a deeply personal, sharply funny, and emotionally rich reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s beloved 1993 classic.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nTogether, we bring decades of filmmaking experience to the table! James is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and producer behind films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, and the original version of The Wedding Banquet. Andrew is a Sundance-winning director whose work like Spa Night, Driveways, and Fire Island explores identity, intimacy, and family, both those we\u2019re born with and those we choose for ourselves, with heart and nuance.\n\nThis new version of The Wedding Banquet reflects the world we live in now \u2014 from universal, evolving ideas of family and tradition, to the complexities of queer Asian American identity. We\u2019ve poured our hearts into this project, and we\u2019re thrilled to share it with you!\n\nWant to know about the making of this film, what it means to update a classic, or how two storytellers came together to collaborate?

He is an amazing character actor who embodies his roles so well. I think what he does best is micro-expressions and the way he acts is just so natural in a given situation.\n\nI love him in Game Night. That role can just be a run of the mill nosy and annoying neighbor but he made it quite charming and so funny. \n\nAnyway, what is your favorite role of his? Some choices to pick from:\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nUSS Callister\n\nPower of the Dog\n\nKinda of Kindness\n\nThe Irishman\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nFargo\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nCivil War \n\nGame Night\n\nZero Day\n\n",

A spunky, young girl whom Rosso takes under his wing and she tries to understand who he is. Miyazaki always had a great knack for female protagonists.\n\nAnd this movie has my favorite Joe Hisaishi original score for a Miyazaki movie. For years, I've been trying to find the piece which scores the flashback scene of young Rosso flying with young Gina. I've never found it. If you know the title, please tell me. I'd be grateful.",

        "content": "For me it's Hackers.  I was about 10 years old when it was released and it brings back the 90s and those early Internet days every time I watch it.  Like dial-up, the slow speeds, how easy it was to fuck about and play pranks on your friends.  Like I discovered if you sent a message on Hotmail and click send again before the page finished loading it would send it again.  So I'd send hundreds of messages to people just to piss them off.\n\nThis movie brings all those memories back and more.  Great times.\n\nEdit:  A few others, the first TMNT movie, Honey, I Shrunk the Kid, Look Who's Talking and all the classic Disney movies.",

It represents not only a singular threat to her, but an existential threat to humanity, and she sees it face to face.  Linda Hamilton did it perfectly.\n\nWhat's yours?",
