Not that I want her to.)\n\n2) Great lines delivered exceptionally well and with perfect timing by Mr. CP.\n\n3) A fat dragon.\n\n4) Above average special effects, with the exception of one potato-throwing scene.\n\n5) Running joke about magic that echoes what I always think, but doesn\u2019t drag on past its usefulness.\n\n6) A complex plot that\u2019s clear enough not to feel complicated.\n\n7) An ending I should have seen coming but still made me cry. YES it\u2019s okay to cry over a fat dragon movie, although the fat dragon didn\u2019t make me cry and only featured in one of the quests.\n\nI look forward to all the comments agreeing with me.\n\n",

What a hard hitting story of a M\u0101ori family.\n\nI was personally struck by the juxtaposition between the beauty of the M\u0101ori people and their culture against the torrid circle of alcohol abuse and violence which has gripped their communities.\n\nI believe that this movie is highly recognised in New Zealand. \n\nI just wanted to share this post for those that have not seen it, and for those that have thought of it as highly as I have.
