        "content": "I've been getting into movies a lot more than before and I just recently watched inglourious basterds, it was a great movie and I loved it. But I was wondering if there was any other movies in the world war 2 movies like it? Something not too serious but really fucking good? Maybe it\u2019s just Tarantino/Brad Pitt but I really need a movie to watch tonight, so feel free to comment suggestions! \n\nEdit: Thank you for all the recommendations, I\u2019ll be watching a lot of these later!!",

        "title": "I'm obsessed with To Die For (1995)",
        "content": "I don't know if this qualifies as a review but I'm a die hard Nicole Kidman yet I had never seen To Die For. I'm 27 so I've followed her current work more closely and had only seen Eyes Wide Shut from her older filmography. \n\nI ended up watching To Die For (1995) last month and ever since, I've seen it three times, I'm completely obsessed with it. Nicole was perfection as Suzanne, she was so charming and charismatic, I loved her mannerisms and she had me rooting for her in a few moments and also feeling bad for her at the same time for not being able to pursue her career. Everyone was great, especially the actress who played Larry's sister, Joaquin and the actress who played Lydia. \n\nI also loved the little Easter Eggs I noticed on my rewatch, like when they first show the abandoned house while Suzanne screams in the background and when she goes to the station to drop her curriculum and she's talking to Ed and she's taking a letter from her bag and just puts it back when she sees George, that was hilarious. I also only noticed later that she slept with that journalist in Miami but I guess I'm just dense lol \n\nI also love Gone Girl and Rosamund Pike and I read that she watched To Die For as an inspiration for Amy so I was expecting Suzanne to be more chilling, cold and calculated and while she was all that, I think the movie carried a certain humour that I really enjoyed. Also loved Suzanne's outfits and how bright the colors were, I absolutely hate the trend where films and shows nowadays feel the need to turn off all the lights on set and everything is dark af. \n\nJust really enjoyed the movie, gave it a 4/5 because I wished we could've seen how Suzanne's plan started, I could understand why she wanted to kill Larry but the plan felt so sloppy and it'd so easy to track back the boys to her, and I think her plan would be more elaborate idk. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else is also a fan and your thoughts about To Die For!",

        "content": "So I rewatched the film and admired the sense of coldness, dread and hopelessness and yeah it's not a perfect film or remake I applaud the tone and I believe they got that down really well. So the film was out in 2006 and now in 2025 it's interesting to think how interconnected we are now and at the same time how lonely and disillusioned we are due to excess information and those out there claiming they're the real news or have all the facts etc.  Imo this film still holds up in terms of tone and it's themes on suicide and loneliness (the blue hue helps alot.) And by the end of the film it just leaves you with feeling hopeless and empty and I feel like interested of social media horror pulse holds up in terms of the existential dread and what it leaves you with after film concludes. Again it's not perfect by any means but check out the film again or first time in terms of 2025 and where we are all at as a society and how these people who made /remade the film of their interpretation of the \"new\" tech such as the internet. Let me know what you think and any film suggestion that gives you that same feeling like this film has left me and hopefully leaves you as well.",
