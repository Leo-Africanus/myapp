        "content": "Hi r/movies,\n\nI\u2019m Mark Dossett, creator of The Town That Cried Bigfoot \u2014 a lost 1978 documentary about a small-town Bigfoot hoax that spirals into murder. But the deeper you dig, the stranger it gets \u2014because none of it\u2019s real. Not even the town.\n\nI built this film completely backward \u2014 starting with real 1970s news footage I found, then reverse-engineering a fictional murder, a cryptid hoax, and a made-up southern town buried inside real news footage.\n\nLet\u2019s just say... if you Google \u201cWeyburn, Virginia\u201d while watching, you might start to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAsk me anything about editing the truth into lies, creating fake towns, tricking Google, Bigfoot folklore, Blair Witch-style worldbuilding, or how the hell any of this even worked. Or anything else you want to discuss.\n\n**Film info:**\n\nThe Town That Cried Bigfoot\n\nGenre: Faux Documentary / Mystery / True Crime (kinda sorta)\n\nRuntime: 47 minutes\n\nWritten, Directed &amp; Edited by: Mark Dossett\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\nIn the winter of 1978, four desperate councilmen in Weyburn, Virginia staged a fake Bigfoot sighting to save their town from economic ruin. The plan worked \u2014 until someone turned up dead.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker\u2014 none of this ever happened. The footage is real. The town is fake. The hoax is real enough to show up on MapQuest. This is a hoax within a hoax \u2014 crafted to feel like a lost documentary buried in public access archives.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg)\n\n**Where to Watch:**\n\nAmazon Prime Video: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN)\n\nGumroad (Download the full film for $5 and support the filmmaker):\n\n[https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film](https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film)\n\nOfficial Merch: [https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com](https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com)\n\nAlso streaming on select free platforms: Stash TV, Fawesome TV, and Xumo.\n\nAsk me anything!

He was lucky the one guy joined him, otherwise the kid would have gotten the chair.\n\nThen he brings up all the holes in the evidence, and breaks the others one at a time. Why didn\u2019t he do that before even the first vote? Or at least before agreeing to the second one? Much of the evidence was questionable, and he was clearly prepared to talk about it.\n\nOtherwise I loved it.",

        "content": "A quick AI translate from Swedish television:\n\n**\"After the Revelation: Hans Crispin Has Sold the Legendary Jerry Lewis Film**  \nUpdated yesterday at 22:31, Published yesterday at 10:03\n\n\u2013 I received a modest sum, says Hans Crispin to Kulturnyheterna. But I can't tell who bought \"The Day the Clown Cried.\"\n\nHans Crispin's pirate copy of the legendary Jerry Lewis film is the only known complete version.\n\nSwedish actor and TV personality Hans Crispin recently revealed to the magazine Icon that in 1980 he stole a film reel of the legendary Jerry Lewis film \"The Day the Clown Cried\" and made a pirated copy, which he has kept for 45 years.\n\nAfter that, he also invited SVT Kulturnyheterna to view the film.\n\nThe news gained international attention and was covered by Newsweek and Vulture, among others.\n\n**Only Known Copy**  \nThe film, which is about a clown in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, has never been publicly shown and is considered a \"holy grail\" for film enthusiasts. It has long been regarded as lost; the copy Crispin has is the only known version with intact editing and sound.\n\nHans Crispin, who at the time worked copying porn films to VHS at Europafilm, stole the film along with a co-conspirator and kept it in secret for decades.\n\nIn the Kulturnyheterna interview a few weeks ago, he said he was now done with the secret and ready to pass it on to the next generation. And he has done so.\n\n\u2013 I have sold it. For a modest sum. I can't reveal more. They came here and watched it. They made an offer. I accepted it, signed a paper, and promised not to tell anything more.\n\n**\"You're not supposed to do that\"**  \nWhen asked how he feels about having sold something he in a \"J\u00f6nssonligan-like\" scheme stole and pirated so long ago, he responds that he has reflected on it over the years.\n\n\u2013 Yes, I stole it. I did. And I've thought about it \u2014 you're not supposed to do that. That's how it is. But I really wanted to preserve it. And I looked up the statute of limitations a long time ago. Two years. And the rights to this film are so tangled that no one really knows who has rights to this copy.\n\n**How does it feel now, that your big secret is out?**\n\n\u2013 A bit empty, actually. I mean, I can't watch the film anymore. I\u2019ve always been able to before. Or show it to someone. You and Caroline Hainer were the last to see \"The Day the Clown Cried\" at my place.\n\nKulturnyheterna's freelance critic Caroline Hainer shared the story of Hans Crispin in the magazine Icon. However, she believes that the film will likely be accessible to a wider audience in the future.\n\n\u2013 Of course, there are financial interests. Jerry Lewis was one of the biggest comedians in the US in the 1950s. I guess it has fallen into the hands of someone who wants to distribute it. I would say there\u2019s a risk that the public might see it. It\u2019s a bad film.\"\n\nSource:\u00a0[Hans \u201dJ\u00f6nssonligan-kupp\u201d blev en v\u00e4rldsnyhet \u2013 nu har han s\u00e5lt den legendariska filmen | SVT Nyheter](https://www.svt.se/kultur/efter-avslojandet-hans-crispin-har-salt-den-legendariska-filmen)",

But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1888624/elio-pixar-movie-review/) (75):\n\n&gt;The frenetic pace may keep kids hooked, but parents will appreciate the sequences when Elio hits the pause button and allows audiences to sit in the silence \u2014 of complicated ideas, of emotionally challenging conversations, and of the wonders around us we too often fail to appreciate.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/elio-review-pixar/) (70):\n\n&gt;But despite how charming and fun Elio is, it still falls prey to some of Pixar\u2019s occasional problems. Yes, this is a story of intergalactic adventures and a wide universe of possibilities, but it still can get a bit convoluted at times.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/elio-review-pixar):\n\n&gt;Overall, it\u2019s an entertaining bit of summer fun.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/elio/) (80):\n\n&gt;Robert Zemeckis\u2019 Contact for kids.

The cosmic misadventure introduces Elio, a space fanatic with an active imagination and a huge alien obsession. So, when he's beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide, Elio's all in for the epic undertaking. Mistakenly identified as Earth's leader, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and somehow discover who and where he is truly meant to be.",

        "title": "Movies where the characters don't mind living a simple life and don't strive for materialistic success (big house, money, expensive cars &amp; clothes, status), or where the characters marry down.",
        "content": "For example, in Health Ledger's A Knight's Tale, Heath Ledger's love interest is from a rich family, but she doesnt hesitate in talking about running away to live with Heath Ledger's character who is very poor. Heath's character says that she'll live with the pigs, and she says \"yes, with the pigs\". \ud83d\udc16\n\nIn today's Western society, i see on social media and instagram that it looks like everyone is trying to get the best car, best clothes, best holiday destinations, expensive high end restaurants, big houses, social status, money, beautiful dresses and suits. It becomes a comparison game.\n\nSo it'd be really refreshing to have some movie recommendations where the characters are literally perfectly okay with living in a humble, simple life.\n\nEdit: I realise there's probably lots of movies that demonstrate this, but could you just give me some movie recommendations. Because this societal materialistic concept is something I struggle with. I dont want to go with the societal flow. I want to be okay with a simple life.",

        "title": "Joseph Kosinski's 'F1' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie): 85% (59 reviews) with 7.10 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/f1-the-movie/): 69/100 (24 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; The impressive craft of these scenes extends to Kosinki\u2019s exploration of the various technologies, like road simulators, used to help drivers gain any advantage. Of course, there are some unrealistic elements in F1, moments that might have sticklers raising an eyebrow, but the film doesn\u2019t feel any less dramatic than the real thing.\n\n-[Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-damson-idris-joseph-kosinski-1236291870/)\n\n&gt; The action is hardly dull, but the sheer disconnect between the wowee zowee immediacy of the race footage and the mezzo mezzo excitement it inspires suggests that tuning out the noise isn\u2019t as easy as Sonny Hayes might seem to think. \u201cSometimes when you lose, you win,\u201d Ruben tells his old friend. And sometimes when you win, this solid but underwhelming blockbuster contends, you still lose.  \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt-1235133092/): C+\n\n&gt; With the action confined to stadium racetracks, you wonder why Kosinski didn\u2019t give the audience more of a consistent eagle\u2019s-eye overview; that would have helped. But maybe he just counted on the thrill of speed, and the specter of death, to be the film\u2019s engine. Is there a suck-in-your-breath cataclysmic crash? Of course there is, but we\u2019re invited to exhale from its consequences too easily. In \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d someone asks why race drivers do what they do, and a racer\u2019s girlfriend replies, \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to go very fast.\u201d Yes it is, but that in itself isn\u2019t enough to make a marvelous movie.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/f1-review-brad-pitt-javier-bardem-damson-idris-1236432987/)\n\n&gt; Top Gun: Maverick's Joseph Kosinski assembles an all-star crew in front of and behind the camera for F1, and they craft a technical marvel of a movie. It\u2019s gorgeous and thrilling to look at, with top-notch editing backing up Brad Pitt\u2019s IMAX-consuming charisma. It's a faithful devotee to the sports-movie formula that\u2019s kept from greatness by a few too many unnecessary components and a finish line that maybe should\u2019ve been closer than two and a half hours away. But in spite of that, it\u2019s still a hell of a ride.\n\n-[Clint Gage, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinsky): 7/10 \"good\"\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d is slick enough to capture your attention for an hour and a half. Again, unfortunately, it\u2019s 2 1/2 hours long. The repetitive story, stale characterizations, portentous self-celebration and oddly flaccid take on the masculine drive just keep puttering along, long after our interest has waned. It\u2019s a classic car that looks brand new \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t had a lube job in decades.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt/)\n\n&gt; Motor racing is a sport in which constituent team members seem to be competing against each other as much as against the opposition, and so it ought to be an ideal subject for a movie treatment. There\u2019s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular.\n\n-[Pete Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt): 4/5\n\n&gt; Whether or not it finds it audience (and there are probably a lot of easter eggs for viewers who know a hell of a lot more about Formula One than I do), F1 is proof that brand Pitt is still a viable option and, like Tom Cruise, can still hold a movie the old-fashioned way, putting pedal to the metal.\n\n-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinski-old-school-racing-drama-1236435474/)\n\n&gt; Joseph Kosinski has done it again. F1 combines unparalleled access, pioneering filmmaking and moving redemption arcs to deliver an exhilarating cinematic experience. What will he attach a camera to next?\n\n-[Sophie Butcher, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/f1-the-movie/): 4/5\n\n&gt; With those warnings in place, buckle in. For flash and rumble, F1 doesn't have an equal this summer. Roll down the windows and enjoy the ride.\n\n-[Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/f1-review-brad-pitt-phenomenal-racing-scenes-dull-script-11755916)\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d leans extremely rousing, though intrigues when it mines the strategic idiosyncrasies of the motorsport and the psychological and physical toll it takes to be a champion. There\u2019s a mental health angle touched on that, if explored more, would have led to a great albeit bleaker movie. Not that this thing deserves a participation trophy. Watching Pitt burn this much rubber, and with macho panache, puts \"F1\" in the winners' circle.\n\n-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/17/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt/84222638007/): 3/4\n\n&gt; F1 couldn\u2019t feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that\u2019s the current obsession of millions, yet couldn\u2019t feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P. This what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.\n\n-[David Fear, Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/f1-review-brad-pitt-formula-one-1235353444/)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nSonny Hayes, a Formula One driver who raced in the 1990s, has a horrible crash, forcing him to retire from Formula One and start racing in other disciplines.
