        "content": "I don't like to praise random films that I like, but as I'm rewatching The Manhattan Project, I'm struck every time by how *good* it is. Far beyond what is expected. \n\nChristopher Collett is incredible. His protagonist is smart, way beyond smart in some ways (and oblivious in othes), but also charming, athletic, has good relationships with adults in his life, and he's also a bit of a smarmy asshole. He's like Zack Morris, if he had the brain of Screech but the inability to think past the immediate like Zack often does. He's almost a prototype for the Mark Zuckerberg character in The Social Network.\n\nThe film doesn't rely on stereotypes. Cynthia Nixon's performance is so elegantly subtle. Her mature perception of the situation, her subtle delivery of dialogue,her ability to evoke emotion with a word or a gesture--it all works so well. And John Lithgow is such a smart and likable guy, it's hard to not feel bad for him as the situation gets worse and worse. And John Mahoney is the perfect no-nonsense military man who also is honest and direct about the role people play in the military-industrial complex.\n\nThe main character is a kid who constructed a nuclear bomb not to harm anyone, but just to see if he could. He's a mad scientist in the purest sense of the label. And the schemes he creates to get the materials, to escape once caught, and to deal with the aftermath are both extremely clever and highly realistic. \n\nOh, and the group of nerds are hilarious. And did I mention Robert Sean Leonard had a small role in it?\n\nMy last plug for watching this film: Roger Ebert gave it four (4) stars.\n",

        "content": "So I want to talk a bit about creature design in movies, TV shows and even games. I get that it is and was often a budget and technical thing, but I am kinda sad that movies and TV shows are hardly ever very creative, when it comes to creature design.\n\nLike most are actually very humanoid, have two arms, two legs, eyes, ears etc. They often even move in very \"normal\" ways, some are different but still like creatures that we know, spiders, horses, dogs. You could do so much already if you just changed up how creatures move, have It very smooth or very abrupt.. \n\nI read once that that also has psychological reasons, that if a thing that looks relatable to us humans is easier to be afraid of, or even easier, if we are already afraid of spiders, we come already pre-afraid of spider like aliens, which sounds kinda cheap to me. But I'd say if you managed to make something so alien we don't understand it and then terrify/or fascinate (doesn't need to be horror) us with its actions, it would be even better. \n\nThere are very few exceptions like the creature from nope! comes to mind first that was at least so alien, that it made me come up with this topic in the first place, even though it also has similarities with some deep sea creatures and it's behaviors. Or the things from arrival that still basically are octopus-adjacent.. \n\n**So what are the most alien designs out there? Why aren't there more of them, at least now in the age of cgi? Does the human mind have trouble coming up with something truly original?**\n\nAlso for games it's weird, since you have to create the creature from the start anyway, so why not go wild? But I guess it's easier to animate and rig if it's animal like. Respect to mass effect for trying at least a little bit.",

        "content": "I know it might be more on the popular side but still I really wish that the second french empire to third french republic period was more depicted on film (1850s to 1940). I guess the latter is more found in adaptations of Jules Verne\u2019s stories and Tintin and some steampunk but not much beyond that.  The french colonial empire as a whole isn\u2019t as popular in movie world as its British rival i guess so that might be a reason.\n\nSo anyway whats yours? And please include some of your favorite movies or tv shows set in those eras",
