I had seen all of them except Cobra and The Hitman.  So, I decided to pop it in this morning, and it was awful, almost unbearable to watch.  It's your usual run of the mill partner turns on the good cop action movie where the good cop seeks revenge, however, the acting in this movie was atrocious, especially from Chuck Norris.  Emotion was non-existent.  Every scene with him looked like he was spacing out, staring into the void, reciting a handful of boring lines.  He looked so uninterested, even when teaching a bullied teen how to stick up for himself.  Is this the norm for his movies?  Is he worse than 90s Steven Seagal?  How did Walker, Texas Ranger run for almost ten years?  Please tell Cobra is better than this movie.",

        "content": "It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.  Driver's average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" (94/100), Coen Brothers' \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (93/100), Jarmush's \"Paterson\" (90/100) and Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" (87/100) at the top.\n\nOther than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you'd struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver.  For example,  Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).\n\nDriver seems to seek out roles like he's adding great directors to his Pok\u00e9dex.\n\n**Adam Driver's Pokedex:**\n\n**1. Martin Scorsese**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Silence* (2016)\n* **Notable Films**: *Taxi Driver* (1976), *Goodfellas* (1990), *Raging Bull* (1980)\n\n**2.

Terry Gilliam**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *The Man Who Killed Don Quixote* (2018)\n* **Notable Films**: *Brazil* (1985), *12 Monkeys* (1995), *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* (1998)\n\n**13. Leos Carax**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Annette* (2021)\n* **Notable Films**: *Holy Motors* (2012), *The Lovers on the Bridge* (1991)\n\n**14. J.J. Abrams**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Films**: *Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens* (2015), *Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker* (2019)\n* **Notable Films**: *Star Trek* (2009), *Super 8* (2011), *Mission: Impossible III* (2006)\n\n**15.

Jeff Nichols**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Midnight Special* (2016)\n* **Notable Films**: *Take Shelter* (2011), *Mud* (2012), *Loving* (2016)\n\n**Additional Thoughts**\n\n* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's \"Megalopolis\", Gilliam's \"Man who Killed Don Quixote\", Ridley Scott's \"House of Gucci\" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.\n* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like \"Hey... my boy is ready when you are\".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?\n* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",

Famous af people with two lines. Literally every aspect of filmmaking is turned to 11. Warren Beaty does NOT get his proper flowers. This is a masterpiece. No question. But it\u2019s never spoken about with the other masterpieces. Hell, it\u2019s never spoken about at all. Everything about this world works. The film\u2019s almost futuristic in its depiction of the past. I isn\u2019t mention anything specific because there\u2019s so much. But I\u2019m deliriously entertained for a Sunday afternoon. ",

A movie isn\u2019t automatically bad just because it didn\u2019t keep you awake while you were already running on fumes. If you missed entire chunks of the story, your critique holds zero weight.\n\nAt least be honest and say, \"I fell asleep, I need to rewatch it, but what I saw I didn\u2019t like.\u201d instead of slamming the movie.",

He\n\n- works hard\n- is generous with his friends and colleagues\n- has pain in his heart from childhood trauma but rather than feel sorry for himself, he tries to pay forward any kindness he has received\n- protects and provides for his loved ones\n- has compassion with those less fortunate than him\n- does the morally right thing despite overwhelming cost and risk to himself\n\nIt's a quiet but intensely profound film and it has deeply impressed and inspired me.",

Not out of anger or any kind of extreme emotion, but I was just so uninterested and underwhelmed that without even thinking I just found myself causally get up and leave to go do something else.\n\nAnyone else have any movies they interested in, or even hyped to see, only to find them surprisingly disappointing or underwhelming?

I found it in a Roger Ebert book of 100 Great Movies and I\u2019m trying to watch all the ones I havent seen this year. \n\nThis one was truly amazing. Its a noir romance crime story - the classic affair with a rich husband but even with its well known played out plot this movie remains completely surprising with true twists and turns and keeps you enthralled the whole time. \n\nUpon reviewing the movie I found out the writer wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark! Arguably the best Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies made. \n\nAnyway I highly recommend to anyone who has not seen it and am curious who else has and if you have any other comments about it or film recommendations!",
