        "content": "Not sure if there is a better place to post this. Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.\n\nEveryone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.\n\nThe movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are \"timekeeper\" cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).\n\nBut the movie never fully explains more from there, and then turns generic. Amanda Seyfrieds character is a rich man's daughter who almost immediately falls in love with the protagonist and joins his fight against the system. They fight the system by randomly robbing banks and distributing time.\n\nCillian Murphy also plays the main Timekeeper cop, but is oddly overzealous about enforcing a bizarrely shitty system. Hes shown to have an insane amount of loyalty to the rigid class structure *despite being born and raised in the ghetto*. He \"made it out\" somehow, but then devotes his life to making sure others don't, and then dies from it because he was still pretty damn poor as a cop.\n\nOverall still an interesting watch but just wish we got a lot more. Background on the system and more explanations would have been way better than a generic love story and cookie cutter standoff.\n\nIts been a while since this came out, but anyone else think similar?\n\n\n",

        "title": "'Ella McCay' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Set in an unnamed state in 2008, an idealistic 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles familial issues and a challenging work life while preparing to take over the job of her mentor, the state's longtime incumbent governor, who suddenly accepts a cabinet position in the incoming Obama administration.*\n\nCast: Emma Mackey, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Lowden, Woody Harrelson, Rebecca Hall\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 21%\n\nMetacritic: 41\n\nSome reviews:\n\nJocelyn Noveck, Associated Press 1/4 - It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\u201d? \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d?\n\nJohnny Oleksinski, New York Post 1/4 - This sloppy slog is terrible; short, but interminable.\n\nMoira MacDonald, Seattle Times 2.5/4 - It\u2019s not at all unpleasant spending two hours with Ella and her family and colleagues, but it leaves you feeling a little nostalgic for what it could have been.\n\nRadheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - Ella McCay, the movie, feels like we\u2019re being bear hugged by a lovable, slightly boozy old grand-uncle who genuinely hopes to find common ground with a new generation, but also can\u2019t help being a little patronizing.\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast - Its phoniness epitomized by Emma Mackey\u2019s lead turn, it\u2019s the biggest dud of the artist\u2019s career, and the holiday season\u2019s most egregious misfire.\n\nOdie Henderson, Boston Globe 2/4 - Ella McCay never registers as a real person; she\u2019s a collection of tics that Mackey desperately tries to play.\n\nVikram Murthi, IndieWire B - Watching \u201cElla McCay\u201d can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you\u2019re capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found.\n\nTim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) 1/5 - There\u2019s not a great deal more to be said about the experience, except that it is best politely avoided, like a Christmas invitation from neighbours you find chirpy, well-meaning and off-puttingly strange on every collision.\n\nTara Brady, Irish Times 3/5 - At 85, Brooks retains an instinct for human foibles and complex characters, even if on this occasion the material doesn\u2019t always live up to his cast.\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - This comedy-drama contains some of the crackling dialogue and disarming candour of Brooks\u2019 best work. Ultimately, however, this disjointed character study ultimately feels as messy as its heroine\u2019s life.\n\nAdrian Horton, Guardian 2/5 - Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess -- a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way.\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, TheWrap - 'Ella McCay' is a film about American politics in the same way that Pixar\u2019s 'Cars' is a movie about cars. As in yes, these are definitely films about politics and cars. But no, politics and cars don't work like that.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - Almost everyone here is trying way too hard, with the exception of Mackey, who\u2019s appealing and natural even when stuck in a phony world full of phony characters.\n\nTaylor Williams, Slant Magazine 2/4 - As it follows its main character navigating political and personal waters, James L. Brook\u2019s film finds itself poised between sincerity and artificiality\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes page:\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ella_mccay\n\nMetacritic page:\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/movie/ella-mccay/",

        "title": "Did you ever find something in the Extra Features of a DVD that took you completely by surprise?",
        "content": "I was just thinking about the decline of DVDs as a format for home theater. The Extras are something of a lost art by now, as a result. Then I remembered this time I discovered a really out-there deleted scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sgsj5rob5ype1.jpeg\n\n\nWe had this movie on DVD back in the day, and my brothers and I were dicking around with the extras after having finished watching the film itself. I don't know how well any of you remember your mid-aughts Rowan Atkinson movies, but towards the middle Mr. Bean has to hitchhike his way across France to get to the Cannes Film Festival, despite not speaking French. He's picked up by Sabine, the female lead, who assumes he's a Russian director or something. This is where the cut scene takes place. \n\nBasically, it's an extended sequence where, through an escalating series of misunderstandings, Sabine starts to question her career and her life's work, pulls the car over, and lays down on the street, screaming \"je veux mourir (I want to die)\". Now, you might be asking yourself \"isn't this a comedy movie?\", and you would be right. The whole affair is played for laughs. You see, it's the middle of the French countryside, so the highway doesn't have any other cars on it. Sabine is forced to wait until a vehicle in either direction shows up to end her misery. Mr. Bean, who has no clue what's happening, just bumbles around asking \"Cannes?\". Until a truck approaches, and he starts to panic. He unsuccessfully coaxes her to get off the street, and then she grabs onto his shoe, saying something about how they should die together(???). I don't even remember how this sequence ends, but in order for it to fit into the larger film, either they must have rewritten/reshot a bunch of stuff, or the intention was for them to get back in the car and never mention or acknowledge what happened ever again.\n\nHonestly, it's not hard to see why they cut this scene. I feel bad saying that because of all the work they put in, especially the actress, but it's overly long, it doesn't really suit the movie that it's in, it's in poor taste and highly inappropriate, and most damning of all: it just isn't very funny. \n\nStill, it's a wild and unexpected ride that I never would have experienced if I had just seen Mr. Bean's Holiday on some kind of streaming service. What was the most off-guard a DVD extra has ever caught you?\n\nEDIT: I found the scene on Youtube. If you're wondering how it ends, the scene just cuts right as the truck seemingly drives over Sabine. Guess we can consider it an alternate ending? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WrxyOZYizd8?si=mOWoV_SPkkrFo7zE&amp;t=467",
