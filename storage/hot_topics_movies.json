However, I think a key part of that experience is the petty-yet-undeniably-righteous thrill of seeing a critic or fan tear into a truly terrible flick. Negative? Granted. Often a thing of beauty? Definitely.\n\nMy favourite, and a contender for greatest of all time, is this autopsy of Steven Seagal's *Contract to Kill:*\n\n&gt;Seagal...walks stiffly and very slowly. It is possible that he never once bends at the waist. Most of the movie, he spends sitting down or walking (again, slowly) up and down flights of stairs. There is a love scene - and, Jesus, what a love scene. His fully dressed body is lowered over a naked woman like a drawbridge.\n\nhttps://www.avclub.com/contract-to-kill-isn-t-just-bad-it-s-steven-seagal-bad-1798189772\n\nSo, movie fans...what reviews live in your head rent-free?",

        "content": "one of my favorite movies of last year was zach cregger's weapons. i'm not gonna go into a long diatribe about how good this movie is because pretty much everyone has already praised it to high heaven. however, one thing i will comment on is cregger's intention of making a prequel about aunt gladys.\n\naunt gladys is the main villain of the film and is easily one of the best villains of the 2020s. not only is she played to perfection by amy madigan but she's a very layered character who's extremely interesting to watch. aunt gladys is easily the most memorable thing about the movie. and it seems like cregger agrees since he plans to make a prequel about gladys.\n\nhere's the thing though. i feel that explaining gladys's origins will ruin a large part of what made her so interesting. her ambiguity.\n\npart of what makes gladys such a scary villain is how little we know about her. all we know for sure is that she's some kind of witch. other than that, we know next to nothing about her. we don't know exactly how old she is, we don't know if she really is alex's aunt, we don't even know if she's really human. and it's that uncertainty that makes her so interesting and so horrifying.\n\nto make a prequel explaining her origins, however good it ends up being, will ruin a large part of what makes gladys such an interesting character. as cliche as it may be to say, when done right, less can be more. and sometimes, what you DON'T see is more scary than what you DO.\n\nthis is also part of why i haven't watched welcome to derry. i don't WANT to know exactly what pennywise is. part of the horror is not knowing.\n\ni just don't get why nothing can be a mystery in modern media anymore. what's next? a pulp fiction prequel where we find out what's in the briefcase? people say that modern media has gone downhill. while i don't really agree with that sentiment, there are some flaws that permeate modern media. and that is the constant hand holding.",

Some suggestions seem really interesting.\n\nI've seen all three lord of the rings. ",

I really don't remember if the soundtrack was good, but I'm guessing I enjoyed it since I bought it, but Idr that it was a pretty unanimous feeling among my whole friend group that the movie sucked. I remember one friend walked out and waited for us rather than sitting through it. Part of me wants to watch it again just to see if I still think it's bad. ",

And yet, it left me speechless.\n\nI don't think I've ever had so much fun and felt so involved watching a film. Byrne and the rest of the band not only manage to bring all their songs to life perfectly, but they do something even more difficult: they make them believable. The cinematography is simple, precise, and tries to make room for all the characters, while the audience is revealed only in the final moments. The set design changes as the songs progress, and the frontman's movements reflect the mood of the song. The song list is also wonderful, each one better than the last.\n\nSo, what do you think of Stop Making Sense?",
