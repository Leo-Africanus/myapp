        "content": "We all complain about how modern trailers have a tendency to spoil everything about the movie except maybe the big twist or the ending, and sometimes even those are not safe. Which is why it's surprising when something completely unexpected happens in the movie, not because it's something actually unexpected, but because the trailers and marketing completely omitted it. Sometimes even entire characters will be mostly absent from the marketing but turn out to be more important than some celebrities in the film that got top billing. Often this isn't even intentional, the people in charge of marketing just prioritized other things.\n\nSo what plot points/characters were you surprised weren't spoiled by the trailers?",

I often watch The Raid and Dredd back to back as a double feature movie weekend.\n\nRambo (2008) - once Rambo enters action mode, the rest of the movie is just rip and tear.\n\nBorn to Fight (2004 - Thailand, by Panna Rittikrai of Ong Bak, and The Protector) - terrorists takes over a village, then the rest of the movie is the villagers fighting back, with one fantastic action scene after another.",

Nothing about this movie screams antiquity in the slightest. Bill Nighy was basically just Jetfire from Transformers 2. Villain is a big rock lava monster. The small monsters are **literally** the Chitauri? \n\nI finished the movie 20 minutes ago and I could not tell you what happens in the first third of it. \n\nIt\u2019s riddled with 2010s era action movie tropes. Hero saying \u201coh come on, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Dafuq. I don\u2019t need him to speak Ancient Greek but can Perseus please not sound like a Will Smith hero circa 2005? If Perseus had said \u201cI\u2019m putting together a crew for one last job\u201d it wouldn\u2019t have felt out of place for this movie. \n\nCan you guys think of some movies as generic as this? Like just one predictable trope or line after another, no soul to the story, interchangeable monsters, etc",

Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

I've read the complaints and I must agree, people who have seen the first two movies don't wonder if it's all real because they know they really have powers, and fans of the trilogy just find the end underwhelming. So, in a way, the best way to enjoy this movie is to either watch it before the other two, or to not watch them. Does anyone else feel this way?",

        "title": "Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.",
        "content": "Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.\n\nThe movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. \n\nI'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.\n\nThis movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. \n\nThe action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.\n\nAmy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.\n \nThere's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. &gt;!The public sex scene!&lt;. This scene kind of has a &gt;!rapey!&lt; moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.\n\nI feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.\n\nEdit: &gt;!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!&lt;",

        "content": "I liked this movie.  I just wanted to say that, regardless of who you side with in the movie (I found myself either agreeing with both in different situations, or at least empathizing with each character in instances where I disagreed), what hit me the most was the CIVIL discourse that occurred.  The both LISTENED to each other.  Neither was interrupting the other.  No personal attacks.  No talking over each other.  Nothing like \"I'm right and you're wrong\".\n\nWhen I think of discussions that I've had in real life, it usually ends up the opposite.  Friends constantly interrupting each other and being dismissive of each others' opinions.  And personal attacks galore!\n\nNow I know this is just a movie, and it's possible that situations like this movie possibly occur in real life, but I just don't think it's common.\n\n  \nI will add that I was very much surprised that Troma Inc was involved in the production of this movie.  I LOVE Troma movies, and I always associated them with the awesome B-horror flicks.  So that was probably the biggest surprise.",

        "content": "I vaguely remember this movie about a terraforming colony (on a pretty forested planet) that loses power and some members go in search of restoring power by following these huge power line poles left by the original colony constructors.  They also want to know what happened to an old colony that went silent.  Only to find out some are still living there but were attacked.  As they follow the power lines they are being hunted by aliens (or people can't remember).  They come across this HUGE (human if I recall) derelict crashed ship  (near the power lines) and end up restoring the power (while fighting off aliens or those hunting them) through the ship to those lines to give power back to the colonies.  It takes place on another planet and it was a fairly recent movie.  I remember the town being pretty run down too.  Then again I could be going crazy and remembering this wrong.\n\nNo it's not Aliens, Prospect or The Colony ;)",
