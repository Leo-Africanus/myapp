We\u2019ve both spent decades working in the industry, garnering awards, and working on some of the biggest movies in Hollywood.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on Ridley Scott projects previously, and between the two of us, we\u2019ve worked on franchises like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Alien. With an eye for detail, and a love of storytelling, our passion for outfitting the right actors in the perfect wardrobes is very special to us both.\n\nIf you want to know more about the process, the methods, and the artistry of costume design for big, epic movies, we\u2019re here to take your questions.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\n\n* [Janty Yates](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946765/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703178&amp;usg=AOvVaw3l_HfawFgp6Rgx07DWbfZl), Costume Designer. Yates has worked in this field since 1989 and has two Academy Award nominations, including one win.

I'll start us of with this:\n\nThe rumour about A Quiet Place originally being written as a Cloverfield sequel. This is not true. The writers wrote the story, then upon speaking to their representatives, they learned that Bad Robot was looping in pre-existing screenplays into the Cloververse, which became a cause for concern for the two writers. It was Paramount who decided against this, and allowed the film to be developed and released independently of the Cloververse as intended. \n\nEdit: As suggested in the comments, don't forget to provide sources to properly prevent the spread of more rumours. I'll start:\n\n[Here's my source about A Quiet Place](https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/a-quiet-place-cloverfield-1201950098/)",

Seeing people cruelty snatch waffle makers out of each others hands as they bleed from broken glass was pretty wild, then the scalp getting torn off when the woman\u2019s hair was stuck to the customers shopping cart.

In The Rock's case it almost seems like it's just a requirement for him appearing in the movie.  Does he actually get involved in getting the movie made beyond slapping his name on it?  Meanwhile I've seen a lot of Plan B movies that don't have Brad Pitt in them, so I'm guessing they're actually involved in getting the movie produced.\n\nSo what's the typical involvement like? What differentiates a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson from a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson &amp; Produced by Seven Bucks?  And why/how are these different than just \"Executive Producer Nicole Kidman\" or something?",

The movie itself was pretty average although I now understand it\u2019s a cult classic having read up on it after watching.\n\nI gotta say, Nic Cage gives an incredibly wild performance which I\u2019m still trying to determine if this was a classic case of Nic Cage overacting antics or he was in fact just brilliant. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure is he was 100% committed to the role, and I was there with him all the way despite the quality of the movie. It\u2019s like watching someone who is way over the top, but he makes you believe that he believes in himself and what he is doing.\n\nHe\u2019s a remarkable person, strange and fascinating, eccentric and spot on at times in his acting performances. The guy can act when he puts his mind to it, as witnessed in Pig where he was much more subtle. Then you see him in something like Colour Out Of Space, his performance was eccentric to say the least but still watchable all the same like you can\u2019t take your eyes off of him. At times you cringe when he goes off the reservation and other times you\u2019re in awe of his more memorable performances thinking \u201cIs this the same guy??\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his Vampire\u2019s Kiss role?",

My baby will be a cinephile if I have anything to say about it, in this family anyway.\n\nLike I love The Goonies, but I'm not gonna show that to her at 2. \n\nBedknobs and Broomsticks can probably be shown around 2, but that's what I'm trying to figure out.

For movies I like a pretty wide range, from Get Out to The Fall Guy to cheesy Hallmark type stuff for the holidays. I\u2019m 31F btw if it matters. Thanks in advance!",

The person that existed was the murderer in the end and it doesn't matter, right? Or is he just astonished by the level of trickery?",

The only problem is that a lot of the good ones require a paid subscription or rental fees, and it really adds up!\n\nDoes anyone know any legit, free websites where I can watch documentaries without needing a subscription? I'm open to suggestions for specific platforms or any hidden gems you all use. Thanks in advance for the help!\n\nP.S. If there are any good YouTube channels with high-quality docs, feel free to drop those as well!",
