She's at the wrong place.\n\n&gt;Bob finds Chris on the porch waiting for him as a dramatic sting hits. \n\nIt's a pretty common trope in thrillers and action and the earliest example I could think of off the top of my head is Silence of the Lambs, but I wouldn't be surprised if it existed much earlier.

I feel like this movie doesnt get talked about nearly enough. It has an absolutely stacked cast, with Christian Bale, Wes Studi, Stephen Lang, Jesse Plemons, Ben Foster, Timothee Chalamet, all nailing their respective parts. And of course Rosamund Pike (who basically stole the show with her performance, in my opinion), also Rory Cochrane, who played the heavily-bearded Sergeant who was depressed. I loved that performance from him. Such a great movie with an intense opening sequence, beautiful cinematography, and a great score.",

        "title": "I watched Pacific Rim and it's now my favourite monster movie",
        "content": "So, i spent some time without watching any movies, months in fact, then, some days ago i opened Max and watched Godzilla vs kong, the new Empire. I loves this movie, and watched the rest of the monsterverse. My favourite were the skull Island and king of the Monsters. Skull Island for its story and human character and the Vietnan war feeling of the movie (its almost an horror movie - i think, i don't watch horror movies - venturing in a unknown land and slowly losing members), and King of the monster for its destruction and action scenes. \n\nI say this because what i feel my favourite thing about PR is the mix of these elements. I initialy thought that the humans would be boring, and that too much time would be spend on the base with nothing happening. And while we spend a lot of the movie in that base, i actually liked the characters. I feel some things in this movie were resolved top fast, i'm thinking about Chuck, we don't spend enough time with him to care about his daddy issues or even which issues he has, so i feel the scene where he says goodbye to his dad and they make amends to be lacking. And the sacrifice at the end only has any weight because Pentecost. \n\nI liked Mori and all her drama, and loved the scene on her memories,\n\nThe fights were epic, and it was this combination of a good story with the epic scenes and fights that made me like this movie. But i also will say that there's a high chance that the story isn't even good and full of plot holes, but i rarely gets any plot hole, i rarely notice them, so i say i liked the story, but i won't say it's good. \n\nOne think i disliked was Hannibal's death, The baby kaiju appears, scares everyone, dies, kills him and then dies again, it felt so pointless to do that, they could just had killed the characters the first time the baby gets out the mother. I think i didn't disliked the death in itself, just that the kaiju goes back to life to perform It and then dies again. \n\n\nI didn't really liked the Cancel the apocalypse speech, not that i could write something better, but it felt too short and not epic enough. \nI didn't care for the doctors though,and disliked their introduction. \n\nBut i prefered the one that goes on a missison to get the brain, and only because of the worldbuilding, which i loved, i liked seeing how the world worked, even If the focus was on the black market and selling kaiju's shit and ticks. \n\nThe sound track is awesome. \n\nI don't have a lot of things do say about this movie other than i liked it and feel that it mixed very well human character and their dramas and stories and epic fights, but it's what makes me like this movie more than the monsterverse ones, it mixes, kong was good because of its characters, and Godzilla 2 because of its Epicness, and Pacific rim had both\n\n",
