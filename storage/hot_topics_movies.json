(Even though he is not really as perfect as he thinks) \n\nAs the title implies, I\u2019m looking for suggestions for movies similar to this. They don\u2019t all have to be Hitman movies.

        "content": "in my opinion, the scariest movie ending is the ending of the original the fly. although i prefer the cronenberg remake, the original film is a solid movie and the ending is more disturbing then anything that cronenberg could have cooked up. it's scary and disturbing on so many levels to the point that, no matter how many times i watch the movie, the ending still gives me chills.\n\nfor starters. this ending plays exploits so many phobias at once. arachnophobia is the obvious one but there's also vorarephobia, the fear of being eaten alive.\n\nand then, there's the fact that we finally get a good look at how the fly with andre's head and arm looks and it's...freaky. for some reason, the fly is bald and looks rather old. it looks rather creepy. and when the fly speaks, it doesn't really mouth words but just kinda opens and closes it's mouth in a rather unnatural way. \n\nand speaking of the fly, throughout the whole thing, the fly is begging and pleading for it's life. you'd think that the high pitched vocals would make the scene less scary but i would actually argue that it makes it MORE scary. fun fact, while filming the scene, vincent price and herbert marshall had a hard time filming the scene without bursting out laughing upon hearing the high pitched voice. how much are you willing to bet that they weren't laughing when they saw the finished product? \n\nand then, there is the spider itself. this scene gets us up close and personal with the spider and it looks terrifying. \n\nthere's also the question of whether the fly has andre's brain or if this is a fly trapped in a man's body. the film seems to lean more towards the ladder but that makes things even worse. andre with the fly's head is becoming more and more fly like over the course of the film. as such, it stands to reason that the fly was becoming more human like. for god's sake, the fly learned to speak.\n\nand of course, this already unsettling scene becomes even more so if you know what spiders actually do to their prey. \n\nall these things combined result in one of the scariest endings of any movie ever.",

It is just mind-boggling for me how she switches so effortlessly between roles in thoughtful \"arthous-y\" films on the one end (stuff like Notes on a Scandal, Babel, I'm Not There, Blue Jasmine, Carol and T\u00e1r), and Blockbusters and genre films on the other end (Lord of the Rings &amp; Hobbit, Indiana Jones 4, Robin Hood, Cinderella, Thor: Ragnarok, Ocean's 8, Borderlands). She also did many films that I would put in between these two categories (Elizabeth films, The Aviator, Nightmare Alley, Don't Look Up etc.).\n\nIt just seems to me like she isn't snobby at all and very open to try very different types of roles, as long as it is either interesting or fun.\n\nWho are other actors that you think have a similar career?",

        "content": "I'm looking for suggestions for a double feature, two movies watched back to back that are connected by something oddly specific. The more specific the better. \n\n  \nAs an example, I offer the double feature of Simon West's CON AIR from 1997 followed by John Woo's Hard Target from 1993. The oddly specific connection here is that each film features a main character sporting a mullet, who starts in a denim shirt and takes it off to reveal a white tank top while surrounded by fire. \n\n  \nWhat other oddly specific double features would you recommend? \n\n  \n",
