Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn\u2019t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he\u2019s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too.  \n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it\u2019s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. \n\nSome of my favorites lines in this movie:\n\n*lands on ship* \u2026\u2026.Aaaahhhhhhhhhh\n\nWait! Don\u2019t open that! It\u2019s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don\u2019t know!!!\u2026.sniff sniff\u2026seems like there is air\n\nWe have to get out of here before they kill guy!!\n\nGuy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!?!\n\nBesides\u2026..hehehehehe, I just had this really interesting idea. Guy: Are you stoned?\n\nWell screw that!\n\nThe list goes on. If you haven\u2019t seen it, go watch it!!",

For example, Amon Goth constructing the concentration camp and mercilessly killing the engineer who tried to explain an issue is a powerful display of such evil.

This is something I could admittedly do better at. Specifically, there are two monologues in the film that emphasize \"you never know this is the last time you'll do X.\" \n\nI enjoyed the movie, its themes, and peformances. I was getting ready for bed and thinking about the film in my mind. Maybe 15 minutes after the movie had ended, our baby monitor goes off. I walked into the nursery to replace the pacifier and soothe my kid back to sleep. Then, I connect the dots that this could be the last time I have this kind of moment. I started to weep and really reflect on enjoying these experiences of parenthood. I'm genuinely grateful that the movie made me consider this more closely. \n\nHas anyone else watched and not had an outward response to it intially, but later become emotional when reflecting on that film? If so, what movie had this effect on you?\n\n  \n",

It has a real fun imaginative energy despite the prophetically dark moments here and there. Why wasn't this a bigger deal? Why are the ratings weak? What happened to this movie? Was the message too much of a bummer at the time?",

        "content": "Saw a similar question on r/television and thought it would be an interesting way to jog our memories about older movies. \n\nI was thinking of *West Side Story* (1961). It doesn\u2019t quite work, as there is one obvious exception. But four out of five lead actors are still with us while being quite up in age:\n\nRichard Beymer (Tony): 86\n\nRuss Tamlyn (Riff): 90\n\nRita Moreno (Anita): 93\n\nGeorge Chakiris (Bernardo): 92\n\nBoth the astronauts from *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968) are still around, but Douglass Rain (the voice of H.A.L.) died a couple years back. Similarly, I\u2019m pretty sure *The Sound of Music* worked for a while until Christopher Plummer passed. \n\n",

        "content": "I downloaded 1932 Mummy via torrent back in 2016/2017 and it came with what I recall to be documentary about movie production, possibly DVD extra.\n\nWhile randomly clicking through that documentary, I saw a short scene of mummy walking toward a man, while he fires two shots from shotgun into his stomach from around 2 meters distance, while backing away. Scene had a sound and you could hear dog barking in the background. Effect of shot hiting mummy was very impressive for a time.  \n\nAfter seeing the film and not seeing that scene, I figured it mist have been cut for being too intense. But recently I  heard that not a single cut scene from this movie survived. Now I'm buffled, what have I seen? Was it from some other movie or something?",
