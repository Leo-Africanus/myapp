That's when I saw Bo Burnhams \"Inside\" on the front title screen, ready to  go. I thought, perfect, I loved Bo and I can't wait to zone out and hit the hay. \n\nHoly fuck was I not prepared for that Covid Special. I was sitting straight up and at attention the whole time like a pre-teen watching their first porno. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen if I wanted to. It was exactly the movie/special I needed to see a year into the pandemic. The emotion, progression, and cinematography were unreal. I went to work the next day and couldn't help myself from talking to every person about the show. They had to see it. \n\nAnd now almost 4 years layer to the day, this special takes me back to a time where the whole world was scared out of their mind. An entire younger generation was stuck in time because they couldn't develop socially. \n\nAll I know is, if someone in the far and distant future asks me how the 2020 pandemic was to me, I'll send them a link to Inside by Bo Burnham.

Spectacular performances. I had tough time deciding should I mark it as 8 or 9 on IMDB. \n\nRecommend me more amazing, hidden gems of movies. Any genre, doesn't matter, just want absolute peak cinema.\n\nAnd those of you who haven't seen Thief yet, and enjoy heist, crime capers or noir, this one needs to be high on your must watch list.

Movies like The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo(Fincher) has a very cold feeling because of the snow, which I think really adds to the movie.  \n\nI think alot of movies that take place on mountains don't do well to use the ice and snow as characters in the movie.  Cliffhanger and Everest for example.  Not my type.\n\nCan't think too many good movies with rain other than Se7en.",

        "content": "**SPOILERS BELOW!!** \n\nThe first time you watch Friedkin's '85 frenetic, gritty, neo noir action thriller you are dazzled by Dafoe's menacing insanity and by Petersen's red hot detective on the edge of total pychopathy. You are mesmerized by literally the greatest car chase in movie history, bar none. No CGI, just real cars doing real car shit. \n\nThe hot lesbian sex and the hot cop sex also wows you. And don't forget John Turturro being a total scumbag. The action is relentless and every character is grimier than the next. Honestly one of the greatest, and most under rated, movies of the 80s. \n\nBut here is the thing! its literally not until the very last line of dialogue that you realize Friedkin's genius in this flick. What you thought was the C story was actually the A story all along. \n\n\"You're working for me now\" \n\nholy shit! Then it hits you - this movie was really about Vukovich being slowly, methodically corrupted and turned into another psycho just like his partner was. Bit by bit, step by step, he is lead along the way until its too late and now he has become the monster. \n\nFriedkin you son of a bitch!",
