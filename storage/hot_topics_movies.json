To give Sophie Marceau something to do besides crying and wearing pretty dresses? \n\nIt even makes William Wallace look bad because his whole motivation is about avenging his wife  and how he yearns to go back to her but then is quick to jump into bed with Isabella. I found it so contrived but then this is the same movie that had Edward II's gay lover, Piers Gaveston, being thrown off a Tower for giggles (that also never happened). \n\nNot every movie needs a love story. It's unfortunate Marceau, a fine actress, was tagged with such a thankless part. They should have just called Judith Godreche and called it a day.",

I picked The Master at random to watch tonight. I just finished the movie and I am just extremely blown away! There are not nearly enough words that can explain how amazing this movie is.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s such a BEAUTIFUL film visually, just absolutely gorgeous! Great cinematography.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP), probably have this movie to thank for being arguably each of their greatest performances of both their careers. Hoffman was a wonderful treasure of an actor and a person, and he will be forever missed, but I MUST single out Phoenix\u2019s performance in particular, he is nothing short of perfect when it comes to playing characters who deal with mental issues, trauma and identity issues, such as the Joker for example. \n\nObviously I still have more movies to see from PTA, but I wanted to shout this movie out on here and share how much of an incredible movie this one is!",

I had to pause and google it right then, after randomly choosing it to begin with, because the setup to the film was just too bizarre to be someone unrecognizable.\n\nBut what follows is just this entire, surreal, hellish adventure film with practical effects that blew my mind. Roy Schneider\u2019s performance is transformative. It\u2019s up there with Jaws for me.\n\nOff the top of my head, easily one of my favorite adventure films and as a Friedkin film, I like it as much as The Exorcist. Massive horror elements too, very genre-fluid. \n\nAnytime I consider a film a 10/10 I\u2019m so curious why others don\u2019t, just out of curiosity. To see that the exposition was everyone\u2019s least favorite part felt almost warm and personal to me, because it\u2019s so strange and really what drew me in. \n",

        "content": "Some horror scenes never leave your mind, no matter how many times you watch new movies.\n\nOne that always stuck with me is the opening of 28 Weeks Later.\n\nThe chase, the fear, the way the father runs while leaving his family behind. It made me feel cold inside like pure survival can make you do anything.\n\nAnother is the girl crawling out of the TV in The Ring.\n\nThe sound, the jerky movements, and that final moment when she steps into the room still make me uneasy whenever I think of it. It felt like the movie broke the wall between screen and reality.\n\nAnd of course, the chestburster scene in Alien. The way it goes from calm to shocking in seconds with everyone at the table laughing one moment and then screaming the next. It made me feel how fragile the human body really is.\n\nThese scenes never left my head.\n\nWhich horror scene still lives rent free in yours?\n\nThank you.",

The \u201ckinetic blast\u201d gun. It bums me out we will never see this on screen again. What other films have cool weapons you wish we could see more of?",
        "content": "So in Minority Report since murder is foreseen by the precogs, cops are using less lethal forms of force and because of that we see a couple cool futuristic non lethal weapons in the film. \u201cSick sticks\u201d is one, which is exactly as it sounds. A stick that makes you puke when it touches you. Pretty cool but not the weapon we are here to talk about today. No. The best one BY FAR, by a country mile, is the weapon we see used in the car factory fight scene. \n\nThe \u201ckinetic blast\u201d gun. If that\u2019s what it\u2019s called? I don\u2019t know. But we see Tom Cruise use this thing to dispatch a few agents non lethally. Not only is the effect of the gun blast really cool, but the reload/recharge is equally effin cool. This is legitimately one of the coolest weapons in film history. That\u2019s a big statement but that\u2019s how I feel about this thing. The effect and the recharge just produce this very satisfying motion and payoff. Mix the sound effect of the gun charging and unloading and god damn. Did Spielberg know what he had here? The man\u2019s a genius so I have to think yes, but then.. \n\nWe only see it used 2-3 times. Which is really cool but\u2026that\u2019s it? That\u2019s all we get? It\u2019s a tease. And because Minority Report is a one and done film, with no sequel, this great idea and design is never to be seen again. That\u2019s a friggn shame. Not that there\u2019s no sequel, MR doesn\u2019t need one, but that we won\u2019t ever see this exact weapon on screen again? It bums me out. I want an entire war fought with these things. They look kinda fun. They don\u2019t look painful. \n\nSo this got me thinking, what are some other weapons in films we don\u2019t see used enough or will never see again because there ain\u2019t no sequel?",
