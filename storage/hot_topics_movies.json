So that go me wondering why his film career got stalled.\n\nand Yes I know he did television work during this time (Boston Legal, A Season of The Office &amp; The Blacklist), but I've seen television actors trying to manage both television and film roles. I just wonder why Spader just became more sporadic with film.",

She puts one Gremlin in the blender and turns him into a smoothie, then goes full Captain America using a tv tray for a shield before dicing up another with a knife.  Then she blinds a third Gremlin with bug spray before nuking it in the microwave.  Channeling her inner Rambo, she then grabs 2 knives to clear the rest of the house.  It was only trickery and deception by the 4th that put her in a compromised position where she needed help from Billy.  Billy and Kate took out hundreds when they blew up the theater, but Mama Badass got a body count of 3, which is more than anyone else in the movie in hand to hand combat.  Meanwhile, the actual armed police officers literally drove away to hide.  Mr Hansen (the science teacher), who seemed to be in good physical condition and Murray Futterman, who was a WWII veteran were both easily neutralized by Gremlins without resistance.  Billy decapitated one with a sword, but that's only because he caught it by surprise.   He also needed a huge assist from Gizmo to kill Stripe.\n\nLynn Peltzer - Wife, mother, and Gremlin Slayer.

Literally, the plot is confusing, and why do they have to create humans that way anyway? What\u2019s with all the loop and only Kim Dami and the guy and the kid is exp the same thing? How is it being controlled by someone (the researchers) The only impressive thing is the huge flood washing them all over again. Also, how is she surviving all that swimming and diving, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s an AI. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like my opinion but this film is shit. Pls watch at your own risk.",

Lots of movies have been called love letters and it's been discussed in that capacity here in this subreddit many times over the years.  But it raises other questions.  If there are love letters, are there booty calls?  Pickup lines?  I'm not even being satirical, really, since there's an element inherent in the idea of a love letter that is over the top and maybe a little much.  Meaning maybe the booty call is all people really need sometimes? Maybe? Like I'd say that if *Tombstone* was a love letter, then maybe *Desperado* was a booty call.\n\nI feel like I'm stepping on the conversation, but the sub requires a body of text.",
