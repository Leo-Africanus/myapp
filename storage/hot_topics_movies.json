        "content": "There's a famous quote attributed to anthropologist Margaret Mead that the first sign of civilization in archaeology is a healed bone because anywhere else in the animal kingdom a broken bone is a death sentence and only humans working together had the ability to reset the bone and care for the individual while it healed.\n\nWe know that when Chigurh gets hurt he'll steal medical supplies and tend to himself. But a snapped arm bone can't really be treated like this and whatever he could do he'd still be left crippled to a point where he's unable to to do the only job he's capable of. Without going to a hospital he'd no longer useful to his employers.  \n\nI don't know if any of this is a part of McArthur's intention. I've seen the interpretation that it's symbolic of the brutality inherent to the world that not even he can escape. But no one else in the story is so acutely vulnerable to this situation as he is; a man who is violently anti-social and entirely self-reliant presented with a situation that requires the willing help of others. And this vulnerability is highlighted by the lengths and pains he has to go to heal a much less serious wound. \n\nTo put it in his terms: if he had been more like his victims, following the rules of society, then those rules would have in fact been of great use to him in that moment. And now it's his own rules that could be said to have ultimately failed him.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention he\u2019s a very distinct looking person, wanted for murder, on foot, walking away from a crime scene less than a mile away with a bone sticking out of his arm.",

Joe Hisaishi's score just soars, it truly is perfect. \n\nIf you have any opportunity to catch this limited showing this weekend - don't miss this. It's a true work of art.",

        "title": "Lethal Weapon 4 is a good example on how to handle a forced unnecessary sequel and make it enjoyable",
        "content": "We all know that feeling, right? When Hollywood milk too much a franchise and you rolls your eyes because there too much sequels and they are kind of useless. Nevertheless, Lethal Weapon 4 is an exception. That movie is kind of underrated but \"full\" of quality. It's a perfect example on how to make a good forced-sequel-that-nobody-asked-for.\n\nFirstly and important point, it acknowledge the aging of the actors (and therefore, their characters) and even allows them to live an evolution. The best thing I suppose is the moment when Riggs use the famous \"I'm too old\" line from Murtaugh, which is a very logical move. But it also keep every running gags and codes of the previous movies to not stray too far from this franchise's nature (this is good too, to not lost the hardcore fans imo) while in the same time, showing new things to still give its own identity to this fourth sequel.\n\nThe Triad is an interesting new antagonist and we are even seeing the international debut of a young rising star (Jet Li). I am also kind of surprise by the final fight scene because of various aspect : it's a little more violent than what we are used to and throught this it also cemented the bromance/alchemy of Riggs and Murtaugh. It's also not a duel but a... truel? definitely not what we are used to in an action movie or a buddy cop movie. Last note, I love so much how Murtaugh and Riggs move in different direction (like a cross) when the fight is about to happen, it's very martial movie-like.\n\nThanks to all this, LW 4 made you feel like you are watching friends or a family that you have been seeing for years. The last scene is the best and almost pretty meta since it totally made you feels like you are a part of the Lethal Weapon family. So, kudos to the late Richard Donner and the whole crew.",

Not only does he pump out 5 films a year, but they are all usually at least pretty good, usually making that many films in a short time span results in a lot of them being poor, but Dafoe makes banger after banger. It\u2019s really impressive actually, he\u2019s probably gonna have one of the biggest filmography\u2019s once his career is over.",

The eyeball scene and some of the killer gorillas getting their limbs amputated by the laser weapon in the climax. All done practical then the CGI slop that overtakes Hollywood nowadays.\n\nSure its campy notably the infamous \"Stop eating my sesame cake!\" but that's what made it entertaining for me.\n\nAnd as a sucker for creature features. This one still holds up imo.\n\nIt's no Jaws or Jurassic Park (This and Congo were movies based on novels by Michael Crichton) but still entertaining in its own right notably it's camp factor and the brutality we see at times. Kinda surprised they got away with a PG rating tbh.",

        "content": "Mind you, I have zero nostalgia for these films. Only saw them when they were on TV earlier but I didn't hold them in very high regard maybe because I was younger. I was blown away how good these films are now. Did Hollywood forget how to make fun adventure films? Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role, couldn't ask for a better actress as Lara. She put in the work and it shows in the stunts. The pacing is breakneck which I feel is lacking in movies these days. How good was Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond role!\n\nThe sequel is even better and Roger Ebert was a fan of it while most critics disliked it then. It doubles the action, the locations and Angelina kicks even more ass. The look is stylized and it works. Some scenes feel straight from the games.\n\nThese films are no Indiana Jones but as modern adventure films, they are a blast!",
