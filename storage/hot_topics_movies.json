Im speechless really. \n\nAlso, the way it was made is absolutely stunning. Stop motion is awesome, sad that its not used a lot nowadays. \n\nIm not going to spoil much here, and Im going to say to go watch it yourself. Amazing movie. \n\nIts about a Fox and his family getting into a conflict with three \"corporate\" food giants, that eventually evolves into a full blown war between the two, and even drags other animals into the conflict. \n\nThere are also some elements of philosophy too, so yeah. \n\nAll in all its a solid 8.5/10. The only bad thing was that its short, but then again its based on the book, so yeah. Go read that too if you would like.",

Trailer makes her role seem larger than it actually is. \n\nThe daughter from Hereditary. They even added deleted scenes from the movie and put it in the trailer to make it seem she had a much bigger part than she had. \n\nSteven Seagal in Executive Decision, though rumor has it, his character was only killed off because the director and writers couldn't stand him any more and they decided to rewrite his character's role and have him die in the first 30 minutes.",

And yes, I know that's what acting is, but when it's a lesser known actor you're not distracted by who they are and can more easily associate them with the character in the movie that they're portraying.

I literally shed tears when Eva thought Wall-E died. The fuck is that about. Disney got it down to a fine art. I think it\u2019s Pixar\u2019s best. Or at least, their most ambitious work. Monster\u2019s Inc is incredible, but it didn\u2019t tug on me on at this deep a level. Maybe I\u2019ll rewatch that next. Maybe Toy Story too while I\u2019m at it. ",

I think Fallout is widely accepted as the best entry, but I'm sure I'll get arguments.  I honestly feel like Dead Reckoning was the weakest entry and I'm really hoping they finish it off on a stronger note.  A series this good deserves a proper finale.  \n\nI'll provide my rankings:\n\n1. Fallout\n\n2. Mission: Impossible\n\n3. Ghost Protocol\n\n4. Rogue Nation\n\n5. MI III\n\n6. MI 2\n\n7.
