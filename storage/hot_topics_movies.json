        "content": "Flicking through the channels this evening, I stumbled on Twister. Apart from it being a bloody amazing blockbuster, I\u2019d forgotten just how great Bill Paxton is in the everyman role.\n\nIt got me thinking about how you don\u2019t really see that kind of actor in cinema these days. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Bill Paxton was a good-looking guy\u2014but a lot of actors today are too manicured, shredded to the absolute lowest body fat percentage, and just don\u2019t feel like someone you'd see on the street who could pull off the same role.\n\nObviously, Glen Powell was the male lead in Twisters, and he was really good, but he wasn\u2019t aiming for that everyman role\u2014instead, he went for the YouTube influencer type.\n\nThere's still everyman actors out there, but they're from generations before and a lot older now (Costner, Keaton, Quaid, William H. Macy, for example). So who do we have as the next crop to take the mantle?\n\nEDIT: There's a lot of good actors being mentioned below but I think they're too old to be considered this generation's. For example, Bill Paxton was 41 at the time of Twister. A lot of the actors mentioned are already way past that, into their late 40s and early 50s.",

I'm thinking more a long opening sequence vs a smaller scene (like when they recipe the previous films in the Planet of the Apes series or the MCU).\nThe wilder the swing the better!\n",

        "content": "In the 1980s and 1990s, we had some great action heroes: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme,....\n\nYeah, yeah, we make fun of them now, but they were great at the time. Then slowly, superhero movies dominated everything and we lost the old macho energy these guys used to bring to the screen. Chris Hemsworth is probably the closest we have to those guys right now, but generally, they have been replaced by boyish-looking dudes who just don't radiate the same masculine energy. Nothing wrong with the actors themselves, it's just they are who they are, and for people looking for the old action heroes, especially after you watch a movie from the 80s and kind of miss that energy, they come up short. \n\nAnybody feel the same? Or are you glad we are done with the old action guys?",

Something with a lot of awesome choreographed fighting like John wick or kingsman would be cool.  The theater in question seems to have an ultra wide screen of that skews any decision making. Let me know what you think, any input is appreciated thanks in advance!",

Then they all got cancer.\u2019\n\nOn top of the incredible cost to rebuild or even damage control for weeks/months and then inevitable insurance company failures and stores or businesses failing, does the city of LA go bankrupt? The state of California? Local economy absolutely shot for how long, housing costs go up if you\u2019re away from ground zero but prices around Stanley ave are about to crater. \n\nWhat else happens in the next 6months/1year etc?\n\nWhat happens after the end of your favorite disaster movie?",

Like, it feels like the studio intervered a bit near the end. But that's okay, the ending is still very much satisfying.\n\nBut still a very great movie with beautiful animation, emotionally driven story, and powerful message about learning to work together and not let prejudice get in the way that I think is very important right now.\n\nRIP Judith Barsi.",
