        "content": "Flicking through the channels this evening, I stumbled on Twister. Apart from it being a bloody amazing blockbuster, I\u2019d forgotten just how great Bill Paxton is in the everyman role.\n\nIt got me thinking about how you don\u2019t really see that kind of actor in cinema these days. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Bill Paxton was a good-looking guy\u2014but a lot of actors today are too manicured, shredded to the absolute lowest body fat percentage, and just don\u2019t feel like someone you'd see on the street who could pull off the same role.\n\nObviously, Glen Powell was the male lead in Twisters, and he was really good, but he wasn\u2019t aiming for that everyman role\u2014instead, he went for the YouTube influencer type.\n\nThere's still everyman actors out there, but they're from generations before and a lot older now (Costner, Keaton, Quaid, William H. Macy, for example). So who do we have as the next crop to take the mantle?\n\nEDIT: There's a lot of good actors being mentioned below but I think they're too old to be considered this generation's. For example, Bill Paxton was 41 at the time of Twister. A lot of the actors mentioned are already way past that, into their late 40s and early 50s.",

Like, it feels like the studio intervered a bit near the end. But that's okay, the ending is still very much satisfying.\n\nBut still a very great movie with beautiful animation, emotionally driven story, and powerful message about learning to work together and not let prejudice get in the way that I think is very important right now.\n\nRIP Judith Barsi.",

Pete Davidson was surprisingly really good as Petey, probably the first performance of his ive seen that I really liked. I liked some of the dumb bits like them hitting the box of bs (the letter, not the bug), and there were a lot of creative gags",

Then they all got cancer.\u2019\n\nOn top of the incredible cost to rebuild or even damage control for weeks/months and then inevitable insurance company failures and stores or businesses failing, does the city of LA go bankrupt? The state of California? Local economy absolutely shot for how long, housing costs go up if you\u2019re away from ground zero but prices around Stanley ave are about to crater. \n\nWhat else happens in the next 6months/1year etc?\n\nWhat happens after the end of your favorite disaster movie?",

The 3 way shoot-out with the variety of shots - on the characters eyes, faces, hands as they await the first move. Again with the Morricone soundtrack. The twist that 'Blondie' has fixed it in a way that he won't lose.",

Like if Superbad met up later on in life. \n\nI really enjoyed American Pie Reunion and there's a UK show called 'Gavin &amp; Stacey' that I really enjoyed on a similar way to Coming of Age films but I guess you transition more into 'full adult' \n\nConcepts such as career, marriage and family but I guess also divorces, death and your youth no longer being there and less freedom and excitement as the unknown is now largely known. \n\nAre there many films like that you could reccomend? That tackle that sorta part of your life when you go 'shit, I've grown up' \n\nI'm only 5 minutes onto this movie btw but it also making me think about catching up with my own friends I've lost touch with ",
