I was having fun laughing at some of the stuff that I now see as overly dramatic but I found cool when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, once it got to the hospital (filmed at St Mary's in Long Beach) scene where Lauren is taken after Pacino finds her in the tub, I was very impressed by the actors in that scene - they seemed to really memorize their hospital lingo and make it believable.  But as I watched more, I kinda felt like the main doctor had to have been someone they just found at the hospital they filmed at and told him to \"pretend this just happened\".\n\nSo I wound up doing some quick research on imdb and got his name, but he's not credited in any other movie.  Some google searching led me to his profile, and everything seems to line up and definitely looks like he was a real doctor, pretty cool:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8buza1izazoe1.png?width=2080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1e96c63c1d057eb2e7ec47a521cec51c3f5e27\n\nAlso, I think the blonde nurse is also a real nurse too, she seems way to natural in her actions in that scene.",

The reason my mother let me pick it out (from a VHS RENTAL STORE, GASP HOW ANTIQUATED) was because it had a kid in a ghost face costume on it walking with a guy she must have assumed was his father (Costner).\n\n  \nNah, this was about a pair of murderers who break out of prison and kidnap said kid, kind of a road movie with Eastwood as the Texas Ranger chief who is chasing them. It's worth a watch, it's a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first \"anti-hero\" sad movies. \n\nAnyway, anybody else got stories like this?",

Shot from Stan\u2019s perspective, they both look back at him and laugh amongst themselves, with Stan and the viewer unaware exactly what it is they\u2019re laughing about. At some point in the film (it\u2019s been a while), Stan confesses his love for Mary. In my mind, the clear implication from the conversation between Mary and Dr Mierzwiak is that Stan has at some point had Mary erased, and is now unknowingly falling for her again, something Mary and Dr Mierzwiak find to be comical.",

The bright colors (red, orange, yellow and green) have such an impact on the vibe of the film. With that said, Theo wears ALOT of red and orange colors. Similarly, the OS1 primary color is a bright orange which matches his shirt in the posted frame. Colors like red and pink symbolize love, and In this case, the start of Theodore and Samanthas romantic journey. Theodore continues to wear these bright orange/red shirts during the \"Honeymoon phase\" (as Theodore calls it) of their relationship. It signifies a healthy beginning to true love.\n\nHowever, as we dive into the issues that Theo and Sam face, he wears more neutral colors such as pale blue and white. When Sams prostitute shows up, Theo is wearing a white shirt. In this moment Theo is extremely uncomfortable, as he is being asked to have sex with someone hes never met by his computer girlfriend. This ultimately causes a pretty deep split between the two, probably the biggest we see in the whole movie aside from the breakup.\n\nAlthough It is a pretty obvious detail, the color usage is a very nice touch in my opinion. I love that colors symbolize the strength and status of Theo and Sams relationship as the movie plays on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vmtsjj4twoe1.jpg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0480a652ffe064fcd40d642c62d3100348a651\n\n",

The younger daughter is even a bit confused by this and ask if she's the product of incest.\n\n- The older daughter despises him and becomes very upset whenever he touches her.\n\n- There's a scene where he invites the younger daughter to watch TV with him instead of doing homework, and says \"we won't yell mom.\" He sits on the couch with his arm around her, and the camera lingers on him as he looks at her.\n\n- In the scene where the daughters visit him in the hotel room, he says \"I've never hurt you\" and the you ger daughter becomes upset to the point where she can't even speak and the older daughter rushes her out.\n\nIs this what the film was implying?",

He was perfectly cast in the movie however Dustin Hoffman was completely miscast as the lead attorney for the plaintiff. His southern accent is tragic and I\u2019m trying to think who would have been a better casting choice to play such a critical role in the movie. ",

        "content": "I've been seeing videos about the Criterion Closet for years now, so when I saw a stack of them in stores I picked one up at random and found I had pick Jeanne Dielman. I had no idea what the movie was abut, let alone that it was over 3 hours of the most mundane subject matter. Despite my inexperience with a larger movie portfolio, I still ended up loving this. What I found quite different about thsi movie form everything else I've ever watched is the lack of dialogue and busy on-screen motions is it gives you so much time to think about Jeanne and how she's acting. You can process through how she goes about her days in relation to you, and reckon with your preconceptions about what a home life is like for women like her. The buildup is long and nessecary so that it feels completely natural when she snaps in the last 10 minutes. I could totally see me never watching this again, but I'm really glad I went way out fo my comfort zone and tried something totally unique. It has really made me rethink waht exactly a movie is supposed to be.",

(The Birth of a Nation and Alice in Wonderland 1915)\n\nI still found these very interesting and they were definitely impressive considering the time period, but I don\u2019t think I could sit there and watch the entirety of these.  \n\nAre there any silent films that are too great to pass up, or maybe this genre just isn\u2019t for me?

How long of a period does the movie take place over, for example how long does it take for the entire poor family to be hired by the rich, i imagine they\u2019re not super close together since that would be a little suspicious \n\n2. Why didn\u2019t the \u2018poor\u2019 family move out of their home? they clearly make quite a bit from the work so why not move into a nicer place?\n\n3. Why is the original guy even stuck in the basement, why not escape? i\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason i just can\u2019t remember and google is failing me",

        "content": "It's a common trope to root for the hero, but sometimes, the villains steal the show. From their charismatic presence to their complex motives, some antagonists are just too compelling to disregard. For example, many people find themselves rooting for Thanos in *Avengers: Infinity War* due to his philosophical, albeit flawed, reasoning. Who's your favorite movie villain that you secretly (or not so secretly) cheer on, and what makes them so appealing?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ak1cktkdr2pe1.jpg?width=334&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf213f6190124726aba6b4f9833bdcc495500c84\n\n",
