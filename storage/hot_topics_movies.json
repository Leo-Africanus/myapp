Everyone who isn't a doctor or a lawyer or a Cardinal in this movie lumps them all into one elite class of assholes and they're not wrong. It's so well acted from everyone, including James Mason as the defending attorney. I swear you can see him start to sweat during the climactic testimony. That's fucking acting right there. ",

        "title": "[Movie Review] Companion (2025) is a really fun black comedy about sci-fi relationships",
        "content": "COMPANION (2025) was a film I was back and forth reviewing due to being a science fiction black comedy. If I had to define its genre, I'd say it's cyberpunk lite. A story that could basically be summarized as \"What if Blade Runner starred the machines and had really stupid people after them?\" Despite the comedic elements or perhaps because of them, the film deals with a lot of incredibly dark subject matter and touches on numerous themes of both technology as well as socialization. \n\nIt's sort of an interesting comparison to EX MACHINA, which had the idea of our machines as wholly inhuman but mankind confusing them for people. This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit). There's a strong feminist theme to the movie that underscores the comedy and slasher movie vibe as our heroine struggles to understand what her \"boyfriend\" now wants to murder her.\n\nThe marketing spoiled a lot of this movie in a manner like CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD as one of the biggest twists comes around the fifteen minute mark but is spoiled by the poster. Indeed, I wasn't even aware it was meant to be a surprise until I watched this movie with my nieces. They had no familiarity with the movie and thus were completely taken off guard when it happened. If you can watch the movie unspoiled or with people who don't know anything other than the title, then I recommend it. Otherwise, note, that the rest of the review will treat this initial reveal as a given.\n\nThe premise for Companion is that Irish (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) are a sickeningly happy couple that are visiting their Russian friend's house for the weekend. It is an incredibly luxurious house in the middle of nowhere and they'll be joined by several friends. It is in the near future with self-driving cars and a variety of other luxury items that seem to be available only to the super rich, though Jack isn\u2019t one of them. One of the guests, Kat (Megan Suri), is initially very hostile to Iris and she doesn't know why. Sergey (Rupert Friend) gets aggressive with Iris and events spiral out of control when he's killed.\n\nWhich turns out to have been the plan all along as Iris discovers that's what she was programmed to do all along. Iris, much to her shock and horror, is a companion robot for Josh. A sort of sexy Tamagotchi that was given a set of fake memories and a willingness to please that overrides all other considerations. Rather than the superhumans of Blade Runner, companions are deliberately made to be no smarter or stronger than \"regular\" humans with the ability of their owners to make them even dumber or weaker. Josh is fond of his companion robot but no more so than a pet and arguably even less than that as he's willing to sacrifice her as part of his plan to murder Sergey then rob him. Unfortunately, he's careless with his master control and he's turned up Iris' survival instincts.\n\nMuch of the movie is, essentially, not so veiled commentary on \"nice guy\" misogyny. Josh is good looking and willing to put on a pleasant enough face around his girlfriend but only when she's subservient to him. Ultimately, she's a convenience and someone that he gets increasingly violent toward as he finds his plans thwarted. We also discover just how fragile Josh's self-esteem is. The fact Jack Quaid is the kind of actor that would be the dorky but handsome lead in a romantic comedy, makes his transformation even more shocking. Like a slowly boiling kettle, we also see how the escalation grows from dismissiveness to furious rage.\n\nThe movie's humor comes from the same source as the movie's terror. The murderers are not particularly competent at their crimes but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous. All of them, even the more sympathetic ones, think of Iris as an appliance that needs to be destroyed. The absolute lack of sympathy from everyone around here is surprisingly well realized. Sophie Thatcher beautifully embodies both the idealized retro-girlfriend with her 1950s-esque inspired look as well as the increasingly capable Iris as she realizes her only way out may be blocked by what she was made to be. I had a lot of fun with this movie.",

I took a peak at the new releases for that time and I'm not familiar with anything that's coming out. I'm not picky, I enjoy a variety of movies, so I figured I'd let the Internet recommend what I see!\n\nHighest up vote wins, please don't send me to Snow White.\n\n  \nEdit: I appreciate not a single mention of Snow White, and only some passing comments about Minecraft :) It looks like I'll just miss some favorites (Mickey 17, Black Bag), but I'm excited to watch Princess Mononoke\u00a0at home over the weekend! I have a meeting with the community outings coordinator on Monday, so I have the weekend to make a tentative plan and decide. Thanks everyone!",

She was supposedly the star of the movie and the first 48 minutes are completely centred on Janet Leigh's Marion until she gets killed off in the iconic shower scene. \n\nOther examples:\n\nJulianne Moore in Children of Men. 2nd billing and name above the title. Trailer makes her role seem larger than it actually is. \n\nThe daughter from Hereditary. They even added deleted scenes from the movie and put it in the trailer to make it seem she had a much bigger part than she had. \n\nSteven Seagal in Executive Decision, though rumor has it, his character was only killed off because the director and writers couldn't stand him any more and they decided to rewrite his character's role and have him die in the first 30 minutes.",

There has been plenty of discussion around iconic monologues and one-liners, but I find that one-word exclamations can be extremely powerful and can make or break a scene for me. So with that in mind, what one-word deliveries have stuck with you for how well they were delivered on screen?",

        "content": "The sort of humid tawdriness of the film is right up there as one of the number one reasons it really feels like Miami. The score sounds like it crawled out of a swamp. The private school class of people. The neighborhoods. The houses. The Saul Goodman-esque law office. The ginormous mansion. And of course, the alligator petting zoo. The seedy motel. Plus the fact that everybody\u2019s fairly corrupt on many levels. This all nailed Miami for me.\n\nSome movies came close: Out of Time with Denzel Washington. Scarface if only for an establishing shot on the old South Beach with Steven Bauer talking up some beachy girls. Moonlight\u2019s definitely in there as well. Believe it or not, Big Trouble is pretty damn true to Miami.\n\nWhat didn\u2019t do it for me was Michael Mann\u2019s Miami Vice remake. Though I like a lot about that movie, Miami representation is a joke. And as much as I like them, Bad Boys is what happens when you don\u2019t hire someone from Miami to scout your locations.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve seen Los Angeles and New York filmed inside and out, I guess we\u2019re only getting started.",

        "content": "(Edit: GOT IT, THE MOVIE IS 11:14) \n\nSo several years ago when I was younger, I remember watching a movie where several people die at the exact same time but in different scenarios. Well actually I don\u2019t think they all die but shit definitely goes down at the same time. The name of the movie is the time it happens at. Anyways, a couple is having sex at the cemetery, a statue\u2019s head breaks &amp; crushes the guys skull. 3 other dudes go out causing trouble in their van, throwing burning books around town. One of them takes a leak out the window while the van is moving, either they crash or the driver hits the breaks abruptly causing the window to slam shut on the guys penis, severing it. I think there\u2019s a couple that robs a liquor store or something as well. Not sure what else happens but does anyone know what movie I\u2019m talking about? Movie should be well over 10 years old, possibly older than 20. If anyone can think of the name I\u2019d appreciate it, would love to watch it again. ",
