        "title": "Things old movies could get away with that new movies can't? (besides racism/sexism)",
        "content": "I know there are plenty of easy answers to this question, like blackface/yellowface, casual racial stereotypes, and sexual assault played as a joke or a hero move. But I'm hoping to dig a little deeper.\n\nI'm thinking more about the language of cinema, and the conventions of storytelling that have changed.\n\nFor example, I was recently watching Cecil B. de Mille's *The Greatest Show on Earth* (1952) and I was surprised at how much of the runtime was just showing the circus. There would be a storyline going on while the circus was happening, but there were multiple extended scenes that featured none of the major characters or that moved the plot forward in any real way. It was just circus performers doing circus acts while the audience reacted. That wouldn't get past editors today, and if it did, it would get skewered by critics as fluff and filler that doesn't add anything to the movie. Yet, back in 1952, people did not have such complaints.",

        "content": "I was watching Dodgeball The True Underdog Story yesterday, and there were a lot of really subtle lines in it that are just hilarious. \n\nFor example, at the end of the movie Cotton says \"Ladies and Gentlemen I have been to the Great Wall of China, I have seen the pyramids, I've even witnessed a grow man satisfy a camel.\"\n\nIt's just so funny the way he nonchalantly slips that in there.  Everyone quotes the \"It's a bold strategy Cotton\" line, but I don't think that one gets enough credit.\n\nAnother is in Tropic Thunder when Les Grossman has just finished screaming and swearing at someone down the phone then casually says \"Could you uh...find out who that was?\"\n\nAgain, it's so funny the way it gets slipped in there.  That he was ranting away like that and genuinely didn't know who he was talking to.\n\nWhat are some of your favourites?",

        "content": "I love Heat, it is a 10/10 that only gets better with every viewing, but I\u2019ve noticed that Heat looks so different compared to other films shot around the time. It uses a lot of natural lighting and my first thought was that Heat was shot digitally in the same vain as Collateral and Miami Heat. Compare to another 1995 Robert De Niro film, Casino, they look like two totally different movies. My main question is am I imagining Heat looking different? If so what techniques were used? Because scenes like the rooftop moment where robert De Niro shares a moment with the love interest, and Al Pacino\u2019s character going to meet his informant at the junkyard,the water tank scenes, and the shootout, all look almost like they were shot digitally.",

        "content": "One of the forgotten about science fiction movies of all time, Outland with Sean Connery, just came up on the YouTube movies for free. \n\nA lot of people describe this as high noon in space, however, I just disagree completely that it has nothing else to offer.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of science fiction that puts you in the belief mode. Films like Blade Runner, the original Alien, or Ad Astra where you can truly believe it\u2019s a story that\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s also a science fiction futuristic type movie.\n\nThis film takes the place as my favorite. It\u2019s made by much of the same crew as the original Alien, so the sets are amazing. The acting is amazing although Connery\u2019s child in the film apparently was criticized for not being a great actor. To me those scenes are not significant enough to the film for that to be said, especially to a child. \n\nThen you have Peter Boyle, who does an amazing job as the evil boss. And not only that, Peter Hyams went on to make 2010 afterwards. One of the great moments in film where someone created two extremely beautiful Science Fiction films in a row.  ",
