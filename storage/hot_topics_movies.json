Doesn't even have to necessarily be a break-up movie as long as it covers these themes of self-exploration and improvement. Thanks.",

        "title": "I Watched All 63 Disney Animated Movies, And It Was Delightful",
        "content": "I was born in the early 90s, in the midst of the Disney Renaissance, and I grew up on Disney movies. My mom showed me a lot of the classics in addition to the new ones that came out during my life, but I hadn't seen the vast majority of these films since childhood. So, nearly two years ago, I set out to watch every movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios (so, no live-action remakes, no made-for-TV sequels, etc.), in chronological order, to refresh my memory and fill in my blind spots. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I ranked all of the movies on Letterboxd, and included my favorite moment from each one (usually an animated flourish, but occasionally a quote or an extended sequence). And below, I listed some good and bad surprises, and I ranked villains, vocal performances, and songs, just for fun!\n\nhttps://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/\n\nGood Surprises:\n\n1. Cinderella - I really, really did not expect to come away from this with Cinderella as my favorite Disney movie and one of my favorite animated movies of all time. But it is. In my memory, it was the classic \"helpless princess, handsome prince, happily ever after\" story. Imagine my surprise when I find that it's a movie about a woman overcoming the most dreadful circumstances with kindness and humility and persistence and self-confidence. She's not immune to the weight of her terrible life, but when life gets her down, she picks her head up and gets back to solving her problems. She is a role model not just for little girls, but for all of us. AND it's beautifully animated, well-paced, and has one absolutely remarkable sequence (the transformation of everyone/everything in preparation for the ball). It's just splendid.\n\n2. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - I expected One Hundred and One Dalmatians to be relatively minor Disney, but I was blown away. From the gorgeous, painterly animation style, to the thrilling plot, to the devious villain, to the delightful side characters (Horace and Jasper are all-time great laughable lackeys)...it all just works.\n\n3. The Emperor's New Groove - I knew I was going to love The Emperor's New Groove, but not this much. It's just one amazing sight gag after another, coming in at an efficient 72 minutes (not including credits), and its blistering pace never runs out of steam. Amazing.\n\n4. Robin Hood - Robin Hood was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid, but as an adult, I realized it didn't have the best reputation, so I wasn't optimistic going in...but I still loved it. It's fun, it's got some great music (\"Phony King of England\", especially), and a ridiculous villain+sidekick combo (Prince John and Sir Hiss).\n\n5. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The crew could not be any more trope-y if it tried. Milo, the out-of-his-depth, nerdy scholar who the group reluctantly depends on. Rourke, the gruff, grizzled captain who clearly has ulterior motives. Helga, a young German woman and Rourke's second-in-command, who thinks she has to act all tough to look like she belongs next to her superior. Vinny, the cavalier Italian demolitions expert who just wants to run the family flower shop. Dr. Sweet, the physically imposing African-American/Native American doctor with a heart of gold. Audrey, the plucky, teenage Puerto Rican mechanic trying to impress her dad (who really wanted a son). Wilhelmina, the chain-smoking communications officer who looks and acts like she should have retired years ago. Cookie, the elderly chef of the expedition, who seems to have come from the Confederate South. Geatan Moliere, a Frenchman who goes by Mole, and also acts like a mole, and also looks like a mole. But it leans into those tropes with such affection, that I couldn't help but love it. \n\nBad Surprises: \n\n1. The Sword in the Stone - Like Robin Hood, The Sword in the Stone was one of my favorites growing up. I don't know what childhood me was thinking. The wizard duel is entertaining, but the plot is just totally inert otherwise. \n\n2. Tarzan - I didn't find the story all that interesting, nor the characters compelling. Much to my surprise, I also didn't love the music - it all sounded the same and didn't hook me whatsoever. RIP to the Phil Collins burning piano meme :(. \n\n3. Fantasia - Hailed as one of the all-time greats of Disney, I was excited...but it was too inconsistent. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is among the best things Disney has ever done, and Night on Bald Mountain is a good time...but otherwise? Couldn't find much to latch on to.\n\n4. The Black Cauldron - Yet another of my childhood favorite that I ranked lower than I'd hoped. I still probably have it higher than most, maybe due to my affinity for all things spooky and the fact that this is certainly the darkest Disney has ever gotten...but still didn't live up to expectations.\n\n5. Wish - This movie is SO bad. I skipped it in theaters when it came out a couple years ago (shortly after I started this project, actually) because of the so-so reviews, but I still thought I'd at least give it a solid 3/5 stars. But it looks terrible (like something from Disney Channel 10 years ago), the songs aren't the least bit memorable, there are no interesting characters, and the plot doesn't carry half the weight that it feels like it should. I LOVE the idea of this movie, and it fits so well into the mythology of Disney...which I think made me all the more angry at how it turned out. \n\n\nTop 10 Villains:\n\n1.

        "content": "So awhile back I purchased a mystery box of 50 DVDS/Blurays (well, all DVDs so far) and when the Mrs and I are stumped for what to watch, we blind pull from the box. Just recently, we pulled the Ringo Starr farce, Caveman. \n\n\nBelieve it or not, this movie also stars very young Dennis Quaid as our hero\u2019s right hand man, and a lovely Shelley Long as the less buxom but got-it-where-it-counts ride or die. \n\n\nIn a nutshell, Ringo wants the tribe leader\u2019s very shapely woman (Played by Barbara Bach). But this gets him kicked out of the group and he has to find a way to score his dream gal and win the hearts of the group. The entire movie is only grunts save few just a few spoken words of English by the the only Asian caveman, in a Monty Python comedic twist. Not sure you can sit through an hour and a half of ooga booga? Me neither, but it happened lol. Puppetry/stop motion dinosaurs add to the silliness. \n\n\nThe fact this fine film didn\u2019t get Oscar nods well\u2026.is unsurprising. But it made for an amusing evening. And of the 30 or so mystery movie night selections so far, it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve come to chat about. So there\u2019s that!\n\n\nSo tell me I\u2019m not the only one to have seen this movie???\n\n\n\nEDIT: Changed to Dennis Quaid, instead of my mistake writing Randy. Also, Richard Moll (Bull, of Night Court fame) was the frozen Yeti!",

        "title": "There's few characters in cinema who are a big and as entertaining a loser as Jerry Lundegaard in \"Fargo.\" Not only is William H. Macy one of the best casting choices ever, but a big part of the film's appeal is just watching him mess up EVERYTHING.",
        "content": "I fully understand why Macy was so determined to play this role that he jokingly threatened to shoot the Coens' dogs if he didn't get it. Not only is Macy one of the best actors ever at playing this kind of character (see \"The Cooler\" for another excellent example), but Jerry is just such a screw-up at everything he does. Right from the beginning, his whole \"kidnap my own wife\" plan is so half-baked and inane that the very crooks he hires to do it are dubious about it. Think of how many ways he screws up:\n\n1. He hired Carl and Gaer on reference from someone at work (who only knows the latter and won't vouch for the former), knowing nothing about them or how competent they may be.(Short answer; not very.)\n\n2. Because of that, he can't contact them to call off the kidnapping when it looks like he might not need it done.\n\n3. He's amazed when his father in law, who is established from the beginning to not care much for him, won't just give him $750,000 with no strings attached.\n\n4. His mumbled excuses to the GM lawyer about the serial numbers to the non-existent cars he scammed them with. (\"Those're in the mail!\")\n\n5. His plan revolving around being able to deliver the ransom himself and therefore cut out most of it to keep, never realizing that his stubborn and controlling father in law (who, again, DOES NOT LIKE YOU, JERRY) might demand on doing it himself. And sure enough...\n\nAnd so on. And watching Jerry constantly fail and lose it is one of the great pleasures of the film, like when he impotently attacks his ice-covered windshield in rage or how his office blinds look like prison bars. Frequently, a character like this might bring about sympathy for his misfortunes, but not Jerry. Not only is he a loser, but his troubles are all self-inflicted. And in the end, when it all comes down on him, it feels earned and very satisfying.\n\nEven though he did manage to knock off $100 on the truecoat. You did accomplish that, Jerry.\n\n",

        "title": "My take on The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.",
        "content": "If ever there was a movie that redefined the Western genre, it's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This movie is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece! Starring Clint Eastwood and released in 1966 in Italy, and 1967 in the United States; The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was Italy's answer to the aging, redundant, and overdone Hollywood Western of the time. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is the final chapter of the Fistful of Dollars trilogy (a fact of which I was unaware the first time I watched it), continuing the adventures of the Man with No Name (or Blondie, as he's sometimes called in this film).\n\nI'll be completely honest, the first time I tried to watch this movie, I was too immature to appreciate it's rather slow pacing and got bored before the end of the first scene, but a few years later, when I tried it again, I had grown up quite a bit as a movie watcher and was able to fully appreciate it for what it is. The film has a slow buildup, but it has several good action scenes, a good portion of them involving the American Civil War. Every scene of this film serves a purpose as it builds up to the climactic final fight.\n\nSpeaking of the final fight, that has to be my favorite scene in the entire movie. This scene is easily my most favorite movie scene of all time! It's also one of the most important movie scenes in cinema history. This scene is so masterfully done, in my opinion. So much is said in this scene without any words being spoken. It all comes down to the characters' facial expressions, the camera shots, and the music. The music in this scene builds the tension so well, it has you on the edge of your seat! The tension in this scene is so thick, you could cut through it with a knife. When the shooting does finally start, it's like the crescendo of a piece of music. \n\nAll In all, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all time favorite western movie. 10 out of 10.",
