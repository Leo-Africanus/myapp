        "title": "The Lives of Others (2006) is incredible",
        "content": "The Lives of Others, or *Das Leben der Anderen*, is a German movie that came out to a lot of critical acclaim in 2006, and eventually won the Best International Film Oscar over Pan's Labyrinth. I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances\n\nThe summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to\u00a0Christa-Maria.\n\nWhile the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary. There are some thriller-esque elements to it, and the movie *can* be pretty tense at times - this isn't really the focus however, as it's more concerned with making a point about the impact of a political and socially repressive regime on its people, whether they're against it or are complicit in supporting it. \n\nThe performances are what really make this such a great experience. Ulrich M\u00fche as Wiesler is fantastic, especially considering how restrained and low-key the role is. He expresses so much with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. It almost feels like he created this entire person on screen without saying a single word about his personality, because pretty much all of his dialogue is strictly about the work he does. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are really good in their roles as well.\n\nThis is definitely a slow-burn narrative that grows in power and impact as it moves along. Honestly, for the first hour or so, I thought it was just \"good\" - well-acted and directed, but not really exceptional in any way. But halfway through, it hits another gear, the screws are tightened around the characters and it gradually transforms into a tense, anxiety-inducing story before eventually ending up as a bittersweet tragedy. \n\nI also have to applaud the ending, as it's one of the most cathartic and emotional conclusions to a movie I've seen in a while. The scene in the bookstore, with Wiesler going \"it's for me\" and the camera freezing on his face for a while - just beautifully done.\n\nAny other fans of this movie?",

Jerry asks, \u201cHow\u2019s Jean?\u201d Carl pauses and goes, \u201cWho\u2019s Jean?\u201d\nKilled me. \nHe didn\u2019t even know the name of the woman he kidnapped.\n\nAll the \u2018yeaaaah\u2019\u2019s always stuck. The accents also did play a huge part in making the movie so loveable. \nThey should do a serious sequel with Scotty (the son) and how he grows up all messed up. \n\nI love Steve Buscemi and William Macy together. (They\u2019ve done a few more movies together but I haven\u2019t watched any of them)\n\nI\u2019d love to watch more classics like this. Please recommend.\n",

        "content": "I was born in 1993, my first time watching Terminator 2 was with my family (when age appropriate, probably 10 years old or so lol) in preparation for us going to the Universal Studios theme park where they had the Terminator 3-D experience (does that even exist anymore?). \n\nMy brothers and I became obsessed and would literally put the DVD in just to watch the Minigun/Helicopter scene or the Motorcycle/Truck chase through the storm drains. \n\nWatched it with my wife last night, it\u2019s probably been at least 15 years since I watched it front to back, I could still quote most lines but now that I\u2019m an adult with a career, wife and pets that depend on me it felt completely different. \n\nThe scene that hit me the hardest was Sarah Connor attacking Miles Dyson\u2019s house. The man is brilliant, successful, has a beautiful house/family and is a part of a groundbreaking technology but also oblivious to the potential that this technology makes him \u201cresponsible for the death of 3 billion people\u201d because it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Why would he have thought of that? At the end he\u2019s willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind. \n\nSkynet doesn\u2019t even feel that farfetched at this point, in fact it\u2019s probably going to be worse considering there\u2019s no politics involved in the movie. \n\nI feel like my perspective on the movie completely changed from someone that idolized Arnold for being a badass to realizing how scary the reality is of the situation. \n\nAll of this is not mentioning the acting, special effects cinematography and everything that helped make the movie such an incredible experience. I hate to say it but it\u2019s as close to a perfect movie if I\u2019ve ever seen one. \n",

        "content": "I recently rewatched the movie, put it on as background noise, but found myself looking at it critically. I realized just how good of a movie it is and not just based off being a fan of DND. There\u2019s so much to like about this movie even if you don\u2019t like or care about DND.\n\nThe dialogue is tight. The plot is simple, but endearing. Characters are defined quickly and are all played really well. You can feel the sincerity and fun they had being these characters and being in the movie. \n\nWith Snow White being all over with comments from the actress disparaging romance in movies. I like how the movie counters the romantic plot being needed without having to call attention to it. I especially love Ed and Holga\u2019s relationship and how naturally platonic it is without needing one of them being secretly in love with the other or something cliche like that. I love how it ties into the overall plot as well with Ed realizing Holga was the mother his daughter loved and deserved. It reinforces the platonic dynamic and gives you an alternative family dynamic without feeling like it needs to justify it or parade it around unlike other movies that see it as a selling point. \n\nAll in all, this movie is amazing and something we need more of. I need another movie with this much depth and sincerity. ",

        "content": "For example, Incendies (2010) had a budget of $6.5 million dollars, which isn\u2019t a \u201csmall\u201d budget per se but considering it looks and feels larger scale than most Hollywood blockbusters, I\u2019d say it was an extremely cost efficient production. \n\nObviously, actors salaries can take up a large percentage of a films budget. Makes you wonder how much better movies would look if they focused on the film itself rather than casting the most \u201con trend\u201d actors. \n\nWhat other examples can you think of?",

        "content": "i want to differentiate that I don't think its the best crime film, but in terms of sheer scale its the biggest I have ever seen. from the various characters, subplots, the representation of Los Angeles. To the greatest shootout ever put on in film. Everything about this film is ambitious\n\nOne issue I have with it though is Neil is presented as a highly intelligent and calculated criminal. When he is talking to Michael telling him that he has other sources of income **\"t-bonds, real estate\"** and that he should cut lose. Shouldn't Neil also have other sources of income as well, alternative ways of making money. it almost makes it sound like he is dependent on the bank job and the scores he does, but maybe I am looking into it too much in that scene\n\nAll in All an epic film, and how do you guys feel about Mann trying to get Heat 2 off the ground, He just submitted his script which I assume is based off the book (which i haven't read yet)",

Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.\n\nI have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.\n\nFor example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.\n\nThe dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,\n\nThere is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. \n\nThen there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.\n\nI love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.\n\nAnyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",
