        "content": "r/movies is covering the Toronto International Film Festival this year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the fest. Included in our coverage will be AMAs/Q&amp;As, junkets, mod reviews/summaries, and community reviews. This post will cover the first of the fest. For information about TIFF, please visit tiff.net.\n\n***TIFF AMAs/Q&amp;As:***\n\n* [Tuesday 9/2 - Curry Barker, Director of Obsession](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n6hto7/hey_rmovies_im_filmmaker_curry_barker_milk_serial/)\n* [Wednesday 9/3 - Sean Ellis, Director of The Cut](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n6mf61/hey_reddit_im_sean_ellis_director_of_the_cut/)\n* [Thursday 9/4 - Chandler Levack, Director of Mile End Kicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/TIFF/comments/1n97oy0/hi_rtiff_im_chandler_levack_writerdirector_of_i/)\n\n***Upcoming Coverage:***\n\n* Wednesday 9/10 - In-Person Junket Interview with Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, LaKeith Stanfield, and Derek Cianfrance of Roofman\n* Wednesday 9/14 - Shasha Nakhai, Rich Williamson, Co-Directors of Bots &amp; Scarborough\n* Tuesday 9/30 - Nadia Latif, Director of The Man In My Basement\n\n***Mod Reviews/Summaries:***\n\n* *If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You*\n\n\tAn anxious fever dream of motherhood stress. Watch Rose Byrne lose it in real time as the camera focuses almost solely on her face and incredible performance. Conan O\u2019Brian and A$AP Rocky fill out this cast of oddballs, but they feel right at home in this surreal and experiential film.\n\n* *Nouvelle Vague*\n\n\tRichard Linklater gives credit to the birth of the French New Wave in this biopic about Jean Luc-Godard making the timeless classic Breathless. Not at all a brooding biopic, this feels more like a heist film as Godard and his ragtag crew, including a magnetic performance from Zoey Dutch as Jean Seberg, attempt to reinvent the rules of cinema in twenty days of shooting. You can see how this story inspires Linklater to do his thing and feel his love for this moment in cinema bursting off the screen.\n\n* *Eleanor the Great*\n\n\tScarlett Johansson\u2019s directorial debut sees June Squibb as a woman mourning the death of her lifelong friend and roommate and looking to start fresh in Manhattan at the age of 94 after she moves in with her daughter. This is an emotions-on-the-sleeve movie and the plot will leave a bad taste in a lot of people\u2019s mouths, but the end goal is to encourage us all to talk about grief more openly.\n\n* *Mile End Kicks*\n\n\tAn extremely Canadian autobiographical film the director, Chandler Levack, wrote about her time writing as a music critic in her early 20\u2019s. Barbie Fereirra stars in a boy crazy summer, a book deadline, and the many mistakes you will make on the way to finding out what you really want, this movie has all those feelings and more in a movie that falls somewhere between Almost Famous and Superbad.\n\n* *Nirvana the Band the Show the Movie*\n\n\tIf you\u2019re not familiar with this web series/show then don\u2019t fear, it just means you have the amount of context I did going on. And rest assured, this is still a hilarious and surprisingly well-executed journey through time and friendship. This is a reality movie, much like Borat, but there are concepts and filmmaking techniques in play that will legitimately make you scratch your head and wonder how the hell they pulled this off. \n\n* *No Other Choice*\n\n\tPark Chan-Wook\u2019s new masterpiece comes in the form of a Donald E. Westlake novel adaptation about a man forced to take extremely darkly comical steps to ensure his future in his dying industry. With classic Park wit and violence, this movie is never predictable and will put a cynical smirk on your face.\n\n* *Sentimental Value*\n\n\tOne of the hottest tickets of the week, Sentimental Value is the new film from Worst Person in the World director Joachim Trier. It\u2019s a steady but fascinating film about an absent father/famous Norwegian director, played by Stellan Skarsgaard, attempting to reconnect with his actress daughter, Renate Renseive, by writing a film for her and casting her in the main role. When she refuses, he sparks a friendship with a young American actress played by Elle Fanning and casts her in the role instead. This movie has an endless mirror quality to it with plenty of meta to go around as you watch Stellan try and form someone else into the daughter he so badly wants to make amends with, and as you watch her get jealous of the olive branch she denied going to someone else. \n\n* *The Lost Bus*\n\n\tPaul Greengrass is back with the true story of Kevin McLeod, a California bus driver who drove towards the Camp Wildfire of 2018 in order to save a classroom of children. Matthew McConaughey and America Farerra star in this thrilling disaster film.\n\n* *Christy*\n\n\tSydney Sweeney takes on the role of famous women\u2019s boxer Christy Martin who spent years married to her manager/trainer denying her queer identity and being mentally and physically abused. Sweeney impresses and Ben Foster is unrecognizable in this disturbing but freeing sports biopic.\n\n* *Bad Apples*\n\n\tSaorsie Ronan stars as a middle school teacher in a small community in Ireland who is at her wits end with a troubled boy in her class. As he continues to disrupt other students ability to learn and lashes out violently during school she accidentally does something extremely illegal to put a stop to it. This is a cynical film that was getting a lot of dark laughs from our crowd and is sold on some great performances from Saorsie and the kids at the center.\n\n* *Roofman*\n\n\tThe wild true story of Jeffrey Manchester, played by Channing Tatum, who robbed 40+ McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the early 2000s by breaking in through the roof and holding up the opening workers. The movie takes place after his escape from prison when he spends several months hiding out in a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and falling for a local woman played by Kirsten Dunst. This has a great ensemble cast and Derek Cianfrance has no problem finding the human side of this bizarre true crime story.\n\n* *100 Sunset*\n\n\tIn a Tibetan apartment building where everyone knows everyone, a teenager with a penchant for stealing befriends the young trophy wife of a new and mysterious resident. Half found footage film, half Sofia Coppola teen longing, all indie filmmaking.\n\n* *Dead Man\u2019s Wire*\n\n\tGus Van Sant tackles the true story of a kidnapping that took place in Indianapolis in 1977 in which a men rigged a shotgun around the neck of a corporate executive at his mortgage lending company and took him home in a days-long standoff with the police. Played incredibly with humor and gravity by Bill Skarsgaard, he speaks through a local radio DJ played by Colman Domingo and becomes a voice for all the people who have been taken advantage of by rich money-lenders. \n\n* *Sound of Falling*\n\n\tGerman arthouse at its most intriguing, Sound of Falling tells the story of four generations of daughters and mothers living on the same farm in Germany. Somewhere between Tarkovsky\u2019s Mirror and Nickel Boys, this movie weaves in and out of timelines and between characters as if the camera is a ghost out of time who sees the rhyming nature of all these lives but is privy to little context.\n\n* *Hedda*\n\n\tA new film from Candyman director Nia DaCosta, Hedda is a reimagining of the classic stage play Hedda Gerbler about a woman scheming and manipulating her way into continued riches even if it keeps her trapped in a society marriage. Tessa Thompson plays this Hedda with heavy tones of queerness and sexual charge as well as a wily unpredictability and Nia feels right at home directing a project that is truly hers. \n\n***Community Reviews:***\n\n* I really enjoyed Eleanor the Great. I laughed and then cried. It was very moving and great performances, especially by June. The audience gave it a standing ovation tonight. - u/Wonderful__\n* Dead Man\u2019s Wire - just brilliant, the tension was there throughout while still managing to have so much humour. bill skarsgard is amazing in this role (a little bummed that he couldn\u2019t be there for the premiere), might be my favourite film from the festival so far!! - u/residentofhell\n* No Other Choice - 9.5/10. My top film of the festival so far. Its critique of capitalism isn\u2019t groundbreaking, but the film is much more than that. What it has to say about individual moral choices people make in such a system is where it shines. Wonderful characters. Expert use of symbolism. As expected with Park, visually stunning. - u/BenefitIndependent88\n* The Last Viking: No expectations going in and it\u2019s a MUST SEEEEE. I laughed. I cried. Fantastic and lovable characters. This deserves the people\u2019s choice awarddd. 4.5/5 - u/Maester_Hodor\n* Blue Moon - Small and intimate character study. The script is a standout with its remarkably smooth flow and witty, but not excessive, jokes. I did not however enjoy the color grading looking like a whiskey commercial and the cold open scene, which I found jarring compared to the rest of the film. - /u/[cleric\\_of\\_deneir](https://www.reddit.com/user/cleric_of_deneir)\n* Hey, ah, where can I find the\u00a0Sir\u0101t\u00a0support group? Because Jesus Christ. - /u/[johnlukegoddard](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnlukegoddard)\n* Roofman - 4/5, just a fun ride all around. Blends a mix of action, comedy, and drama. Channing Tatum is charismatic, as always, but this is the most serious role I\u2019ve seen him in! Also appreciated that the director came to introduce this for the regular screening. - /u/CinemaBud\n* Only five star film I have seen so far is THE VOICE OF HIND RAJAB and it\u2019s not because of my political leaning, it is a smartly made recreation that locks you in and emotionally devastates you. After that I probably enjoyed DEAD MAN\u2019s WIRE the most, Van Sant doing his riff on Fargo. 4/5. - /u/[MikeRotzzz](https://www.reddit.com/user/MikeRotzzz)\n* Eternity - probably around an 8/10. I really liked this one a lot. It's been my favourite so far. It was really funny, I love the kind of humour the dialogue had and it was a fun environment to be in. Gets you thinking about death and what you would do if there was an afterlife. My friend and I were discussing after what kind of eternity we would choose. Da'Vine Joy Randolph and John Early were fantastic together. They were so hilarious. We had Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner (man, he is so handsome), John Early, and director David Freyne for the intro and then John, Elizabeth, and the director for a Q&amp;A, which was a nice surprise. I guess Miles and Callum couldn't stay. I'm pretty sure this is going to be near the top of my festival rankings when I'm done and will probably be on favourites of the year list. - /u/[mistakes\\_were\\_made24](https://www.reddit.com/user/mistakes_were_made24)\n* Hamnet: 5/5 (actually 10/5): I knew the reviews were good going into this but I was not expecting this good a film. Poignant and heartbreaking in equal amounts, this has to be a front runner for the Oscar\u2019s at this point. Especially for Best Actress, cause holy shit, Jessie Buckley\u2019s performance. - /u/[BreadfruitWorth](https://www.reddit.com/user/BreadfruitWorth)\n* Sacrifice - 2/10. Has a couple funny moments and themes perhaps provide something to chew on. But satire is hard these days and this didn\u2019t get over that hurdle for me. Characters aren\u2019t grounded in reality and the filmmaking seems like it was done by someone who mostly makes music videos. Maybe this just wasn\u2019t for me, but it really really wasn\u2019t for me. - /u/[BenefitIndependent88](https://www.reddit.com/user/BenefitIndependent88)\n* The Furious: - 9/10 - OMG an action film has never left me breathless. To be clear, there is very little story. A mute father goes to save his daughter after she\u2019s abducted on the streets of \u201csomewhere in SE asia\u201d. But honestly who cares. Wall to wall dances of insane fight scenes that are hard to believe anyone could pull off. A+ midnight madness programming. - /u/[Lolakery](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lolakery)\n* Frankenstein- 4/5 stars. Solid film; you'll be guaranteed to be entertained at the cinema, though it's not the type of film that sticks with your soul after you leave. There's quite a few changes from the novel but I thought it captures the spirit of the story well, and I think they were necessary to keep the film under 5 hours lol- it already feels quite bloated as it is (the first half especially drags a bit). As expected, the vibes are immaculate- set, costumes, shots are all beautiful and it really manages to capture the gothic vibes of the story. Oscar Issac &amp; and Jacob elordi were terrific, but I found Mia Goth distracting during her scenes because she kept doing this head nodding thing whenever she had a line. All in all it's a good movie. - /u/[evil-poatotes](https://www.reddit.com/user/evil-poatotes)\n\n",

        "title": "Watching Juno again in 2025",
        "content": "When Juno came out in 2007, I was 14 years old. I went to see this in the theaters with a friend and I remember thinking that I liked it, but I mostly took away Juno's quirky one-liners and tried to adapt them in real life, and failed miserably. I had watched it a few times after and always enjoyed it, but never really had any strong feelings towards it other than a \"no way do I want to ever be a pregnant teenager\" mindset. \n\nI just rewatched Juno for the first time in probably 12 years. Oh My God. Now, I'm 32 and have a child of my own (she's 2). There was so much more that jumped out to me this time around, so much that I missed as a teenager. I think it was really beautifully done, how a teenager's perspective and an adult's perspective were both so truthfully represented in this movie. Juno's character\u00a0is one of the most original, strong, hilarious, and self-aware that I've ever seen in a film. As a teenager, I thought she was a little \"weird\", and as an adult, I'd be honored to have a teenager like that involved in my life in just about any way. \n\nAs a teenager, I thought that Juno's and Bleeker's relationship was different than most teenage relationships, but that they loved each other. As an adult, I can see that it is a young love that got dangerously close to being violently shoved into adulthood.\n\nI always thought Mark was cool watching the movie when I was younger, and the very first time I saw them start to slow dance, alarm bells would go off in my head and I'd be like \"um, what is going on\". I always thought that Mark liked Juno and wanted to leave Vanessa to be with her. As an adult, I think Mark was just more envious of Juno's youth and clean slate after the adoption. She just held a figurative mirror up to his face, and he could see that he was going down the wrong path for himself, and then proceeded to handle it like a jackass. \n\nIn 2007, I couldn't even imagine telling my parents I was pregnant and having them react like that Juno's dad and stepmom in the movie. And now, being a parent of a daughter no less, I have a goal for that to obviously not happen for her, but to really try and remember this scene from the movie and bring that energy into the room should she come to me and tell me she's pregnant when she's 16. Best reaction I think I could give. \n\nI also had a theory about Juno and her birth mother's relationship. She mentions her mom left when she was young, and got remarried, and started a new family across the country, and mails her a cactus every year on Valentine's Day. When Juno is telling us all of this, she mentions the word \"abondonment\", and I wonder if that played a roll in her being so willing to give up her baby for adoption. She was so strong-willed, and I don't know that I would have had the strength to do that, even being a teenager. Any other thoughts on that?\n\nLastly, I was confused as to why Vanessa appeared to have a reaction when Juno told her that she found their ad in the Penny Saver. Did anyone else think Vanessa appeared confused or like wtf? \n\n",

        "content": "I\u2019m talking about movies that start strong with great concept, characters and then halfway through, they either fall apart or just forget what made them interesting in the first place.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s Reminiscence (2021). The premise is incredible. A memory-retrieval noir set in a flooded Miami. Feels like Blade Runner fanfic set in the world of Inception.\n\nBut halfway through, it just evaporates. The plot turns into a sluggish romance, the mystery fizzles, and Hugh Jackman ends up swimming through people\u2019s memories in a tank. All the momentum vanishes in a haze of voiceovers, flashbacks, and unnecessary monologues about time.\n\nNot talking about movies that were bad from the start, I mean the ones that trick you into thinking they\u2019re about to be amazing. What\u2019s your pick?\n\n",

All they have is junk food, and arcade games for sale--those seem to do well, I guess--but where's the merch? I would never buy junk food, but I would buy a poster. Why are they foregoing my money? Isn't it a big, ongoing problem that movies are failing to make enough money for the studio?\n\nBy the time I get home, I've either forgotten I wanted some swag, or the feeling has worn off and I am not motivated enough to go look for it online.\n\nMy theater seems to have a lot of free floor space, where mini kiosks / checkouts of swag would fit, or just fit it behind the counter with the candy and popcorn.\n\nI don't get why there isn't movie merch at the movie theater.\n\nThere has to be a reason.

        "content": "This can be in any possible genre of film, but I'm wondering if there's any actresses who mostly play characters that are good, well intentioned or flawed but not completely terrible, but there's the potential for them to play a character that's not redeemable or who just consistently behaves in a nasty fashion. No joke comments also.\n\nI have a feeling that Emma Stone is soon going to play a role like this. Her performance in The Curse is notable for being maybe the least likeable character she's ever been, but I wouldn't call Whitney a villain and her nastiness is balanced out by some measure of pity. I don't know what her character in Bugonia will be like, but given how adventurous she's been as an actress recently, I feel like she's soon set to play a character who's a terrible person from start to finish and doesn't even invoke pity. There might still be that charm she's known for, but you could easily pull that off. ",

        "title": "The Beginning Scene of Crime and Punishment (1969)",
        "content": "I read the novel, Crime and Punishment, and loved it more with each page. I frequently chatted to my siblings about it (they've never read the novel), and I decided that I'd look for an adaptation so I can experience it with them. If I wanted them to just experience it, sure, I'd throw them my copy of the book, but it's much cooler when you're sitting there with them. I think that's why movie adaptations of books exist, at least partly.\n\nAnyway, I found that this adaptation, an almost four-hour-long movie made in the Soviet Union was the most faithful adaptation, and for the most part, it was pretty good! Of course, the novel will always be better, as you're so much closer to the cast (and I mean that; in the movie, Razumikhin barely does anything, but in the novel, he's one of the best characters), and parts of the plot are explored deeper like Luzhin and Svidrigailov. In spite of all of that, this was a great movie, but this opening scene really stuck out to me. It's my favorite movie scene *of all time.* This is what the inner monologue was attempting to be. The melancholic music mixed with the Nosferatu-esque framing of Raskolnikov makes it terrifying. The still shots of him walking down the bridge to him staring out the window paints him to be a demon. It's brilliant, and I wish the rest of the movie follows through with this idea.\n\nAnyway, if you haven't read Crime and Punishment, you absolutely should! It's the best novel I've ever read, but if you don't wanna sit through 600\\~ pages, the movie's a great pick too. It's never had a remaster, so I found it on YouTube, and it was split into two parts.\n\nIf you don't know what Crime and Punishment is about, here's my unofficial (though accurate) synopsis:\n\n*Set in mid-19th century St. Petersburg, Crime and Punishment focuses on 23-year-old Raskolnikov. He frequently pawns items to a woman named Alyona, and she's a stingy, abusive, cruel, disgusting old hag who piles her money while doing no good with it. He finds himself in a moral dilemma: would it not be a good thing if he murdered and robbed her, and then gave her money to the less fortunate? Raskolnikov tests this theory, but finds himself haunted by the unexpected guilt and paranoia of the murder. He attempts to justify the murder using his own philosophies, but can't escape the horrors of what he's done.*",

Or was it a matter of \u201cwe love this\u201d and as time went on, the legend grew and grew?\nOn the same hand, Part II is also considered to be one of the greatest sequels of all time and even some consider it just as good as the original. Was that always the case?\n\nI\u2019m fascinated because in the year of our lord 2025, online discourse would have you believe everything is either considered to be a masterpiece or complete dumpster fire, so I\u2019m curious to know what exactly people thought at the time.
