The movies, the cartoons, and the toys.\n\nBut as I got older I started realizing more and more that \u201cGhostbusters 2\u201d had a less than stellar reputation. That shocked me. I mean is it as good as the first? No. But it\u2019s still a damn good time. It\u2019s got a great plot device(negative charged slime), a scary bad guy(VIGO!), some fun set pieces(court room bust) but most all?\nYou get to spend time with these actors playing these characters. They have this wonderful chemistry together. \n\nThey have such great chemistry. I remember coming across the IMDb score for the 2nd Ghostbusters. Back then it was much lower than it is now. In the 5/10 range. What gives?\n\nI watched Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, fans of the first film, rip the sequel to shreds. \n\nI would read how critics and audiences thought it\u2019s a retread of the first film, it wasn\u2019t funny, didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhy are people still not believing in ghosts after the first film\u201d. That last one never made sense to me. In the entire film only like 3 people say they don\u2019t believe. One or which is an insane judge. Another a kid I mean\u2026it\u2019s 2025 and people still think we didn\u2019t go to the moon or that the earth is flat. So I don\u2019t think everyone would be accepting to the idea of ghosts and marshmallow men. \n\n\nSo what are some other examples of films you loved then found out they weren\u2019t as liked or respected as you imagined?",

They've somehow managed to bridge the gap between critical acclaim and cult following in a way that feels unique in today's fragmented media landscape.\n\nTheir formula seems deceptively simple: find distinctive directorial voices, give them creative freedom, market the films with striking visuals and minimal exposition, and let word-of-mouth do the rest. But the consistency is remarkable.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is how they've become a trusted brand for younger audiences who might otherwise be disengaged from non-franchise cinema. The way their films spread through TikTok and social media feels different from traditional film marketing.\n\nDo you think any other studio has matched their cultural impact in recent years? ",

The story was good.  His dark hero character was interesting. Seeing him bald he's almost unrecognizable. I like that there's no set up for a sequel it's a complete movie within. What are some other one and done movies that need no sequel?",

It\u2019s full of strange philosophies that may sound silly at first, but they reveal something deeply true. These days, we can hardly live without smartphones or the internet \u2014 they\u2019re practically owning us.  \nWhenever I take a break from them, I feel a sense of real freedom.  \nBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not looking to punch anyone in a basement like in Fight Club!",

        "content": "So\u2026I finally decided to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin. After finishing the movie, I came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall. One question that keeps coming up is: Why didn\u2019t Kevin kill his mother?\n\nA lot of people interpret it as Kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reaction\u2014and while I agree with that interpretation to some extent, I have a different take I\u2019d like to share.\n\nI think Kevin didn\u2019t kill his mother because doing so would\u2019ve given his actions a clear motive. Let me explain.\n\nThere\u2019s a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those \u201ccrash CDs,\u201d and he replies: \u201cThere is no point. That\u2019s the point.\u201d That line really stuck with me. It shows that Kevin is fascinated by meaningless things\u2014things that have no purpose.\n\nWhich brings me to my theory: he killed his father, sister, and classmates because there was no reason to. His father was kind to him, his sister was just a child, and the classmates didn\u2019t really do anything to him. There was no personal vendetta. And in Kevin\u2019s twisted worldview at the time, that lack of meaning made it worth doing.\n\nBut killing his mother? That would have made sense. That would have had a clear motive:revenge, hatred, resentment. And that\u2019s exactly why he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nAt the end of the movie, when she asks him \u201cWhy?\u201d, he says, \u201cI used to think I knew. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d To me, that shows he\u2019s grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness, and now he\u2019s left with confusion and regret, or at least uncertainty.\n",

But he mostly does a lot of obscure and low budget films. He really could\u2019ve been up there with the all timers, he should\u2019ve had a much bigger career in my opinion",
