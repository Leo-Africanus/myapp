That being said, what he does i feel is intangible. \n\nHe isn't super funny, his \"acting\" isn't especially spectacular, he doesn't pull some DDL or Meryl Streep shit, he doesn't take his shirt off or have a sex scene or anything. He's just...magnetic and highly watchable.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Hill, PSH, Pratt, all the supporting cast and the script are great, but Pitt delivers a movie star performance. What is the best example of this you can think of? A good movie elevated to phenomenal solely because a movie star was a movie star. Pure charisma. I'm thinking Clooney/Pitt in the Oceans movies, Newman in Cool Hand Luke and Butch Cassidy, Leo in Titanic. \n\nWhat's the best example you can think of? ",

        "content": "A long-lost piece of media is finally coming to the screen after 25 years.\n\nHouston Cinema Arts Society presents the world premiere of Dreams in the Attic, a never-before-aired live-action television film starring the late Shelley Duvall (The Shining, Faerie Tale Theatre) in one of her final roles. Filmed in 1999 on 16mm in Galveston and Houston, the movie was shelved after being passed over by the Disney Channel and has remained unseen for over two decades.\n\nIn celebration of Shelley Duvall\u2019s birthday, the film will premiere at Houston\u2019s historic River Oaks Theatre, marking its first public screening. Duvall stars as Aunt Nellie, the eccentric owner of a costume shop whose magical attic trunk allows anyone who tries on its costumes to bring their dreams to life.\n\nThe film features a standout cast including Haylie Duff (Napoleon Dynamite, Lizzie McGuire), Mary McDonough (The Waltons), and Vanessa Lee Chester (The Lost World: Jurassic Park). Long whispered about among fans of lost media, Dreams in the Attic has built a cult following based on its mysterious trailer and IMDb listing. Until now, no complete version of the film has ever been released or shown to the public.\n\nThe screening will include a post-film conversation with director Bob Willems, along with additional cast and crew members who will share behind-the-scenes stories and reflect on the film\u2019s unusual journey to the screen. Also joining the conversation is Sarah Lukowski, founder of the Shelley Duvall Archive, who will speak on Shelley\u2019s legacy and her friendship with the actress.\n\nThis special evening will honor Shelley Duvall\u2019s extraordinary career, her Houston roots, and a long-lost film that never got the chance to shine\u2014until now.\n\nTickets are limited. Be the first audience to see this film and reserve your seat today for this magical, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience!",

That scene where he prays to all religions lol\n\nAnd the soundtrack is amazing! \n\nDid anyone go watch it when it was rereleased last year. \n\nI think severely underrated. \n\nMy favorite scene will always be the prison warden getting all excited when he finds his treasure, and then going crazy when the bug eats his brain and he goes crazy and runs and crashes into the wall. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nI still remember my parents taking me as a kid to watch this movie in 1999. Amazing experience.\n\nEven the rides at LA and orlando are so fun",

Not necessarily full-on antihero stuff, but just stories where the characters are messy, conflicted, and maybe even a little unlikeable but still human\n\nI think it's because I find myself more engaged when I don't know who I'm supposed to root for. It makes the story feel less predictable and more real. Sometimes I even walk away still unsure how I feel about a character\u2026 and I kinda love that\n\nAnyone else prefer movies like this?
