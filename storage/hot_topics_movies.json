        "content": "We are **Janty Yates** (Costume Designer) and **David Crossman** (Costume Designer \u2013 Military Costumes) and we had the pleasure of working on Ridley Scott\u2019s new film, Gladiator II. We\u2019ve both spent decades working in the industry, garnering awards, and working on some of the biggest movies in Hollywood.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on Ridley Scott projects previously, and between the two of us, we\u2019ve worked on franchises like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Alien. With an eye for detail, and a love of storytelling, our passion for outfitting the right actors in the perfect wardrobes is very special to us both.\n\nIf you want to know more about the process, the methods, and the artistry of costume design for big, epic movies, we\u2019re here to take your questions.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\n\n* [Janty Yates](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946765/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703178&amp;usg=AOvVaw3l_HfawFgp6Rgx07DWbfZl), Costume Designer. Yates has worked in this field since 1989 and has two Academy Award nominations, including one win.

I'll start us of with this:\n\nThe rumour about A Quiet Place originally being written as a Cloverfield sequel. This is not true. The writers wrote the story, then upon speaking to their representatives, they learned that Bad Robot was looping in pre-existing screenplays into the Cloververse, which became a cause for concern for the two writers. It was Paramount who decided against this, and allowed the film to be developed and released independently of the Cloververse as intended. \n\nEdit: As suggested in the comments, don't forget to provide sources to properly prevent the spread of more rumours. I'll start:\n\n[Here's my source about A Quiet Place](https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/a-quiet-place-cloverfield-1201950098/)",

        "content": "I actually saw this at an early screening so it was before any of the reviews had come out, and having been all over the board with M Night, I never really know what to expect, but the concept for this one was more interesting to me than either of the last two movies he's made, so I was at least curious to check it out.\n\nAs far as the 'believability' of it, I was a little surprised how many people seemed to just totally be in shock that M Night would make a film with a ridiculous concept, given that he also made a movie about a beach that makes you old, meaning I wasn't exactly holding out for stark realism. I admit, it is an absurd premise, but when the movie is being pitched as 'Silence of the Lambs at a Taylor Swift concert', I'm not going into it expecting anything other than entertaining schlock, which is exactly what I got. It feels like a slightly shitty De Palma movie, but I'll take a flawed, original concept over fucking Venom 3 or Red One any day.\n\nThe main reason this works at all, for me at least, is Josh Hartnett. M Night movies live or die on their characters, and while this is nowhere near Bruce Willis in Unbreakable or James McAvoy in Split, I still thought he really understood exactly what he needed to bring, and the fact that it was contextualized as 'an obsessive serial killer in a highly tense situation having to feign normalcy' made the signature weird Shyamalan dialogue make a lot more sense, especially when the daughter would call him out on sounding weird.\n\nHis performance (and the film in general) has been compared to the Hitman games, and I think that's pretty apt. It's also a movie where the overall quality of the production combined with the ridiculousness helps make it feel like 'polished/\"elevated\" schlock', which studios aren't really making a lot of anymore, for better or for worse.\n\nAfter rewatching it on streaming the other night just to see if anything had changed from the early version I saw (it hadn't), I can definitely admit the hype of being at a screening gave me a bit of a rose-tinted view of it the first time, but in general I still thought it was a fun movie with more self awareness than Shyamalan usually has, and had enough fun with its concept that I was a little bummed when it seemed like most people really weren't digging it, at least at first. Curious how y'all felt about this one.",

        "content": "What. A. Fantastic. Movie.\n\nSo I'm on rewatch number: ??? and once again I'm left entertained and satisfied by this wonderful movie from Peter Weir. \n\nI think this is Russell Crowes best role. Of course his performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius was iconic but his performance as Captain Jack Aubrey was, imo, on another level. I'll admit I haven't read the books so I'm not 100% sure he physically resembles his book counterpart.\n\nOpposite him is a wonderful Paul Bettany as Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Their friendship is the heat of the movie and Crowe and Bettany sold me on what is a living friendship between two rather different men. \n\nMy favorite character is Mr. Blakeney. His entire character arc is fantastic start to finish, post his arm surgery is some great story telling seeing as he leads a boarding party to great effect. \n\nThe best sequence is of course the expedition on the Galapagos island where Stephen intended name a tortoise after Aubrey. I do think using Prelude is cheating seeing as it's a excellent piece of music. \n\nWe also get a few haunting scenes.\n\nWe have a man over board situation where the Captain is forced to cut wreckage loose ultimately dooming the sailor...and that sailor's friend had to assist in the cutting.\n\n Mr. Holm being scapegoated as a Jonah ends up committing suicide in a terrifying way...we see his eyes fade into the inky darkness of the sea as Mr. Blakeney looks on helpessly. \n\nThe best scene is the higher ranking officers at dinner getting hammered and making weevil puns.\n\nIt's a 10/10 movie and a crying shame we didn't get any other movies from Weir.",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than 20 days, I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. For example, two days ago, it was Italy's turn in this little filmic journey and I have to say: While I'm a bit disappointed, that literally nobody mentioned *A Roman Holiday* or (if you want a genuine italian movie to win) any part of the *Don Camillo* series, I think we have another deserving winner here. It got really exciting again: At one point it looked as if  *Ladri di biciclette* (engl.: *Bicycle Thieves*) would be the first film from the 40s to make the list, and in between there was a real neck-and-neck race with *La Vita E Bella* (engl.: *Life is Beautiful*), but in the end ***Nuovo Cinema Paradiso*** (that was only called *Cinema Paradiso* in the English distribution for whatever reason) has brought it home.\n\nBecause I started the next round a bit earlier yesterday (in order to watch *Gladiator II*, another movie mostly set in Italy), I have another winner to announce. The victory here was very clear - the only controversy in some parts of the world might be that I see the region in question as a country in its own right. Nevertheless, I am happy to give ***Zgjoi*** (engl.: *Hive*) a spot in [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). before we move on to the next country: **Latvia**. For those of you who are still new here, here are the two rules of this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n# \n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italia - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "content": "I'm a sucker for a good Western movie but somehow, mostly due to negative critical response, I had never watched Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp. I finally watched it last night and I was blown away.\n\nI know it often gets unfavourably compared with Tombstone, and I love Tombstone, but to me it's far more absorbing and an all round better film. You get a far better understanding of the Earps, their flawed personalities and what led to the OK Corral shootout and consequent vendetta.\n\nI struggle to understand what the critics issue with it was? Yes it was long, at just over 3 hours, but it never felt bloated. I never felt that any of it was over indulgent. The shootout at the OK Corral was, as far as I'm aware, pretty much true to life. Far more abrupt and less Hollywood than it's usually depicted.\n\nAlso the performances were superb. I never thought anyone could surpass Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, but Dennis Quaid was absolutely sensational and brought a dark, unhinged menace to the role that I really enjoyed. You can tell he's really struggling to hold his fraying will to live together.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind strapping in for a 3 hour biopic.",

        "content": "I'm sure there's a range here, but generally when you see something like Seven Bucks for The Rock or Plan B for Brad Pitt, what can you expect the behind the scenes work to be to get this production credit?  In The Rock's case it almost seems like it's just a requirement for him appearing in the movie.  Does he actually get involved in getting the movie made beyond slapping his name on it?  Meanwhile I've seen a lot of Plan B movies that don't have Brad Pitt in them, so I'm guessing they're actually involved in getting the movie produced.\n\nSo what's the typical involvement like? What differentiates a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson from a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson &amp; Produced by Seven Bucks?  And why/how are these different than just \"Executive Producer Nicole Kidman\" or something?",

        "content": "So I watched this movie yesterday not really knowing anything about it except that Nic Cage was in it. The movie itself was pretty average although I now understand it\u2019s a cult classic having read up on it after watching.\n\nI gotta say, Nic Cage gives an incredibly wild performance which I\u2019m still trying to determine if this was a classic case of Nic Cage overacting antics or he was in fact just brilliant. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure is he was 100% committed to the role, and I was there with him all the way despite the quality of the movie. It\u2019s like watching someone who is way over the top, but he makes you believe that he believes in himself and what he is doing.\n\nHe\u2019s a remarkable person, strange and fascinating, eccentric and spot on at times in his acting performances. The guy can act when he puts his mind to it, as witnessed in Pig where he was much more subtle. Then you see him in something like Colour Out Of Space, his performance was eccentric to say the least but still watchable all the same like you can\u2019t take your eyes off of him. At times you cringe when he goes off the reservation and other times you\u2019re in awe of his more memorable performances thinking \u201cIs this the same guy??\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his Vampire\u2019s Kiss role?",
