        "content": "&gt;The film is notable for the performance of child actor John Adames (also known as Juan Adames), for which he won the first ever Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor, shared with Laurence Olivier for his role in The Jazz Singer. Adames, who had been cast after an open call, was between five and seven years old when cast, and his character Phil Dawn was six. He did not have any subsequent film roles afterwards.\nAdames' performance was criticized by contemporary reviewers, who according to critic Ray Carney, expected Adames to be \"cute and cuddly\", and when he was not, they judged that Cassavetes had failed. Eric Henderson of Slant magazine posited that the criticism was due to Adames' vocal delivery, which he compared to \"what Paddy Chayefsky would sound like impersonating Alvin Chipmunk\".\nRoger Ebert praised Adames' performance, calling him \"well cast\".\n\nSome critics do go out of control in how they review kids' performances. If someone deserves criticism, it's the director. A 5 year old doesn't deserve to be torn to shreds by pretentious film critics who expect every film to be Citizen Kane.",

It's pretty rare for me to watch a movie I know very little about but I saw it had good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and starred Jim Cummings who I've followed on social media for a while and has some really good takes on getting low budget movies made.\n\nI really enjoyed it. It's a low budget movie but you can see every single dollar they had is up on the screen. The performances are rock solid and its twisty turny enough to hold your interest.\n\nIt's the kind of movie everyone complains about doesn't get made any more so I feel like it deserves to make more money and I wanted to give it a shout out.\n\nIf you know of other movies that have been lost amongst the noise then please give them some love here.\n\n  \nEDIT: Interested to know why you loved it too.

No title no cast no film date.\n\nEither way I\u2019m looking forward to it, I don\u2019t think Trey and Matt have made a theatrical film since Team America. Vernon Chatman is also involved which has me even more excited.\n\nCurious to know what\u2019s going on the film. The premise alone sounds fucking wild.",

        "content": "Inspired by James Raterman, a real ex-military interrogator starring in One Battle After Another. Especially impressive when you consider how he's holding his own against actors with decades worth of tenure. \n\nAny others come to mind?\n\nBria Vinaite in The Florida Project blew me away when I first saw her going toe to toe with Willem Dafoe. She sank into that role.\n\nKeith Williams Richards, one of the goons from Uncut Gems is intimidating as shit too, and the casting department found him on the NY subway. Hell, you could even consider Julia Fox at that time a non-actor.\n\nNikki Reed in Thirteen is pretty exceptional as well. Co-starring with an Oscar winner in a semi-autobiographical film she wrote - knocked it out of the park, \n\nEdit: Equally interested in people who started off as non-actors and parlayed it into a career, like the cast of KIDS. Rosario Dawson was streetcast and has had an illustrious Hollywood career alongside Chloe Sevigny and Leo Fitzpatrick.",

        "title": "The \"anonymous hero\" moments in movies hit me way harder than the main hero scenes",
        "content": "I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for moments in movies where a random, unnamed background character - a soldier, bystander, worker, etc. - suddenly does something heroic or deeply human.\n\nNot the clich\u00e9 \u201credshirt\u201d stuff where they die for shock value or a quick joke, but when the film actually treats them as real people, even if it\u2019s just for a few seconds. Maybe they stand up when everyone else hesitates, or stay behind to hold a line, or help someone escape - even though we\u2019ll never learn their name.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about them dying, really. Sometimes the best ones are when they don\u2019t: they just make a choice to act bravely and keep going. Like they step out of the background, do something meaningful, and then quietly fade back into the world.\n\nI also love when a main character is struggling alone, and a few strangers step up to help - not in a way that turns them into new sidekicks or \u201cimportant\u201d characters, but just people who decide to stand alongside them for a bit. Those moments of shared courage between strangers hit really deep for me.\n\nI can\u2019t fully explain why, but these little glimpses of anonymous heroism often hit me way harder than the big \u201cmain hero saves the day\u201d scenes. Maybe because it feels truer - like the movie suddenly remembers that everyone in its world has their own story and potential for bravery.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? And what are your favorite examples of these kinds of moments? I would love to find new movies/shows with these premises (obviously, not just to watch one scene but to me I feel like the writers really know what they're doing if they include this)",
