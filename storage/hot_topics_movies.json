Of course, like many, I saw them back in high school\u2014but watching them now, with fresh eyes and a bit more life behind me, left me in absolute awe.\n\nQuentin Tarantino truly crafted something unreal with these films. The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography\u2026 it\u2019s all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.\n\nI\u2019ve been craving that \u201choly sh*t, THIS is cinema\u201d feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It\u2019s a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.\n\nSo if it\u2019s been a few years\u2014or you\u2019ve only ever seen it once\u2014this is your sign to queue it up. You won\u2019t regret it.",

And it was like watching two totally different movies smashed together. \n\nI saw it recommended in a thread here recently. Couldn't remember why though. I just gave it a quick search and saw that it was George Clooney, Harvey Kitel, Selma Hyek and that Tarantino had something to do with it. Sounded like the makings of a good flick.\n\nI generally hate spoilers, so I usually don't read much about movies outside of the basic premise before I watch them. The last movie that blindsided me this bad was when I watched Bone Tomahawk. \n\nAnyone else get blindsided by this movie? What other movies totally caught you off guard?",

        "content": "This movie is exactly what cinema is about experiencing a world which one doesnt know anything about it and still mesmerized by it. A well paced, good script, well acted movie about less known stories who arent as flashy and glamour.\n\nThere are so many aspect of baseball which i didnt get ofcourse but I dont even think this movie needs a person to know so much about baseball.\n\nPoint is this movie subverts almost every sports movie clich\u00e9. I am a big football fan and I follows different clubs, league games, manegerial stuff, transfers nd all And i can resonate every thing about movie. There\u2019s no big championship scene, no locker room speech, no slow-mo victory montage. Instead, it\u2019s about spreadsheets, stats, undervalued players and background story of how much pressure they go through.\n\nBrad pitt was just excellent and he should have won oscar for this one rather than OUATIH. Its simply one of the best nuanced performance i have ever seen. Brings so much depth to the character without going offbeat for once yet hit every stress conflict scenes perfectly. Probably my fav performance of him\n\nEmotional as well last scene, that daughter tape made me smile and sad at same time.\n\nIf there is any person who havent seen this movie, give it a chance its something very rare and fresh air. 10/10 already one of my all time fav movies list.",

One of my favorite LOTR scenes is all about this; the scene in \"Return of the King\" after the four hobbits have returned to the Shire and are sitting at the Green Dragon pub surrounded by their fellow hobbits and awkwardly feeling out of place. It's a moment very akin to soldiers coming back from war and one that J.R.R. Tolkien, himself a WWI veteran, would approve of; the foursome have been through so much that they can never fit in amongst their fellow hobbits again (and indeed, not one of them ends up spending their final days in the Shire). It's not just \"how can we go back to our mundane old lives after everything we've been through\", it's also, \"wow, we've been outside the cave, we can never relate to these people again.\" It's one of the quietest moments of the trilogy and yet very effective in how much experiences can make your old life unobtainable again.",

        "content": "Phenomenal movie with a lot of memorable scenes and characters, but the standout is obviously Dementus\n\nEven from a design standpoint, he\u2019s very distinct. A cape made of a parachute, crooked nose, and the teddy bear on his armor. Also a super nasally and abrasive voice. I would say in terms of cruelty, he probably does the most fucked up things of any villain from the last few years, including to his own men\n\nWe know very little about his backstory other than that his family was killed early on in the wasteland, leaving him with only the teddy bear to remember them by. As a result, Dementus commits heinous acts just to feel something, anything. While it gives him an initial rush of adrenaline, we see how he has to do worse and worse things just to feel something, until it\u2019s never enough. In his old age, he\u2019s extra unhinged and obsessed with misery. In his \u201cthere is no hope!\u201d speech, I kind of interpreted Dementus as being upset with the idea of other people finding solace in eachother.\n\nEarlier in the movie, he tries to become a twisted father figure to Furiosa and have her replace the family he lost, and seems genuinely hurt when she hates him (he lacks the self awareness to know she would obviously hate him for killing her mother)",

        "title": "'Predator: Killer of Killers' - Review Thread",
        "content": "**Rotten Tomatoes:** [97%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/predator_killer_of_killers)\n\n**Metacritic:** [80/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-killer-of-killers/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Total Film - Amy West - 5/5](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/predator-killer-of-killers-review-great-characters-thrilling-action-and-gorgeous-arcane-esque-animation/)\n\n&gt;It's clear Wassung and Trachtenberg just get it. Somehow, they're able to push the sci-fi envelope and offer up fresh images and ideas the series has yet to see, while also appealing to diehard fans with Easter eggs (keeps your eyes peeled for a pistol in the final act and a franchise-first look at something fans have been dying to see realized since 1987), as well as cheeky teases of a connected universe and potential sequel, too. Before we get anything like that, though, the latter  is set to release the upcoming live-action flick Predator: Badlands, yet another take on the menacingly-mandibled meanies. After Prey, we had faith the series was in good hands. After Predator: Killer of Killers, we don't want anyone else getting their mitts on it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-killer-of-killers-review-dan-trachtenbergs-animated-anthology-puts-an-inventive-spin-on-a-durable-franchise-1236247198/)\n\n&gt;Predator: Killer of Killers provides the non-stop action that the diehard fans crave. And no concession has been made to the animated format; the film easily earns its R rating with copious amounts of gruesome violence and bloody gore that should well sate viewers\u2019 bloodthirsty tendencies. The animation takes a bit of getting used to, with its exaggerated, video game-style visuals, but it serves the material well.\n\n[The Guardian - Catherine Bray - 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/05/predator-killer-of-killers-review-animated-anthology-of-arnies-old-antagonists)\n\n&gt;The only problem with this stuff is that you can\u2019t help picturing how much more spectacular it would look in live action. The animation is all perfectly competent but it\u2019s lacking a little something \u2013 that spark of life and ingenuity that can make even flawed animation so fascinating. There\u2019s something quite slick about all this, almost to a fault. Was AI involved? We\u2019ll probably never know, but it\u2019s a problem that the suspicion has got inside the door.\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/predator-killer-of-killers-review-hulu/)\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg and Joshua Wassung\u2019s animated \u201cPredator\u201d sequel takes a while to prove it\u2019s more than just a demo reel of superficial badassery, but when it does, it\u2019s involving and intense. It\u2019s hard not to love at least a couple of these characters, who keep getting screwed over by their own propensity for violence. If you\u2019re so deadly that monsters travel millions of light years just to try to murder you, you might have flown a little too close to the sun. You never see a Predator hunting the attendees at a needlepointing convention, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.",
