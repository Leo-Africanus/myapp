        "title": "January 31-February 2 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' debuts with a pretty great $36 million domestically, marking DreamWorks' 26th film to hit #1. Meanwhile, 'Companion' opens in second place with a very solid $9.3 million domestically.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/4xbb33mt50he1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f895ae7b62d34771b5e8e35a9e00fcd75e3fb76\n\nAnd so, DreamWorks' winning streak continued. After a very weak January, ***Dog Man*** arrived with a bang, delivering the second highest January debut for an animated title. WB's ***Companion*** had to settle for second place, although it still finished with a solid debut.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $74.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 45% from last year, when ***Argylle*** embarrassed itself with its failure.\n\nDebuting in first place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** earned $36 million in 3,885 theaters. That's the second best January debut for an animated title, behind DreamWorks' own ***Kung Fu Panda 3*** ($41.8 million) and marks the studio's third consecutive #1 title.\n\nThe film's success is not entirely surprising. The books from which it is based on have proven to be very popular with kids and families, allowing it to build an audience ready for the film. Another advantage was that it was the first animated film (get out of the way ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, so families were starving for a new film. Reviews were also good enough (78% on RT) to convince those skeptical in giving it a chance.\n\nAccording to Universal, 52% of the audience was male and 58% of the audience was under 25. They gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, signaling some great word of mouth. The film won't face much animated competition (that ***Looney Tunes*** movie is distributed by a very small distributor), so this could hold well. For now, a $150 million domestic run is likely.\n\nDebuting in second place, Warner Bros.'s ***Companion*** earned $9.3 million this weekend. That's not that far off from ***Barbarian*** ($10.5 million), which is another title from producer Zach Cregger. Not bad at all considering this just $10 million.\n\nIt's tough to ask for much better numbers for a film like this. WB spent low on the marketing front; just $29 million went to the marketing campaign. They hoped that the trailers emphasizing an interesting concept would perform similarly to ***Barbarian***, hoping the audience would be surprised by the twists (well, most of them). While Sophie Thatcher and Jack Quaid are known names, they still aren't box office draws by themselves. WB gave a final push for the film by lifting the embargo earlier than usual, and it looks like it worked; it's currently at a great 94% on RT.\n\nAccording to WB, 51% of the audience was male, and 68% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is very solid for a thriller like this. The film should hold well in the coming weeks, although it's unlikely it can match the domestic total of ***Barbarian*** ($40.8 million).\n\nIn third place, Disney's ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** eased just 27% this weekend, grossing $6.3 million. The film has earned $229.6 million so far, and it should finish with $250 million lifetime.\n\nIn fourth place, Sony's ***One of Them Days*** also eased just 27%, adding $5.8 million. The film has earned $34.3 million, and it will finish with over $45 million domestically.\n\nLast week's champ ***Flight Risk*** descended 53%, adding $5.4 million this weekend. Considering the horrible reception, that's not really a bad drop. Through 10 days, the film has earned $20.7 million, and it looks like it will finish with close to $30 million by the end of its run.\n\n***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 39%, adding $3.2 million. That takes its domestic total to $230.5 million.\n\nIn seventh place, Disney's ***Moana 2*** dipped 32%, earning $2.8 this weekend. The film has amassed $453.9 million so far.\n\nSearchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** had the best hold in the Top 10. It eased a light 25%, grossing $2.3 million. With this, the film has earned $66.8 million, becoming one of the studio's highest grossing films.\n\nA24's ***The Brutalist*** added 494 theaters this weekend. With this, it eased 30%, adding $1.8 million. The film has earned $12.1 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera***, which dropped 47% and adding $1.5 million this weekend. With this, the film has amassed $34.4 million.\n\nNeon's ***Presence*** collapsed 61% on its second weekend, earning just $1.3 million. The film has earned $5.8 million so far, and it's not gonna make it to $8 million domestically.\n\nThe Chinese film ***Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force*** debuted in 200 theaters, but it earned a pretty good $1.2 million.\n\nUniversal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** lost 1,313 theaters on its third weekend, further adding salt to the wound. The film fell 65%, adding $1.1 million this weekend. Through 3 weeks, the film has earned just $19.9 million, and it should finish with around $22 million domestically.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mufasa*** once again led the overseas box office, earning $11.7 million, taking its worldwide total to $653 million. The best markets are France ($39.5M), the UK ($36.6M), Germany ($29.3M), Mexico ($29.1M) and Italy ($23.4M).\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** added $8.7 million this weekend, for an early $93.2 million overseas run. \n\n***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $7 million, for a $462.5 million worldwide run. With this, it has officially passed ***Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu*** for the second highest grossing video game movie. The best markets are the UK ($30.1M), Mexico ($21.7M), France ($19M), Australia ($18.2M) and Brazil ($12.9M).\n\n***Companion*** debuted in 60 countries, although it earned a soft $5.3 million, for a $14.6 million worldwide debut. It had weak debuts in the UK ($900K), France ($700K) and Mexico ($500K), indicating this is gonna be a domestic heavy film.\n\nWhile ***Dog Man*** was strong in North America, the same cannot be said for its overseas prospects. It debuted in 29 countries, but it earned just $4.2 million, which translates to a $40.4 million worldwide debut. It had a modest start in Spain ($1.1M), while it was very weak in Mexico ($700K) and Italy ($600K). Looks like it will be the rare DreamWorks film to skew higher on the domestic side.\n\nAfter two months in theaters, ***Gladiator II*** added $450,000 this weekend in the remaining overseas markets. And with this, it has now eclipsed $461.3 million worldwide, finally passing the original ***Gladiator*** ($460.5 million). If only that budget didn't get out of control.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*The Wild Robot* | Sep/27 | Universal | $35,790,150 | $143,901,945 | $326,369,928 | $78M\n\n- DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** has closed with a damn great $326 million worldwide. The film has held very well, achieving the 4x multiplier. It's a big win for DreamWorks, on top of achieving some of its best reviews in their history. They recently announced a sequel is in development, we'll keep an eye on that one.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThe Super Bowl weekend is known to be one of the slowest weekends ever. People prepare to meet up and watch the game (with last year's game being watched by a colossal 123 million viewers, the most watched event in US history), so studios avoid releasing anything big here.\n\nUniversal is releasing the action comedy ***Love Hurts***, which stars Ke Huy Quan as a realtor whose past as a violent hitman comes back to haunt him. The marketing emphasizes the action element, while also highlighting that it comes from the producers of ***Nobody*** and ***Violent Night***, both of which were very successful. While it won't take the top spot from ***Dog Man***, perhaps ***Love Hurts*** could surprise.\n\nSony is also releasing the slasher comedy ***Heart Eyes***, which follows co-workers working late on Valentine's Day who are mistaken for a couple by the infamous Heart Eyes Killer. The horror comedy combo is hit-and-miss at the box office, so Sony wanted to give the film a chance by lifting the review embargo one week early, and the reviews are quite good so far.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

In every kind of movie whether it\u2019s an action movie, a rom-com, a mystery. Everything. \n\nI need a movie that will genuinely stump him. Something so out of left- field he didn\u2019t even see it coming. \nNothing super scary though, we\u2019re not horror film people. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to give a list of movies we have watched bc there are so many. But to give an instance of how wide across genres it goes: we watched \u201ccrazy, stupid love\u201d the other night and he pretty much guessed some of the ending. We watched the first \u201cKnives Out\u201d last night. He guessed it too. Granted these may not be too hard to follow and predict, but he does it it nearly every movie.\n\nThanks in advance! ",

It got to the point where I almost didn't want to finish the movie.\n\nFirst off as someone who likes Owen Wilson, his character in this movie is completely unlikeable, I'm not sure if that was meant to be the point or what. He moves in then breaks all rules set for him, and when he actually does something good, it seems like it was only thrown into the movie in order for people to not completely hate Dupree.\n\nThe plot makes no sense and it tries to force the fact that the main character, Carl, is the bad guy so hard it confused me how anyone in the movie wasn't on his side? His best friend moves in then immediately sleeps naked on the couch, spends their money with no way to pay them back, burns down half their house while having sex, and then openly masturbated onto Carl's socks. And I'm supposed to believe Carl's the bad guy because he didn't write some thank you letters? His wife forces him to kick out Dupree then a day later forces him to take Dupree back in. When Carl tries to explain why he's always home so late she doesn't believe him and takes her father's side. And then gets drunk with Dupree and takes his side when he starts yelling at Carl about being late. \n\nNow I don't know if I'm the crazy one here but if my best friend got drunk late at night with my wife and then started eating breakfast with her every morning, I would start to think somethings going on aswell. Along with Dupree making creepy noises while watching Carl's wife get sugar for some reason? \n\nBut nope, according to everyone in the movie Carl is the one who should change. After Dupree attempts to break into the house after being kicked out Carl's wife invites Dupree in for dinner. And after some antics from Carl's wife's father, Carl lunges at Dupree and then leaves the house. Which then puts Carl's wife into a position where she is ready to LEAVE Carl and move on. Stating that she knows Carl loves him but \"it's not enough.\" Let me restate the only things Carl has done the ENTIRE movie that could be considered bad are 1. Not writing thank you cards. And 2. Lunging at Dupree.  But he's supposed to keep a cool head and apologize to his wife after being constantly antagonized by her father and dealing with Duprees shenanigans while she takes Duprees side on every confrontation and won't listen to Carl about her father. \n\nThis is throughout the whole movie with different little things here and there that make this pile of trash almost unwatchable to me. I don't want to be forced to think someone's a bad guy especially when you write them to literally NOT be a bad guy. That's all.\n\n\n(The movie is trash don't watch it)",

Awesome story with awesome and entertaining characters.\n\nI loved the chance to see Immortan Joe and the Citadel again, and it gave us another fantastic scene of how much authority he holds over his minions. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even bother to respond to Dementus\u2019s comments, he has the people eater do it for him.\n\nThen that leads to a fantastic scene of a random war boy being chosen to represent how all of them would willingly blow themselves up in the Immortan Joe\u2019s name, or as the people eater words it\n\n\u201cAmong us, are 972 devout warriors. Any one of them, if chosen, would\u2019ve done the same. Each would die historic for the Immortan Joe. That\u2019s why you\u2019re fools, you\u2019re all fools for coming here!\u201d",

        "title": "\"Starman\" (1984) was left forgotten by some but it's a moving, thought-provoking sci-fi melodrama that wrings your heart. Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen were never better.",
        "content": "Starman is everything I'd want in a sci-fi romantic movie. This is the movie that made me understand what love is, the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen is incredible, you genuinely believe their bond, but at the same time, it's such a sad movie. \n\nWhat might seem a movie about an Alien. Starman/Scott (Jeff Bridges), taking human form and holding his female companion, Jenny (Allen)  hostage for most of the film, ends up being a picture about an alien life form learning how it is to be a human while at the same time, a broken woman starts to accept the loss of her husband/partner, the alien having taken his appearance which adds greater gravitas. Jenny barely having survived the death of Scott, now faces another loss, Starman/Scott whom she learns to love and starts to yearn to leave Earth with him. All the time, they're being chased after by the Government. \n\nCrucial for the movie, it's Jack Nitzsche's epic, bittersweet and operatic score. Every time that score came up, I got goosebumps. It's so good. \n\nI don't think Starman gets as much attention as it deserves. It's such a classic but not many people know about it. Even with Jeff Bridges getting a nom (Karen Allen deserved a nom too).",

        "content": "The last time I saw Kelly's Heroes was about twenty years ago. I recently rewatched it and re-discovered what a fantastic movie it is.\n\nThe all star cast is perfect. Clint Eastwood is amazing as Kelly, Telly Savalas as Big Joe, Don Rickles of course, and Donald Sutherland as Oddball steals every scene he's in. I LOVE Oddball. And Carroll O'Conner as the general \"GET ME MY UNIFORM!\" \n\nThere are so many goofy funny moments that are all taken seriously, Big Joe admonishing his men and telling them to buld a bar in the farmhouse, \"But we don't have no booze. We'll get some booze!\" the Captain driving off with a yacht after warning them about looting, Oddball's \"boys\" all lounging around while Kelly looks like he's trying not to laugh, \"Get out of here, the game's on!\" \n\nAnd the battles are really well done and realistic, and you could really relate to Kelly and his men as they tried to just move through the battle without getting involved. And the end with the German tank commander who decides to blow up the bank so he could profit too. The best part is the end with the celebrating and cheering French crowds as Kelly and his men grab all the gold bars, and the men go their ways, and the general arrives right at the end.\n\nSuch a great movie.",

        "title": "Jojo Rabbit, a comedy about a 10 year old Nazi.",
        "content": "Jojo Rabbit\n\nA comedy about a ten year old boy who loves being a Nazi. That shouldn\u2019t work. When I first saw Jojo Rabbit, I didn\u2019t know much about it. All I saw was a quick summary along the lines of, \u201cA boy in Nazi Germany towards the end of WWII discovers that his mother has been helping a young Jewish girl hide out in their attic.\u201d I thought I was about to watch a serious drama, but then it kicks off with a little boy and his imaginary friend, Hitler, and their banter. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d I told myself.\n\n\n\nThis movie is very funny. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson at the youth camp are hilarious. Not only is the writing witty, the physical comedy hits the right notes of goofy. My favorite side character is Yorki. He gets to have the best lines:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m going home to my mom. I need a snuggle.\u201d\n* \u201cGuess I\u2019m just a kid trapped in a fat kid\u2019s body.\u201d\n* \u201cSomehow I just keep staying alive.\u201d\n* \"The Japanese are our only allies left, and between you and me, they don't really look that Aryan.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the movie does with tone throughout the runtime is what I believe makes it a great film. The first time we see Jojo looking upon people hanging in the square, and is told that what they did is what they could, this hilarious comedy lets us know that the reality of the situation is extremely bleak. We also find out that Jojo\u2019s father is in the war, and that his mother is having the hardest time raising a young boy who has been brainwashed by the Nazis\u2019 propaganda. When Johansson pretends that she is her husband, it really makes me feel bad that she is alone in trying to raise a boy amidst the war, a war that she hates and knows how her country is in the wrong.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cshoes scene\u201d, as I like to call it, may be the largest gut punch any comedy has ever put to screen. We just had seen the most tense scene, where we think that Elsa has been found out by the Gestapo, but then gets away. There is a butterfly and nice music, and it feels like maybe everything is going to be alright. But then we see the shoes. Again, how a comedy can turn the mood so fast is where this movie earns its greatness.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma Jojo finds himself in, where he wants to be a good Nazi and turn in the hiding Jewish girl, but he knows if he does so, he, and especially his mother, would be in trouble, is quite unique. If Jojo wasn\u2019t ten years old, I don\u2019t think this plot would work. How can we have any feelings for someone who loves Hitler? It makes me feel bad for any youth who are raised to hate others.\n\n\n\nSo how did Taika make a movie about Nazis funny? He made sure to let the audience know that Nazis are stupid. It has a repeating gag of Hitler offering him a cigarette. If you watch this movie and get nothing out of it, at least you will know, Nazis are stupid.\n\n",
