        "content": "#[Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) if you want to just nab one and skip the wall of text.\n\n---\n\nAlright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen during the ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1itlqyx/oscar_bingo_xii_submission_thread/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- If you win just be sure to yell \"BINGO\" really loud wherever you are. And if you wanna post your gamecard to the game thread that would be fine too.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

These moments with Neal are probably the most human interaction he's had in nearly a decade and this scene where he finally fights back his only response is of what he had in his prior life before his wife's death. When you get that twist at the end of the movie it makes the entire movie that much more heartbreaking. Del's entire monologue is esentially him fighting back by just reininsicng on the life he once had. Amazing performance from Candy who probably would've been one of the better character actors if he stayed alive.   \n  \n",

I thought the story was so much more powerful because of its surrealist qualities. I expected scenery chewing villains and overwrought scenes of torture. What I got was more akin to a haunted dream that left me pondering the passage of time. This is a bold film from a real artist. I\u2019m not even raving about the movie. On letterboxed I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and It\u2019s far from my favorite of the year. But I\u2019m truly struck by the artistry and how much the movie surprised me. Bravo! ",

Basically, an early scene has Marky Mark's young daughter practicing her speech for class on what her Dad does, with a Coke can as a demonstration. \n\nThat got me wondering, in an era where so many movies seem to just plunk two characters down and have them talk about things that they are both already aware of solely for the audience's benefit (\"Wow, I can't believe it's been 5 years since you had that car accident where you lost your young son named Michael, after which your wife left you because she couldn't process her grief, and you moved back in with your estranged father....\"), do you have any other examples where a movie found an elegant or effective way to deliver some complicated backstory or foundational knowledge required to understand the specifics of the story?",

        "title": "\"Why you flanking me?\" What films and tv shows hit with the intensity of this scene from Wind River?",
        "content": "I'm an avid movie/tv junky and have been since my teen years in the 80's'.\n\nThere are a number of films that i rewatch, usually about once a year, and a few weeks ago I watched\u00a0**Wind River**\u00a0(2017) and it still impresses me as such a great film. I was thinking about other films and tv shows that have intense scenes like the flanking scene, and came up with a few. I'm posting to see what ya'll can add to my small list so far.\n\n**13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi**\u00a0(2016)  \n\\- I'm watching this right now and the movie manages to maintain such intensity throughout, i just love it.\n\n**Sicario**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The border crossing scene is so great.\n\n**Heat**\u00a0(1995)  \n\\- I haven't rewatched in a while, but i do remember the big shoot-out scene as being pretty intense. It's time for a rewatch i think.\n\n**Bone Tomahawk**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- I don't want to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it, but my recommendation if you have not is to go in blind and not read anything about it. It's just a great film.\n\n**The Revenant**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The bear attack is pretty riveting. The entire movie is pretty intense and a bit depressing, but i do like that there is a bit of justice in the end.\n\n**Saving Private Ryan**\u00a0(1998)  \n\\- The Knife kill scene is etched in my memory for all time.\n\nI will also mention\u00a0**Black Hawk Down**\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0**Band of Brothers**\u00a0(2001) which both have many such scenes, too many to list here. Also time for a rewatch i thinks.",

This and other vastly important details are left out of the theatrical edition to make the movie short enough for viewers.",
        "content": "The original movie was cut greatly to appease Fox for standard viewers. The movie may as well be two different films. Ridley Scott\u2019s Director\u2019s cut has clarity, pace, and depth. The theatrical edition is a hack and slash film cut to have a start and an end. I recommend the first if you want to be on the edge of your seat for 3 hours! \n\nOther missing details: \n\n\n&gt;!Balian and his wife lost a baby in the beginning, she killed herself because of it, Balian was placed in custody for madness in his grief. He burned the baby\u2019s unfinished shirt she had been sewing before killing his brother in a rage. This shows why he felt he had nothing left and went on the crusade. Also, Balian had other family in the crusades, including his uncles! His father\u2019s backstory is further discussed and there is an entire plot about Sybilla and her son being king Baldwin that is left out!&lt;",

It surely looked like he couldn\u2019t have been stopped. It\u2019s haunted me and bothered me since I first saw it months ago, but I can\u2019t find anything online about it.
