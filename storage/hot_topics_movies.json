        "content": "Happy (early) Thanksgiving, Reddit! I'm Barry Hertz, a Toronto-based film critic and author of WELCOME TO THE FAMILY: THE EXPLOSIVE STORY BEHIND FAST &amp; FURIOUS: THE BLOCKBUSTERS THAT SUPERCHARGED THE WORLD, which just came out this week. The book is the first-ever deeply reported look inside the surprising history and contentious future of Hollywood's most unlikely success story -- a series that anticipated the shifting currents of pop culture while changing the business of global entertainment at the same time. I spent the past two years talking with as many cast and crew involved in the Fast-verse as possible, all in the hope of shining a light on what I feel is one of the most underrated series of movies to ever come out of Hollywood. \n\nMy bio: \n\nI'm the award-winning film editor and chief film critic for The Globe and Mail, Canada's leading national newspaper, based in Toronto. Over the past two decades, I've reviewed thousands of movies, interviewed hundreds of actors and filmmakers, and covered every angle of the industry from festivals, sets, and markets around the world. Welcome to the Family: The Explosive Story Behind Fast &amp; Furious, the Blockbusters that Supercharged the World, is my first book. \n\nBuy the book:\n\n[https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/barry-hertz/welcome-to-the-family/9781538771037/?lens=grand-central-publishing](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/barry-hertz/welcome-to-the-family/9781538771037/?lens=grand-central-publishing) \n\nAsk my anything! I'll be back tomorrow Thursday 11/27 at 3 pm ET to answer any questions. ",

It\u2019s not as good as it those, but it satisfies a desire I\u2019m looking for. \n\nI love the characters and find their relationships very real. I guess it helps that it takes place in hotels, airports, and bars: all interstitial places, to tell a story about a man living an interstitial existence. \n\nClooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick are so perfectly cast. I just enjoy watching them interact.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought about this movie for quite awhile but this rewatch was so enjoyable. I really like Juno and Young Adult, too, but that\u2019s it for this director. Nice little trilogy.\n\n",

        "title": "Rewatching Memento now vs early 2000s hits completely different in the context of our hyperpolarized culture",
        "content": "I randomly started thinking about Memento recently, hadn't seen it since it came out in the early 2000s.  Back then I was so focused on the backwards narrative structure /gimmick, but in 2025 after everything society has gone through, especially culturally in the US, in the past 10-15 years I realized Memento is like a premonition of our entire polarizing cultural climate today.\n\nSome examples:\n\nLeonard can\u2019t form new memories, so he literally builds his reality out of:\n\n* Polaroids\n* Sharpie notes\n* Tattoos of \u201cfacts\u201d he chooses to trust after each \"reset\" and not question later\n\nThis feels similar to how people build their political identities now. We don\u2019t sit with nuance anymore or deep, probing critical thinking. We grab a screenshot, a headline, a tweet, a TikTok clip, and treat it like it\u2019s the whole truth. Just little ideological Polaroids we carry around like proof. You hear people reference these \"tattoos\" in debate. (e.g. have you seen the clip of Don Lemon on CNN trying to explain how women reach their prime in their 20s, 30s, and sometimes 40s citing Google as his evidence?)\n\nLeonard, the movie's protagonist, says:\n\n\u201cWe all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.\u201d\n\nModern culture takes that literally. Instead of mirrors, we have algorithms and influencers constantly reflecting back the version of ourselves we already want to believe in. And if something contradicts that? We just forget it. On purpose.\n\nWhat's really prescient is realizing Leonard is basically choosing his own reality. He keeps the \u201cfacts\u201d that keep him emotionally stable and discards anything that threatens the story he needs to survive. That\u2019s the real twist: he doesn\u2019t actually want the truth because he wants certainty.\n\nThis feels like american politics now.\n\nStructurally, the movie even mirrors how discourse works. You don\u2019t move from facts --&gt; conclusion. You start with the conclusion (my side = good) and work backwards to grab whatever fragments support it. Same inverted logic as the film itself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the line that feels like it was written in 2025:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the truth. You make up your own truth.\u201d\n\nLeonard and an entire culture built on curated memory, selective evidence, and outsourced thinking.\n\nBy the end of the movie, Leonard isn\u2019t free - he\u2019s the easiest person in the world to manipulate. And the scariest part is that he thinks he\u2019s thinking for himself the entire time.\n\nFeels like Nolan made a movie about humans and social media before social media even gained momentum. This could have a current film about current times.",

        "title": "Why do streaming services, like Netflix, look so terrible on browser?",
        "content": "Yeah so i've recently begun collecting Blu-rays again, because i've gotten back into movies, and of course i've always known that streaming doesn't look or sound nearly as good as it does on Blu-ray (UHD aswell), i know it has something to do with the amount of bitrate the service uses to stream it to you, so even though it says \"4K\" it's never actually 4k because of the low bitrate.\n\nSo i've been trying to circumvent this issue, then realized it looks so much better when using an app, like on your phone, ipad, smart-tv, but on browser? Yeah pretty much all the streaming services look so ugly and closer to 480p than 4k, even though im paying for the premium package thats supposed to give me that, so why only on browser? genuinely what.\n\nAnd the reason im posting this now, is because I just watched a movie on HBO Max, it looked as grimey as it always does, then afterwards went to watch youtube, changed the video I was watching to 4k, then it clicked... WHY CAN I WATCH IT ON YOUTUBE PERFECTLY FINE, BUT THE PAID SERVICE IT LOOKS SO BAD??!?!?!\n\nOf course its still not to the level of having a physical disc, its still being streamed right, but the bitrate isnt as low as to make my eyes squint, as it sometimes is on Hbo max or disney plus, why does youtube look so good in comparison, when all this time I had just accepted it as fact that browsers just inherintly look bad when streaming, when youtube has showed that that's not the case at all.\n\n\n\nEDIT: After reading some of your answers, these companies genuinely make pirating look so much easier, because seriously, why am i even paying to watch movies in 720p in 2025...",
