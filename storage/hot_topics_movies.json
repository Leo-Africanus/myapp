Each film has to also not be so bad that it makes no money and justifies a sequel. I think Police Academy pulled this off, but most series will have a bounce back move (e.g., Star Trek 4)",

For example, William Friedkin's \"Sorcerer\" had the miserable luck of being released in the wake of the unexpected phenomenon that was \"Star Wars\", but it wasn't helped either by a title that many found quite misleading. People who expected a fantasy film with that title were surprised to find it was actually a new adaptation of \"The Wages of Fear\" and that \"Sorcerer\" actually referred to the name of a truck. (Friedkin later said he got the title from the Miles Davis album and that the \"sorcerer\" in question was the hand of fate.) So while \"Sorcerer\" had a bad hand dealt to it already, the title didn't help matters any.",

It helps that the role was written specifically with him in mind, but still. It is absolutely his most iconic role and for good reason. He is not playing a part in that film. He IS that character. He might just be playing himself, but he is so natural. As a matter of fact, another example of perfect casting lies within that movie as well, with John Goodman as Walter. I can\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that role. He is by far the funniest part of the entire movie. \n\nOther examples without making this post an essay:\n\nJ.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Terrence Fletcher\n\nMatthew Lillard as Shaggy\n\nAl Pacino as Michael Corleone\n\nDaniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview",

When he learns that a long-serving U.S. congressman with a similar name \u2014 **Jeff Johnson** \u2014 has died in office, he sees an opportunity. Thomas runs for the now-vacant seat, using name recognition to fool voters into thinking he's the same Jeff Johnson.\n\nTo everyone's surprise (including his own), **he wins** and becomes a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAt first, Thomas sees Washington as the ultimate con \u2014 a place where money flows freely and influence can be bought and sold. He fits right in, manipulating political loopholes and taking advantage of the system to make a quick buck. But over time, he begins to see the real impact of corrupt politics on ordinary people, particularly when he encounters issues involving environmental hazards and lobbying.\n\nEventually, he grows a conscience and decides to take a stand against the very corruption he once embraced.",

        "content": "Scene: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjsfs49SRbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjsfs49SRbc)\n\n\n\n49 minutes, 34 seconds after start of film:\n\n\n\n\\[Fletch is in an airplane hanger belonging to Boyd Aviation, in the Los Angeles area. He is posing as a technician who has come to assist one some repair work. He is looking inside the small airplane (a Cessna) that Alan Stanwyk uses as his personal aircraft. Two Boyd Aviation airplane technicians are present: \"Bud\" (played by Burton Gilliam) and \"Willy\" (Beau Starr).\\]\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Looks well-used.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy (Beau Starr): Goes back and forth to Utah every weekend.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Oh is that right? What, is he a Mormon?\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud (Burton Gilliam): Ha ha! \\[Laughs loudly.\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: \\[Laughs.\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: I don't think he's doing a whole lot of singing with the Tabernacle Choir.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: These executives, they live high. You know what I mean?\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): I sure do.\n\n\n\n\\[Long pause. Willy knows that Fletch is lying about who he is.\\]\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Ah, that's a terrific wing. I love this shape.\n\n\n\n\\[Willy decides to test Fletch's knowledge of airplane mechanics, to confirm his suspicion that Fletch is not really who he says he is.\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: Hey, do us a favor, pal.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Name's Liddy. Gordon Liddy.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: Gord, take a look at the seventh Fetzer valve, will you. I think it's been sticking.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): \\[Nods.\\] Probably the humidity.\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: \\[Laughs.\\] That's funny. No, what I think it is myself is the, uh, by-pass line.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): It could be the by-pass line. Yeah. Maybe I should take a look at it.\n\n\n\n\\[Nobody moves to assist Fletch. Fletch walks resolutely to the front of the airplane and lifts up an unlocked panel on the nose of the plane. It opens to reveal a storage area for luggage, clearly not where any sort of by-pass line might be found. Willy watches him closey.\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: Uh, Gordo? \\[Bud is still standing near the back of the airplane. He points to a spot near himself.\\] Back here.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Don't tell me my business, boy! Just checking the luggage. Somebody ought to clean these windows. There is a tremendous build up of gook all over them. \\[Rubs his hand on the outside of a cockpit window.\\] Look at that. \\[Walking to the back of the plane.\\] You use a lot of fuel to go to Utah?\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: That's what I always ask.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: Burns enough to go to South America and back.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): South America and back? Huh? Is that right?\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: Yeah. But I always kid him about it. I say, \"What are you doing up there? You doing some stunt flying or something?\" \\[Laughs.\\]\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): \\[Laughs.\\] What's he say?\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: Well, you know. He don't say nothing. He just gives me that look. You know, he's got that look. \\[Tries to contort his face into \"that look.\"\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: Yeah, he don't say nothing. He just gives him that look.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Well, sure, he's the boss. Here, let me take a crack at this Fetzer, here. \\[Climbs on a small ladder to look some exposed airplane parts on the top of the plane.\\]\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: Uh, Gord. \\[Points to a spot on the bottom of the plane.\\]\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Yeah, I know where it is. I'm just getting a bird's eye view, here... and, uh... Oh, ho ho ho.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: What do you think? It's the by-pass line, right?\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): I think it's the by-pass line, yeah.\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: Told ya.\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): I'm gonna need some pliers and, uh, a set of 30-weight ball bearings.\n\n\n\nTechnician Bud: What?\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Yeah, uh... Tell you what. I gotta go to my truck. If Fred gets here before I'm back, you can tell him to start without me.\n\n\n\nTechnician Willy: What the hell do you need ball bearings for?\n\n\n\nFletch (Chevy Chase): Ah, come on guys... It's so simple. Maybe you need a refresher course. Hey! It's all ball bearings nowadays... Now, you prepare that Fetzer valve with some, uh, 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads. And I'm gonna need about 10 quarts of antifreeze... preferably Prestone... No... No, make that Quaker State... And wash those windows. They got filth and muck on them.\n\n\n\n\\[End of scene.\\]",

        "content": "[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025) **85% (166 Reviews) -**  ***Certified Fresh***\n\n* **Critics Consensus**: Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this\u00a0Superman\u00a0flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.\n* **PopcornMeter: 96% (1000+ ratings)**\n\n[**Metacritic**:](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/superman-2025/) **70 (46 Reviews) -** ***Generally Favorable***\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety (80)](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/)\n\n&gt;The super-busy quality of \u201cSuperman\u201d works for it and, at times, against it. The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That\u2019s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cSuperman II,\u201d \u201cThe Batman,\u201d \u201cGuardians\u201d). I\u2019d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cThor,\u201d \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d \u201cCaptain America,\u201d and the hugely underrated \u201cIron Man 3\u201d). Yet watching \u201cSuperman,\u201d we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we\u2019re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that\u2019s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)\n\n&gt;What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times\u00a0*Superman*\u00a0suffers from overload, much like Gunns\u2019\u00a0*Guardians of the Galaxy*\u00a0trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the\u00a0*Babe: Pig in the City*\u00a0treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran\u2019s) more hopeful vision.\n\n[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)\n\n&gt;Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman\u2019s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you\u2019re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it\u2019s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it\u2019s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn\u2019t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+\n\n[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)\n\n&gt;Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.\n\n[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)\n\n&gt;The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.\n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)\n\n&gt;Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.\n\n[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we\u2019ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world\u2019s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it\u2019s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.\n\n[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)\n\n&gt;From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.\n\n[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard\u2026 which are the best flaws a film can have.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)\n\n&gt;Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film \u2014 if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first.\u00a0**Grade: B-**\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)\n\n&gt;It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast \u2013 he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent \u2013 but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.\n\n[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn\u2019s signature sense of fun shine through \u2014 but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn\u2019t work.\n\n[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He\u2019s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.\n\n[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Yes, \"Superman\" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.\n\n[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn\u2019t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.\n\n[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)\n\n&gt;As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we\u2019ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.\n\n[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film\u2019s approach isn\u2019t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.\n\n[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)\n\n&gt;This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood\u2019s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush\n\n[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)\n\n&gt;The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.\n\n\\---\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n&gt;Follows Superman as he reconciles his heritage with his human upbringing. He is the embodiment of truth, justice and a brighter tomorrow in a world that views kindness as old-fashioned.\n\n**STARRING**:\n\n* David Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman\n* Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane\n* Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor\n* Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mister Terrific\n* Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho\n* Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern\n* Isabela Merced as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl\n* Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen\n* Wendell Pierce as Perry White\n* Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard\n* Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant\n* Alan Tudyk as Superman Robot #4\n* Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher\n* Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as Angela Spica / The Engineer\n* Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan 'Pa' Kent\n* Neva Howell as Martha 'Ma' Kent\n\n**DIRECTED BY:** James Gunn\n\n**WRITTEN BY:** James Gunn\n\n**PRODUCED BY:** Peter Safran, James Gunn\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY:** Henry Braham\n\n**EDITED BY:** William Hoy, Craig Alpert\n\n**MUSIC BY:** John Murphy, David Fleming\n\n**RELEASE DATE:** July\u00a011,\u00a02025\n\n**RUNTIME:** 2h 9m\n\n**BUDGET:** $225 Million",
