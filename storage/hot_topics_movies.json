        "content": "Hi r/movies! I\u2019m Joe Begos! Filmmaker behind VFW, Bliss, &amp; Christmas Bloody Christmas. My new movie Jimmy and Stiggs is a blood-drenched, alien-infested, DIY sci-fi horror shot over 4 years in my apartment with a crew of maniacs &amp; hand-built effects. Coming to theaters on August 15. Ask Me Anything!\n\nAbout Jimmy and Stiggs: A shitstorm of bad news sends out of work filmmaker Jimmy Lang (Joe Begos) spiraling into an out of control bender, during which he claims to have been abducted by aliens. Fearing they\u2019ll come back, he contacts his old friend Stiggs (Matt Mercer) to help him gear up for war. When the sun sets, the duo are thrown into a hallucinatory explosion of aliens, drugs, booze, and all out carnage. Joe Begos is back! And this time, he\u2019s brought his A-game with a drug-fueled, wall-to-wall frenzy that pulls no punches from the moment it begins. Channeling the hectic, chaotic brilliance of Jackson, Raimi, and other masters, Begos infuses his own unique tone and craftsmanship into JIMMY AND STIGGS. This film also showcases Begos\u2019s acting chops, delivering a physical performance that\u2019s part Keaton and a whole lot of Campbell. A wild and wonderful ride that truly deserves to be seen in the cinema with like-minded lunatics.\n\nWebsite: [https://jimmyandstiggs.com/](https://jimmyandstiggs.com/)\n\nTrailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3aSWSyAm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3aSWSyAm8)\n\nOut in theaters August 15th,.\n\nAsk me anything!

The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze.

To get the drug cartels to start fighting so they can destabilize the human trafficking network. Sorry but how does that even make sense? Shouldn't they go after the terrorist organizations that planned these attacks?\n\nAnd why and how did Alejandro even track down the kid who shot him? He was blindfolded and gagged, he wouldn't even know who fired the gun. Their only engagement from his perspective, should be that the teenager pointed him out on the bus. Doesn't seem like its worth the effort\n\nOne part I didn't understand, when Isabel escaped the convoy during the firefight, another man covered in blood first found her and tried to force her into his car before Alejandro shot him, who was that dude?? Seemed like he appeared out of nowhere.\n\nEdit : I just remembered, close to the ending, Matt's superior Cynthia told him to shut down the operation and cut off loose ends, and also revealed that the terrorists were actually US citizens, not foreign nationals. Like wtf?? So this whole operation happened due to faulty intel??",

        "content": "Mine: Fight Club\n\nI was absolutely that guy that would ask a girlfriend to come over just to watch Fight Club for the first time. It encapsulated everything I loved: Punk, rage, anti-consumerism, violence, David Fincher, anarchy and a shared philosophy that we were nothing more than smart monkeys playing house to cope with existential dread. \n\nFast forward to my late teens: I finally decide to read the book and learn about chuck Palahniuk. Completely flips the script on my viewpoint: \u201cThis is a borderline erotic love story about two dysfunctional men cohabiting amidst terrible mental health issues AND was written by a gay man. How did I never know this? - Made me fall in love with it all over again, because the idea of such a hypermasculine movie beloved by dudes everywhere not catching the subliminal gay undertones and examination of their own poor mental health was absolutely incredible. \n\nFast forward to my late 20s: #Metoo has happened, mass shootings every other day in America, men\u2019s health is at an all time low and hypermasculinity is veering into toxic sexist bullshit. I watch Fight Club again and can\u2019t help but think it inadvertently fetishized some of what\u2019s happening in the world today, maybe even influencing it to a small extent considering the zeitgeist.\n\nMy opinion today: It\u2019s an artistic commentary on the decline of men\u2019s mental health over the last 3 decades. I can only vaguely identify with the characters now, which to me is a good thing. While I\u2019ll always consider it an incredible film (Arguably Finchers Best outside of 7even) and a personal favorite, my hope is that it\u2019ll become more of a PSA and less of mantra for young men over the course of time. \n",

Like, really hit me. I think I paused the movie and just sat there. It made me rethink how I was living my life.\n\nOr maybe the last five minutes of Her, where everything is just\u2026 still. And sad. And somehow comforting.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m curious. What\u2019s a movie moment that quietly changed something in you? One that doesn\u2019t leave, even years later?\n",

The idea of being trapped in a remote Alaskan town during 30 days of darkness, hunted by feral, intelligent vampires, creates nonstop tension. The atmosphere is cold, hopeless, and terrifying. From the eerie silence to the blood-soaked chaos, every scene builds dread. It\u2019s not your typical vampire movie there\u2019s no romance or charm here, just raw survival and horror. We need more horror movies like this bold, relentless, and unafraid to go all in on fear and originality.what y'all think !\n\n",

What a masterpiece of atmospheric, visual storytelling.\n\nBut what's really gotten under *my* skin is the soundtrack by Mica Levi. It's barely even \"music.\" It's the sound of an alien consciousness trying to understand our world. The screeching violins, the simple, repetitive three-note motif that signals the hunt... it creates a sense of dread and a strange, predatory sensuality that I've never heard before.\n\nIt reminds me of the way bands like Heilung use sound to create a ritual, or how Giger used art to show us something beautifully terrifying. It's a score that doesn't just support the movie; it *is* the movie.\n\nJust had to share. This one's going to stick with me for a long, long time.",

        "content": "I hadn't watched this movie since it first released and I remembered thinking it was good but not amazing. But I honestly think all the negative reviews I heard at the time and the fact that it was a box office flop influenced my thoughts. I watched it again last night and loved it! Almost all the complaints everyone has with the movie I don't care about. Apparently people were upset that they wasted the premise of \"what if the meteor never killed the dinosaurs\" but I thought making the dinosaurs human-like and the humans dog-like was a novel and fun idea in itself. Also people complained that the realistic world clashed with the cartoony character designs, but it never bothered me. I think the realistic world actually drives home all of the scenes where they want nature to feel brutal and unforgiving. Yet another criticism people have with this movie is that it had no plot apparently. I thought it had a very focused theme and story of overcoming your fears and the whole movie was in service of that. Overall this movie has reminded me that I should just watch movies I'm interested in and not always listen to some reviews from strangers online lol. Definitely worth a watch imo if you haven't seen it!",
