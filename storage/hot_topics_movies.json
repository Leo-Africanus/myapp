There were funny enough gags to get a chuckle out of me like the mawwage part towards the end. I just wanted to get a short rant off about how much I love this movie",

        "content": "My only experience with Star Trek was the first JJ movie, so I have some basic familiarity with the setting. Suddenly I got the urge to go back and experience the classic series. I'm not still sure about commiting to watching any of the shows so I decided to check out the movies.\n\n\nI saw Star Trek The Motion Picture. Man, that was slow as hell. The story is fine, but the plot progresses at the speed of snails. So many unnecessary exterior shots and scenary. But despite that, I got a taste for what classic Trek was like and I dug it.\n\n\nRn I finished Wrath of Khan. Ah that hit the spot man. It was so good. Ugh I love old timey acting so much. So much class and the performances are so elegant.\n\n\nWhat a kick ass story, high stakes and emotional. They totally got me. I &gt;!wasn't expecting at all to see Spock die, bravo. And the eulogy scene is brilliant!&lt;\n\n\nShatner's great as Kirk. I love how cunning and willful his Kirk is, compared to the wildcard rebel that's Chris Pine's Kirk. I'm really curious now what young Kirk must be like.\n\n\n\nBest performance is hands down Ricardo Montalban. Holy shit that guy can act and deliver a mean monolouge. Every line he speaks is iconic. 10/10 delivery. Ironicly this isn't the first time I've seen Montalban. I knew him as the villain from Naked Gun 1 lmao. He was performing his heart out in that too. What a great actor.\n\n\n\nOh man, I dug the vibes of the this movie so much that I'm gonna watch Star Trek 3 and 4 too. I don't care if they're not as good, as long as I get more from the cast I'm gonna enjoy it.\n\n\n\nAlso, R.I.P. &gt;!Captain Terrell!&lt;, you're only crime was wearing a red coat.",

I even found Principal Mullins (Joan Cusack) to be over the top in all ways. And despite this, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) absolutely steals the show and magically brings along a bunch of kids to fit in perfectly.\n\nWhile watching it, I couldn\u2019t help but think ANY other actor on earth as Dewey Finn and this movie is very quickly just horrible. Who else can do what he does? Or has their own version that fits here?\n\nWhat are some other movies that would seemingly be awful with a different actor/actress, but are actually really great because a special talent pulled it off?",

There are at least two scenes that no matter how many times I have seen the film cause tears to fall down my face.\n\nThe movie itself is unique in that there are no true antagonists, except for the past and the pride and bitterness that keeps us from forgiveness. There are two heroes you are equally invested in. \n\nIf you have held out on seeing it because you aren\u2019t into MMA, don\u2019t short change yourself, I am not into MMA either.

This movie has everything and it\u2019s incredibly interesting and terrifying!!! And kinda deep haha! I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s starting to be considered a cult-classic, but I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s didn\u2019t win some kind of award. It has a slightly independent-feel. They\u2019re is a lot going on here and it\u2019s well done. Great acting. Not cliche. Suspenseful. Creative. Scary. I am rarely impressed by anything Sci-fi ish but this movie is amazing. It\u2019s one of very few that keep me from multi tasking or playing on my phone at the same time. Iykyk. And I will never recover from the bear\u2026\n\nThis movie is not for kids imo. it\u2019s a little intense.",

        "content": "This list includes 12 movies that were shot a while back but so far, they remain shelved and haven't had any release dates yet. This list doesn't include any direct-to-streaming releases, only ones meant for theatrical releases.\n\nAnniversary (Lionsgate): This movie was shot in the summer of 2023 during the SAG-AFTRA strike as an Interim Agreement was signed to finish filming but so far despite the film being rated by the MPA in October 2024, there's no U.S. release date for the film so far.\n\nDistant (Universal): Despite the film being released in select international territories via streaming, there's still no sign of a U.S. release coming anytime soon. As per the U.S. Copyright Records, it does seem like that the distribution rights reverted to Amblin back in April 2024. This movie was shot in late 2020 during COVID and the directors did Lyle, Lyle Crocodile during post-production for this film.\n\nFaces of Death (Legendary): This movie was shot in spring 2023, had test screenings in late 2023/early 2024 and was rated by the MPA in May 2024 but apparently, it's stuck in post-production limbo. The film was originally supposed to go out through Sony Pictures as part of a distribution deal they had with Legendary but that deal was cut short late last year.\n\nHarvest Moon (Miramax): This Paul Bettany movie was shot in fall 2021 but since filming wrapped, there's been no news about it and it's possibly that it got shelved during the post-production phase.\n\nHorizon - An American Saga - Chapter 2 (Warner Bros.): This movie was supposed to be released on August 16, 2024 but after Chapter 1 underperformed, WB then took off the movie from the release schedule in July 2024. Despite screenings at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2024 and at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in February, this movie still hasn't gotten a new release date yet and after those legal issues, I don't think that we are seeing it anytime soon.\n\nIn the Blink of an Eye (Searchlight): This movie was shot from March 2023 to May 2023 and was supposed to come out last year but never did. It got rated by the MPA in March 2025 so it should come out later this year, probably on Hulu.\n\nIn the Grey (Lionsgate): This movie was shot from August 2023 to October 2023 with a SAG-AFTRA Interim Agreement in place. Originally set to be released on January 17, 2025. In November 2024, Lionsgate removed the film from their release schedule mainly because the film wasn't completed on-time such as reshoots and pick-up shots being delayed for months as they still haven't happened. Director Guy Ritchie has since done two movies: Fountain of Youth for Apple TV+ which just came out on Friday and Wife &amp; Dog which is currently in post-production.\n\nThe Haunting in Wicker Park (Sony): This movie was shot in spring 2022 and was supposed to come out on January 6, 2023 but M3GAN caused the film to move off of its release date and despite being rated by the MPA in April 2023, there's also no sign of a release date anytime soon.\n\nThe Strangers - Chapter 3 (Lionsgate): This movie was shot simultaneously as all three of them were shot from September 2022 to November of 2022. Originally set to be released in early 2025, no release plans have been announced so far but I assume that it's definitely coming out next year as Chapter 2 is coming out in September after being delayed by a WHOLE year.\n\nVicious (Paramount): This movie just wrapped filming about a year ago but it was originally supposed to debut on August 8, 2025 before being moved up by a whopping six months to February 28, 2025. Two months before its supposed release date, the film was removed on Paramount's release schedule and so far, hasn't been redated on the calendar. A Paramount+ dump is definitely incoming but they need movies for their 2026 slate anyways.\n\nWar of the Worlds (Universal): was shot in fall 2020 and was rated by the MPA in April 2024. At one point, it was rumored to go to Peacock but nothing since then.\n\nWizards! (A24): This movie was shot in the summer of 2022. It was originally scheduled to premiere in 2024 and despite the film being rated by the MPA in October 2023, the film was undergoing a re-edit in late 2023/early 2024 but since then. Nothing. And the director behind it (David Mich\u00f4d) has since shot an another movie with Sydney Sweeney late last year.",

I would like a mix of movies to choose from depending on everyone's moods. \n\nThanks all.\n\nEdit: please nothing too \"artsy fartsy\" like Holy Mountain. \nAlso the more obscure and niche the better...

I didn't even know there was a second one until I read some people saying that it was bad, that it disrespected the characters from the first movie, and some going as far as to say that you should only watch the first movie and pretend the sequel doesn't exist.\n\nYesterday I finally got around to watching it, and... just like the first one it was a lot of fun... not as good, but I didn't even think it was mediocre let alone anywhere near as bad as people made it out to be.\n\nThere are a lot of other movies I can think of that fit this criteria (such as The Lost World: Jurassic Park), but most of them I already saw before hearing the bad word of mouth, so I was curious what your experiences are of hearing a movie is bad/mediocre only to end up enjoying it are.",

It felt authentic (as someone who has zero experience with firearms) and you could really feel each shot.\n\nIt reminded me a little of a game I played years ago called Black that had similar sound effects/authentic feeling gun play.",
