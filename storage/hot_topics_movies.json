But rewatching as an adult, I realized Christof was actually telling the truth from his perspective. The real world Truman was escaping to in 1998 was already filled with reality TV, manufactured personas, and the early stages of our current parasocial nightmare.\n\nTruman wasn't escaping artifice for reality - he was just trading one stage for a bigger, more complex one where he'd have the illusion of control.\n\nThis adds such a haunting layer to that final bow and \"In case I don't see ya - good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\" It's not just a goodbye to his fictional world, but almost a greeting to ours.\n",

It exceeded my expectations massively, the mystery elements matched with the dream-like plot makes it one of the most original movies I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I feel like in the next decade or two it will be held in a much higher regard. \n\nWhat other poorly received movies were/are ahead of their time? ",

        "title": "Movies you loved as a kid &amp; adult only to discover the movie had a negative reputation with critics &amp; audiences. For me it\u2019s got to be \u201cGhostbusters 2\u201d",
        "content": "I grew up loving Ghostbusters. The movies, the cartoons, and the toys.\n\nBut as I got older I started realizing more and more that \u201cGhostbusters 2\u201d had a less than stellar reputation. That shocked me. I mean is it as good as the first? No. But it\u2019s still a damn good time. It\u2019s got a great plot device(negative charged slime), a scary bad guy(VIGO!), some fun set pieces(court room bust) but most all?\nYou get to spend time with these actors playing these characters. They have this wonderful chemistry together. \n\nThey have such great chemistry. I remember coming across the IMDb score for the 2nd Ghostbusters. Back then it was much lower than it is now. In the 5/10 range. What gives?\n\nI watched Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, fans of the first film, rip the sequel to shreds. \n\nI would read how critics and audiences thought it\u2019s a retread of the first film, it wasn\u2019t funny, didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhy are people still not believing in ghosts after the first film\u201d. That last one never made sense to me. In the entire film only like 3 people say they don\u2019t believe. One or which is an insane judge. Another a kid I mean\u2026it\u2019s 2025 and people still think we didn\u2019t go to the moon or that the earth is flat. So I don\u2019t think everyone would be accepting to the idea of ghosts and marshmallow men. \n\n\nSo what are some other examples of films you loved then found out they weren\u2019t as liked or respected as you imagined?",

        "content": "Judith Barsi, the child actress who voiced Anne-Marie, was killed by her dad right after she did the voice-work for the movie. \n\nThe last scene of Charlie (Burt Reynolds) saying goodbye to Anne-Marie, Reynolds' teary voice can be heard because it was real, the actor kept breaking down whenever he voiced his lines as he had to hear the voice of a dead child telling him how much she loved him. \n\nJudith Barsi struggled to sing the song, [Soon You'll Come Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSMJTSKXtLs), because of the abuse at home and how she related to the song. She broke down crying and they ended up using another girl to dub Barsi's singing. \n\nThe movie itself is a moving and solid picture. I don't think Burt Reynolds getsw enough credit on how good he was in this voice acting role. He even showed he could sing. I like his duet with Melba Moore. \n\n\nI just adore Don Bluth and I wish he had made more movies.",
