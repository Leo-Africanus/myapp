I was taught about the holocaust in school, but there's something different about the experience of watching a film that offers a glimpse into it\n\nI believe this film is more important than ever now and it is easily Spielberg's magnum opus.

The acting of every character is so unique from each other, they all just feel grounded and like real people. I can't recall a single character that didn't feel like it was necessary to be in the movie.\n\nI will always watch this movie and just be waiting for Ben Mendelsohn to be back on screen. He plays that character so well and you just can't take your eyes off of him when he's on screen, he's like somehow made a scumbag druggie seem captivating. \n\nI watched this movie before I ever saw sopranos and I love seeing James Gandolfini in this movie as well, he's such a small part but he plays this older exhausted mob/assassin guy so damn well it's amazing. \n\nAnd of course Brad Pitt fits his role like a glove, he doesn't need to move outside his acting comfort zone because his role seems like it was written with him in mind. \n\nScott Mcnairy has such a unique voice and accent in this movie I can't not listen to every word out of his mouth. His role throughout the movie seems like a series of unfortunate events that brings all these fantastic characters to screen in such a great pace. \n\nOne scene I cant ever get over is the gambling robbery, something about the way the camera follows Russell through the back and the alley and out to the car, the sound design is just one of my favorite parts, it feels like youre right there. \n\nThis movie is a must re-watch for me every so often, because I know how the characters and the sound design and the filming will always just keep me in the movie and this story the whole time.

        "content": "Have you rewatched a movie as an adult and it\u2019s like seeing it again for the first time but with a new perspective? \n\nYou can understand it more, find the deeper meanings, it touches a nerve now, or you can actually relate to it?\n\nThis has happened to me twice now. Once with the Pirates of the Caribbean series and again with The Hunger Games. Both series I loved as a kid/teen but haven\u2019t watched them for years. \n\nRewatching Pirates as an adult allowed me to understand the pirate lingo, comprehend the plots that went over my head as a kid, such as Tia Dalma and Cutler Beckett, and actually see the movie in a new way. As if I was watching it for the first time. \n\nWith the Hunger Games, I never cared for the rebellion as a teen, I wanted to see the games. Now I appreciate the fact that a poor 16 year old is the face of a rebellion, that she\u2019s on the frontline, that she\u2019s battling a very real enemy. The rebellion is now harder to watch and the moments of unity and humanity (such as the three finger salute or her \u201cif we burn, you burn with us\u201d moment) actually make me emotional and understand the rallying that happened. \n\nHas anyone else had this sort of experience where they understand a movie in a new way after watching it when they are older?",

        "content": "So I think that the Bourne trilogy is an absolute classic for me. From the action sequences, story and action scenes. I also don't mind the shakycam in those movies too as at least you can focus on what's going on in those scenes.\n\nBut one thing I will say is how it kickstarted shaky cam in action movies for the worse. After Bourne Supremacy, every filmmaker decided to start including shakycam in action movies. Batman Begins was an early example of shakycam in action movies and then we had dozens more that had shaky cam until the trend finally went away once people found out that people couldn't replicate Bourne's shakycam. Even in The Bourne Identity, there was some shaky cam (especially the first act) in that film also.\n\nI ain't talking about The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Jason Bourne (2016) as we talk about those an another day in a separate post. But for a while, shaky cam in action movies were a huge trend around Hollywood.",
