        "content": "Hey reddit, we're Michael Dougherty and Quinn Lord, director and lead actor from 2007's TRICK 'R TREAT. It's being re-released in theaters next week. Here to answer your questions.\n\n*More information:*\n\n**4K re-release trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-IlZeWpXs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-IlZeWpXs)\n\n**Tickets to see it in theaters:**\n\n[https://www.fathomentertainment.com/releases/trick-r-treat/](https://www.fathomentertainment.com/releases/trick-r-treat/)\n\n**More information:**\n\nMichael Dougherty is a writer, director, animator, and producer known for his work in a variety of genre films, both big and small. Beginning his career as an animator and illustrator, Dougherty's animated work was featured on MTV, Nickelodeon, and a line of twisted greeting cards published by NobleWorks. He then co-wrote the blockbusters X-Men 2 and Superman Returns before making his directorial debut with the classic horror comedy, Trick 'r Treat (2007), starring Anna Paquin, Dylan Baker, Quinn Lord, and Brian Cox. Trick 'r Treat has since become a perennial favorite that has spawned a growing line of toys, comics, theme park attractions, and Halloween decor, and a sequel is in development with Legendary Pictures. Dougherty later set his sights on Christmas, which resulted in Krampus (2015), a holiday horror comedy starring Toni Collette, Adam Scott, David Koechner, and Allison Tolman. Much like Trick 'r Treat, Krampus has become an annual holiday classic. Most recently, Dougherty co-wrote and directed the blockbuster Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) starring Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, and Ken Watanabe, and co-wrote the story for its sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), starring Brian Tyree Henry, Rebecca Hall, and Alexander Skaarsgaard. Collectively, Dougherty's work has grossed over 2 billion dollars at the box office.\n\nQuinn Lord was born on February 19, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He is an actor and producer, known for Imaginaerum (2012), The Man in the High Castle (2015) and Fringe (2008).\n\nWe'll be back later today (Wednesday 10/8) at 3 PM ET to answer your questions. Ask us anything!\n\n",
