        "title": "December 6-8 Box Office Recap: 'Moana 2' stayed on top of the box office, earning almost $600 million worldwide after just 2 weeks. The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8\n\nThanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.\n\nWithout any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).\n\nThrough 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.\n\n***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.\n\n***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.\n\nAmazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.\n\nThe Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.\n\nParamount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.\n\nSony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.\n\nFathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country\u2019s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).\n\nDebuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. \n\nThis shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.\n\nAccording to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful \"C\u2013\" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.\n\nOutside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.\n\nVertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.\n\nA24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.\n\nSearchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.\n\nWhile ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.\n\n***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.\n\n***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M\n\n- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nFive films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.\n\nThe first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.\n\nThe other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.\n\nParamount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.\n\nAmazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.\n\nThe other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "**The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lord_of_the_rings_the_war_of_the_rohirrim): 60% (30 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/): 59 (12 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-peter-jackson-company-attempt-return-183-years-earlier-tolkein-universe-japanese-anime-1236197887/):\n\n&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):\n\n&gt;For those who can\u2019t get enough of Middle Earth, here\u2019s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm\u2019s Deep (where we saw Saruman\u2019s Orcs obliterated by Ents in \u201cThe Two Towers\u201d).\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):\n\n&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore\u2019s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien\u2019s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm\u2019s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we\u2019ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.\n\n[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):\n\n&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson\u2019s LotR in the best way. It\u2019s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):\n\n&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from \"The War of the Rohirrim.\" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that\u2019s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It\u2019s hard to get mad at this movie, but it\u2019s oh so easy to be disappointed.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson\u2019s trilogy \u2014 few do \u2014 but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):\n\n&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):\n\n&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth\u2019s famous legends.\n\n\\--------\n\nDirected by Kenji Kamiyama\n\n&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001\u20132003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.\n\nRelease Date: December 13",

Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.\n \nAnother thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.\n\nThe ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).\n\nThe only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.\n\nIn short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.\n\nHighly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",

Its obviously always there but I just found this movie to be pretty ridiculous with it. Got any others?",

The characters are well thought out and very entertaining, Karl Urban plays the role of Jacob very well. The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The \"pirate speak\" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.\n\nIt's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.\n\nAlso, my 3yo boy is obsessed with it, so I'd have to watch it whether I liked it or not. ",

        "title": "\"The Lovely Bones:\" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List",
        "content": "I just saw the movie \"The Lovely Bones\" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. \n\nI came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on \"paired with\" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl \"everyone dies\" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. \n\nI also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to \"everyone\" like the spirit guide describes death. The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. \n\nFurthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the \"cool grandma\" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a \"grown man\" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just \"live with it\" less than a year after the murder.\n\nIt's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.\n\nFinally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the \"weird looking, creepy stranger\" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.\n\nThis movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.\n\nEDIT: I guess I wasn't as articulate as I could have been, no I don't think they needed to show a 14 year old literally getting raped, please stop saying that's what I said or asking why I supposedly wanted to see that. My point there was, I think the film is way too flipant with how it handles rape's emotional impact by not acknowleding what happened in any way, or at the very least by rushing the girl to get over it ASAP. Girls need to show that this isn't okay and their upset feelings are valid when it happens to them. No death survivors can get anything from this movie, as they are dead. However SA survivors can. And if the point wasn't supposed to be about the girl, we didn't need to see her in the afterlife.",

        "content": "I watched the movie for the first (and most likely last) time last night and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. \n\nSpoiler warning for those who haven\u2019t seen it. \n\nThe acting was phenomenal and the story was really heartbreaking. \n\nSeeing Neil get groomed and assaulted by his coach made me want to crawl out of my skin. It was even more disturbing and sad that years later, he still views and believes that summer as one in which he was in love with and was \u201cloved\u201d and \u201cprized\u201d by an adult man who preyed on him and his team mates at 8 years old. \n\nSeeing Brian struggling and looking for any explanation (such as alien abduction) to give an answer to why he couldn\u2019t remember the night of his assault was also devastating, and it was so sad to watch him as Neil reveals the truth to him at the end of the film. \n\nIt\u2019s sick that these things happen in real life and this film really showed the damage that childhood sexual assault can have on individuals lives.
