It looks far more dangerous and insane than most fire stunts since then. Like they really did just throw buckets of gasoline at a stuntman while he is already engulfed in flames thrashing about the set",

        "content": "Few films have achieved such a memorable opening as West Side Story (1961), directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, the latter also responsible for the original Broadway choreography. The opening scene, without a single word, immediately immerses us in the tension between youth gangs in New York in the 1950s.\n\nWith music by the legendary Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and photography by maestro Daniel L. Fapp, this film became a benchmark of the modern musical. It won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture.",

        "title": "Terminator 2: Judgement Day is the gold standard of utilization of both practical and digital effects.",
        "content": "In T2, The T-800 (Arnold) was 100% practical effects. The T-1000 (liquid metal Robert Patrick) was about 50% CGI. In fact, many of the scenes that general moviegoers assume may be CGI are actually practical. \n\nIn the hospital chase when Robert Patrick is being shot at, he has tiny holes in a shirt - devices are hidden inside them, that when operated via remote control, they expand outward through the hole revealing the metal plate, aka gunshot. The elevator blast was a dummy on a spring. The shotgun blast through the windshield of the nitrogen truck was a dummy. The blade through the hospital security guard was a real blade on a dummy's head from the back view. Eye hole was a dummy. The loss of legs when frozen was a amputee stuntman. CGI was only used when we see him in metal form reverted back to his Robert Patrick mode, the bullet holes reverting to normal on camera, the bar scene, the helicopter morph, and a couple of other shots.\n\nIf T2 were made today, not only would the T-1000 be 100% CGI, most of the T-800's effects would be CGI, too.\n\nIt's the gold standard for me because they only used CGI when practical was not possible, like things that are liquid taking shape. For mechanical structures like a machine, you don't need it, as a machine can be built. For puppets like Chucky, you don't need it, because animatronic dolls can be made.  Now it's used for almost anything that isn't human. ",
