Real freaky stuff, makes you question our understanding of our universe, and whether something supernatural is at work or not.",

        "title": "Possession (1981) is an absolutely batshit insane movie - I'm still not sure how I really feel about it",
        "content": "Just finished this 1980s horror cult classic and holy shit bruh...this movie is the definition of \"wtf did I just watch?\". Just an absolutely bonkers, over-the-top story that's equal parts genius and ridiculous. \n\nIt took me a little bit of time to really latch on to the narrative, because it's so purposefully heightened and melodramatic. The dizzying camerawork, the unhinged, overacted performances and the gradually escalating luridness creates a truly demented and nightmarish atmosphere. Honestly, it's worth watching for pure vibes alone. \n\nIsabelle Adjani is what everyone talks about when mentioning Possession, and I think her performance mostly lives up to the hype. It's just complete commitment to the role, no holds barred. The infamous subway scene is as wild and jaw-dropping as advertised. Sam Neill deserves a lot of credit too, for playing a character almost as fucking nutty as his wife. His portrayal of a man seeing his marriage fall apart and realizing he has no control over it is pretty damn impressive.\n\nIn fact, the first thing that I thought of when I finished it is that Andrzej Zulawski was definitely fuckin' going through it. The entire narrative felt like a representation of a man experiencing the end of his marriage, not being able to come to terms with it and desperately doing whatever he can to hold on to a relationship that's already over and beyond repair. To that end, the ending, &gt;!with the creature turning into a \"better\" version of Mark, seems to indicate that he's been well and truly replaced!&lt;\n\nReally, the horror element is surprisingly almost a sidenote - I was expecting the movie to have much more straight-up horror-esque elements than it actually did. This isn't bad really, just unexpected. The squid monster thing seems almost symbolic a lot of the time. \n\nIn terms of why I'm conflicted about the movie...even though I found it fun, well-made and something I'll probably remember for a while, the extremely heightened nature of the story and the atmosphere is a *lot* to take. The entire movie is one giant crash-out, everybody speaks like they're in a mental institution, there's sooo much screaming and yelling, and unless you remind yourself that it's purposefully designed to be absurd, the campy overacting can be grating and unintentionally hilarious.\n\nWith that being said - this is a truly unique cinematic experience. It really feels like a waking nightmare and it never stops making you feel uncomfortable - which is really what the best horror movies manage to achieve.\n\nApparently there's a remake in the works, which to me seems like an awful idea. The untethered, no-limit insanity of this movie is what makes it work and I really can't see a modern remake capturing the tone - or a modern actress embodying what Isabelle Adjani pulled off. \n\n",

        "content": "I enjoy Liam Neeson action movies because he doesn't just phone it in like other older action stars making action movies. They have a decent plot, well shot, and his acting is always good. The action is mostly well done, but some have a lot of cuts and bad editing. I will rate them in order of: 1: Action. 2: Story. 3: Everything else.\n\nI'm only ranking pure action movies, and he has to be the **main protagonist**.\n\n\n\n1. **Taken** - The one that started it all and still the best one. Great story and action.\n\n2. **Run All Night** - One of his best when it comes to pure action, and the plot is interesting with some twists.\n\n3. **Non-Stop** - Pure adrenaline, set on an Airplane, intriguing plot and twists.\n\n4. **Unknown** - Another one with great plot and twists. Action movie with mystery.\n\n5. **Darkman** - This is an underrated movie, it's a comic book adaptation, but I'll count it as an action movie.\n\n6.  **A Walk Among the Tombstones** - Detective movie with action and good story.\n\n7. **The Commuter** - Similar to Non-Stop but set on a train and just a fun movie.\n\n8. **Honest Thief** - Liam Neeson doing what he does best. Not bad.\n\n9. **Cold Pursuit** - Different from his other action movies, but a funny action movie with dark humor. \n\n10. **The Marksman** - Liam Neeson against the cartel, say no more.\n\n11. **Memory** - Generic action movie, not much to say.\n\n12. **Taken 2** - Disappointing sequel compared to original.\n\n13. **The Ice Road** - Not a bad movie, but it's more of a disaster movie with some action.\n\n14. **Retribution** - Below average. The whole movie takes place in a car, with some twists, and can be boring.\n\n15. **Absolution** - Yea this is one of his worst action movie, bad plot, bad acting, only little action scenes.\n\n16. **Blacklight** - Literally unwatchable trash with boring plot, avoid it. How did this cost 40m??\n\n17. **Taken 3** - Just for the fence scene, this deserves last place.",

        "title": "Don Logan from Sexy Beast (2001) scares me way more than Anton Chigurh",
        "content": "Sexy Beast is an iconic English Gangster movie, beautifully filmed and has an excellent pace. At 84 minutes, it packs a nice concise punch, and leaves you wanting more. Starring Ray Winstone (Gal) and Ben Kingsley (Don Logan). \n\nIf you've not seen this film, then please do, it is incredible. The performance Ben Kingsley gives as Don Logan will leave you genuinely chilled to the bone. I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense. \n\nThis film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in spades in this film. I promise you that you will love this film - you might want sub titles because the cockney accents are strong with this one. Please watch it, and please enjoy.",

I don\u2019t want to oversimplify or put everything on Quentin\u2019s shoulders and say that he alone changed the makeup of Hollywood. So anyway, do any of you youngins really feel Iron Eagle?

I dunno. I just don't want it to be about anything serious or depressing. Stuff I have found interesting is for example people trying to make movies that either turn out to be awful or just the production is extremely troubled. Or when something goes wrong and it causes a huge chaotic fallout that a lot of people have to deal with. (without anyone's life getting actually, completely ruined)\n\nHopefully im not rambling too much. If anyone does have recs, thank you so much. And have a great day!\n\nEdit: Just came to say, I wasn't expecting this many replies, and again thanks so much. I have a wide selection to choose from and I really appreciate it!",

        "title": "Hear me out: Death Becomes Her is basically a dark comedy version of Sunset Boulevard",
        "content": "\nBoth films centre around aging actresses who refuse to accept that their youth and fame are long gone. Norma Desmond and Madeline Ashton are basically cut from the same cloth. They\u2019re both living in fantasy worlds, surrounded by reminders of their past glory, doing everything they can to pretend time hasn\u2019t touched them. Norma clings to old film reels and delusions of a comeback. Madeline drinks a potion and literally becomes immortal. Different tone, same fear, irrelevance.\n\nThey also share this intense jealousy when \u201ctheir\u201d man starts loving someone else. In Sunset Boulevard, it\u2019s Joe Gillis. In Death Becomes Her, it\u2019s Ernest. That jealousy builds until it tips over into madness and, eventually, murder. Both women go down with the ship, clutching their illusions of beauty and control.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a detail I\u2019ve always found weirdly perfect. When Norma first meets Joe, she mistakes him for a mortician. But in Death Becomes Her, Ernest actually is a mortician. He literally specializes in making the dead look alive. The symbolism is so on the nose it almost loops back around to genius.\n\nOf course, the tones are completely different. Sunset Boulevard is noir tragedy, Death Becomes Her is full-blown camp. But they\u2019re both sharp critiques of Hollywood\u2019s obsession with youth, beauty, and fame. One just plays it straight, the other goes off the rails in the best way possible.\n\nSo yeah. Sunset Boulevard walked so Death Becomes Her could teeter in wearing heels, half a spine, and a wildly inappropriate hat.\n\nAnyone else see the connection? Or am I just watching too many movies about dramatic, decaying divas?",

        "content": "There are many people that argue that a guy and a girl can\u2019t JUST be friends, especially if both parties are heterosexual. Because depending on how close they become, it is usually inevitable that they will become sexually and emotionally attracted to the other. \n\nHowever, I personally believe the opposite and that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be very close without there being any hints of romance. \n\nOne good example that I can think of is the friendship between Jess and Leslie from the Disney film; Bridge to Terabithia (2007)! Their friendship was the heart and overall story of the movie, and it was so heartwarming to watch that friendship develop before it took a devastating turn with Leslie\u2019s death. \n\nSure it could be argued that Jess was realizing that he was romantically falling in love with Leslie, and there were some hints of a romance sparking between them before she died. But it was still a great friendship, where there was a great deal of love between them without needing to become a couple. ",
