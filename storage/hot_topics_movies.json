And it does, at least until we realize that there\u2019s not much else going on.\n\n[Newsday](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/338) \\- [Rafer Guzman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/rafer-guzman) \\- 0 / 4\n\n&gt;\"HIM\" does not have the Peele touch. What it has is an intriguing premise, but no coherent story and no clear idea of what it wants to say.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [Frank Scheck](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/frank-scheck)\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, *Him*, directed by Justin Tipping (*Kicks*), squanders its potential. While it starts out promisingly, it seriously devolves in its second half into a surreal phantasmagoria that\u2019s more gonzo than chilling. If you\u2019re looking for a truly disturbing film about the dehumanizing effects of professional football in the corporate age, the one to see is still 1979\u2019s *North Dallas Forty*. \u00a0\n\n[The Direct](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100010147) \\- [Jeff Ewing](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jeff-ewing) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Marlon Wayans is exceptional, and well supported overall by the film's other players. Some moments do add confusion, but it ultimately comes together well enough to be a laudable experimental effort.",

When his evil nemesis resurfaces and Willa goes missing, the former radical scrambles to find her as both father and daughter battle the consequences of their pasts.*\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti, Regina Hall\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [98%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_battle_after_another)\n\n**Metacritic:**  [99 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/one-battle-after-another/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[HighOnFilms - Liam Gaughan](https://www.highonfilms.com/one-battle-after-another-2025-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a hyperkinetic thrill ride that surprisingly never loses momentum throughout its nearly three-hour running time, yet never feels weighed down by its scope. The action has the same eye-popping practicality of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d or \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d with the charm that none of its characters are particularly skilled. DiCaprio often appears as a bumbling hero in the vein of Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, even if he shows a capacity for delivering snarky one-liners not seen since his work in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250917-one-battle-after-another-review) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Salman Rushdie, reviewing Pynchon's Vineland 35 years ago, called it \"a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself.\" And at a Q&amp;A with Anderson several weeks ago, Steven Spielberg praised the film as \"increasingly more relevant than perhaps even when you finished the screenplay\". American society, in all its strengths and missteps, has been a major theme for both Pynchon and Anderson, and it grounds Anderson's dazzler of a film, giving it an emphatic, unmistakable political charge.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/one-battle-after-another/) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Ambitious, urgent and personal storytelling from Paul Thomas Anderson, blending many different genres to create an engaging and vital new masterwork. Relentless pacing, strong performances, technical and visual excellence, with multi-layered depth and inspiring relevance to bring about change for our overwhelmingly dark times.\n\n[IGN - Michael Calabro](https://www.ign.com/articles/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-pta?utm_source=threads,twitter) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;Even the things PTA whole-cloth invented for the film, like the harmony transponders, Bob forgetting the code words, the Christopher Reeve Superman poster in Sensei Sergio\u2019s dojo, semen demon, the car chases, the stunt fall off a building down a tree\u2026 There are so many little details, seemingly inconsequential touches \u2013 the filmmaker\u2019s style, if you will \u2013 that all add up bit by bit to turn this amazing movie into a masterpiece.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1235151707/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Anderson concedes that he\u2019s no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-andersons-thrillingly-helter-skelter-counter-culture-caper) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen \u2013 an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream? Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-2025) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s also, crucially, a deeply humanist movie. Anderson cares about these characters deeply. Bob\u2019s frustration becomes our own, as does his concern for Willa. So many \u201cfilms of our moment\u201d have felt angry or cynical, but Anderson\u2019s movie transcends that by being human and even offering optimism. It\u2019s not one loss after another. It\u2019s one battle. Keep fighting.\n\n[The Playlist - Rodrigo Perez](https://theplaylist.net/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-declares-war-in-thrilling-comical-moving-take-on-revolution-personal-evolutions-20250917/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;From one generation to the next, the struggle endures. Fierce and unrelenting, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d burns as both an incendiary action epic and a tender family drama, alive with humor, conviction, and revolutionary spirit. And amid all its pandemonium, Sergio\u2019s reminder that \u201cfreedom is no fear\u201d lingers as the film\u2019s quiet truth, a mantra passed down like a torch. Few films this year feel so vital, so breathtaking in scope and soul. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n, indeed.\n\n[London Evening Standard - Nick Howells](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-anderson-leonardo-dicaprio-teyana-taylor-b1247490.html) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;What Anderson has turned out is something of a cinephile\u2019s visual symphony. If there were Proms devoted to films instead of music in the future, One Battle After Another would be one of the first movies to join the repertoire. And yes, Oscars must be coming...\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/09/17/one-battle-after-another-thriller-leonardo-dicaprio/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Eyes shielded by Terminator shades, tatty dressing gown flapping in the breeze, Leonardo DiCaprio tumbles through One Battle After Another looking like he\u2019s fighting several conflicts simultaneously, on physical and mental fronts...This madcap urban warfare thriller has heists, showdowns and two of the best car chases in years.\n\n[Empire - Alex Godfrey](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/one-battle-after-another/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;In years to come, when this appears on TV late at night, it\u2019ll be impossible to switch off. It\u2019s just one of those films. A stone-cold, instant classic.\n\n[Associated Press - Jake Coyle](https://apnews.com/article/one-battle-after-another-review-pta-dicaprio-354b5503260e63ff724a7ab8847d946c) \\- 100 / 100\n\n&gt;\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d as a major studio release clattering with straightforward representations of racism, xenophobia and vigilantism, is an exception in almost every way to modern-day Hollywood. I\u2019m sure that will bring debate, just as any good movie does. And I\u2019m sure some will find its American portrait muddled and chaotic. But those aspects feel true, too, just as does the movie\u2019s abiding fighting spirit.\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1661135/greatest-character-actors-all-time-ranked/) \\- 10 / 10\n\n&gt;I don't think anyone would classify Anderson as an action filmmaker, but \"One Battle After Another\" is propulsive, loaded with shootouts and a lengthy car chase finale that's so intense and exciting that I felt like I was going to get out of my seat and start pacing around the theater to calm the hell down. Are you even allowed to make movies like this anymore, on this sort of grand scale? I don't know, but Paul Thomas Anderson has done it. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n.",

I knew nothing about it going into it, I can't even remember what made me watch it. Then 10 minutes into the movie, I realized it was going to be in reverse chronological order, which I thought was a gimmick. By the end of the movie, I'm not sure they could have told it in proper sequence, it totally worked. It's was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I recommended it to my friends Whatsapp group, and those that watched it really enjoyed it as well\n\nAny under appreciated movie recommendations out there?

I forget how good the dialouge in this movie is. \"That fucking nurse man...she ain't honest\", \"I'm not as big as you Mac\"\n\nIt really, really makes me wanna sit down and read the book. I can just feel how much context is missing from these incredible characters backgrounds. I also assume the book is set in the 50's? Because they never mention a time frame for the movie so I assume it happens in the 70's, but everything about the settting feels like the 50's\n\n\nI wanted to say this is Jack Nichelsons best performance, but I'm conflicted cause I also love The Shining. But honestly, everybody's great in this. I can't think of a single person who wasn't giving a top notch performance.\n\n\nIt's an incredible story. If you judge the plot purely by the events that happen, everything becomes worse by McMurphy arriving to the hospital. Objectively, Mac's a bad person. He has a long rep sheet, he even says I fuck and fight too much. His antics lead to a lot of bad shit happening.\n\n\nAnd yet he's exactly what those poor bastards needed to take a break from that domineering nurse and the cold, sterile enviorment she created.\n\n\nThat said, everybody remembers Nurse Ratched from this movie as the villain, but Washington the orderly is also a pretty good side villain. He takes entirely too much pleasure in pushing these outcasts around and delights in punishing them.",
