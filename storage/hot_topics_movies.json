        "content": "Just finished The Prestige and damn my brain is spinning. I went in thinking it\u2019s just two rival magicians trying to outsmart each other. But nah, this movie is way twisty..  \n\n\nThe biggest shock for me was Borden being two people. Alfred and Fallon were twins the whole time, living one life as one man. That\u2019s why sometimes he is loving and sometimes cold. Sometimes he cares for his wife and sometimes he feels like a stranger. They literally destroyed their personal lives just to protect one magic trick. That\u2019s crazy dedication.\nThen Angier\u2026 this part really messed me up. I thought he finally used a double. But no, Tesla\u2019s machine was real. It was cloning him. Every single show, one Angier survives and the other one dies in the tank. He never even knows if he will be the man who lives or the man who drowns. He keeps killing himself again and again just to win. That is straight up disturbing.\n\nThen I realized the opening murder wasn\u2019t even normal murder. Angier planned his own death to frame Borden. He sacrificed himself just to destroy his enemy. That\u2019s how deep his obsession went.\nThe ending hurt. One Angier is drowning in the tank and the other is bleeding on the floor. No winners at all. Just two broken men who ruined their lives for obsession.",

        "title": "Examples of anti-Chekhov's guns?",
        "content": "A rule of thumb for playwrights is that any significant story element introduced early in the play should have some sort of payoff before the play ends. If you introduce a gun in act one of a three act play, it better go off in act three or it was an extraneous detail that should be excised from the script. The same rule is often applied to movies as well.\n\nMy question is what examples of an anti-Chekhov gun are there: not just a plot device that has no payoff but a plot device that is introduced and subsequently works in a way antithetical to the way the movie explains. Basically how many movies lie to the audience.\n\nTwo examples come to mind: in Jurassic Park, it's shown early on that the t-rexes are so massive that their footsteps can be heard from far away and shake the ground but later in the climax, a T-Rex seemingly appears out of nowhere with no warning. In Ant Man, it's explained that items that are shrunk down maintain their mass, that's why a punch from a microscopic Ant Man packs the punch of a full grown adult yet we see later in the movie that Hank Pym is carrying around a shrunk down tank that should way thousands of pounds on a keychain.",

Like I could barely get popcorn the lines were so long, and they had every single bloody cash register staffed with people. The theater itself for Hamnet was sold out. I've been to the theater nearly five times in the last two months, and each time, it only gets busier. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share something really positive, because it made me nearly cry I was so happy. art never does die, even when we're worried it will :)",

I get the feeling it sort of expanded his vocabulary a little.\n\nHe asked me what the first R-rated movie I ever watched was, and I can\u2019t remember for sure, but it was probably The Terminator. I definitely wasn\u2019t old enough when I watched it. I have these really vivid memories of watching it with friends in some dark room, feeling both exhilarated and deeply anxious the entire time. That eye surgery scene was freaky, and the factory scene at the end when the Terminator is just a metal skeleton gave me nightmares.\n\nStill, I remember being so glad I\u2019d seen it. I didn\u2019t know movies could do that, could make you feel such intense fear, excitement, and awe. Just felt like some of a revelation.

Cornel Wilde not only stars in the film but he also co produced and directed the film. The film\u2019s language is 95% Afrikaans and 1% English but you watch the film for the intensity. The film is crazy how they got away with some of the scenes back in 1965. ",

I dread completing a film, because I know I will get sad and numb after and it just makes me less enthusiastic to watch more films. I just completed \"A silent voice\" it is a beautiful movie and I got so invested that when it ended it felt like i fell into a void, I have no idea how to explain it. \n\nI dont know if this is the appropriate place to Post this but I will anyway.

So, these are my go-to's but what else should be on the list?\n\nThe Shining\n\nAmityville Horror\n\nRosemary's Baby\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nCarrie\n\nStepford Wives original\n\n\u200b\u200bThat 70s movie about that lady named Sally with the little weird creatures that escaped from the furnace. That was wild.\n\n\u200b\u200bScary Movie 2 is a comedy but I'll put it on the list anyway\n\n\u200b\u200bI haven't watched Scream in so long that I don't really remember if I was scared at all when I saw that.\n\n\u200b\u200bI don't care for gruesome gore. Back in the day a group of guys invited me to go watch Saw with them and I went having no backstory on the movie.\n\n\u200b\u200bI walked out of the theater after the first scene.\n\n\u200b\u200bWhat other haunting movies should be on my list? What have you watched and enjoyed? Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Some films build incredible tension, character development, and momentum, only to stumble in the final act with a rushed resolution, a contrived twist, or a tonal shift that doesn\u2019t land.  \nThis isn\u2019t about endings you simply didn\u2019t like, but ones that felt like a narrative or structural letdown after a strong setup.\n\nConsider:\n\n* ***I Am Legend***\u00a0(original vs. alternate ending).\n* ***Sunshine***\u00a0(2007) \u2013 shift from sci-fi to horror.\n* ***Law Abiding Citizen***\u00a0\u2013 final resolution debates.\n* ***10 Cloverfield Lane***\u00a0\u2013 divisive finale.\n\nIf you were in the editing room, how would you have reshaped the final act to preserve the film\u2019s earlier brilliance?",

        "content": "When two characters talk between each other in a language, and switch to another (mainly English), most of the time it feels weird, forced. For example, when Legolas and Aragorn speak Elvish just to suddenly change to English to deliver *the* phrase.\n\nIt delivers, it serves a dramatic purpose, but most of the time it feels unrealistic.\n\nIn Rental Family, this felt completely the opposite. When Brendan Fraser's character speaks in Japanese, it's natural, it fits the context, and it's a realistic use: ordering ramen, when first contacting a person... And when he switches to English, it feels so real, he speaks it with people that fit it: a child learning it in school, a renowned filmmaker who has probably traveled around the world...\n\nNot only the context is \"justified\", but he's constantly switching from English to Japanese, and it flows so naturally. It was beautiful to hear and see this movie.",
