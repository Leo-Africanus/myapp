        "title": "Films with Theatrical Cuts that are better than Director's Cut/Extended Edition?",
        "content": "I feel that most director's cuts/extended editions of films are actually inferior to the theatrical versions. That isn't to say that they're all bad, but in many instances, the director's cut usually kills the flow of the film. A theatrical cut isn't always done because of studio interference. Most of the time, scenes are left out for a reason. \n\nMy most controversial take is that the theatrical cuts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy are vastly superior to the Extended Editions. Maybe it's just because I watched the Theatrical Versions countless times growing up, but any time I watch the Extended Editions, I find myself taken out by the differences. The edits from the Theatrical Versions stick out like a sore thumb. They aren't bad by any means, but the pacing of the Theatrical Versions is much tighter, which is crucial for such long movies. The Theatrical Version of Fellowship of the Ring is literally a perfect film. Not an ounce of fat on there. Even Peter Jackson prefers the Theatrical Editions and says he put the Extended Editions together for the most hardcore fans. \n\nAnother is Step Brothers. One of my favorites comedies that I feel really gets hampered by its Director's Cut. The pacing grinds to a halt and the jokes don't really land. The theatrical cut is much tighter. It's crazy how much of a difference a few minutes makes. \n\nSpider Man 2.1 is also vastly inferior to the theatrical version. I've seen people praise it as the \"definitive edition\" of the film, and I don't understand why. A briskly paced and perfectly edited film that is elongated for no good reason. The added scenes were unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story or what it was saying. \n\nA lot of the time, the Theatrical Cut is what the director intended to be seen by everyone. What are your examples of a Theatrical Cut that is the superior version? \n\n*EDIT: I would say the most essential Director\u2019s Cut is the Extended Edition of Once Upon A Time In America. At 251 minutes, it isn\u2019t even Leone\u2019s full vision, but it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ll ever get. It completes the story as much as it can. ",

        "content": "I\u2019m talking about easter eggs you noticed yourself while watching a movie, not that you learned about by reading about it. I\u2019ll go first (it\u2019s a long one):\n\nI watched Kana\u0142 (1957) today and noticed something incredible. Keep in mind that it was made at a time when Poland was Communist and under a Stalinist government, so censorship was very strong. Anyway, the movie is about the Warsaw Rising, which failed because the Russians intentionally let it fail to weaken resistance for their own occupation of Poland. Obviously, Wajda (the director) could not portray this in the film because of censorship, so he hid a genius easter egg instead. In one scene where a pianist who fights with the rebels finds a piano, he is asked to play it. He begins playing Chopin\u2019s Revolutionary Etude before being quickly told to play something else. This piece was written by Chopin in the 19th century, just after Poland had risen up against Russian occupation and been crushed. The inclusion of this piece in the film was absolutely a direct parallel to this rising caused to fail by the Russians.\n\nThis was an incredible easter egg to notice by myself. What are your similar stories?",
