Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

        "title": "Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.",
        "content": "Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.\n\nThe movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. \n\nI'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.\n\nThis movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. \n\nThe action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.\n\nAmy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.\n \nThere's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. &gt;!The public sex scene!&lt;. This scene kind of has a &gt;!rapey!&lt; moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.\n\nI feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.\n\nEdit: &gt;!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!&lt;",

        "content": "I love \"process\" movies about teams working through a problem or working toward a goal --think Spotlight, Reversal of Fortune, All the President's Men, etc. These movies usually focus on one perspective: the news team working on the story, the legal team working on the case. Are there any movies that show one story that both the news team and the legal team are working on, presumably at cross purposes? Journalists and lawyers are often in opposition to each other, are there good movies about that specifically?",

I don't often pay attention to the music, unless it is noticeably either kind of awful or really incredible. \n\nEvery now and then I come across a movie that has a truly intoxicating score. Like I watch the film, it becomes such a crucial element of the film to me, I can't imagine the film without those sounds, and then I have those rhythms stuck in my head for weeks. \n\nA few other examples I can think of are the original Wicker Man, The Fountain, Under the Skin, maybe Enter the Void or perhaps some Ken Russell stuff. I honestly can't quite remember at this point. \n\nDo you have any movie recommendations like that? Of soundtracks that really just sucked you in and entranced, on an almost spiritual level? \n\nThis is the song from Holy Mountain that most comes to mind:\nhttps://youtu.be/8zjhtSeocXc?si=r_3YXmFaef8-NNNb\n\nI'd love to find more examples. \nThanks!

        "title": "\u201cThe Monkey\u201d by Oz Perkins\u2026 A cosmic parable. (Spoiler free)",
        "content": "I find most themes, tropes, and narratives to all be a \u201cdifferent flavor of the same soup base,\u201d and I adore making parallels where there may not be such an obvious connection.\nI was fortunate enough to go to an early screening of the new movie \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d directed by Osgood Perkins and starring Theo James. \u201cThe Monkey\u201d releases officially on February 21st, 2025.  \n  \nLoosely based off of a Stephen King short story, James knocks this role out of the proverbial park, embodying two incredibly distinct characters that bring a depth to the story that a singular protagonist may lack. I could easily drone on about how the word \u201cprotagonist\u201d might be a misnomer here, but the point of this article is not to dissect vocabulary (that will be for another day).  \n  \n\nLast year, Osgood Perkins released his feature film \u201cLonglegs,\u201d which was pretty divisive with reviewers; while the divisiveness was warranted, I truly think \u201cThe Monkey\u201d will transcend that pitfall\u2026 It is so bonkers, ridiculous, and so far-fetched that there is no need for suspension of disbelief. It\u2019s just a ride to be had\u2026. \n  \nBefore I delve deeper into \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d let\u2019s briefly turn our gaze towards another recent film that, much like entropy, follows similarly chaotic narratives in a way that demands order \u2014 The 2024 movie \u201cThe Substance,\u201d directed by Coralie Fargeat (starring Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley) is another cinematic experience that completely forces you to meet the movie where it\u2019s at\u2026 It is visceral, disgusting, terrifying, and a sobering parallel to how beauty, especially female beauty, is commoditized, and the baggage that we inadvertently carry as a result forms our experience of reality.  \n  \nSometimes archetypes are forced upon us, and we have no awareness that we have accepted them without question, and while \u201cThe Monkey\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d offer vastly different perspectives on the futility of control, the message crystallizes the more you\u2019re forced to just sit alongside it.  \n  \nFunny enough, that\u2019s kind of the takeaway from \u201cThe Monkey\u201d in general \u2014 not unlike quantum mechanics, we cannot truly predict where a photon will collapse, but based off of a trend, we can form a pretty accurate prediction of where it *may collapse* based on prerecorded datasets. In mathematics, which, I must admit, I remain far from even a layperson\u2019s understanding of, the term for this probability equation is called \u201cWave Function.\u201d   \n  \nMuch like the overarching themes of the visceral, absurdist horror renaissance we find ourselves experiencing, quantum particles don\u2019t like being forced into a world that demands order\u2026 and so, it subverts it entirely. Your only recourse is to relinquish yourself to the raging current, which isn\u2019t the failure modern society seems to think it is.  \n  \n\u201cThe Monkey\u201d teaches us that, much like life, The Monkey kills indiscriminately; the more an outside participant tries to control the outcome, the more The Monkey misbehaves\u2026 or, like a quantum particle, it behaves exactly as predicted.  \n  \nBoth the film and the titular character \u201cThe Monkey\u201d subvert every expectation of itself \u2014 beating you over the head with its parable like a chaotic primate gripping a drumstick \u2014 until you are finally willing to meet it where it\u2019s at.  \n  \nRelinquish all control, because life doesn\u2019t work that way\u2026 you never know when your cosmic time card is going to be punched.",

        "content": "I don't know if this qualifies as a review but I'm a die hard Nicole Kidman yet I had never seen To Die For. I'm 27 so I've followed her current work more closely and had only seen Eyes Wide Shut from her older filmography. \n\nI ended up watching To Die For (1995) last month and ever since, I've seen it three times, I'm completely obsessed with it. Nicole was perfection as Suzanne, she was so charming and charismatic, I loved her mannerisms and she had me rooting for her in a few moments and also feeling bad for her at the same time for not being able to pursue her career. Everyone was great, especially the actress who played Larry's sister, Joaquin and the actress who played Lydia. \n\nI also loved the little Easter Eggs I noticed on my rewatch, like when they first show the abandoned house while Suzanne screams in the background and when she goes to the station to drop her curriculum and she's talking to Ed and she's taking a letter from her bag and just puts it back when she sees George, that was hilarious. I also only noticed later that she slept with that journalist in Miami but I guess I'm just dense lol \n\nI also love Gone Girl and Rosamund Pike and I read that she watched To Die For as an inspiration for Amy so I was expecting Suzanne to be more chilling, cold and calculated and while she was all that, I think the movie carried a certain humour that I really enjoyed. Also loved Suzanne's outfits and how bright the colors were, I absolutely hate the trend where films and shows nowadays feel the need to turn off all the lights on set and everything is dark af. \n\nJust really enjoyed the movie, gave it a 4/5 because I wished we could've seen how Suzanne's plan started, I could understand why she wanted to kill Larry but the plan felt so sloppy and it'd so easy to track back the boys to her, and I think her plan would be more elaborate idk. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else is also a fan and your thoughts about To Die For!",
