Not just comedy/light hearted movies either. When watching the Revenant I was like 'you don't get up at 5am in freezing tempratures for months just for the hell of it.

So many cool ideas for a film in this genre like the viewing room where we see a man get cooked alive by the sun. The space craft they're in has one of the coolest designs I've ever seen in a space/scifi film. Personally, I fully believe that the film stuck the landing as well. However the shaky cam at the end is nauseating and there's a certain bit towards the end that I rolled my eyes at. But other than that I really don't have very many other complaints this shit rocks. \n\nIf you haven't seen Sunshine and you're a fan of scifi I highly highly recommend it. This is one of the greatest films to get high to as well if you partake. I was in awe during multiple scenes on my first watch after smoking a bowl. Don't go in expecting a super realistic and grounded space film. Just go in expecting a fun ass movie and you won't be dissapointed. ",
