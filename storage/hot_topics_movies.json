        "content": "Hey, Reddit! I\u2019m Reza Dahya and my feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW 2025), hits digital platforms on 11/21! It features rising star Ashton James as an aspiring rapper seeking his big break in Toronto\u2019s music industry. AMA!\n\nHere's the trailer:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ)\n\n**About Boxcutter:**\n\n&gt;Aspiring rapper Rome has the talent and the vision to break out in Toronto's hip-hop scene but his crippling insecurity is holding him back. When he learns that megastar producer Richie Hill will be making an appearance at a local club, Rome seizes the chance to meet him and get him his album. However, disaster strikes when Rome\u2019s apartment is burglarized and the only copy of his album is stolen. Racing across the city with his friend Jenaya, Rome scrambles to track down his collaborators, and his records, before he misses his one shot. Set against Toronto\u2019s gentrifying streets and its vibrant music scene, BOXCUTTER features an authentic look into Toronto\u2019s creative arts community with fixtures like Rich Kidd (2-time Juno-winning artist, produced songs for Drake, DMX, Jay Electronica and more), Clairmont the Second (Juno, Polaris &amp; Prism-nominated artist), RUSSELL! (R&amp;B singer/producer) and Junia-T (the official DJ for global superstar Jessie Reyez) all making appearances.\n\n**About Director Reza Dahya:**\n\n&gt;Reza Dahya is known for his work as a host and producer of OTA Live on FLOW 93.5 FM in Toronto. He transitioned into filmmaking with his short films, ESHA and the crowd-funded FIVE DOLLARS, which premiered at the TIFF Kids International Film Festival, screened internationally and aired on CBC\u2019s \"Canadian Reflections\". A 2015 alumnus of the CFC Directors\u2019 Lab, Dahya completed his CFC Short Film, CHAMELEON, the independent THE WORST PART and is currently releasing his feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW, 2025).\n\nFor additional information: [https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter](https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter)\n\nAsk me anything!

        "title": "Watched The Wolf of Wall Street again yesterday and something clicked about how Scorsese tells the story",
        "content": "It feels like the entire movie is shot from inside Jordan Belfort\u2019s head. All the excess, the money, drugs, parties, sex is exaggerted to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile the truly dark consequencs never feel as brutal as they realistically were. Scorsese easily could\u2019ve shown the damage in a far more disturbing, grounded way, but he doesn\u2019t. And I think that choice is deliberate.\n\nThe \u201cI drove home safely\u201d scene is the clearest example. In Belfort\u2019s mind, he\u2019s a genius who kept it together. Then we see the actual reality total destruction. That one scene tells you everything, the movie isn\u2019t showing the world as it is, but as belfort believes it to be.\n\nThat\u2019s why the film feels like its \u201cglorifying\u201d the lifestyle. It\u2019s not Scorsese glorifyng it its belfort. We\u2019re stuck inside his delusion the whole time. The highs look incredible because he thinks they were. The lows feel softened because he never processed the harm he caused.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the final scene, which I honestly think is a masterpiece. Belfort is reduced to giving sales seminars, but Scorsese frames it like he\u2019s still the king he imagines himself to be. What hit me the most was the audiences faces all staring at him with this mix of hope, desperation, and admiration. It\u2019s Scorseses final punchline that belfort may have fallen, but the world is still eager to be sold the same dream.\n\nThe cycle continues, and people still want what he represents even after seeing how hollow and destructive it is.\n\nTo me, that ending recontextualizes the whole movie. It\u2019s not just a story about Belfort. Its about the audience both in the film and in real life who are still drawn to the fantasy he built.\n\nEdit: A few people pointed out that this idea is already established in the very first shot where jordan corrects the color of the car. And yeah, that absolutely sets the rule for the whole movie.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what I meant. im talking about how Scorsese goes beyond that one meta moment. He builds an entire visual language around Belfort\u2019s warped perception. It\u2019s not just that Jordan changes tiny details, the whole world is filmed the way he wants to remember it, almost like reality is bending itself around his fantasy.\n\nAnd the irony is that the truth only breaks through in brief, jarring bursts like the real version of the driving scene, Naomi throwing water on him, the yacht sinking moments where Scorsese essentially grabs the camera back from Jordan and shows the objective version of events.\n\nso yes, that first shot establishes the rule.  \nbut what im pointing at is the way Scorsese keeps that rule alive throughout the entire film, basically letting us watch a movie that feels codirected by jordans own delusions. Thats why the excess feels so shiny, why the darkness feels blunted, and why the whole thing plays like one long, unreliable flashback.",

I have never in my life cried as much as I did for a movie until I watched BBM. whenever I think of how Ennis and Jack never truely had each other I get teary eyed and think of possible other universes where they are happy together and accepted. Jake Gyhlenhall's performance in the movie is fantastic but Heath Ledger was truly the best part of the movie for me. the way he portrayed his emotions felt so real to me. \nI have never felt so empty and broken after watching a movie. \nfor years, I always dismissed this movie as just a movie about gay cowboys because growing up, thats all I was really told about the movie. \nI was not prepared for how this movie would make me feel afterwards. \nfor the people who dismiss this movie or hate this movie because the characters are gay, please I beg you watch this movie with an open mind. I promise you will find something about it you love. \n",

        "content": "Just curious, we have all seen a lot of discussions about movies that are more enjoyable when you go in blind. I\u2019m a big believer in going in blind, I love to be surprised. But are there any films you can think of where some foreknowledge has actually benefitted your experience? Maybe the obvious type of example is a historical drama where it helps to know who is who. What do you think?",

They do this in order to appease a supposed god to bring a bountiful harvest. It\u2019s basically lord of the flies mixed with the wicker man. \n\nThe adult couple in the course of one day are able to dispatch the cult of somewhere between 30-50 children. \n\nIf instead of it being two random civilian adults, if John Rambo had come into the town, how quickly would he have defeated them? Keep in mind, these children (ages ranging from 8-18) have no formal combat training. But they do have home field advantage and they have the numbers (at least a couple dozen of them vs 1 man). \n\nMy prediction, instead of taking a full day, John Rambo defeats them in less than 2 hours.",
