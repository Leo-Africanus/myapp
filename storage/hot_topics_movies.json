In the historical drama released earlier this month, Cynthia Erivo plays the legendary abolitionist \u2014 but one Hollywood executive initially thought the role should go to Julia Roberts. \n\n&gt; Gregory Allen Howard, the screenwriter and producer of \"Harriet,\" recently revealed in multiple interviews that Roberts was suggested to play the lead role during a meeting with a studio president in 1994. \n\n&gt; \"The climate in Hollywood\u2026 was very different back then,\" Howard said. \"I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, 'This script is fantastic. Let's get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.'\"\n\n&gt; Howard said that a black person in the meeting said casting Roberts would be impossible because she is white. \n\n&gt; \"That was so long ago. No one will know that,\" the executive replied, according to Howard.",

Personally Gravity in IMAX 3D was still my favourite ever cinema experience and Clash/Wrath of the Titans just looked very colourless and ugly in post converted 3D! )\n\nSo yeah, was there a hard reason the whole phenomenon just stopped seemingly overnight or did I just misremember?",

Despite how serious this part can be its also really funny with some great stories.  \nHis time with Sid Caesar, writing Get smart etc are covered and of course him and Carl reiner foray into comedy albums.  \nOnce we get to The Producers, he spends a few chapters covering Producers, 12 chairs, blazing saddles, young Frankenstein and Hugh anxiety.  \nOnce he gets to HOTW Part 1 the chapters get a bit shorter, Spaceballs and later only get a chapter, sometimes  few pages though.  \nThere's a point where he mentions going thru a divorce, and you realize he never mentioned even being married or having kids up until that point.  \nHe does talk about his late 2nd wife a lot though, Anne Bancroft, good stories,  \nThe last chunk of book covers making the Producers musical and is very interesting and that's coming from somebody who hates musicals.  \nA great book, seek it out.  \nBonus mention: after Anne passed he was at the white house accepting an award and medal when Barack Obama pulled him aside, asked him if he's doing OK since her passing and gave him a hug.",

Burdened, guilty, angry, looking for redemption, haunted by doing the \"right\" thing. And finding it by saving the man who paid him to take a dive, the man he probably hates most.\n\nWe never see the boxing match, though.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is famous for writing genre mash-ups scripts with what would be the \"good\" scenes of two or three movies. So the scene where Ving Rhames delivers a monologue about how \"Pride never helps. it Only hurts?\" to Willis? Good scene: keep that in the movie!\n\nThe actual boxing match? We know what a boxing match looks like: don't need to show it.  \n  \nIt may also have been a matter of expense: Pulp Fiction was not a big-budget movie, and a boxing match means loads of extras and conditioning for Willis to look like a credible pugilist. \n\nAlso, one scene of boxing turns any movie into a \"boxing\" movie, and this was not at heart a boxing movie.\n\nWhat other scenes are critical to the plot but never make it onto the screen?",

Definitely not talking about actual kids. \n\nFor me its that scene in The Road to El Dorado where Chel is with Tulio in a private room, and the camera cuts to outside as Miguel walks in. Chel pops up from near Tulio\u2019s lap, and Tulio looks flustered.\n",

Other Rankin/Bass productions, like The Last Unicorn, might have more popularity, but I think this takes first place.\n\nThe mixing of the real world and magical realms is quite unique and not copied all that much. If you're a Ghibli fan or just into anime generally, this could be a great recommendation for ya. Need more convincing? Just watch Ommadon's speech! Every word out his mouth is coated in delicious villainy. ",

(And again, it has to be different projects, so Jerry Orbach being a cop for hundreds of episodes of Law and Order doesn't count.)\n\nAnother example that came to mind is R. Lee Ermey being cast as military personnel. Any others I'm mising?\n\n\\* Edit: oops typo in the title",

From the very beginning I was invested in the mystery which quickly turned into something much bigger.\n\nI\u2019ve seen hundreds of films in a similar category as this and this one was the easiest to follow. Please watch! I can\u2019t stop gushing about this movie enough. \n\n10/10\n\nAny recommendations with a similar atmosphere are welcome! ",

        "content": "\nFor fans of Hong Kong\u2019s jiangshi (hopping vampire) films of the 1980s and early \u201990s, Rigor Mortis (2013) is, in my view, a horror tour de force, a deeply atmospheric work and perhaps the swan song of the jiangshi genre.\n\nThe film rewards those with at least a working understanding of Mandarin or Cantonese culture, as much of its charm lies in the nuanced exchanges between its cast. It also pays generous tribute to the jiangshi classics of the past, layering easter eggs throughout its narrative and set design. From the talismans used to subdue restless spirits to the Taoist devices for bending the elements, even down to the smallest costume details, the film is steeped in nostalgia. \n\nOne standout example is the warrior costume worn by protagonist Chin Siu-hao, identical to the one he donned as the villain in Tai Chi Master (1993) alongside Jet Li. The attention to detail and reverence for cinematic history are nothing short of remarkable.\n\nThe ensemble cast features many veterans of the jiangshi era, now well past their youthful primes, whose characters, with wry irony, lament their own bygone golden days.\n\nVisually, the cinematography is both haunting and exquisite. Many shots are purposefully desaturated, crafting a muted, elegiac tone that perfectly aligns with director Juno Mak\u2019s vision.\n\nFor viewers less familiar with the genre or the broader landscape of Asian horror, the film may require multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. Some online review have critiqued the story as \u201cincoherent,\u201d but this reaction likely stems from a lack of context regarding its genre roots and cultural touchstones.\n\nIf I were to offer any criticism, it would be towards the third act and the \u201ctwist\u201d ending. That said, I struggle to imagine a more fitting narrative device to tie together the film\u2019s overarching theme.\n\nA haunting love letter to a fading genre and highly recommended.",
