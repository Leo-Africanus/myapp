That\u2019s a dereliction of duty, but it\u2019s one I didn\u2019t commit on purpose. I simply hadn\u2019t bothered to think about it.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):\n\n&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope\n\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):\n\n&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don\u2019t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d might be very, very bad (and by \u201cmight be\u201d I mean \u201calmost objectively is\u201d), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today\u2019s audiences might consider as \u201cgood.\n\n[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):\n\n&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which \"Kraven the Hunter\" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows \"Kraven\" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Crowe\u2019s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there\u2019s not much to like elsewhere\n\n[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):\n\n&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it\u2019s best that this misbegotten series quits while it\u2019s just-barely ahead.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):\n\n&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):\n\n&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.\n\nDirected by J.C. Chandor:\n\n&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.\n\nRelease Date: December 13\n\nCast:\n\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven:\n* Ariana DeBose as Calypso Ezili\n* Fred Hechinger as Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon\n* Alessandro Nivola as Aleksei Sytsevich / Rhino\n* Christopher Abbott as the Foreigner\n* Russell Crowe as Nikolai Kravinoff",

As a healthy teenager with an upper middle class upbringing, my only first hand knowledge of health care system was getting shots, physicals, etc.  Nothing major.\n\nWatching this movie opened my eyes to the horrors of our health care system and has stayed with me all these years.  I know it isn't a great movie by any means but it made an impression on me of a man who would do anything for his child in a system you expect to help him.  Instead you learn how bad the system is and what is forces a man of conviction to do.\n\nAs with the news, I flashed back to this moving thinking of what drives a man to violence when he is trampled by the system.  How doing something crazy is sometimes the sanest option you have left.",

        "title": "The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ",
        "content": "If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.\n \n\nFirst of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. \n\nMost of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.\n \nIt also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. \n\nAnd the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. \n\n\nThe only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. \n\n\nAnyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job. Overall 8/10",

I loved how it was very different from any other zombie media I have seen where the virus was contained only in UK, and eventually basically eradicated. The only thing I dislike is how stupid everyone is, but thats a given for zombie movies. I actually liked 28 week more than 28 days, so Im curious why people hate it so much.",

        "content": "This may be the greatest movie I\u2019ve ever watched. The simplicity is incredibly nostalgic, yet the grandeur of the journey as a whole creates an incredible experience. The characters are layered and flawed, and these flaws are displayed wonderfully through the interactions and decisions made over the course of the movie. This movie made me feel like none other. I\u2019m 17 going on 18 in a few months, childhood is nearly gone, and I would do anything to go back. This movie confronted me with the challenging reality that I will never have experiences like that again. While I do cherish those memories deeper for it, I can\u2019t help but feel sad about how infinitely out of reach those experiences are from me.",

So thats Alien Checkboxed. We got a sequel to Bladerunner (1982) with Bladerunner 2049. Though he was a producer on that. Now we have a sequel to his Gladiator movie which came out in 2000. \n\nI'm surprised he hasn't had a itch to remake or continue Legend (1985) Since it was his forth movie he did. \n\n\nOr is this just wishful thinking on my part?\n\n:Fixed error ",
