        "content": "Occurred to me the other night when my wife and I were talking about the first album we ever bought as kids. I laughingly admitted mine were Kriss Kross and Ace of Base. She had a good laugh, and tried to remember the lyrics to \"Jump Jump.\" I tried to remind her by bringing it up on Spotify and she emphatically stopped me (No! Please no! I don't need that song stuck in my head all week!). So I joked I was going to secretly make it her alarm clock music. It then reminded of the gag from Groundhog day and got me thinking that \"Jump Jump\" would actually be an older song to someone now than \"I Got You Babe\" was to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. And then it reminded me of the cruel march of time... But I digress...\n\nIf Groundhog Day were remade today (please don't Mr Hollywood producer person), what song would our protagonist be waking up to every morning?\n\nEdit Edit: Lotsa folks getting hung up on the exact year difference. Can't change it now, but I didn't mean to sound like it had to be from *exactly* 1997, just that that was the rough era we were talking about. Any similarly old song is fair game.\n\nEdit: Some of my favorites listed so far:\n\nSpice Girls - Wannabe. Just opening every day with \"Yoooooo I'll tell ya what I want!\" would be hilarious\n\nSmash Mouth - All Star. Ditto: \"SOoooommmeBODY Once told me...\"\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Today. How poetic\n\nChumbawumba - Tubthumping\n\nLen - Steal My Sunshine\n\nWho Let The Dogs Out\n\nBittersweet Symphony\n\nGreen Day - Basketcase\n\nSheryl Crow - Every Day Is A Winding Road\n\nBare Naked Ladies - One Week. Starting every day with \"YIIIIITsss beeeen ONE WEEK!\"\n\nCher - Believe. Nice reference to the original.\n\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go One. Fits the sappiness and relevance of I Got You Babe.\n\n4 Non Blondes - What's Up.\n\nCardigans - Love Fool\n\nRembrants - I'll Be There For You.\n\nOasis - Wonderwall.\n\nThird Eye Blind - Jumper or Semi Charmed Life\n\nProclaimers - 500 Miles. \"When I wake up... Yeah I know I'm gonna be...\" Even a bit of a love song to boot. \n\nWhitney Houston version of I Will Always Love You. Imagine waking up every morning to AAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDDD IIIIIIIII eIIIIIIIIIIIII",

I won't even look at the title before playing. Mostly mediocre films, Madame Webb being an exception in that it was absolutely horrible. \n\nPride and Prejudice being the exception in that it was phenomal. I'm a 25 year old male, I don't like romantic films, at least I don't think I did. I was apprehensive about watching it because when the title card came up and I seen what it was, I had heard it was a love story and just assumed it would be stereotypical. Glad I stuck with it. It doesn't force any stereotypes, it let's you sit with the characters and see the tension build up through their dialogue and physical body language. The scene where Elizabeth is looking at Mr D'Arcys statue after finding out he paid for the weddings is where I think we see her fall in love. I watched Cold Mountain yesterday and the romance in that was nowhere near the standard here, felt very forced and sudden. The only other romance film I've enjoyed as much, in fact I enjoyed a little more, was A Portrait of A Lady on Fire. They're both very similar and maybe that's the type of romantic film I need to lean into. Both I went in thinking \"ugh, another romance film, do I even want to watch it?\" Well, yes, I do. \n\nAnyone else who is put of by the idea of these films, just give them a try, they are truly remarkable.",

I actually think Collateral is one of his better work where he almost disappears into his character, but the performance is still relatively uneven throughout the movie. I\u2019d watched Zodiac as well and I can\u2019t remember him at all.

        "title": "Movies that portrayed a reality that was reflective of the time, but now seem unbelievable",
        "content": "As the saying goes, the past is a foreign country, and as such movies from the past can also seem like a foreign country. Movies usually try to reflect the reality of the time they're made in, but something that seemed normal in the past can seem unbelievable to modern audiences even if they're aware of the historical context.\n\nFor example, I recently rewatched White Christmas, and the song [\"What can you do with a General\"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0rRe9gmFC4&amp;list=RDD0rRe9gmFC4&amp;start_radio=1) and the whole plot point about the retired general always seemed strange to me. The premise is that normal soldiers returning from WWII had better employment prospects than retired generals, with the general now running a failing inn while all of his former subordinates are doing very well. In modern times, this seems completely alien. Nowadays enlisted persons have a much harder time finding a decent job or even any job at all after their military service, especially if they lack a proper education/useful transferable skills or they have health problems, while high-ranking officers have a very easy time getting a good job thanks to their education and connections. I am frankly not even sure if the whole thing about retired WWII generals having a hard time finding a job was true, but it is definitely true that WWII veterans had a much easier time after their service than soldiers in later wars.\n\nAnd on that note, pretty much any old movie where a father with his own income in a job that isn't even that prestigious can provide for a whole family with a nice house that he owns. This is now a fantasy to anyone thinking of starting a family.\n\nSo what other then contemporary historical realities depicted in movies seem strange now?",

        "title": "December 26-28 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' crosses $760M worldwide on its second weekend. 'Marty Supreme' opens with a great $27M on its first four days, A24's second best ever debut. 'Anaconda' and 'Song Sung Blue' open solidly with $23.6M and $12.4M, respectively.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wygzklyid6ag1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b048a1a740aec7190835df598197ffeee82c7a\n\n2025 came to an end with a very lucrative post-Christmas weekend.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** easily held the top spot for a second weekend, while holdovers had a very strong weekend. The biggest newcomer was A24's ***Marty Supreme***, which over-performed projections and posted the studio's second biggest ever debut. ***Anaconda*** and ***Song Sung Blue*** followed suit, as both had solid debuts as well.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $170.6 million this weekend. That's up 7.1% from last year, when ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** repeated at #1.\n\nEasily holding on to #1, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added $64 million this weekend. That represents a very light 28.2% drop, which is better than ***The Way of Water*** (52.8%). But that's not a great comp; ***The Way of Water*** didn't have Christmas Day till its second Sunday, while ***Fire and Ash*** is already in the post-Christmas slot.\n\nThrough 10 days, ***Fire and Ash*** has cleared $217.6 million domestically. It's currently $44 million behind ***The Way of Water*** through the same point. Given that that film was barely starting its Christmas run, that gap will continue to widen. For instance, its third weekend was slightly higher than its second weekend, and it's unlikely ***Fire and Ash*** can replicate that. Right now, ***Fire and Ash*** should reach $500 million domestically.\n\nOf all holdovers, ***Zootopia 2*** benefitted the most. It jumped 34.7% for a $20 million weekend. That's higher than ***Moana 2***'s fifth weekend jump. The film has amassed $321 million, and it could surpass the original's domestic gross as early as next week.\n\nA24's ***Marty Supreme*** expanded to 2,668 theaters and grossed a great $17.7 million ($27 million four-day). This is A24's second biggest ever debut, behind ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million). The debut is also higher than Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's previous Christmas title, ***A Complete Unknown*** ($11.6 million).\n\nConsidering this is A24's most expensive title ($60-$70 million), this is a pretty great start. There was the challenge of winning over audiences with a ping-pong sports drama; sports films are often successful, but there aren't many ping-pong films. What helped is that A24 did a fantastic job with marketing, selling the film as more than just a sports film, instead showcasing it as a \"quest to be the greatest to ever exist.\"\n\nBut the real credit has to be Chalamet. A very popular star, this was his biggest gamble so far. ***Dune*** and ***Wonka*** were IP films, and ***A Complete Unknown*** was a Bob Dylan biopic. ***Marty Supreme*** is a completely original film, sold entirely on him. And as you can see, it worked; 50% of the audience reportedly watched the film because of Chalamet. The cherry on top was the universal acclaim it garnered: 95% on RT, and 88 on Metacritic are some of the year's best reviews.\n\nAccording to A24, 57% of the audience was male, and 63% was 25 and over. Highly popular with Gen Z: 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is fine for an adult drama. It's A24's second best grade. With huge Oscar buzz on the horizon and with a weak January ahead, ***Marty Supreme*** should enjoy some great legs. Don't be surprised if it can reach $80 million domestically. If it gets there, it'll become A24's highest grossing film.\n\n***The Housemaid*** dipped just 19% on its second weekend, earning $15.4 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $46.4 million, and there's a strong possibility that it could reach $100 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, Sony's ***Anaconda*** debuted with $14.5 million ($23.6 million four-day) in 3,509 theaters. This is below the 1997 film's debut ($16.6 million) and slightly ahead of ***The Hunt for the Blood Orchid*** ($12.6 million). Adjusted for inflation, the new version sold less tickets than either film.\n\nGiven its low $45 million budget, this is a very good debut. Especially given the film's bizarre premise: two friends who grew up with the original ***Anaconda*** and proceeding to reboot it, only to be chased by a real anaconda. It's one thing to reboot a horror film, but it's very different to retool it as a comedy (even if the original 1997 is a hilarious film by itself). \n\nTo give it a chance to succeed, Sony gave it the prime Christmas date, and got two comedy names in Jack Black and Paul Rudd to lead the film. Turns out all audiences needed was \"Jack Black and Paul Rudd getting chased by a large snake.\" Reviews were mixed (51% on RT), but those were actually the best in the franchise. By this point, you pretty much know what you're gonna get with this. I mean, the trailer used Sir Mix-A-Lot's chorus to \"Baby Got Back\".\n\nAccording to Sony, 53% of the audience was male. They gave it a \"B\" on CinemaScore, a so-so grade for a comedy, but better than the original's \"B\u2013\". It should hold well over the coming weeks; right now, ***Anaconda*** should reach $70 million domestically. Not a bad performance for a horror comedy.\n\nAngel Studios' ***David*** dipped 42.5%, adding $12.5 million. That's quite a rough drop, considering the great word of mouth and Christmas corridor. But it seems like the film's audience was more limited than anticipated. Through 10 days, it has made $49.5 million, and it looks like it will finish with a little below $100 million.\n\nIn seventh place, ***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** eased 28.3%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. Through 10 days, it has amassed $38.1 million, and will probably end its run with a little above $70 million domestically.\n\nIn eighth place, Focus Features' ***Song Sung Blue*** debuted with $7.6 million ($12 million four-day) in 2,578 theaters. The debut is below last year's other music drama ***A Complete Unknown***, although that had a more iconic figure than in ***Song Sung Blue***.\n\nIt's hard to ask for much better numbers. The film's selling point is Neil Diamond's music, but it's not a Diamond biopic. Instead, it follows Mike and Claire Sardina, who performed as the Neil Diamond tribute band Lightning &amp; Thunder. Getting known names like Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson is a plus, but it's still a limited audience. At the very least, the positive reviews (75% on RT) helped attract audiences over the past days.\n\nAccording to Focus Features, 61% of the audience was female, and a massive 94% was 25 and over. It skewed old, with 48% of the audience 55 and over. They gave it a great \"A\" on CinemaScore, suggesting strong word of mouth. Right now, look for ***Song Sung Blue*** to finish with around $35 million.\n\nAfter its very weak drops, ***Wicked: For Good*** got some help from the holidays. It jumped 8.2% for a $5.2 million weekend. That takes its domestic total to $331.6 million.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** with $4.4 million. It dipped 42.5%, tying for the steepest drop in the Top 10, indicating that it won't benefit much from the holidays. The film's domestic total stands at $118.9 million, and it looks like the film will tap out with less than $130 million.\n\nNeon released Park Chan-wook's new film ***No Other Choice*** on Christmas Day in 13 theaters. It earned $312,687 ($625,656 four-day), which translates to a solid $24,053 per-theater average. With some awards buzz and critical acclaim on its side, the film will continue expanding in the next few weeks.\n\nSearchlight expanded Bradley Cooper's ***Is This Thing On?*** to 33 theaters, earning $203,000. It will continue playing in limited release before a wide expansion in mid January.\n\nSpeaking of Searchlight, they also launched the buzzy title ***The Testament of Ann Lee*** in 4 theaters. It earned a modest $71,000 ($111,000 four-day), which is a middling $17,750 per-theater average. The film will continue expanding, but given its poor performance in many awards circles (and also missing practically all of the announced Oscar shortlist categories), it seems like it will struggle to reach audiences.\n\nMUBI also released Jim Jarmusch's new film ***Father Mother Sister Brother*** in 4 theaters, earning $48,395 ($94,971 five-day) for a weak $12,099 per-theater average.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added a strong $181.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $760.4 million after two weeks. It could reach the billion mark as early as next week. The best markets are China ($99.6M), France ($54.4M), Germany ($43.1M), Korea ($32.1M) and the UK ($27.7M). Based on its holds, it should reach $1.7 billion by the end of its run.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** is not done with its run. It added $67.9 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $1.420 billion. There's two big stories here: it broke the $1 billion mark overseas, the first Hollywood title to break it this year. But perhaps the most insane record: in China (where it has earned a colossal $561 million), the film crossed 100 million tickets. It's the first Hollywood title to reach 100 million tickets in a single country since ***Titanic***. The best markets are China ($561.1M), France ($55.9M), Japan ($52.2M), Korea ($49.1M) and Germany ($34M). Given that it still has a lot of gas left, this might reach $1.7 billion worldwide.\n\n***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** began its international run with a good $22.1 million, taking its worldwide total to $60.2 million. Its best debuts were in the UK ($3.9M), Mexico ($2.7M), Germany ($2.6M), France ($1.8M) and Israel ($1.7M). Given that it still has some markets left and very little competition, this film should be set for a solid run through January.\n\n***Anaconda*** debuted with $20 million overseas, for a $43.6 million worldwide debut. Its best debuts were in Australia ($2.4M), Mexico ($2.1M), the UK ($1.7M), Germany ($1.2M) and Brazil ($1M). This is easily hitting $100 million worldwide, and could get to up to $170 million.\n\n***The Housemaid*** also started its international run with a pretty good $18.5 million, taking its worldwide total to $64.9 million.\n\nWith $4.3 million overseas, ***Wicked: For Good*** has finally crossed $500 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**ANNOUNCEMENT**\n\nThis was posted earlier than usual because Actuals could be delayed due to the holidays. Even then, the difference is very minimal. Next week, it'll return to the usual Weekend Actuals.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Snyder is talented... but it's very domain based talent and storytelling/taste are not his strengths. So him seeing himself as an epic auteur hasn't worked out well.\n\nAs a pulp stylist he really delivered - with strong and exploitative material that played to his strengths - in Dawn of the Dead and 300 where I think most directors would flounder. And nothing about his narrative and thematic flounders of the past 16 years suggest he's lost *this* aspect of his flair - he's still an incredible stylist.\n\nHe's a 21st century Frank Fazetta - but in time. He's also about as much of a storyteller. If he embraces that rather than trying to deconstruct and reconstruct epics with full creative control, he could turn into one of the all time great pulp directors. Like, if he had directed PRIMITIVE WAR, that would have been rad. Or imagine a Zack Snyder COCAINE BEAR. Or VFW. They'd be unreal.\n\nI think this is why he's so divisive - his fans cannot see why people don't get no other director can deliver in the ways he can on an unimaginably large scale (Nolan and Cameron, as directors, also see and are in awe of this talent), and his detractors cannot get past his appalling instincts with story and theme while tackling thematically and narratively ambitious material.\n\nIf Snyder spent the rest of his career doing stuff like Joe Carnahan scripts instead of trying to become the next Lucas/Nolan, he would absolutely kill it. Cheap high concept exploitation Snyder would carve out an unimpeachable niche all of his own.",
