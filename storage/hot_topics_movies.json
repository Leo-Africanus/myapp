Personally, I found it perfect, and here\u2019s why.\n\nThe finale shows that even in the most extreme scenario, where everything the two abductors believed turned out to be true, their lives would still be failures. All the conspiracy theories, all the paranoia, all the supposed \u201cawakening,\u201d none of it changes the fact that they wasted their lives, stagnated and underachieved.\n\nI think that\u2019s a powerful message. It enables the movie to be a subtle dissentive against spending your life spiraling down conspiracy rabbit holes and using \u201csecret truths\u201d as a substitute for actual living. Even if the world really were the way they imagined, it wouldn\u2019t make them any less miserable or unsuccessful.\n\nIn that sense, Bugonia lands the same kind of emotional blow as Requiem for a Dream or Trainspotting.

Films like **Blade Runner** or **The Thing were criticized** or ignored on release, but today yet they\u2019re seen as genre defining. Even **Eyes Wide Shut** and **Jennifer\u2019s Body** feel more appreciated now than when they premiered.\n\nTime gives certain movies room to breathe. Cultural context shifts and what once felt OFF suddenly makes a sense. It makes me wonder how many films we write off too quickly just because they don\u2019t fit the moment they arrive in.\n\nWhich movie you think history was kinder to than its original audience?",

        "content": "It has been 18 years since Heath Ledger died. For a lot of people, he is forever tied to the Joker, a performance that reshaped how comic book villains are taken seriously and still gets debated today and sets Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" against many contemporary superhero films for its compelling characters and more grounded approach.\n\nBut his career was way more than that. From *Brokeback Mountain* to *Monster\u2019s Ball* to *A Knight\u2019s Tale* to *I\u2019m Not There*, he kept taking risks and actively pushed against being boxed in as a pretty leading man.\n\nI am curious how people here view him with distance.\n\nWas Joker peak, or just his most notorious moment?\n\nWhere do you think he'd be today career-wise had he lived?\n\nWhich performances do you think are underrated or overlooked?\n\nFeels worth revisiting how rare it is to see that level of commitment and range, especially now when franchise roles dominate so much of the industry.\n\nTo me, he was a one-of-a-kind generational actor and I'll always wonder what could have been.",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t read a single good review about this movie, mostly just people criticising it and I know my opinion is disagreeable but I really enjoyed it, especially the ending. Let me explain my perspective.\n\nHowe is obsessed with a walrus that once saved his life and decides that walruses represent purity and superiority to mankind. He wants to recreate it, but in reality he just wants control. It is especially disturbing because people in real life often dress up cruelty with \u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019 like Howe did. We are all dangerous because we do cruel actions and think that it has a purpose.\n\nWallace stays a walrus because I think he\u2019s already been erased and destroyed: he can\u2019t speak or rejoin society. He\u2019s become a thing instead of a man. Putting him in a zoo basically says: \u2018we don\u2019t know what to do with someone this broken\u2019. This points out how society chooses to ignore people who have been changed by trauma. \n\nHe cried at the end and this the most confusing and deep part. It shows that despite how our traumas change us and make us unrecognisable, we are still ourselves inside with our emotions and perhaps he chooses to stay a walrus because he realises he is lost and that resembles how people choose to stick to their identities of trauma even though it makes them miserable. \n\nOf course the whole movie was medically inaccurate and ridiculous, but I really really enjoyed it! I hope I\u2019m not like an English teacher over analysing everything \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d but it\u2019s really my true opinion and takeaway of the movie!!\n\n ",
