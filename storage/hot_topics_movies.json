        "content": "Like many fans of the horror genre, I\u2019m constantly searching for that great \u201cscare\u201d. For me, it\u2019s almost never going to come from the excessive use of production elements or tropes that simply remind you that you\u2019re watching a movie. Excessive use of sound effects that telegraph what you\u2019re meant to be scared of, unrealistic sound design (stabbing a human body doesn\u2019t sound like stepping on a bag of grapes), saturating you with jump scares every five minutes, overly polished production design.\n\nEvery now and then there are movies that demonstrate restraint, with a director that realises for example, that a figure that simply emerges in the background and is seen to the audience but not the main character can chill you to the bone, and doesn\u2019t need to be telegraphed with stock sound design that we\u2019ve heard hundreds of times before. That silence can add to the terror and keep you inside the world that\u2019s been created. That tension and dread is better than the incessant release of a jump scares. Take Alien or Paranormal activity for example (there\u2019s plenty of others). These classics exercised exactly this type of restraint. Please horror directors, invest in the subtleties of your art form and  create more great horror!",

        "content": "For me it was CODA (2021). I had seen every Best Picture nominee following up the awards night. CODA was the last on my list because I had seen people say it\u2019s \u201ca glorified tv movie. Too safe. Etc. Etc.\u201d When I started CODA, I thought \u201cIt\u2019s good, but predictable. Troy Kotsur deserves the Oscar..\u201d I was still leaning towards Licorice Pizza being the best film of that year I had seen.\n\nBut the movie did something. It began to grow on me. I became highly invested in the scene with the young woman and her deaf parents individually. But the scene with her father Frank (Troy Kotsur) places his hands on his daughter\u2019s neck to feel the vibration of her vocal cords as she sings to him. Completely had me hook, line, and sinker. I felt every moment in this film led to this powerful scene. I began to cry. Moved me so much.\n\nWith a sure certainty I remember saying to my Momma. \u201cI just watched CODA. It\u2019s going to win Best Picture tomorrow. Mark my words.\u201d Then I asked her to watch it with me. She agreed.\n\nI know I\u2019ll catch a lot of flack for that, but I own up to it. I love this film. Sometimes something sweet and simple can hit us harder than we imagine. I love this movie.",
