And that is a solid commitment for a casual watcher to make.\n\n\nWhat I liked: \n\nAfter minute 55, the movie is friggin rivetting. I didnt want to stop it to get up to pee. \n\nThe acting is excellent. And I mean excellent. There was one point where I teared up a little. And another where I chuckled along with the characters just because it was just a good moment. The character building and relationship building is top notch.\n\nEven the small characters do well. If you dont watch westerns you forget that &gt;!anyone can die. and goodamn it characters drop like flies in this film.!&lt;  And that really sells a story to me.\n\nRussel Crowe. You forget how good of an actor he is.\n\nMusings: \n\n\nI fell asleep watching this movie back when it came out and I just kinda forgot about it. I've heard many people say its a good movie so its been on my list for a long time. Just took me around 18 years to get around to watching it. Oddly enough, I fell asleep watching it this time too. So I watched the rest of the movie today. And I'm happy to have watched it. I'm already excited to watch it again. \n\nThe good part is things makes sense at the end. There were a few things that bothered me after I watched it so I read up the reddit posts about the movie and that cleared it up for me. I watched the scenes redditors talked about and I found that, yeah, it all adds up. In a convincing way. \n\nIf you liked this movie, I will recommend you watch Appaloosa, if you havent already.",

It has certain \"cartoonishly macabre\" tone to it and \"the snobbish high society is dumb\" social commentary, both of which are pretty typical in Burton's movies. It helps that the movie to this day stands-out from the rest of Zemeckis' filmography, which is more known for fun adventures and grounded dramas, so it never comes to my mind first, when thinking about his movies.",

        "content": "One of my favorite films is \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d and I\u2019m beginning to believe that there\u2019s an alternate take on this film that isn\u2019t often spoken about.\n\nThe town of Bedford Falls and its people would have been just fine without the existence of George Bailey.\n\nI know that contradicts what Clarence the angel shows us, but I ask you to consider the following:\n\n1. Harry Bailey never falls through the ice and never dies.\n\nWe see George as a kid, and he is overly confident (as we see when telling Mary about all the skyscrapers he\u2019ll build and the four wives he\u2019ll have) and no doubt he is a leader among his peers.\n\nSo\u2026why was Harry even sledding on the ice in the first place?  I posit that it was George and his friends who decided on that activity, and Harry simply tagged along for the ride.  Furthermore, it was probably George himself who insisted on being near the thin ice as he is overly confident in himself.\n\nSo if George doesn\u2019t exist, Harry never even goes there.  He\u2019s either chillin\u2019 with mom or as an only child, learned to find his own friends.  And if he did go, didn\u2019t have a daring, adventurous leader like George Bailey and probably played somewhere safer.\n\n2. Mr. Gower never poisons anyone because he hires a pharmacy assistant who knows how to get to work on time.\n\nPeople think that Mr. Gower almost poisoned a customer because of the distraught state he was in as a result of his son dying.  \n\nI call bologna.\n\nPeople forget that when George shows up for work that day, Mr. Gower is pissed and calls him out \u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Gower had to rush around and open the store all by himself and tend to customers and fill prescriptions all while dealing with the death of his son.\n\nHad Mr. Gower simply hired an employee who showed up to work on time, then he wouldn\u2019t have been rushed and would\u2019ve poisoned no one.\n\n3. Peter Bailey lives many more years as a result of his son, George, not existing.\n\nThe very last conversation between Peter Bailey and his ungrateful son is excruciating to watch.\n\nPeter sheepishly asks George if he would consider staying on at the Building and Loan.  Peter knows he shouldn\u2019t ask but probably also wants help contending with the likes of Potter.\n\nNot only does George say no, which is fine by itself, but then goes on to berate the profession that his stand up father has done his entire life.  Sure, he apologizes after, but the damage has been done.\n\nA mere few hours after this Peter would have a heart attack and pass away.  Coincidence?  I think not.\n\nI think Peter would have lived had he and his profession not been badmouthed by a loved one as a response to simply asking for help.  Imagine the stress of having to deal with Potter and his schemes, and then you finally come up with the courage to ask a loved one to fight the good fight, and they say \u201cNah that sounds like it would suck.\u201d\n\nThe fight left Peter Bailey that day, and the reason was his son George.\n\nWithout George around, Peter himself lives on and continues the fight against Potter.  When the run on the bank happens, Peter and Irene simply use their savings just as George and Mary did.  And Peter/Irene would have a lot of extra money considering they didn\u2019t have to pay for George\u2019s entire existence.\n\n4. Ernie would\u2019ve never found out his wife was only in it for the money.\n\nSure, one saving grace of George Bailey is that he created Bailey Park to help the good folk of Bedford Falls avoid Potter\u2019s slums.  But what happens when you examine the details here?\n\nOne such person who \u201cbenefited\u201d from Bailey Park was George\u2019s pal Ernie and his wife and kid.  However, in the Pottersville timeline, we learn that Ernie\u2019s wife ran away with the kid because Ernie was too poor.\n\nI\u2019m actually sad for Ernie, that by the end of the film, he\u2019ll never know that the woman he loves would have dropped him had he not been able to afford a house.\n\n5. Mr. Welch wouldn\u2019t be banned from the local bar.\n\nGeorge says some rather hateful things to his children\u2019s school teacher, Mrs. Welch.\n\nLater on, Mr. Welch rightfully stands up for his wife and pops George in the mouth.  He is then forever banned from his local bar.\n\nIf George doesn\u2019t exist, then a good teacher doesn\u2019t get savagely insulted on Christmas Eve and her husband is still allowed to drink at the establishment he prefers.\n\n6. Mary Hatch would not have been an old maid.\n\nI maintain that Mary had a somewhat unhealthy obsession with George starting at a very young age.\n\nTo the point of calling her fellow 10 year old classmate a whore for liking the same boy, rudely flaking on a date with her suitor Freddie MID DATE to go out with George instead, and later, she would attempt to make George jealous by being overly enthused with Sam Wainwright on the phone.  I\u2019d say that wasn\u2019t fair to Sam\u2019s feelings but he already knows Mary\u2019s game which is why he has a side fling of his own.\n\nI believe that if George hadn\u2019t existed, then Mary wouldn\u2019t have been so narrow focused on one man her entire life and could\u2019ve made it work with Sam.  Sam knew that Mary was obsessed (as anyone with eyes knew if they saw Mary looking at him) and that\u2019s why he played around on her, but otherwise we see that Sam is a pretty smart and good guy.  He\u2019s able to create a booming business and we know his character is good by his donation of $25,000 at the end of the film.\n\nAnd even if Mary never marries, there\u2019s literally nothing wrong with a life devoted to the library of all things.  The library is a wonderful public service and I\u2019d say a life devoted to that is a life well lived.\n\n7. The town would have come to the aid of Peter Bailey just as they did George had a similar circumstance arisen like Uncle Billy giving Potter $8,000.  In fact, that situation would have never happened under Peter\u2019s tenure.  Unlike his son George who likes to sled too close to the thin ice, Peter is responsible and would\u2019ve known to never let that drunkard Billy handle all that cash.\n\nAbout the only thing George was good for was a housing development that should\u2019ve been a cemetery, and now because George Bailey exists the town has no place to bury their loved ones when they die.\n\nI hear no bell.",

        "title": "Interesting dialogue or plot changes made in localizations for foreign languages",
        "content": "We often talk about localization of movies in foreign markets when it comes to weird title changes, but that's only the most visible form of localization when translating movies to other languages. The whole point of localization isn't to just translate everything, it's to make the product understandable, non-controversial, and entertaining to foreign cultures, which doesn't always work with a purely faithful translation, so changes are often made to the dialogue and plot.\n\nFor example, in Inside Out Riley doesn't like broccoli, a common trope with Western children, but in Japan this was changed to bell peppers, which is a more common disliked food trope in Japan. They even changed the animation for those particular scenes.\n\nA common one we often hear about is when a movie has gay characters. Foreign markets will often change the dialogue where it is stated that a character is gay, and if there's a scene of them kissing someone of the same gender they'll just cut it out. \n\nBut one of the most infamous localization changes was what happened to the Castilian dub of the movie Mogambo. In the film, Grace Kelly and Clark Gable are in an adulterous relationship, which was a big no-no to the Catholic censors of the time. To rectify this sinful plot, the married couple were instead changed to being siblings, thus Grace Kelly was free to be in a relationship with Clark Gable. The problem was that they didn't cut the scenes where Grace Kelly kisses her \"brother\" and is quite close to him, so they accidentally replaced adultery with heavily implied incest.\n\nSo what are some other interesting localization changes?",

I'm sure theres nothing quite the same, but if anything comes to mind that matches this style that I could enjoy as an adult, I'd love to hear it. \n\n",

        "content": "Weird way to make a movie. My wife and I enjoyed the ride, it's at least fun and riveting to watch and figure out what it's leading up to\n\nThe movie has some issues in my opinion, and obviously the whole Shutter Island plot is obvious from the get-go basically as soon as you know he's both a recovering alcoholic after having driven drunk.\n\nMy maim things are\n- What's actually real? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Were the police real people involved in the investigation, or did they just happen to be there when he was leaving? They were too agreeable to not be Shutter Island-esque plants. But prior to that it doesn't seem like the hospital is at all trying to push any investigation. \n\nIt seems like the therapist lady was guiding the investigation, but it was unclear at what point that was the *purpose* of him being there, since finding the bodies didnt seem like an important or relevant point until she showed up. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he lock them in the gas station? How the frick does he steal the cop car? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he actually kill the security, break in and manage to kidnap a guy? And no one stops him?! What??? Did he actually shoot the oxygen tap and blow up the OR and shoot Bruce? Or is that in his imagination?\n\n\n- Why are there so many small seeds they plant that are more of poor misdirects rather than intentional red herrings?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; besides some message of masking trauma and parallels to him losing a wife and child, as well as tying in his alcoholism, how does the previous wife plot have any relevance? Not saying I don't get it, but they could've basicslly.cut that whole thing and it wouldn't make a difference to the main plot.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The LL floor thing is wacky to me. What are the chances that it actually IS the organ donation floor?? I mean, he saw them go down there assuming it was cor a CAT scan and is none the wiser, he finds out at some point that they genuinely harvest organs, AND it's ACTUALLY on the floor he saw them going to? Puh-leeease!!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; How was Peri's scarf in there? He brought it in when he got treated? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If he was coming in being treated for a car crash, why would no one have checked his car out? Looked out the window even? \n\nTons of other things to point at, but these are some of the glaring flaws. \n\nI feel like because of some things they did in thus movie, they missed some good opportunities. In some areas, it's utterly predictable. In others, they do a weird twist that contradicts something established earlier in the plot.\n\nIt would've been better if they didn't show MC having fallen into the pit. The viewer knowing that he has untreated head trauma makes it obvious that everything is in his head. It's been said before, but it would've actually been better if they made him seem delusional to trick him into not realizing it was a REAL evil organ-harvesting hospital.\n\nNonetheless, San Worthington is STELLAR in this movie, and it definitely had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what exactly is going on and what'll happen next.\n\n\n\nHoly frick that was long.",

None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn't phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.\n\n",
