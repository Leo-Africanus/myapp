        "title": "May 2-4 Box Office Recap: 'Thunderbolts*' debuts with a solid $74.3 million domestically and $160.4 million worldwide. Meanwhile, 'Sinners' crosses $200 million worldwide, while 'A Minecraft Movie' nears $900 million worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wngz60kwb1ze1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1eddccb860443e3e769a9c792de4692c33d63c\n\nWell, the summer season is officially underway.\n\nThe MCU returned to the first weekend of May, earning another #1 spot with ***Thunderbolts***. Which hopefully will be a sign of good legs ahead. Meanwhile, ***Sinners*** had another incredible hold, despite losing IMAX and other premium-large formats.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $142.3 million this weekend. That's up a massive 108.2% from last year, when ***The Fall Guy*** flopped and delivered the worst start to the summer season in decades.\n\nDebuting on top, Marvel Studios' ***Thunderbolts*** earned $74.3 million in 4,330 theaters. That's below ***Captain America: Brave New World*** ($88.8 million), which premiered on February. Compared to other MCU titles, that's below ***Ant-Man and The Wasp*** ($75.6 million) and ***Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*** ($75.3 million) and above ***Eternals*** ($71.2 million).\n\nAll in all, this is a solid (but not fantastic) debut. At the end of the day, it's a team-up film following secondary characters that aren't very popular, with the exception of Bucky and Yelena. Marvel probably wasn't expecting this film to open at $100+ million, considering ***Brave New World*** didn't get that with a more well known character. ***Thunderbolts*** only had one hook: the introduction of Sentry. There's also curiosity surrounding the meaning behind the asterisk in the title (we'll get to that in a moment).\n\nMarvel knows that audiences haven't been fully on board with some of their previous projects (***Quantumania***, ***The Marvels***, ***Brave New World***, etc.), but they still hoped the audience could be interested in ***Thunderbolts***. To the point that one of its trailers highlighted the crew's involvement in multiple projects (most of which were A24). Well, the crew's involvement at least resulted in some great reviews (88% on RT). Not to mention the fact that back in March, Marvel confirmed that a lot of cast members from the film would be back in ***Avengers: Doomsday*** next year. While that spoiled the fate of the characters, it might have helped boost interest.\n\nAccording to Disney, 65% of the audience was male. Marvel has had a problem in attracting younger audiences, and this film is another proof of that: only 30% of the audience was under 25. What does this mean? That they're losing ground with Gen Z. This has been noted a few years, and it doesn't look like it will be fixed any time soon.\n\nIn some good news, the audience gave the film an \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore. That represents a solid response from the audience, although the MCU mostly falls in the \"A\" score. At the very least, that's better than ***Brave New World***'s poor \"B\u2013\". There's no competition over the coming weeks, although ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** will probably dethrone it in its third weekend. We'll see how it goes, but for now, a final total around $200 million is likely for ***Thunderbolts***.\n\nMarvel didn't even wait until the second week just to finally confirm on social media the meaning of the asterisk in the title. Just today, they've started promoting the film [under a new title](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/thunderbolts-poster-the-new-avengers-title-change-1236386731/) (big spoilers in that article). That's a bit too early, but will the audience be more interested in the film now?\n\nEven with the arrival of ***Thunderbolts*** and losing IMAX and other formats, ***Sinners*** was not affected in the slightest. The film dipped just 28% this weekend, adding another $33.1 million. That's almost on par with ***Get Out***'s third weekend drop (26.5%), which is simply insane. The film has earned a fantastic $179.8 million domestically, and it should continue legging out. For now, the film should hit $270 million domestically. The fact that it's getting close to $300 million is simply spectacular.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 40%, adding $13.7 million this weekend. One thing on its favor was [the \"rowdy screenings\" for this weekend.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/minecraft-movie-block-party-edition-1236202463/) Have theater employees in your hearts, for this might have been a very ugly experience. The film has earned $398.2 million so far.\n\nWell, the math is out and the numbers aren't good for ***The Accountant 2***. The film earned $9.4 million, which is a very poor 61% drop from last week. In contrast, the original dropped just 44.8%. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $41.1 million, which is $6 million below the original through the same point. That gap will continue to widen. For now, the film should finish with around $60 million domestically.\n\n***Until Dawn*** won't see a sunrise any time soon. The film dropped 52%, adding $3.8 million this weekend. That's not a horrible drop for a horror, but considering how low it began, it's simply unremarkable to make a difference. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.3 million, and it only has one weekend before facing tough competition with ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***.\n\nIn sixth place, ***The Amateur*** dropped 48%, earning $1.9 million. That takes its domestic total to $37 million, and while it should cross $40 million, it won't be by much.\n\n***The King of Kings*** continues losing steam. This weekend, it collapsed another 59%, earning $1.7 million. The film has earned $57.7 million so far, and it won't make it much further than $60 million.\n\nA24's ***Warfare*** dropped 52%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $24 million so far.\n\nIn ninth place, the Indian film ***HIT: The Third Case*** earned $955,000 in 950 theaters.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was another Indian film, ***Guru Nanak Jahaz***. Despite playing in just 119 theaters, it earned $685,000 this weekend.\n\nOutside the Top 10, we find Nicolas Cage's new film, ***The Surfer***. Unsurprisingly, it didn't fare well. It made just $698,114 from 884 theaters. It's not gonna last long on theaters, so hurry up.\n\nA24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** fell outside the Top 10. It collapsed a brutal 76% this weekend, earning just $341,951. The film has earned a meager $2.1 million so far.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Thunderbolts*** also topped the overseas box office, debuting with $86.1 million abroad, for a $160.4 million worldwide debut. That's below ***Brave New World*** ($193.4 million), although that had an extra day on Monday. It was a mixed bag all around; some were pretty good, but others were soft. The best markets were China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M). Some of these markets were also boosted from local holidays (Labor Day). We'll wait for the second weekend to see if it has a chance of recouping its $180 million budget.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** added $26.6 million, taking its worldwide total to $874.6 million. The best markets are the UK ($69M), Germany ($35.7M), Australia ($33.5M), Mexico ($31.2M) and China ($27.5M). It's still fighting to hit the $1 billion milestone.\n\n***Sinners*** is also holding very well overseas, adding $10.4 million, for a $237.3 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($13.8M), France ($6.7M), Australia ($4.3M), Mexico ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.7M). It's obviously going to skew domestically, but it looks like it could get close to $100 million overseas by the end of its run.\n\n***The Accountant 2*** added $7.2 million overseas, for a $66.3 million worldwide total. Ouch, that's not actually great. Or good at all. It should still hit $100 million worldwide, but it feels like it should've done that without problem.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Black Bag* | Mar/7 | Focus Features | $7,607,250 | $21,474,035 | $39,284,035 | $50M\n*The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* | Mar/14 | Ketchup | $3,158,830 | $8,875,344 | $13,896,775 | $15M\n*The Woman in the Yard* | Mar/28 | Universal | $9,395,255 | $22,405,985 | $23,175,286 | $12M\n\n- \"Make a good original movie and people will watch it.\" Yeah, where were you when ***Black Bag*** played in theaters? Steven Soderbergh's film earned critical acclaim, but it has ended its run with just $39 million worldwide. How frustrating, isn't it? A film that deserved much better. Don't cry for Soderbergh tho; he has just recently said that Focus Features confirmed that the film would eventually be profitable thanks to home media and PVOD. He also recently said that his new film ***The Christophers*** has wrapped filming and could come out this year. Damn, 3 Soderbergh films in a year????\n\n- That's all, folks. ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** has closed with $13 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $15 million budget. But maybe Ketchup Entertainment is content with its performance, considering they just spent $50 million in buying ***Coyote vs. Acme***, which will come out next year. Let's just hope it fares better than this.\n\n- Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** has closed its run with just $23 million worldwide. That's the second flop in a row for Blumhouse, after the unremarkable run of ***Wolf Man*** back in January. Not to mention ***Drop*** is fading quickly. What's going with Blumhouse?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nNothing lol. For some reason, studios avoided releasing anything noteworthy. The only major release is Lionsgate's ***Shadow Force***, but that has no chance of hitting #1. Probably not even Top 5.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "I read an interesting piece in The New Yorker by Namwali Serpell, where she points out a growing trend in movies toward excessive literalism, leaving little room for audiences to interpret meaning on their own. Films now seem to patronize viewers by relying on overly explicit metaphors and heavy-handed commentary. For instance, The Substance shows Demi Moore literally giving birth to her younger self through her back. She points out The Brutalist for visualizing its metaphors too explicitly: immigrants' lives being depicted as literally turned upside down and showing the American Dream as something that, \"literally fucks you.\" Did anyone else read it and just curious about thoughts about whether they feel that movies are spelling out symbolism instead of trusting the audience's intelligence.",

But she was never asked back in Top Gun Maverick like she aged a lot and left Hollywood forever. \n\nJennifer Beals who is known for Flashdance 1983 film, she was huge that time but nowadays she has been forgotten. Even now generation wouldn't know Jami Gertz but if you was in the 80s you probably remember her from the lost boys, Sixteen Candles and others but nowadays she retired and she is a million, but I don't think she is well remembered that well as soon as you see her face bow compared to the 80s where you would recognise her well.\n\nWell can you guys think of more 80s celebrities that are completely forgotten as you watch them again and some others you recognise their face, but didn't know their name from a classic 80s film as you searched them up. Well any suggestions about this?",

Not only was he the greatest hitter who ever played the game, he fought in two wars.  There's gotta be a story worth telling somewhere in there.  Plus, we all know how much Hollywood loves a good \"Boston Movie.\"  Just please don't let Ben Affleck play him.\n\nMaybe his life isn't controversial enough for a film?  Maybe there aren't enough movie goers left from age groups that would care enough to go see it?  I know I would, though.\n\nSo who is your choice for someone that never had a biopic made about them, but you think it'd be a pretty good movie if they did?",

        "content": "\n\nThe whole premise is bonkers but so clever it how it serves as a metaphor for how ethnic minorities, black people in this case, are utilized as drones of consumption and how this perpetuates negative stereotypes (e.g. Fried chicken, obsession with hair products, selling drugs, etc.). It shows how to be critical of those consumer goods we're obsessed with. What makes us feel good or \"look cool\" to others isn't necessarily good for us. \n\nI also love the point it made when Fontaine almost gave up and accepted his fate as a mere clone living in a vicious cycle. Even after people figure out the trap, that knowledge alone won't keep you from falling into it again and again. We might be products of our environment and even our genetics, but at the end of the day, we have free will, and it's up to us to break free from the cycle we are stuck in.\n\n\nI myself am Latino (Puerto Rican to be exact) and I feel like many points made in the film apply to my culture as well. In recent years, Puerto Rican culture has become a bit more known internationally, thanks to things like Bad Bunny and the Despacito song. While there is nothing wrong with people being curious of and being entertained by the culture, there is also a concerted effort to perpetuate pretty offensive and harmful stereotypes about my people: From sexual promiscuity thanks to reggaeton music to the idea that we all live in slums next to the beach. And many fellow Puerto Ricans end up internalizing these stereotypes and thinking it makes us \"cool\". \n\nThe film just really spoke to me this way, and feel it even applies to other ethnicities or minority groups. Great film. It was like Us, but actually good. Also had no idea Boyega had such range in acting. He was phenomenal.",
