        "title": "Alice in Wonderland 1915 silent film on Prime Video audio has faint audio track with voices in the background barely audible underneath a lot of white noise...",
        "content": "...just curious if anyone can explain what might be going on; I could barely make out the voices with my laptop volume up to the maximum, but it has the cadence of old-timey American speech from movies in the 30s/40s.  I can mostly hear a man's voice but it seems like there's some conversation taking place with at least two people.  I went to YouTube and played the same fim version on two different channels that didn't have a music track playing, and I could hear some scratchy white noise much more faintly in the background at full volume that has a bit of a speech \"rhythm\" to it if that makes sense, and both youtube videos had the exact same pattern of white noise, but it was different from what I'm hearing on Prime Video.  \n\nI'm just fascinated by this and wondering how/when these voices could have been picked up and added to the film, but I know nothing about the technical aspects of film audio. It seems even more odd given that this is a silent film that was made before speech audio was included in movies, so it seems likely that it somehow happened much later, or maybe it's somehow a glitch with the Prime platform, but really no clue, so if anyone has any ideas that would be helpful--it's these little inexplicable oddities in life that nag my brain lol. (I'm very aware that I probably explained all of this with the wrong terminology but hopefully what I'm asking makes sense; would probably not be worth attempting to answer unless you can hear it for yourself first on Prime Video, the movie is free right now.)",

        "content": "I do understand that it's not considered a really good film (although I personally like it), but as it seems most people think it's trash, which I don't get. Sure, I initially didn't understand how some of the scenes took place, but after reading a bit, I got it and understood the movie better. I like movies that make me think a lot about them afterwards, and Tenet definitely did. The only flaws I found were that the acting was weak in some spots and the dialogue was unnecessarily long sometimes.\n\nSome people say it's nonsensical and devoid of logic, whether internal or otherwise, but I disagree. Of course that the technology doesn't make sense in the real world, but within the movie itself, the inversion process and the scenes concerning it make sense. There may be plot holes that I didn't catch, though.\n\nI might get downvoted to hell, but that's just my opinion. I respect people who believe it's trash, and I want to know why. I'd also like to note that I'm not an expert in films at all and didn't watch many films that are considered great, so that might be part of the reason I don't get it.\n\nEDIT: the movie is rated high in Imdb, RT, Letterboxd, and I was wrong to say \"most people\", but I still do want to understand why some people dislike it.\n\n2ND EDIT: I think I understand the main points for why this film is weak. Firstly, the fact that you have to read about certain scenes to understand them makes it less enjoyable for some people, which is understandable. Secondly, it feels like a movie built around a concept and not the other way around, like if Nolan thought of this inversion technology first and made a movie out of it. Also, most people had issues with the sound mixing.\n\n3RD EDIT: another reason people seem not to like it is that the characters lack depth, and we aren't introduced to them enough to care about them, plus the main character doesnt have a clear personal motivation",

Shannon and his co-counsel, Richard E. Grant, as British lawyer David Maxwell Fyfe, take the courtroom scenes to higher ground, tearing G\u00f6ring down with carefully crafted monologues. \n\n[NextBestPicture - Jason Gorber](https://nextbestpicture.com/nuremberg/) - 7 / 10\n\n&gt;An incredible performance from Russel Crowe. But for all its bold moments of courtroom antics and mind games between monsters and their keepers, this is an almost insultingly pared down version of events from one of the most important legalistic moments in human history. By providing a convenient in within a broader entertainment, the film certainly introduces newer generations to what transpired, but it provides such a simplified view that it may actually do more harm than good.\n\n[Collider - Ross Bonaime](https://collider.com/nuremberg-review-russell-crowe-rami-makek/)\n\n&gt;Quite frankly, it never hurts for a film to preach the dangers of Nazis and how they can be anywhere and everywhere, but it is a bit of a shame Nuremberg isn\u2019t finding a more compelling, enticing way to tell this inherently fascinating true story.",

(Although not clever in the abrasive and cocky Dr House sort of way.)\n\nSome examples that spring to mind for me are:\n\n*Small Things Like These* - a meek man tries to do the right thing against social pressure.\n\n*Conclave* - a similarly timid man tries to uncover corruption during the election of the next pope.\n\n*Twelve Angry Men* - a man uses calm reason to positively guide a jury to the truth.\n\n*Everything Everywhere All At Once* - not the main character but her husband, helps to save the day by being resolutely joyful and silly in the face of life's hardships.",

        "title": "The Sin of Adam &amp; Eve (1969)- Adam makes Eve cry scene. Featuring Mexican actor Jorge Rivero &amp; American actress Candy Wilson- directed by Miguel Zacarias",
        "content": "\u201cThe film, directed by Miguel Zacar\u00edas, retells the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Mexican actor Jorge Rivero played Adam, while newcomer Candice 'Candy' Wilson played Eve. There are no other actors in the film. The movie is largely silent, with the actors gesturing and calling each other's names to communicate. The film has some opening narration, as well as the voice of God saying a few phrases from the heavens.\n\nThe film gained notoriety because Rivero and Wilson appear fully nude throughout most of the film, with occasional glimpses of genitalia, pubic hair and female nipples.\n\nThe film was picked up by Dimension Pictures. Stephanie Rothman and her husband Charles Swartz supervised re editing and dubbing the film for US release\u201d \n\nIt was a Mexican film titled El pecado de Ad\u00e1n y Eva that released in 1969 but later released in the states in 1973.

More people than I'd seen at even new release movie in quite some time. It was amazing seeing it on the big screen. I was only 3 when it released so it was all VHS for me back then. I hope this becomes commonplace, bringing more classics back for people to enjoy together at the movies. ",

        "title": "Do you enjoy movies that end without an ending or have an ambiguous ending?",
        "content": "I just finished a movie that was recently launched on Netflix (after a brief cinema stint). I've seen other movies break down a scene and replay it from different angles/actors etc...and this was effective, I was engaged in the movie. It all is leading up to what should be a climax but... then it just abruptly ends. It makes me feel like it was a super waste of time! \n\nI'm not sure if this types of story telling is on the rise or if I happen to keep randomly selecting movies that end without wrapping the story up but rarely do these movies hit well for me. There are a few ambiguous endings where the viewers is left to come to their own conclusions (Birdman comes to mind as an example), but many just abruptly end and it feels like part of the movie was quite literally cut/ended in error. \n\nI was curious what others felt about these kind of films. Do you have examples of either which were successful or not?",

Im getting back into watching Kung fu/ xiaolin movies after a long while. Recently rewatched the Legend of the Drunken Master movies, Kung Fury, the Ip Mans, and a few others, mainly the Jet Li/Jackie Chan/ Donnie Yen stuff. Hoping to get suggestions of both movies I dont remember and new movies to add to the library. Thanks in advance for the help",

        "content": "So, over the past few days I have watched both Re-Animator and The Substance.\n\nI can't help but notice parallels and wonder if Re-Animator was an influence on The Substance - only partially! Not saying it's the same movie... :D\n\nExample 1: The drug that is injected in both films looks like it's Luminol.\n\nExample 2: The way the camera deals with nakedness - In Re-Animator it is definitely exploitative, whereas in The Substance its expositive - but the similarities are there.\n\nExample 3: Over-the-top practical effects, both used it very well.\n\nI think I'd be pushing it with any more, but I have a feeling there are. Thoughts?\n\nNote: I know which is the better film. Don't think I'll watch Re-Animator again, but I'll definitely be doing The Substance again next year.",

It\u2019s such a fun, compelling adventure film. The Special Effects I feel still hold up,\u00a0and the Big Action Pieces are great to watch. What I also found with this film is that I feels a little more grounded than the sequels, which I feel dial it up but I like 2 and 3, 4 is okay, 5, I just didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe Cast is great. Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Jack Sparrow and I feel he is at his best with the character in the 1st film. In the 1st film, Jack is a master manipulator who excels at improving his strategy when things go sideways and you can never really tell if he is a joke or if he\u2019s serious. He is unpredictable, he is charismatic, He is just fun to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also great as Barbossa and makes for a great villain and his banter with Depp is fun to watch.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are also good as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but I must admit, without Jack Sparrow, their story was a little bland but It didn\u2019t dissuade me, I still love this film.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I just love this film and rewatching it, it is a great adventure film.",
