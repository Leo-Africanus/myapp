I want to know what movies have actually benefited from delays and reshoots? Or what movies have been able to overcome bad press/rewrites/delays and became great films or blockbusters?\n\nThe best example off the top of my head is Jaws (1975) whose shoot was 100 days over shooting schedule and many issues on set, but I don\u2019t believe it was a subjected to bad press, issues like rewrites or reshoots that would be reported on like modern Hollywood releases.",

Anyways\u2026\n\nI just rewatched the movie yesterday and I realized one thing that could add to giving away Verbal/Keysers unreliable narrator story. \n\nIn the beginning of the movie, when we open on Dean lighting his cigarette on the boat, he is the one who flicks his matchbook and ignites the trail of oil. However, when Verbal is recounting the story of seeing Keyser Soze in his interview, the scene depicts Soze flicking his cigarette to ignite the oil trail. \n\nIt\u2019s a small thing that adds to the inconsistencies of Verbals story. \n\nSmall detail but I haven\u2019t heard many people discuss it. What were some other giveaways/inconsistencies in Verbals narration?  \n\nEdit: okay, I apparently watched a TV edit of the movie where they cut Keyser pissing on the fire. Ah well. I thought I was onto something.",

        "content": "*A Los Angeles detective pursues an elusive thief who teams up with an insurance broker for one last heist.*\n\nDirector: Bart Layton\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crime_101_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [70 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/crime-101/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/feb/11/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-barry-keoghan-mark-ruffalo) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;This is a movie that revs the engine entertainingly and loudly, though it is less convincing when it claims the moral high ground of social comment by perfunctorily showing us LA\u2019s homeless. At one stage, Ruffalo\u2019s detective rides on a city bus crowded with the city\u2019s low-net-worth individuals. (What, no Uber?) But overall, it is a highly watchable spectacle, leaving a sizzling streak of rubber on the tarmac.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-halle-berry/)\n\n&gt;That \u201cCrime 101\u201d comes close to greatness and never quite gets there is not a crime. Even if it was, it\u2019d be a misdemeanor. The flaws in \u201cCrime 101\u201d are only somewhat distracting, and they never ruin the experience, they just get in the way a little. The plot can be humdrum, and it often lacks drive, yet the skilled cast and sleek visual style keep our eyes locked on the screen anyway. So what if Bart Layton\u2019s film doesn\u2019t steal our hearts? It\u2019s still getting away with something.\n\n[Financial Times - Jonathan Romney](https://www.ft.com/content/cf17faa2-d92a-4639-a0ac-2501dfc3974d) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;The film is manifestly aware of its ancestors, among them the Michael Mann canon, Walter Hill\u2019s The Driver and the Steve McQueen titles that are prominently namechecked. That\u2019s some calibre; Crime 101 pretty compellingly measures up to it.\n\n[Awards Watch - Jay Ledbetter](https://awardswatch.com/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-brings-the-heat-in-michael-man-influenced-actioner-as-good-as-its-title-is-bad-b/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;Because of its penchant for imitation, it is hard to argue that *Crime 101* will be remembered as some sort of action masterpiece, but its competence and thoughtfulness are not familiar to the last fifteen, or so, years of action cinema. This is a film that touches on a number of important topics, to varying degrees of success, like sexism in the corporate workplace, police corruption, and the lawlessness of the uberwealthy. Add to that a cast that includes bit players the likes of Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tate Donovan, and you have something that far transcends the run-of-the-mill work clogging the pipes of crime cinema in the 2020\u2019s. This is a movie that deserves to be taken seriously. Derivation be damned, *Crime 101* can stand on its own. If only they could do something about that title\u2026\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-mark-ruffalo-1236658899/)\n\n&gt;\u201cCrime 101\u201d includes crime aplenty, but at heart it\u2019s a character study \u2014 or, rather, four character studies wound into one. Based on a novella by Don Winslow (\u201cSavages\u201d), the film is just moody and intricate enough to feel the-Michael-Mann-of-\u201cThief\u201d-adjacent, but it\u2019s really a portrait of lost souls working to keep their heads in a corrupt world. Maybe that\u2019s why \u201cCrime 101\u201d plays like a bit of a head game, in a way that may not do it any favors at the box office. Taken as a thriller, it has its indulgences, but by the end it can stand as an advanced course in what underworld dreams are made of.",

        "content": "How does Breach (2007) not get more play? Peak Laura Linney, peak Chris Cooper, one of the handful of truly great performances from Ryan Philippe. Beautifully dark cinematography, all dim blues and grays. Really decent representation of tech for the era. Condensing and streamlining a true story without feeling like it was just adding drama/cheese. Cooper keeps his layers discrete without losing the deepest ones entirely. Philippe is believable in his cover. The wives are both great. And Laura Linney portrays a human hard-ass inversion of a MPDG that would become a template for women in spy films for the next decade.\n\nIt's not a \\*perfect\\* film, but it deserves to be recognized more often than it is. Great early spring watch while the sun is still going down early.",

Any other movie collections you would recommend? I say collection because I\u2019m talking about film makers, actors/actresses, or movie series. I\u2019ve watched all the lord of the rings, Harry Potter, some Martin Scorsese movies, and probably 90% of Leonardo DiCaprio movies if that helps! I used to be pretty in touch with movies as I worked at a video store about 15 years ago but now I\u2019m wildly indecisive in picking movies so it would be cool to have a bit of a goal! ",

As a book, I'm thinking of Camus' ***L'Etranger*** vs Daoud's ***Meursault Contre-Enqu\u00eate.***\n\nBut in cinema, do you have other examples of such perfectly counterpointed and balanced pair of films ?\n\n  \nEDIT : I just saw this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qqmnfz/movies\\_that\\_are\\_the\\_same\\_but\\_with\\_different/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qqmnfz/movies_that_are_the_same_but_with_different/) and there a lot of good examples, sorry the redundancy.

It's a standard \"retired badass brought out of retirement\" action flick in premise, but the villains aren't a standard one like a drug cartel, illegal weapons dealers, Mafia-type crime family or human traffickers. It's a network of scam/ID theft call centers, which is a pretty big problem now but doesn't really make for typical action flick villains.\n\nThe original The Accountant movie also comes to mind. The villain runs a massive corporation in robotics but he doesn't have any grandiose diabolical plans, he's just trying to cover up white collar fraud in stock manipulation. Again a big deal in the real world in some places but kind of a premise that's not very action packed on its surface.\n\nOther examples?",
