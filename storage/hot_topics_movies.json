It uses a lot of natural lighting and my first thought was that Heat was shot digitally in the same vain as Collateral and Miami Heat. Compare to another 1995 Robert De Niro film, Casino, they look like two totally different movies. My main question is am I imagining Heat looking different? If so what techniques were used? Because scenes like the rooftop moment where robert De Niro shares a moment with the love interest, and Al Pacino\u2019s character going to meet his informant at the junkyard,the water tank scenes, and the shootout, all look almost like they were shot digitally.",

It's such a good movie with one of the best alien encounter story ever. \n\nThe conversation scene at the end had me grinning like a damn fool. The entire sequence near the end is just lovely. \n\nI remember people being upset that Roy abandoned his family but earlier the beings did something to his brain when they gave him that burn. He *had* to go, it honestly didn't feel like he had a choice...it was his destiny lol. ",

I read Alastair Reynolds' \"Revelation Space\". I read Iain M. Banks' \"Culture\". I read Vernor Vinge's \"A Fire Upon The Deep\". \n\nAnd I believe a series of Mass Effect movies that were of LOTR/MCU/Dune quality could wow mainstream audiences like LOTR/MCU/Harry Potter/Dune did.\n\nThe story of ME1 could easily be adapted into a movie but ME2 has a lot of characters in it.\n\nPerhaps they could split ME2 into two movies and/or cut a few characters. I think Garrus, Mordin, Jack, Thane, Grunt, and Legion are essential though.\n\nThey could go with original ending instead of the red, green, and blue choice.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-3-dev-explains-original-ending-plans-and-why-they-may-have-used-those-controversial-colours\n\nI am really excited for both Avengers Doomsday and Dune but if the MCU doesn't get its groove back then Hollywood should seriously consider bringing Mass Effect or other unknown sci fi and fantasy that the mainstream doesn't know about to the big screen.\n\nAnd it might inspire sci fi writers to create more fiction like this.\n\nI love fantasy too but it seems like we have a million books with dragons, castles, and swords. I'd love to see more books with space battles and good worldbuilding.\n\nI don't really care if they choose a male or female Shepard.",
