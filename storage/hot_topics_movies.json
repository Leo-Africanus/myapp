The movie is well reviewed, had an immensely popular lead (Gosling) along with a familiar Hollywood legend (Crowe) yet it doesn\u2019t seem to have reached the fame or icon status of a Superbad or The Hangover. In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn\u2019t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?",

        "title": "What happened to the Daniel Craig era James Bond series?",
        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

The disease was progressive and by his teens he was wheelchair bound, his condition just got worse from there. In his adult life he became engrossed in the online RPG World of Warcraft, which saddened his family as he withdrew from them. However, Mats left them his login info for the game when he died...\n\nHis parents decided to log in and post a message on his account about his passing... they were immediately flooded with Mats' online friends reaching out with their condolences and stories of online friendship. The family digs into his account and discovers that Mats was not simply gaming, but living a very rich and fulfilling life in the game where he was not limited by his condition. He made many friends, genuinely affected those he cared about and even found love. His online community mostly had no knowledge of his real life condition.\n\nI cried multiple times, but absolutely bawled at the end at his funeral when some of his guildmates attended his funeral and the woman that he had a genuine, loving and complicated relationship with was one of his pall barers.\n\n15/10 - cannot reccomend it enough.",

It ends up revolutionizing how players are evaluated in baseball. Analytics in general end up taking over in other sports as well. \n\nAre there other movies like this?

        "content": "Hey everyone, I put this this question/recommendation out to the r/MovieSuggestions subreddit and while I was getting recommended movies, the moderators took down my post because they don\u2019t allow people to ask for broad movies, only specific genres.\n\nI hope to make it work here and I want to see if you guys can recommend me some more movies. YOU CAN RECOMMEND LITERALLY ANYTHING, ANY TYPE OF MOVIE, GENRE, YEAR, ETC ALL IS OKAY!!! I want to hear your voices and I want to see everything there is to offer.\n\nI have the entirety of January planned out and most of February but obviously I need the rest of the year. So by the end of the year, I\u2019ll have 365 movies watched or more, as I need at least one per day. \n\nThank you guys for your recommendations, I appreciate all of them.",

Maybe I'm biased since I have 3 cats, but the animation, score and camerawork were breathtaking. I've never seen a dialogue-free movie before but this movie captivated me more than any other film I've seen.\n\nHas anyone else seen it? What did you think? ",

I have seen viking/norse movies before but none of which have struck me in the way The Northman did . \n\nA lot of viking movies are the same thing over and over again but the Northman felt very refreshing and new to me, although it shared a lot of the same structure as other viking movies.  \n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated.
