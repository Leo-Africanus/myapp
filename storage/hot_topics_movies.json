        "content": "We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.\n\n\nBut on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  \n\nHe's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command &amp; Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! \n\n\nHe's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. \n\nHe has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.\n\nI personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!\n\n\nHe is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. \n\n\nTim Curry.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/29qFh8i.jpeg",

        "content": "I've just watched San Andreas, which is a fun but unsurprisingly unrealistic movie, but one thing that's stood out to me as particularly immersion breaking is the use of time. It's just arbitrary.\n\nFor example, at the start of the film there's a scene where a rescue helicopter is running low on fuel whilst hovering during a rescue.\n\nThe Rock (I don't even think the character has a name, it's always just The Rock playing himself) says \"we have 5 minutes!\". \n\nAbout 15 minutes later and the helicopter is still going. And then they finally rescue the girl and fly back to base, the lack of fuel completely ignored for the rest of the flight.\n\nThe scene already had plenty of jeopardy, why add low fuel as well if it's going to be ignored immediately?! \n\nAnd then later, The Rock is saving his daughter from drowning whilst appearing to hold his breath for 30mins all while doing intense physical exertion. \n\nBonus points for him watching her drown before deciding to try kicking the blockage to free her...\n\nDo these silly time related discrepancies annoy anyone else more than they should? \n\nIs there a name for this?\n\n",

        "content": "Being a long time mad max fan I never thought I would find another post-apocalyptic universe that drew a lot of similarities from mad max. I recently watched waterworld this past weekend for the first time and I would love to see that universe explored more and a more deep dive on mutants.It seems that the theatrical release of waterworld flopped due to the controversy surrounding Costner and the cast\u2019s dislike for the production of the movie, which killed any chance of a sequel. I heard a lot that waterworld sucked which is why i never gave it a chance, but I wish i did. I guess my point of this post is that I would to see a sequel. Are we, as a society, ready for a waterworld sequel?? ",

        "title": "Grandma's Boy was way ahead of its time and doesn't get the credit it deserves",
        "content": "It's a good solid comedy about a group of friends who work at a video game company in the mid 2000s. Waaay before nerd culture became popular and mainstream. It shows the lives of actual nerds before being a nerd became cool. Is it a cinematic masterpiece and the most well written comedy film ever? Of course not. Is it also a stoner movie? Yes. But it isn't a stoner movie in the way Half Baked or Harold and Kumar are stoner movies. And I think that aspect has always overshadowed the fact that it's just an overall good buddy comedy set in a time that is very nostalgic for a lot of people who were in the same age range as the characters at the time the movie was released. The reason I say it was ahead of its time is because you can swap out the video game company in Grandma's Boy with any creative media/internet/journalistic venture that groups of nerd friends have launched over the past 20 years, and it could serve as the exact same kind of backdrop for a similar story. And seeing how having such a venture is the norm these days in nerd culture, you can't deny seeing the makings of that kind of thing in the modern era of pop culture as early on as Grandma's Boy. Like I said, overall it's just a good comedy. But too often it gets dismissed as just being a typical stoner movie.\n\nEdit: Nice to see all the love for Grandma's Boy. ",

I\u2019m not looking for jump scares or just good production, I want something that really *messes* with me.\n\nHere are a few I\u2019ve seen recently:\n\nIncantation \u2013 Loved the atmosphere and presentation, especially how it played with curses and audience interaction. It was really well done\u2026 but honestly, not that scary.\n\nLonglegs \u2013 Cinematography and storytelling were top-notch, and I was hooked the whole time. But that ending... when it boiled down to *\"the devil made me do it\"*, it just killed it for me. I\u2019m not into supernatural explanations that feel like a cop-out.\n\nGonjiam: Haunted Asylum \u2013 This one was solid, especially for found footage. Great pacing, great use of the setting. I want more like this. (But it wasn't scary at all)\n\nSo yeah, I'm open to *any* language as long as there are English subtitles. I do have a soft spot for found footage, but I\u2019m happy with any style or subgenre as long as it delivers on the terror.",

Additionally, certain children\u2019s films contain messages or overall story arcs that as an adult you need to explain to your child conceptually for them to fully understand and embrace.
