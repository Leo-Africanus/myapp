I don't think that the movie is bad (it does has some cool scenes such as the Darth Maul fight scene) but I am saying this: we were all excited for the return of Star Wars after a 16 year hiatus, it was constantly hyped up, was the most anticipated movie of our lives and we were curious to know about the rise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader...\n\nInstead, we ended up getting Jar-Jar, a long podracing scene, CGI overload and corny dialogue that was written by a 7 year old. We waited 16 years for this film to come out and also, we get a sci-fi movie, disguised as a children's film for the first 2/3rds of the movie. It was a huge letdown at the time but despite this, I since have cooled down quite a bit on the prequels with the exception of Jar-Jar Binks as at least, it still has the Star Wars feel to it and a cool fight scene to Phantom Menace which is the Darth Maul fight scene with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.",

        "content": "This is probably discussed already but as a programmer I have to get it out of my system. I watched Final Reckoning on a flight and here are the things I find absolutely unbelievable -\n\nWhy is the source code of The Entity on a hard drive on a submarine? Who deploys software with source code? Were there no other copies of the code with the programmers who developed it? No concept of a code repository?\n\nLet's put aside the fact that Luther developed a virus/malware for code he has not seen for a drive he has not seen and seems to use a non standard interface - how connecting the poison pill to the Podcova drive will control/kill the AI when the drive is not even connected to any network?\n\nWhy would any country connect their nuclear arsenal with public internet? This is a common trope of all AI as villain movies. AI taking control of nuclear weapons and launching them to destroy humanity.\n\nHow did the US government know it will take the Entity exactly 3 days for the Entity to gain access to every country's nuclear arsenal?\n\nWhy didn't any other country launch a preemptive nuclear strike on the command centers controlled by the Entity? Why wait till your command center also get hacked?\n\nIf you know your servers are going to be hacked, just unplug the router.\n\nGabriel seems to be all powerful and resourceful. He also seems to have easy access to nuclear weapons himself. He activates them not once but twice. In any other movie just stopping a guy like him from having access to even a single nuclear bomb would itself be a mission. And now he just shows up and activates a nuclear weapon like lighting a cigarette.\n\nWhy is Ethan Hunt the only man who can find the submarine and retrieve the hard drive? How difficult would it be to locate a sunken submarine from 2012 when everyone seems to know its coordinates can be found from a specific monitoring station. Why would the Russians wait for 13 years when they already have another key. \n\nThe action sequences are getting boring and repetitive. Just how many times have we seen Tom Cruise hanging onto planes and skyscrapers? The bike jump in Dead Reckoning was cool. The whole submarine and plane chase was simply exhausting.\n\nThey tried to make Neo out of Hunt. One who fights the machine/AI and saves humanity.",

She wants to be more and successful but the older woman is sort of dragging her down mentally.\n\nI believe the younger person is engaged, and the older woman is against that I think. The older woman is married and the husband is not around often. A lot of the movie takes place in the house. There are books, I think it ends in a garden.\n\nThe older woman might have dementia or some kind of illness. She\u2019s very snappy and manipulative.\n\nThe closest thing I\u2019ve found is The Lesson but it\u2019s not that.\n\nSlow burn drama. Not a ton happens. English language. Made in the last 10 years.\n\nScenes at dinner table, bathroom, bedroom, flowery garden.\n\nPlease help me.\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU REDDIT! You movie buffs did what AI couldn\u2019t. It was Shirley.

Where the first and second used the murder-mystery as a jumping-off point for some very funny contemporary satire, *Wake Up Dead Man* is much more introspective. In a funny way, it\u2019s a little analogous to *Joker 2*, not because it unloads on its audience in the same acerbic way but because it poses similarly metaphysical questions about its own popularity. Why do people respond so eagerly to stories of murder and betrayal? To answer that, director [Rian Johnson](https://deadline.com/tag/rian-johnson/) goes back to the greatest story ever told, using a small religious community as the setting for the third instalment.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-third-knives-out-1235149631/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;It works, and it\u2019s no big mystery why \u2014 Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.\n\n[Awards Radar - Joey Magidson](https://awardsradar.com/2025/09/07/tiff-review-wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-is-rian-johnsons-best-and-most-ambitious-installment-yet/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Filmmaker Rian Johnson trusts the strength of his franchise to play around with format and theme. The gothic elements on display, as well as the religious aspect, may initially seem like a left turn, but it all ends up fitting like a glove. He knows the must haves for a *Knives Out* flick and absolutely delivers. A few big sequences here at TIFF received ovations once completed. You just can feel that you\u2019re in the hands of a master storyteller, so you\u2019ll follow him anywhere. Johnson knows that and 100% makes the most of it.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-3-finds-god-and-is-so-good-because-of-it/)\n\n&gt;In terms of pure, heady kicks, it outpaces *Knives Out* but falls just short of *Glass Onion*. In the big picture, however, such distinctions are rather inconsequential; more important is that Johnson\u2019s franchise remains a sly and sure-footed delight, as well as demonstrates, with its religiously minded latest, that it\u2019s capable of coloring its Christie-esque mysteries in a variety of shades.",

As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he soon rediscovers purpose, belonging, and the quiet beauty of human connection.*\n\nDirector: Hikari\n\nCast: Brendan Fraser, Mari Yamamoto, Akira Emoto, Takehiro Hira\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rental_family)\n\n**Metacritic:** [70/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/rental-family/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Franck Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser-hikari-1236362251/)\n\n&gt;Brendan Fraser's superbly nuanced and expressive performance proves key to the film\u2019s power, and he\u2019s well matched by excellent supporting players, including Mari Yamamoto as one of his role-playing co-workers, with whom he develops a strong friendship (and who thankfully doesn\u2019t turn out to be a predictable love interest).\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser/)\n\n&gt;\u201cRental Family\u201d is, in turns, wholesome and vicious, funny and severe, contrived and elegant. It is after all a film about actors with oodles of range, undergoing the unique challenges of their craft, and these shifts serve the material well but they don\u2019t always work wonders for the audience. It\u2019s easy to struggle with how exactly we\u2019re supposed to feel about all this.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/rental-family-review-brendan-fraser-1235149619/) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;It\u2019s impossible to watch Fraser\u2019s turn without thinking about the various injuries he\u2019s suffered over the span of his career (physical and otherwise), and that extra-textual layer of personal history goes a long way towards fleshing out the underwritten character he inhabits here. His see-through screen persona makes for a similar advantage, as it allows Phil\u2019s services to perfectly split the difference between the realness of his connection and the artifice of his affect. His relationship with Mia feels real as can be and glaringly fake all at once, which is just as well in a gentle little movie that recognizes truth and performance as two sides of the same coin.\u00a0\n\n",

So many Iconic European actresses: Tilda, Angela Winkler, Renee Soutjendiik, Sylvie Testud, Ingrid Caven, and then, there's the original leading lady, Jessica Harper. \n\nAs much flak as Dakota Johnson gets for her acting,I thought her performance as Susie was very good, even though they made some drastic changes with her character. Tilda is good as usual. I loved Mia Goth, her scenes are definitely the closest ones to Horror. Chloe Moretz has an unforgettable cameo. \n\nBut the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's very uneven. The political commentary felt pointless. And Tilda's stunt casting as an elderly man was distracting and mostly boring. It was like the Dominic Guard scenes in Picnic at Hanging Rock, a irritating distraction.",

I absolutely love the way that it's shot, a long with the score giving it a mythical or dreamlike feel at times. I was thinking recently about Tom Hardy and how his career trajectory has changed since the venom movies and I feel like he doesn't stand out as much as an actor anymore, and rewatching this movie reminded me just how great Tom Hardy can be. His role as Fitzgerald is genuinely his best in my opinion. The cinematography is stunning, the performances are bold, the violence feels real, and the desperation of Hugh Glass really is felt. Of course this movie won DiCaprio his Oscar and I feel that's well deserved despite some saying he tortured himself to get the Oscar. For the life of me I don't understand how so many people I know were underwhelmed with the movie upon its release. Have you revisited it recently? And if so, how have your thoughts on the film changed since release?",

        "content": "([https://archive.org/details/who-discovered-roger-rabbit-script-1998](https://archive.org/details/who-discovered-roger-rabbit-script-1998))\n\n**Writers:** Sherri Stoner &amp; Deanna Oliver\n\n**Note:** This was a script that was commissioned by Michael Eisner - as it was developed around the late-90s, after the original prior Toon Platoon prequel script (by Nat Mauldin &amp; Tony Sheehan &amp; Jeff Stein) was cancelled - although it retained the element of Roger searching for his mother, but Stoner &amp; Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, \"This Only Happens in the Movies\", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.\u00a0\n\nSteven Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI, but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film.\n\n\\*Attached is Stoner &amp; Oliver's November 20, 1998/1st draft -- Enjoy!",
