She then went on to direct West of Memphis, in collaboration with producers Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. \n\nIn 2013, Amy\u2019s psychological thriller Every Secret Thing (starring Diane Lane, Dakota Fanning, Elizabeth Banks, Common, and Danielle MacDonald) was purchased by IFC.

Establishing it as a matter of racial equality might have lost support, as it was considered too radical at the time.",

I love a good parody of serious topics, this felt like the Spinal Tap for a new era. \nThe shots taken at TMZ were hilarious. The way it was shot was so mtv like. Just so good. \n\nI am ashamed that it took 9 years to watch it, but I\u2019m buying the blu ray, because it has high rewatch value. \n\nAbsolutely hilarious! ",

        "content": "So, here\u2019s a funny story. In 1994, when I was 6 years my parents agreed to let me watch a scary cruise ship movie they rented that had release about 20 years prior. \n\nAs I\u2019m watching this movie, I keep getting weird feelings about the main character. He\u2019s very handsome, I think, and i realize that I like him a lot. \n\nAnyways years go by but I don\u2019t forget that \u201chot dude\u201d in the scary cruise ship movie where my attraction was awakened for the first time. \n\nFlash forward to 2005. I\u2019m 17 years old and at a friends house and they throw on a really old movie. I detest but then realize, wait! I know this movie\u2026. \n\nI explain to my friend that I watched this when I was a kid and the main actor is super hot. \n\nAs we watch, I keep waiting for him to show up but he doesn\u2019t?? I know it\u2019s the right movie because I remember the other characters and the storyline. \n\nThen the realization dawns on me. \n\nIn case you haven\u2019t figured it out by now the movie is The Poseidon Adventures and my first Hollywood crush was Gene Hackman at a whopping 6 years old \ud83e\udee0\n\nAlso in case you\u2019re thinking \u201cwell Gene Hackman in 1972 probably was attractive!\u201d No\u2026 no\u2026 look up his stills from the movie. \n\nAlso one more thing, that is a very traumatizing and upsetting movie to show to a 6YO \ud83e\udd23",

        "content": "I'll go first, Stockard Channing. No matter what she's in, she steals the scene. Even The First Wives Club, where she was in it for 5 minutes! \n\nMarcia Gay Harden is another one that makes everything she's in, worth watching. \n\nVictor Gerber is another great actor who never gets the praise he deserves. \n\nI also love John Leguiziamo. He's a hugely talented man and absolutely stole Too Wong Foo,as well as several other films. I don't know why, but he deserves so much more kudos than he gets! \n\nI'd love to see a film with them all working together. How amazing it could be!\n\nSo, over to you...",

        "content": "In the midst of fantasy genre's dominance in the 2000s when Potter, LOTR and Pirates of the Caribbean ruled the box office, Narnia was released in 2005 to great success.\n\nIt made 745m and got decent critical reception. It's DVD sales were noteworthy too. However, the poor performance of the two sequels has erased the trilogy from people's minds.\n\nBut I think the first is a great fantasy film which deserves to be remembered. I love all 4 lead characters and Neeson's Aslan as well as Tilda Swinton leave a lasting impression.\n\nNew Zealand provided a fantastic location to set Narnia in and I think the final battle is underrated when it comes to on-screen battles of this kind.\n\nThe movie has that warm Christmassy vibe and actually makes for a great viewing during the December holidays.",

        "content": "Hope mods allow as its movie adjacent, as 2/3 of the movie are about making movies. Even if yiu aren't a fan of Brooks style, its a terrific read.  \nFirst 20% cover his early life, his dad dying when he was really young, his amazing mother and brothers, and him serving in WW2.  Despite how serious this part can be its also really funny with some great stories.  \nHis time with Sid Caesar, writing Get smart etc are covered and of course him and Carl reiner foray into comedy albums.  \nOnce we get to The Producers, he spends a few chapters covering Producers, 12 chairs, blazing saddles, young Frankenstein and Hugh anxiety.  \nOnce he gets to HOTW Part 1 the chapters get a bit shorter, Spaceballs and later only get a chapter, sometimes  few pages though.  \nThere's a point where he mentions going thru a divorce, and you realize he never mentioned even being married or having kids up until that point.  \nHe does talk about his late 2nd wife a lot though, Anne Bancroft, good stories,  \nThe last chunk of book covers making the Producers musical and is very interesting and that's coming from somebody who hates musicals.  \nA great book, seek it out.  \nBonus mention: after Anne passed he was at the white house accepting an award and medal when Barack Obama pulled him aside, asked him if he's doing OK since her passing and gave him a hug.",

        "content": "So he comes back from his trip and his wife and boy were killed by Crow Indians. He starts killing Crows in revenge being loosely based on Liver eating Johnston or Crow killer Johnston. One brave escapes the encounter and as Johnson closes in, he begins to sing. Then Jeramiah dips. He leaves him be and just walks off.\n\nThis is, of course, all fictional.  Jeremiah Johnson never existed so this is more a question about filmmaking than it is anthropology. Why did he spare him? What wrre they saying?\n\nOne interpretation might be that he sang his death song. I guess that means he's already dead in some sense. And though Johnson hates the Crow, he still respects their beliefs enough that it's good enough. \n\nThat's very cheesy and likely has nothing to do with actual Crow beliefs but this is a 1972 picture. Everything is just a little hippy dippy. I'm thinking they wanted the action of him fighting the Indians but not the same way the cavalry fought them. Which they alluded to earlier. \"They're Christian people down there.\" implying that non Christians are less worthy of being saved.\n\nI'm not really sure but that moment definitely meant something. I never really got the subtext there. That's the best I can come up with.  What do you think? Any insights, theories, speculations, possibilities or corrections?",

Burdened, guilty, angry, looking for redemption, haunted by doing the \"right\" thing. And finding it by saving the man who paid him to take a dive, the man he probably hates most.\n\nWe never see the boxing match, though.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is famous for writing genre mash-ups scripts with what would be the \"good\" scenes of two or three movies. So the scene where Ving Rhames delivers a monologue about how \"Pride never helps. it Only hurts?\" to Willis? Good scene: keep that in the movie!\n\nThe actual boxing match? We know what a boxing match looks like: don't need to show it.  \n  \nIt may also have been a matter of expense: Pulp Fiction was not a big-budget movie, and a boxing match means loads of extras and conditioning for Willis to look like a credible pugilist. \n\nAlso, one scene of boxing turns any movie into a \"boxing\" movie, and this was not at heart a boxing movie.\n\nWhat other scenes are critical to the plot but never make it onto the screen?",
