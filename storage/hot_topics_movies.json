        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "Back in the early 2000s it felt like every movie had a video game tie-in. Spider-Man 2, The Incredibles, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the King, Chicken Little, etc.\n\nSome were surprisingly good, others were\u2026 not, but I kind of miss that era where studios tried to extend the movie experience through games.\n\nRecently I noticed an indie film called Connection that got turned into a story-driven game (called *Stay Alive for Me*), and it made me realize how rare that crossover has become.\n\nDo you think that kind of movie/game synergy could ever come back, or was it just a weird relic of that time?",

        "content": "I finally went and visited Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming, which featured so prominently in the movie, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", and was thrilled to see it in person.  I just had to rewatch the movie (and was thrilled that Dr J. Allen Hynek was the advisor on the movie and had a cameo in it). Does anyone know how much of the movie (i.e. scenes such as power outages and seeing UFOs out on the highway) were taken from real stories?  Did Spielberg write the entire screenplay?",

I'm going to watch it again tonight! ",

Not over-used, underlined the emotions of the scenes, and paired with the perfect song. Zach Snyder comes to mind, I know he can be heavy handed with it, but still I loved 300 when I was younger and I think Watchmen had some good examples. Is there a movie or scene that you think has the perfect use of slow-mo?",

I guess being animated, aimed at kids and a comedy just lowered our guard. \n\nI can't think of anything else where perhaps a sad scene is unexpected. Maybe when Buba dies in Forest Gump? That hit me. \n\n'Everything Everywhere all at once' (2022) hit me when she said\n\nI saw my life... without you... I wish you could have seen it... it was beautiful.\n\nKe Huy Quan's expression just hit me hard - by no means a tear jerker but definitely caught me off guard.\n\nMaybe bridge to terrbethia (2007) but I kinda felt like it was coming. \n\nOH Adam Sandler in Click caught me too \n\nThoughts?
