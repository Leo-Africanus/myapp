Doesn't even have to necessarily be a break-up movie as long as it covers these themes of self-exploration and improvement. Thanks.",

        "title": "I Watched All 63 Disney Animated Movies, And It Was Delightful",
        "content": "I was born in the early 90s, in the midst of the Disney Renaissance, and I grew up on Disney movies. My mom showed me a lot of the classics in addition to the new ones that came out during my life, but I hadn't seen the vast majority of these films since childhood. So, nearly two years ago, I set out to watch every movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios (so, no live-action remakes, no made-for-TV sequels, etc.), in chronological order, to refresh my memory and fill in my blind spots. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I ranked all of the movies on Letterboxd, and included my favorite moment from each one (usually an animated flourish, but occasionally a quote or an extended sequence). And below, I listed some good and bad surprises, and I ranked villains, vocal performances, and songs, just for fun!\n\nhttps://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/\n\nGood Surprises:\n\n1. Cinderella - I really, really did not expect to come away from this with Cinderella as my favorite Disney movie and one of my favorite animated movies of all time. But it is. In my memory, it was the classic \"helpless princess, handsome prince, happily ever after\" story. Imagine my surprise when I find that it's a movie about a woman overcoming the most dreadful circumstances with kindness and humility and persistence and self-confidence. She's not immune to the weight of her terrible life, but when life gets her down, she picks her head up and gets back to solving her problems. She is a role model not just for little girls, but for all of us. AND it's beautifully animated, well-paced, and has one absolutely remarkable sequence (the transformation of everyone/everything in preparation for the ball). It's just splendid.\n\n2. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - I expected One Hundred and One Dalmatians to be relatively minor Disney, but I was blown away. From the gorgeous, painterly animation style, to the thrilling plot, to the devious villain, to the delightful side characters (Horace and Jasper are all-time great laughable lackeys)...it all just works.\n\n3. The Emperor's New Groove - I knew I was going to love The Emperor's New Groove, but not this much. It's just one amazing sight gag after another, coming in at an efficient 72 minutes (not including credits), and its blistering pace never runs out of steam. Amazing.\n\n4. Robin Hood - Robin Hood was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid, but as an adult, I realized it didn't have the best reputation, so I wasn't optimistic going in...but I still loved it. It's fun, it's got some great music (\"Phony King of England\", especially), and a ridiculous villain+sidekick combo (Prince John and Sir Hiss).\n\n5. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The crew could not be any more trope-y if it tried. Milo, the out-of-his-depth, nerdy scholar who the group reluctantly depends on. Rourke, the gruff, grizzled captain who clearly has ulterior motives. Helga, a young German woman and Rourke's second-in-command, who thinks she has to act all tough to look like she belongs next to her superior. Vinny, the cavalier Italian demolitions expert who just wants to run the family flower shop. Dr. Sweet, the physically imposing African-American/Native American doctor with a heart of gold. Audrey, the plucky, teenage Puerto Rican mechanic trying to impress her dad (who really wanted a son). Wilhelmina, the chain-smoking communications officer who looks and acts like she should have retired years ago. Cookie, the elderly chef of the expedition, who seems to have come from the Confederate South. Geatan Moliere, a Frenchman who goes by Mole, and also acts like a mole, and also looks like a mole. But it leans into those tropes with such affection, that I couldn't help but love it. \n\nBad Surprises: \n\n1. The Sword in the Stone - Like Robin Hood, The Sword in the Stone was one of my favorites growing up. I don't know what childhood me was thinking. The wizard duel is entertaining, but the plot is just totally inert otherwise. \n\n2. Tarzan - I didn't find the story all that interesting, nor the characters compelling. Much to my surprise, I also didn't love the music - it all sounded the same and didn't hook me whatsoever. RIP to the Phil Collins burning piano meme :(. \n\n3. Fantasia - Hailed as one of the all-time greats of Disney, I was excited...but it was too inconsistent. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is among the best things Disney has ever done, and Night on Bald Mountain is a good time...but otherwise? Couldn't find much to latch on to.\n\n4. The Black Cauldron - Yet another of my childhood favorite that I ranked lower than I'd hoped. I still probably have it higher than most, maybe due to my affinity for all things spooky and the fact that this is certainly the darkest Disney has ever gotten...but still didn't live up to expectations.\n\n5. Wish - This movie is SO bad. I skipped it in theaters when it came out a couple years ago (shortly after I started this project, actually) because of the so-so reviews, but I still thought I'd at least give it a solid 3/5 stars. But it looks terrible (like something from Disney Channel 10 years ago), the songs aren't the least bit memorable, there are no interesting characters, and the plot doesn't carry half the weight that it feels like it should. I LOVE the idea of this movie, and it fits so well into the mythology of Disney...which I think made me all the more angry at how it turned out. \n\n\nTop 10 Villains:\n\n1.

        "content": "I fully understand why Macy was so determined to play this role that he jokingly threatened to shoot the Coens' dogs if he didn't get it. Not only is Macy one of the best actors ever at playing this kind of character (see \"The Cooler\" for another excellent example), but Jerry is just such a screw-up at everything he does. Right from the beginning, his whole \"kidnap my own wife\" plan is so half-baked and inane that the very crooks he hires to do it are dubious about it. Think of how many ways he screws up:\n\n1. He hired Carl and Gaer on reference from someone at work (who only knows the latter and won't vouch for the former), knowing nothing about them or how competent they may be.(Short answer; not very.)\n\n2. Because of that, he can't contact them to call off the kidnapping when it looks like he might not need it done.\n\n3. He's amazed when his father in law, who is established from the beginning to not care much for him, won't just give him $750,000 with no strings attached.\n\n4. His mumbled excuses to the GM lawyer about the serial numbers to the non-existent cars he scammed them with. (\"Those're in the mail!\")\n\n5. His plan revolving around being able to deliver the ransom himself and therefore cut out most of it to keep, never realizing that his stubborn and controlling father in law (who, again, DOES NOT LIKE YOU, JERRY) might demand on doing it himself. And sure enough...\n\nAnd so on. And watching Jerry constantly fail and lose it is one of the great pleasures of the film, like when he impotently attacks his ice-covered windshield in rage or how his office blinds look like prison bars. Frequently, a character like this might bring about sympathy for his misfortunes, but not Jerry. Not only is he a loser, but his troubles are all self-inflicted. And in the end, when it all comes down on him, it feels earned and very satisfying.\n\nEven though he did manage to knock off $100 on the truecoat. You did accomplish that, Jerry.\n\n",

It's small, but shows how Anton is finally more willing to eat all food, to give it a chance.

The thought that stuck in my head throughout the entire runtime was \u201cwhy is this shot like a horror movie?\u201d\n\nObviously \u201cLonglegs\u201d came out a few years after but it\u2019s a perfect example of how this style cultivates dread. The frame shows you either too much or too little, making the space feel oppressively small or uncomfortably large. There\u2019s too much open space in the background for \u201csomething\u201d to appear. It holds for too long once characters have left the frame. In the garage, the axes are always in view (and center frame to boot).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why. I think it was very effective but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading too much into it. Obviously, this isn\u2019t the kind if movie where things appear in the background or axes are grabbed off walls. All the same, it feels like too intentional of a choice to write off.\n\nThoughts?",
