He has directed projects for Adult Swim, Disney, HBO Max, and Cartoon Network. He is also well-known for his cult hit video game ART SQOOL and his 3D illustrations, which appear frequently in the New York Times and NewYorker.

He graduated from Ohio State University in 2019 with a film studies degree, interned at NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, but really found his stride with the chaotic &amp; crudely animated videos that earned him a Murrow award in 2023.\n\nAsk us anything!

I told myself I needed to rewatch it because I feel like I might\u2019ve missed a few things. I loved it mostly because it made my brain itch and think and it struck emotions that I wasn\u2019t expecting. What were your thought when you watched the movie and would you recommend it to others? Did it make you feel strongly or completely uncomfortable? ",
