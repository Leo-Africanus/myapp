        "content": "*Mankind encounters AI beings for the first time when a highly sophisticated programme, Ares, leaves the digital world for a dangerous mission in the real world.*\n\nDirector: Joachim R\u00f8nning\n\nCast: Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Jeff Bridges, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [56%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron_ares)\n\n**Metacritic:** [48 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tron-ares/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Next Best Picture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/tron-ares/) \\- 4 / 10\n\n&gt;\u201cTron: Ares,\u201d like many long-delayed legacy sequels, has long since crossed the threshold of necessity. It feels like a nostalgia-bait artifact designed purely to revive interest, a fact made even more evident by the inevitable sequel-baiting that will undoubtedly go nowhere. What\u2019s worse for a movie that hopes to celebrate the beauty of humanity is that its message is told through the perspective of an artificial intelligence, aided by an almost hilariously Sorkin-esque portrayal of a billionaire who believes he\u2019s making the world a better place. It\u2019s a fantasy that falls short of being as sensorily stunning as it needs to be. If anything, \u201cTron: Ares\u201d is less a film than a cinematic pin dropped in a franchise map that\u2019s going absolutely nowhere.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-evan-peters-1236394401/)\n\n&gt;*Tron: Ares* is a separate story rather than a direct sequel to *Legacy*, meaning Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde\u2019s characters are AWOL. It\u2019s also a marked upgrade from its predecessor, with more dynamic visuals and muscular action sequences. Only occasionally does an actor look like they are cowering from some green-screen threat (Lee more than others). More often, the stakes are elevated thanks to greater use of physical sets and in-camera effects than in previous installments.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-jeff-bridges/) \\- 1.5 / 5\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a cheekiness to the composers\u2019 deft incorporation of older styles into their present-day approach to soundtracks, but after a time even their cleverness exposes the film\u2019s hollowness. For a story that seeks to champion the unpredictability and finite quality of life, *Ares* ultimately feels trapped by the inertia of working within the parameters set by its no less flimsy predecessors.\n\n[AwardsWatch - Erik Anderson](https://awardswatch.com/tron-ares-review-what-kind-of-legacy-is-this-c/) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;But the problem isn\u2019t that *Tron: Ares* lacks any good ideas\u2014it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t know what to do with the stray threads it tugs at. By the back half, we\u2019re down to the most uninspired impulses of studio filmmaking, complete with a character who exists purely to spout non-joke wisecracks (Arturo Castro as Eve\u2019s friend Seth) and a climax that visually resembles every Marvel movie featuring some giant piece of floating machinery threatening the streets of New York. *Tron* will always have its dazzling baubles to ooh and aah at, but at the end of the day, *Ares* feels much like the AI tech companies keep insisting on shoving down our throats: technically impressive, but also frivolous and empty.\n\n[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/tron-ares/) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;It has about as much depth as a floppy disk, but some lovely, shiny CGI and a stunningly ear-shattering score from Nine Inch Nails makes for a fun if forgettable bit of futuristic fluff. Bio-digital jazz, man!\n\n[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/tron-ares-review) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;Or maybe the early-2000s vibes of *Tron: Ares* really are that powerful, bending time to pluck a semi-canceled leading man from his prime. Certainly the movie\u2019s ideas about A.I. (which it variously conflates with video game avatars, 3-D printing, and old-fashioned robots) don\u2019t feel especially informed by anything happening in 2025. In the world of this movie, we\u2019re still dawning on a potential new age of information revolution, or whatever, and the coming hybridized life is what we make of it, off-grid or on. And in the context of our world, that\u2019s enough for *Tron: Ares* to work as escapism. The result is a pretty dumb movie with beautiful visual effects, cleanly shot action, and a kickass soundtrack. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the future of blockbusters was only this bleak?",

        "content": "I heard from someone that rather than going to the cinema to watch a particular film with a set start time, back in the 50s/60s and before, people would just go to the cinema and watch whatever was playing, and start watching it from whatever point in the screening, often watching multiple films in one sitting.\n\nSo the cinema was more about the outing than the actual film, and most films were unremarkable.\n\nIncidentally, I was recently watching \"12 Angry Men\" (1957), and there's a description of the film going experience from Juror 4 which seems quite strange to the modern ear and made me think about what I had heard:\n\n*Juror 4; Monday night? Monday night... my wife and I went to the movies.*\n\n*Juror #8: What did you see?*\n\n*Juror #4: \"The Scarlet Circle\". A whodunit.*\n\n*Juror #8: What was the second feature?*\n\n*Juror #4: \"The\"... I'll tell you in a minute...\"The... Remarkable Mrs.\" something... \"Bainbridge\". \"The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge\".*\n\n*Juror #8: Who was in \"The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge\"?*\n\n*Juror #4: Barbara... Long, I think it was. A dark, very pretty girl. Ling or... Long, or something....I'd never heard of them before. It was a very inexpensive second feature, with unknown...[actors]*\n\nCould someone explain this? Does anyone have some more details about how going to the cinema worked in the Golden Age of Hollywood? \n\nAnd how did it work with second features? AKA B films? I assume they weren't promoted at all.\n\n*Edit: Some people are assuming I am very young and don't understand pre-internet media. I am not. I am asking specifically about the cinema experience BEFORE the 1970-80s, when movies didn't have start times and second features/newsreels were a thing.",

All I remember from him even semi-recently is Hot Tub Time Machine. Other than that, where has he been? And do you think he gets the credit for his acting history? Not necessarily the acting itself, but all the fun movies he\u2019s led?\n\nAnyway, love the guy and I hope there are other fans of his out there. ",

I\u2019m not sure I was supposed to be in it and Denis had a little idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThe script is phenomenal. It\u2019s really hard to create a film, it\u2019s such a dense book. There\u2019s so much to tell. [Denis] does dip in and out and he does try and he does want to have certain connections and tentacles to the book.
