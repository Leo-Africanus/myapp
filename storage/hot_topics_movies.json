        "content": "**'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_impossible_the_final_reckoning): 87% (97 Reviews) - Certified Fresh\n\n* Critics Consensus: Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Reckoning is a sentimental sendoff for Ethan Hunt that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible.\n\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/): 70 (33 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-christopher-mcquarrie-1236215149/) (60):\n\n&gt;If it\u2019s going to be the last we see of one of the most consistently entertaining franchises to come out of Hollywood in the past few decades \u2014 a subject about which Cruise and McQuarrie have remained vague \u2014 it\u2019s a disappointing farewell with a handful of high points courtesy of the indefatigable lead actor.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-cannes-1236394481/):\n\n&gt;Is this *really* the end? It\u2019s certainly *an* end, wrapping up seven films\u2019 worth of storylines with a showman\u2019s flourish. What it doesn\u2019t do, though, is rule out another. As Cruise breezes into his mid-60s, it\u2019s hard to imagine him pulling off anything like the high-wire act he achieves here. But the door is still open, and the challenge is there, should anyone else choose to accept it.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-1236396671/) (80):\n\n&gt;It's the most enveloping \"M:I\" film since \"Ghost Protocol,\" because something's at stake. And because Cruise's stunt work is off the hook.\n\n[The Independent ](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-b2750034.html)(4/5):\n\n&gt;*The Final Reckoning*, final or not, presents us with a fascinating contradiction: Ethan Hunt is both a pure singular and a state of mind. He\u2019s cinema as the madman dreamer\u2019s paradise.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-1235122988/) (50):\n\n&gt;\u201cWe make our own destiny,\u201d someone intones during the film\u2019s closing voiceover, and by the end of Ethan Hunt\u2019s story, it\u2019s hard not to take those words to heart. I only wish that Cruise and McQuarrie had managed to make a better one.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (75):\n\n&gt;If this is the end of the 'Mission: Impossible' movies, they ended on an adequate note.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise) (6/10):\n\n&gt;While its action is reliably thrilling and a few of its most exciting sequences are sure to hold up through the years, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning tries to deal with no less than the end of every living thing on the planet \u2013 and suffers because of it. The somber tone and melodramatic dialogue miss the mark of what\u2019s made this franchise so much fun for 30 years, but the door is left open for more impossible missions and the hope that this self-serious reckoning isn\u2019t actually final.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/14/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-wildly-entertaining-adventure) (5/5):\n\n&gt;It is a wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films in the M:I canon - but we still get a brand new, box-fresh Tom-sprinting-along-the-street scene, without which it wouldn\u2019t be M:I. Moreover, this eighth film gives us a terrific new character, US sub commander Capt Bledsoe, played with suavity and the tiniest hint of camp by Tramell Tillman (from TV\u2019s Severance) who has the chops for M:I9 whenever that happens.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;The Final Reckoning is stuffed, convoluted, and ludicrous at times. But it\u2019s also mostly a great send-off to this universe, a deserved celebration for everything this series has accomplished, and one final (again, seemingly) showcase for Cruise as one of the greatest action stars of all time.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1859165/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;And yet, The Final Reckoning is too messy, too awkward, too clumsy. It somehow feels overlong and inert even as it never slows down.\n\n[Screendaily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-spy-franchise-wraps-a-self-regarding-double-bill/5204859.article) (70):\n\n&gt;The press notes get the tone of the film best: \u201dIt is impossible to overstate how seismically significant the filmmaking partnership between Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie has been on the direction the *Mission: Impossible* franchise has taken since they first joined forces on it,\u201d they intone. \u201cOr how uniquely potent it is.\u201d *Mission Impossible - The Final Reckoning*, the second instalment in a globally-shot, monumental multi-year concurrent film-making effort which should be lauded for its ambition, knows what popcorn cinema escapism is all about. But, like the perennially defiant Hunt, it sometimes over-estimates its own powers.\n\nDirected by Christopher McQuarrie:\n\n&gt;Ethan Hunt and the IMF team continue their search for the terrifying AI known as the Entity \u2014 which has infiltrated intelligence networks all over the globe \u2014 with the world\u2019s governments and a mysterious ghost from Ethan\u2019s past on their trail. Joined by new allies and armed with the means to shut the Entity down for good, Hunt is in a race against time to prevent the world as we know it from changing forever.\n\nCast:\n\n* Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt\n* Hayley Atwell as Grace\n* Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell\n* Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn\n* Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge\n* Angela Bassett as Erika Sloane\n* Esai Morales as Gabriel\n* Pom Klementieff as Paris\n* Mariela Garriga as Marie\n* Pasha Lychnikoff as Captain Koltsov\n* Holt McCallany as Serling Bernstein\n* Janet McTeer as Walters\n* Nick Offerman as General Sidney\n* Hannah Waddingham as Admiral Neely\n* Shea Whigham as Jasper Briggs\n* Greg Tarzan Davis as Degas.\n* Charles Parnell as Richards\n* Rolf Saxon as William Donloe\n* Tommie Earl Jenkins as Colonel Burdick\n* Katy O'Brian as Kodiak\n* Mark Gatiss as Angstrom, Head of the NSA\n* Indira Varma as The Head of the DIA\n* Tramell Tillman as Captain Bledsoe\n* Lucy Tulugarjuk as Tapeesa",

I am not one of those people. I took great joy in the punishment; couldn't have picked a more fitting one if I tried. The only thing that could have made it better is if they'd added a scene after the ending, after he's willed his property to the last family he has left. I'd add a scene where they reject his gift and sell the land off. To hell with his obsession with ancestry and land possession. Leave no trace of his legacy whatsoever, and his name disappear till it's only on his own tombstone.",

This seems like a good sub to ask for recommendations!\n\nI've seen most Disney movies, Star Wars, and have (finally) seen all of the LOTR and Harry Potter movies. \n\nI've been wanting to see all the things I missed, be able to understand references and jokes, etc. But when I try to start, I get so many random results and recommendations that I get overwhelmed. I'm making a spreadsheet with all the movie recs so I can check them off and feel a bit more in control on where to start lol\n\nMy hubby got to show me Goonies for the first time last year! But most movies I've never seen. Give me your \"Must Watch\" list, please!!! ",

It was released at the end of the last century and beginning of the new millennium, but it was a box office failure and has since been forgotten in the face of the studio's other classics\n\nHowever, I consider it somewhat underrated, although it's a shame that its conductor, James Levine, has been involved in infamous sexual abuse cases",
