The kind that made you want to wash it all off and just forget everything?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s Requiem for a Dream. I remember watching it for the first time when I was 16, and after it ended, I swear I just sat there in silence for an hour, afraid to even move. And to this day, the soundtrack still gives me intense anxiety.",

        "title": "Nosferatu (1979) by Werner Herzog - a re-reading of FW Murnau's film",
        "content": "The film \\*Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht\\* (1979), directed by Werner Herzog, is a masterpiece that reinterprets F.W. Murnau's expressionist classic \\*Nosferatu\\* (1922) and also engages with Bram Stoker's novel \\*Dracula\\*. Klaus Kinski plays Count Dracula / Nosferatu, Isabelle Adjani plays Lucy Harker, and Bruno Ganz (who portrayed Hitler in the film \\*Downfall\\*) plays Jonathan Harker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xoqpoc4uatge1.jpg?width=259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9e9b0fb4d2a0776448b02537564609efc7e65ff\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a0In the 1979 version, we follow Bruno Ganz through spectacular mountainous landscapes, with camera movements that seem almost improvised. There is no attempt to hide the anachronistic handrails amidst the waterfalls or the fact that the \"phantom coachman\" is simply a local coachman found by the production, playing himself.\n\n\u00a0From the moment he is received by Dracula at the entrance, the Count already exhibits animalistic behavior, showing no initial interest in the dwelling. When Jonathan cuts himself during dinner, he realizes he is in the presence of a creature that feeds on blood, as his neck is wounded by two sharp fangs. Later, he discovers his coffin in the darkest part of the castle. Soon, the Rat King will see Lucy's face in a small portrait and set off in a supernatural carriage to Wismar, a journey that includes maritime travel and the curse that will befall the crew. Desperate, Jonathan will have to climb down the window using bedsheets, witnessed by a boy and his music, and will be aided by the gypsies, even though he is psychologically unfit to fulfill his destiny.\n\n\u00a0I see the soul of Count Dracula as a reflection of melancholy and isolation, deeply immersed in his dark core. In \\*Nosferatu\\*, the figure of the vampire takes on visceral and animalistic contours, far removed from the romantic and seductive image that usually permeates popular imagination.\n\n\u00a0Count Dracula brings the plague, and in the 1979 adaptation, more broadly, the plague destroys institutions and \"liberates\" bourgeois society from the social and moral constraints of capitalism, leading to chaos.\n\n\u00a0Isabelle Adjani's Lucy emerges as a kind of Angel of Light against Kinski's Angel of Death. This is because Herzog distills the narrative even further, attributing to Adjani all the actions of the various male characters who attempt to hunt and destroy the Count. Herzog completely discards these characters, leaving only a useless and skeptical Van Helsing, who surprisingly does not believe in the supernatural. Given the incompetence of the male \"protector\" figures, it falls to Lucy to exorcise Dracula's house and his coffins, and to create a circle of holy wafers to protect her beloved, who is under the vampire's influence.\n\n\u00a0In a fascinating role reversal, it is Jonathan himself who ends up occupying the role typically assigned to Mina, as the poor victim of the vampire who is withering away in the third act and needs to be rescued from his influence before it is too late.\n\n\u00a0It is interesting that Herzog chose to name his Ellen \"Lucy\" instead of Mina, which would be the correct name for Jonathan Harker's wife. Many adaptations, including John Badham's \\*Dracula\\* released the same year, randomly switch the names of these characters, but here it seems like a more conscious decision. After all, Murnau's Ellen is a blend of the two characters, perhaps less Mina and more Lucy\u2014the sleepwalking girl who lives under the constant influence of the vampire and eventually dies, drained of blood by him.\n\n\u00a0In Herzog's film, Lucy's sacrifice is about pleasure, where the vampire's seduction is more a means to achieve his goal, and more about Dracula himself, who is willing to sacrifice his immortality in exchange for a few hours of carnal pleasure\u2014biting the neck of a consenting victim is the closest he can get to a sexual experience.\n\n\u00a0His death is dry and without frills, as silent and pathetic as his existence on Earth. By accepting his humanity, and therefore his mortality, through the touch of flesh, he also perishes as a man\u2014without transformations or disintegrations, almost like an insect sprayed with insecticide.\n\n\u00a0The vampire's kiss does not promise eternal life or sexual liberation\u2014it signals, purely and simply, total and definitive death. It is, in essence, the very Shadow of Death.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",
