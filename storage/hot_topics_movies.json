        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for moments in movies where a random, unnamed background character - a soldier, bystander, worker, etc. - suddenly does something heroic or deeply human.\n\nNot the clich\u00e9 \u201credshirt\u201d stuff where they die for shock value or a quick joke, but when the film actually treats them as real people, even if it\u2019s just for a few seconds. Maybe they stand up when everyone else hesitates, or stay behind to hold a line, or help someone escape - even though we\u2019ll never learn their name.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about them dying, really. Sometimes the best ones are when they don\u2019t: they just make a choice to act bravely and keep going. Like they step out of the background, do something meaningful, and then quietly fade back into the world.\n\nI also love when a main character is struggling alone, and a few strangers step up to help - not in a way that turns them into new sidekicks or \u201cimportant\u201d characters, but just people who decide to stand alongside them for a bit. Those moments of shared courage between strangers hit really deep for me.\n\nI can\u2019t fully explain why, but these little glimpses of anonymous heroism often hit me way harder than the big \u201cmain hero saves the day\u201d scenes. Maybe because it feels truer - like the movie suddenly remembers that everyone in its world has their own story and potential for bravery.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? And what are your favorite examples of these kinds of moments? I would love to find new movies/shows with these premises (obviously, not just to watch one scene but to me I feel like the writers really know what they're doing if they include this)",

In more recent times, movies get to do and say things that movies of yesteryear could never dream of due to censorship, in particular the Hays Code. The MPPA ratings system also used to be a lot stricter on certain things.\n\nA long time ago, you couldn't get away with showing an interracial relationship out of fear of offending bigots, now you can. You couldn't get away with two gay characters kissing out of fear of offending bigots and/or getting an R-rating or even an X/NC-17 rating, now you can. You couldn't depict gay characters even existing in a kid's movie out of fear of offending bigots and/or getting a rating not suitable for kids, now you can.\n\nSo what other things would get censored in older movies that are now commonly accepted?",

And wow, it's bad.   I know Spike can be hit or miss sometimes but this was miss for me on all fronts. Not even Denzel could save this for me. I honestly think it might be his worst performance. And the acting across the rest of the cast is just as bland and uninspired, especially the lady playing his wife and the kid playing his son and ASAP Rocky who is woefully miscast and has 0 screen presence. I think the only person I even kind of enjoyed watching was Jefferey Wright. The random celeb cameos were unnecessary and took me right out of the movie. I get that this is Spike trying to pay homage to New York by getting as many NY names in here as possible but I think he definitely could have gone about it in a better way. And also, is it not weird to anyone else that the rich characters escape this whole situation unscathed and the poor/lower class characters are brutalized, racially profiled, maimed, put in jail,  etc.?? What exactly is the message here? I really struggle to see what critics enjoyed so much about it. Maybe a fan of this movie can give me some idea of why it worked for them, and encourage a rewatch.",

        "content": "I'm nearly done with my Robert Redford marathon - just two left! In any case, I just watched All the President's Men, which I've watched about 5 or 6 times since it first came out. This one is excellent on so many levels! For starters, it's based on the true story of the Watergate break-in, which happened just a few years before the movie came out and was thus still big news. And what's more, the story is amazing in-and-of itself! As they say, the truth is often stranger than fiction, and this is a case in point! Until 1972, who would have believed that such a huge illegal operation was going on, administrated by our own president! To me, the silver lining behind all this was the ability of the free press, the Washington Post in this case, to get to the bottom of all this and expose it to the public, which is free speech in action, without which our democracy could not stand. \n\nUnfortunately, since then, I'd say we've slid downhill tremendously, since most of our news sources have become untrustworthy and we now allow known criminals to occupy our highest positions of power. Those of you who still care about what our country stands for, in particular, what our founding fathers have created for us, ought to take this movie and its message seriously and still stand for our democracy, which I sincerely hope never dies!

        "content": "I rewatched *Limitless* last night. The film shifts between power fantasy, cautionary tale and sci-fi thriller, but never fully locks into one. That might bother some people, but for me it worked.\n\nIt gives you space. You can just enjoy the momentum, or start noticing what sits underneath. Identity, ambition, control, addiction. It doesn\u2019t explain much, and that\u2019s what I liked about it.\n\nThe film doesn\u2019t pretend to be deep, but something stays with you. Not loud or dramatic, just a quiet weight that builds over time.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it a masterpiece, but I\u2019d still be interested in seeing more from that world.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen it recently, how did it land for you? Did it age well?",

        "title": "Coraline Explained",
        "content": "*When I was a child and Coraline first released I was horrified of the film and could never watch it all the way through. Now that I am an adult I finally have and I think after reading both the novel and seeing the film I finally understand the film.*\n\nWatching Coraline for the first time as an adult was a completely different experience than what my childhood fears imagined. As a kid, I couldn\u2019t make it through the movie \u2014 the eerie button eyes and the uncanny world terrified me. But now, watching it as a 20-year-old, I realized it\u2019s more than just a creepy stop-motion film. It\u2019s a dark, symbolic story about temptation, neglect, and identity.\n\n**The Beldam (Other Mother)**\nThe Beldam represents manipulation disguised as love. She\u2019s the embodiment of temptation \u2014 offering Coraline everything she craves: attention, delicious meals, and parents who seem to care. But her perfection is artificial. Her goal isn\u2019t to nurture; it\u2019s to possess. By creating a fantasy world tailored to Coraline\u2019s desires, she lures her into complacency. The Beldam symbolizes toxic relationships and how abusers often present charm before revealing control. Her button eyes, stitched smile, and spider-like body reflect how she spins emotional webs to trap her victims.\n\n**The Ghost Children**\nThe ghost children are tragic warnings of what happens when someone gives in. They once accepted the Beldam\u2019s offer, trading their freedom for false happiness. Now, they exist as lost souls, forever voiceless and unseen. They guide Coraline by showing the price of giving up one\u2019s will. Their fading presence adds emotional weight \u2014 they\u2019re victims of neglect and manipulation, reminding us how easily innocence can be stolen.\n\n**The Symbolism of the Eyes**\nEyes are a major theme throughout the film, symbolizing awareness, truth, and identity. The Beldam\u2019s request to have Coraline sew buttons over her eyes represents surrendering one\u2019s perception and individuality. Once the buttons replace real eyes, a person no longer \u201csees\u201d reality \u2014 they become blind to deception. Coraline\u2019s refusal to lose her eyes is her refusal to lose herself.\n\n**The Cat**\nThe black cat is both mysterious and wise, acting as Coraline\u2019s moral compass. Unlike other characters, he moves freely between worlds, representing insight, instinct, and independence. His sarcastic but protective attitude helps Coraline realize that courage doesn\u2019t mean being fearless \u2014 it means choosing to act despite fear. The cat also reflects the adult voice of reason, challenging Coraline\u2019s assumptions and encouraging her to think critically.\n\n**The Ending**\nIn the end, Coraline triumphs by using her cleverness, bravery, and empathy. She doesn\u2019t just defeat the Beldam; she grows. Returning home, she learns to appreciate her real parents and the imperfect but genuine love they provide. The garden scene at the end mirrors her emotional transformation \u2014 from isolation to connection. Watching this as an adult, the message hits harder: life isn\u2019t about fantasy or perfection. It\u2019s about authenticity, resilience, and self-trust \u2014 values that only come from facing, not fleeing, the real world.\n\nI\u2019d like to also add that I confidently believe that the cat disappearing into the signpost signifies that the Other World still exists and The Beldam still has a mental grasp on Coraline even if she escaped the evil witch\u2019s hands.",
