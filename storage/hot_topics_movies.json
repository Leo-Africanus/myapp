        "title": "October 31-November 2 Box Office Recap \u2013 On a slow Halloween weekend, 'Black Phone 2' returns to #1, and crosses $100M worldwide. 'Bugonia' opens with a solid $5M domestically, the best ever debut for Yorgos Lanthimos.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/060hdqtcj4zf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7663c96381632fdd9c8587f3bf38e69342a62a8\n\nIt was a tight battle for #1 this weekend. Sunday estimates had ***Regretting You*** taking the top spot, just $100K above ***Black Phone 2***. But with Monday actuals, ***Black Phone 2*** reclaimed the top spot thanks to a lighter Sunday drop. Either way, Mason Thames had the rare honor of starring in the two biggest movies this weekend. Not everyone can say that.\n\nWith absolutely no new wide releases, the Halloween weekend was a very quiet place for moviegoers. The only notable thing was that Yorgos Lanthimos' ***Bugonia*** had a very good debut in its wide expansion, achieving his best weekend ever.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $47 million this weekend. That's down 25.6%, when ***Venom: The Last Dance*** repeated at #1. Overall gross represented $55.5 million, which is the fourth lowest of the year. Thanks to a very underwhelming line-up, October 2025 posted just $428 million, which was the worst since 1997 (excluding 2020 for obvious reasons).\n\nWhy do studios avoid the Halloween weekend? Well, it's a very busy weekend, given that people choose to attend other events instead of going to the movies. It's even more complicated when Halloween falls on Friday. The date is full of the type of distractions (trick-or-treating, parties, etc.) that keep moviegoers away from theaters. In the previous six times that Halloween fell on a weekend, only two years (2008 and 2010) had a film reach $20 million on the weekend. As such, studios avoid releasing big stuff here. And then you also have the final two games of the 2025 World Series, which was the main attraction this weekend.\n\nAfter dropping to third place last week, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2*** returned to the top spot with $8.3 million. Thanks to its Halloween connection, the film eased just 35%, which allowed it to have the best second weekend drop among all Top 10 wide releases. While it started with a lead over the original, the film has earned $61.7 million domestically, which is now behind the original through the same point. But it's $10 million ahead of ***Smile 2*** through the same point. Assuming it can hold well for the next few weeks, it should close with around $75 million.\n\nParamount's ***Regretting You*** originally called in as the #1 movie this week, but weekend actuals had it settle for second place with $7.8 million. That's a fine 43% drop, which is much better than ***It Ends with Us*** (52%), although that film opened to almost four times as much. Through 10 days, the film has earned $27.2 million, and it should reach $40 million by the end of its run.\n\nLast week's champ ***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** added $6.2 million this weekend. That's a steep 66% drop, but that drop is actually better-than-average for an anime IP; those titles drop at least 70%. Through 10 days, it has earned $30.9 million, and could hit $40 million.\n\n***KPop Demon Hunters*** returned to theaters, this time playing at a larger screen count (2,890). But it seems the novelty wore off, as the film made $5.9 million, far off from the $18 million it opened with back in August, and that was in far less theaters.\n\nIn fifth place, Focus Features' ***Bugonia*** debuted with a solid $5 million in 2,043 theaters, taking its 10-day total to $6 million. This is easily Yorgos Lanthimos' biggest ever weekend, and it also outgrossed the domestic lifetime of ***Kinds of Kindness*** ($5 million).\n\nThis is a solid debut; it's hard to ask for much better numbers, considering Lanthimos doesn't make mainstream titles. The fact that it could get his biggest weekend is thanks to Focus' strong marketing, which highlighted its satire and crazy premise. Reviews have been great so far (87% on RT), and some Oscar buzz has helped it attract interest. \n\nAccording to Focus Features, 61% of the audience was male, and 63% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a \"B\" on CinemaScore, which is below ***Poor Things*** (A\u2013), but it's still a solid grade considering the film's tone. The film will have some adult drama competition in the next few weeks, but it should still hit over $15 million domestically by the end of its run.\n\nUniversal re-released ***Back to the Future*** in 2,290 theaters for its 40th anniversary. It earned $4.9 million, taking its lifetime gross to $221 million.\n\nAfter its weak debut last week, ***Springsteen: Deliver Me to Nowhere*** had a rough drop. It dropped 58%, for a $3.7 million weekend. That's a brutal drop for a music biopic, especially considering that this was aimed at older demographics. Through 10 days, it has made just $16.2 million, and it won't make it much further than $20 million domestically.\n\n***Tron: Ares*** had its best drop yet. It dropped 38%, adding $3 million. But with just $68.1 million in the bank, it's hard to consider it a win. Look for this to finish with around $72 million.\n\nBriarcliff Entertainment released ***Stitch Head*** in 2,162 theaters, but the film flopped with just $2 million ($2.4 million five-day). Expect this to fade quickly.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***Good Fortune***, which dropped 53% for a $1.4 million weekend. The film has made $14.6 million, and it will close very quickly.\n\n***One Battle After Another*** dropped 47%, adding $1.1 million. That takes its domestic gross to $67.8 million.\n\n***Roofman*** dropped 50% for a $1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $21.3 million.\n\nTurns out people didn't want to get Stuckmannized. Neon's ***Shelby Oaks*** collapsed 67%, earning just $770,423 this weekend. It has earned $3.9 million, and it will fade quickly from theaters.\n\nS. S. Rajamouli's newest film, ***Baahubali: The Epic***, debuted with $825,040 in 448 theaters. In comparison, ***RRR*** earned $9.5 million, although that was playing in 1,200 theaters.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** added $8.4 million, taking the worldwide total to $139 million. The best markets are South Korea ($20.9M), the UK ($2.8M), Germany ($2.7M), France ($2.6M) and Mexico ($2.1M).\n\n***Regretting You*** added $8.2 million, crossing the $50 million worldwide milestone. The best markets are the UK ($5.1M), Germany ($3.3M), Australia ($2.6M), Mexico ($2.2M) and Brazil ($1.4M).\n\n***Black Phone 2*** added $7.3 million overseas, allowing it to cross $100 million worldwide. The best markets are Mexico ($9.8M), UK ($4.3M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.3M) and France ($1.7M).\n\n***One Battle After Another*** continues fighting for its life. It added $5 million, taking its worldwide total to $190 million. The best markets are the UK ($15.1M), France ($13M), Germany ($9.5M), China ($6.8M) and Italy ($5.8M). In the next weeks, it should finally cross $200 million.\n\nMaking its debut in 46 markets, ***Bugonia*** earned $4.4 million overseas, for a $11.3 million worldwide launch. It still has lots of markets left to open.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*The Long Walk* | Sep/12 | Lionsgate | $11,703,621 | $35,163,573 | $49,071,826 | $20M\n*The Smashing Machine* | Oct/3 | A24 | $5,841,662 | $11,357,580 | $19,778,902 | $50M\n\n- Lionsgate's ***The Long Walk*** has closed with $35 million domestically and $49 million worldwide. Not one of Stephen King's biggest hits, but it's a solid success regardless. Buoyed by strong reviews and word of mouth, it legged out to 3x multiplier. Not bad.\n\n- No one wanted to know what The Rock was cooking. A24's ***The Smashing Machine*** has closed after just 4 weeks with a poor $11 million domestically and $19 million worldwide, failing to come anywhere close to its $50 million budget. This is Rock's worst ever wide release, finally dethroning ***Faster*** ($35 million worldwide). Even though the film garnered buzz in Venice, reviews declined as the film got closer to release. The film experienced poor word of mouth, which is why it dropped off a cliff after its weak debut. While this was sold as an awards vehicle for the Rock, it'd be a surprise if it garnered anything notable, considering there's very little passion.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\n20th Century Studios is releasing ***Predator: Badlands***, the latest installment in the ***Predator*** franchise. After ***Prey*** and ***Killer of Killers*** were released on Hulu, this is heading straight to theaters. While the franchise has had its up-and-downs at the box office, the past two installments have received very positive reviews and reigniting some interest. Well, this is gonna be a test if the franchise can make a comeback in theaters.\n\nMUBI is releasing Lynne Ramsay's ***Die My Love***, which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. After its Cannes premiere, MUBI bought it for a record $24 million and plan to launch it in around 1,500 theaters. Lawrence has garnered acclaim for her performance, and there's some Oscar buzz circulating. Could it surprise?\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "I was just randomly thinking about this, it\u2019s a common refrain in storytelling of all sorts that you should ideally [\u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell?wprov=sfti1), meaning to convey information and story using relatively little exposition. \n\nAnd there\u2019s generally good reason for that, exposition can bog a story down or feel like you\u2019re lecturing the audience or something. It can come across as unnatural, with for example two characters having a discussion and delivering information that both of them should already know and have no reason to bring up, except to inform the audience. That sort is very common. \n\nBut what are some good movies (or shows) that do the exact opposite: they do \u201ctell, don\u2019t show\u201d superbly well?\n\nMy pick is Unforgiven, where there is constant reference to William Munny\u2019s pitch-black past as an exceptionally violent and indiscriminate murderer, but we never actually see him doing any of it, in flashback or anything. You only get a very small taste, deliberately, at the end when he does his revenge and the old Munny returns. \n\nHis past is otherwise communicated almost entirely through lines said by both Munny and Little Bill, with the latter especially going into a rage about how Munny used to slaughter women and children. Which Munny openly admits with the famous line, \u201cI\u2019ve killed just about everything that walked or crawled at one point or another.\u201d\n\nBut outside of those lines, Munny\u2019s despondency and deep remorse throughout the entire movie and Bill\u2019s anger at his perceived hypocrisy are all you need to \u201cshow.\u201d You believe it completely.

The UK has rated it 15 for Strong Bloody Violence, language, brief sexual references and New Zealand have it down as R16 for Violence, Cruelty and Language.\n\nAlthough the MPA site and many others around the web don't show the official rating yet for The Running Man, when you bring up the films IMDB section for Parents Guide, it says it has been rated R for Strong Bloody Violence and Language throughout, and sexual references.",

        "content": "Context: Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) meets with the president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste Senior (Eamonn Walker), using a revolver that Yuri was pitching to him on one of his soldiers. \n\nThis is a perfect scene, in my opinion. It\u2019s obvious that Andre sees through the \"used gun\" excuse and knows that Yuri can potentially be threatened or scared, but he can also control himself and push down his humanity for business. An absolute monster cannot be trusted, but a human who can ignore their humanity when it suits them is great for business.",

And I didn\u2019t realise how much of my childhood vernacular was influenced by this single character.\n\n The music is good. The mythology is gorgeous and the fact that it is steeped in Australian nature is thrilling as an Australian. \n\nAlso like that the lead fairy isn\u2019t really interested in romance at all, as it\u2019s nice to watch a US kids movie from the 90s that isn\u2019t romance focused",

        "content": "Grendel in the original literary epic is a bit of a sad figure; he's basically a monstrous Grinch who hates being excluded and can't stand the nonstop partying from Hrothgar's hall (his nightly attacks are basically an extreme example of a grouchy neighbor trying to get those damn kids to turn the music down). But the Grendel in the 2007 film is an utterly tragic figure even if he's also a completely unhinged killing machine who bites people's heads off and smashes others like a pulp while running around screaming like a banshee on a cocaine high. If the revelation of his parentage wasn't enough, his body horror is abominable. In contrast to the usual depiction of him being a hulking, powerful beast, here we have this twisted, malformed abomination that looks like an aborted fetus that somehow survived and grew to adulthood. David Cronenberg would be impressed by this ugliness; uneven limbs, melted features, skin that looks burned and exposing muscles and bone, a misshapen skull and that massive eardrum that causes every sound to be be utterly agony. No wonder the sound of partying at Hrothgar's hall drives him into a murderous frenzy.\n\nThe closest I can compare this Grendel to is to Godzilla in \"Shin Godzilla\". Both are horrific threats, but they also look like mere existence is an agony to them. And Grendel's ultimate fate at Beowulf's hands and his final scene with his mom just brings home his tragedy. His entire life has been noting but misery and his demise is actually quite a relief. At least the pain in his head will stop.",
