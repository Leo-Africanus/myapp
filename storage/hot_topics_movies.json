        "content": "Dakota Johnson thought \"Madame Web\" was part of the MCU. When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

I feel like these are some of the most entertaining movies to watch and deliver some of the biggest laughs",

I had no idea Steve Carell could play such an asshole.  Sam Rockwell is his typical, awesome self - and, in this role, I like to imagine he's basically playing himself.  If you haven't seen it, give it a shot, I think you'll be pleased.",
