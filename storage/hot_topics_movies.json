        "title": "The one Disney animated film that BEGGED to be made into a franchise/series but never did? THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE. Oh how I wish we could\u2019ve had more adventures with Basil of Baker Street",
        "content": "I know everyone always goes on about the Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladdin etc. (&amp; those are wonderful films)\n\nBut for me? 1986\u2019s \u201cThe Great Mouse Detective\u201d is the **PERFECT** animated Disney film. I love practically every frame. The music, the voice acting &amp; animation? It\u2019s wonderfully charming. Disney doing Victorian era London is always special &amp; atmospheric. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know the premise? It\u2019s simple. What if Sherlock Holmes\u2026was a mouse. Solving mice crimes. All while living in mouse hole tucked away in actual human Sherlock Holmes address of Baker Street\n\nThis movie was completed in that sweet spot where Disney had yet to make the switch to digital coloring(aka digital Ink &amp; paint aka the CAPS system) and so this film has that warmth &amp; charm that was a little bit lost when the conversion was made circa the early 1990s. It does have a very early CGI sequence in an animated film, the terrific Big Ben Clock climax. (The gears were created digitally and then traced over, not actually rendered out to film or composited digitally)\n\nSo what makes the film so special? The characters. The characters! I know this isn\u2019t technically \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d BUT if it were, this would be my favourite rendition of the great detective. \n\nLike all great Sherlock adaptations it\u2019s the Sherlock/Watson relationship that is the true measure of success and this movie takes the cake. David Q Dawson is our Watson stand in, he\u2019s a caring albeit clumsy mouse, compared to Basil\u2019s man(er..mouse) of action. They just have terrific chemistry. You buy them as friends instantly. \n\nAnd it\u2019s this reason more adventure were needed. I don\u2019t care in what form. Straight to video, animated series or legit theatrical sequel. So long as the same voice actors were used? Give me more! But alas, it was not meant to be. After Little Mermaid and the rest become huge cultural juggernauts, there was no more room for the relatively modest successful fare like The Great Mouse Detective. And we are all the poorer for it. Also unlike most those other films, this isn\u2019t a musical. There\u2019s one scene where characters break out in song. And it\u2019s great.\n\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered if Disney would do the same \u201clive action\u201d remake route befallen to so many of the animated films. Maybe in time but you\u2019ll never do better than Vincent Price as Ratigan, Barrie Ingham as Basil and Val Bettin as Dawson. RIP.\n\nAnd that score by Henry Mancini? Now that\u2019s a theme! Remember when we had memorable musical themes? \n\nSo? For those who haven\u2019t had the pleasure or for those who have &amp; haven\u2019t had the pleasure in awhile, go check out The Great Mouse Detective, bask in its charm, warmth, heart and splendor. \n\nThis movie deserved to be a franchise.",

My daughter knew we loved \u201cPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\u201d thus, she said, we should love \u201cHot Rod.\u201d \n\nBruh.\n\nI never laugh during an initial viewing of a comedy. Don\u2019t know why, but any comedy I see the first time, it might elicit a chuckle here or there, maybe a chortle or a slight guffaw, but that\u2019s about it. \u201cHot Rod\u201d had me cackling the first time I watched it, and every time I\u2019ve watched it since, I still laugh hard.\n\nSo unbelievably quotable\u2026 \u201cCool beans,\u201d \u201cBABE, WAIT, BABE!\u201d \u201cYoo-hoo shitheads, I found this bag of fireworks in the men's restroom. Would you guys like to light them off?\u201d \u201cLet me join your crewwwWWW?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking green tea all goddamn day!\u201d \u201cYou guys, the bathroom here is nuts!\u201d \u201cUltimate punch!\u201d \u201cPussyyyyyyyyyy\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Rod and I like to party.\u201d \u201cI said you look shitty! Goodnight, Denise!\u201d\n\nPerfect soundtrack! Effing EUROPE songs throughout. The \u201cYou\u2019re The Voice\u201d montage! We know the story takes place in the age of the internet, but when? It\u2019s timeless, sorta. 80s glam metal songs with earnest lyrics, clothes vehicles and houses that could put you in any of the last five decades. \n\nStill cannot believe this movie even exists. Thank god it does. With all of the frightened studio execs unwilling to take risks on anything because audiences are unpredictable and unreliable, for Paramount to basically go, \u201cOK idiots, here\u2019s $25 million, go make a movie,\u201d it\u2019s baffling to me. It\u2019s also a shame this movie is still not as well known as it deserves. I would have thought, y\u2019know, long tail rules, \u201cHot Rod\u201d would have made its money back by now.\n\nI\u2019m dropping this here for appreciation of a damn funny movie that deserves more viewers.",

        "content": "For this I'm not really thinking of improv takes for comedy films, but I guess that can fit. But just recently I've seen multiple actors/directors talking about a take that was originally just meant to be funny but ended up getting used in the final product. Examples:\n\n- **A Real Pain**: after tour guide James is saying a heartfelt thank you and goodbye to Benji and just turns and nonchalantly and flatly tells David thanks. James' actor has said that that was just meant to be funny and even Jess Eisenberg originally though the take was \"ruined\" but ended up loving it and using it.\n\n- **Leon the Professional**: Gary Oldman dramatically yelling \"EVERYONE!\" was one of a couple takes that he intentionally was overdoing to make Luc Besson laugh. Turns out he liked it enough to use it in the final film.\n\n- **Severance**: TV obviously, but in the most recent episode when Mr. Milchick delivers a letter to a character and then abruptly sprints away, Tramell Tilman has said he just did that to be funny and didn't think it would be used.\n\nWhat are some more famous or interesting examples?\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**: To emphasize, I'm not necessarily interested in \"just\" improvised scenes/lines here, but specifically a delivery or take where the actor themselves thinks it's ridiculous or a joke or unusable that I'm interested in.",

It's somewhat realistic with some domestic abuse scenes, but the overall tone is light and gentle when it comes to the main story where you can feel the love between Alice and her son while she struggles to make her way. You got a stacked cast with Ellen Burstyn as the lead, Kris Kristofferson, Harvey Keitel, Diane Ladd, and Jodie Foster making an appearance. It's really funny and a very interesting portrait of a woman in the 1970s figuring out her life after her husband passes. I can kind of see it like a 90s version of Nomadland, but this is more of a slice of life comedy than a introspective drama. \n\nI don't know why this isn't talked about when it comes to Scorsese movies. Maybe it just doesn't have the deep subject matter or the intensity of his gritty body of work, but it doesn't make it shallow or lacking an emotional core. I think the most memorable image in this movie is Ellen Burstyn holding a forced grin when working as a waitress and she gets embarrassed by the other waiters. Just a great moment.\n\nRandom thoughts\n\n* I can see why Ellen Burstyn won an oscar for this. Doing this and The Exorcist back to back blows my mind with how she has great range.\n* This movie doesn't have a single moment where I thought Scorsese was on hard drugs\n* the actor who played Alice's son grew up to work as an engineer. Good to know!\n* I couldn't find a blu-ray release, so the DVD makes the movie look kinda ancient and the colors don't seem to pop off as they should.\n* Criterion, please give this a blu-ray release.\n* \"A Jack Job in a paperSack, Get off my back!\"",

        "content": "Just finished watching and the only redeemable thing about this movie is Kat Graham. The twist with Kevin was predictable. He was acting like he didn\u2019t care about Rodney\u2019s death while his partner Caleb was so broken up about it. I also felt like it was quite obvious that he was shifting the blame onto Caleb and I couldn\u2019t understand why no one brought up that Kevin was the one to yell out \u201cGun,\u201d the entire movie except maybe once. \n\nI thought Tony\u2019s friendship with Kevin was a little weird and suspicious because if I was friends with someone who had been involved in a shooting like that and didn\u2019t seem to care, I would have serious concerns about being friends with them. That said, it was mildly surprising that Tony was also one of the ones behind everything, however, knowing that makes his interactions with Kevin make more sense. If Tyler Perry wanted to make it obvious that Kevin was a piece of shit, he succeeded. \n\nTo touch on Fela: I found her grief over Rodney to be incredibly underwhelming (especially after finding out Rodney was cheating), and after watching the ending it makes so much sense why. After the four month time jump I was almost certain she was involved because who wins 15 mil and falls off the face of the earth from their only friend who was supposed to be her rock? \n\nIn summary: I did not like the movie at all. While I enjoy Kat\u2019s performance, I felt she could\u2019ve done better. The entire story was rushed, the ending sucked, and the only thing that could\u2019ve made it better was if Tony double crossed Kevin. I really hoped he would but alas, he was a piece of shit too.\n\nI don\u2019t know about anyone else, but I feel like Tyler Perry\u2019s movies used to be good. I don\u2019t know what happened over the years but they\u2019ve gotten to be subpar. Movies like I can do bad all by myself, Diary of a mad black woman, and Why did I get married were a few of the ones I thought were pretty good. This one was absolute hot garbage. Anyone else agree?
