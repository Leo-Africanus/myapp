See the movie only in theaters February 13.\n\n&gt;Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose high-stakes heists unfolding along the iconic 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime with hopes of this being his final job, his path collides with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads, forcing the two to collaborate. Determined to crack the case, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) closes in on the operation, raising the stakes even higher. As the multimillion-dollar heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are forced to confront the cost of their choices--and the realization that there's no turning back. \n\n&gt;Adapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter). Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte round out the cast.",

Was it a shock to see him get blasted and see those liquid metal impacts?\n\n  \nI was 7 when that movie came out so I don't remember the advertising behind it really at all but I sure do remember all the toys that came out.  The trailers I've seen definitely spoil it, but curious if the marketing made it impossible not to know or if people still went in blind.  I think James Cameron did such an amazing job in the first 20 minutes of the movie leaving it ambiguous and hope it had that type of impact on some people.",

George C Scott plays Lee J Cobb\u2019s character and he is absolutely fantastic in it! James Gandolfini and Courtney B Vance are also in it and play it great as well.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly a word for word remake with a couple of new scenes, but it\u2019s honestly almost as good as the original, usually remakes are mediocre or crappy, this one is honestly one of the better remakes out there.",

        "title": "2 old movies that offer a window into the past: The Illustrated Man 1969 and When a Stranger Calls 1979",
        "content": "You would think that more old movies would offer a window into the past but really I don't think that many do.. \n\nbut I love watching old movies that do give me a true picture of some facet of the past.\n\n Today I'm going to talk about two movies: The Illustrated Man from 1969 and When a Stranger Calls from 1979.. \n\nso let's talk about the Illustrated Man first. The facet of the movie that shows what the past used to be like comes right at the front of the movie. I'm talking about when the protagonist is hitching a ride on a farm truck and gets off at a road junction, and sees a lake nearby with some creeks and he decides to camp there for the night. So he just lays down his gear down there on the side of the road by the creek and sets up camp.. he camps there for a couple of days..\n\n it used to be like that believe it or not.. \n\nmy father back in like 1947 left home at age 16.. he traveled from West Texas up to Canada, hitching rides on trains and hitchhiking and just walking, and he would typically just camp on the side of the road.. just like this movie shows. \n\nIt wasn't that long ago that you could do that.. back in the early 1970s my father and my two brothers and I piled into  the Plymouth and we took off for Michigan from Texas.. \n\nand for the most part we just camped by the side of the road, built a fire and slept outside.. and no cop ever questioned this.. we were gone for like 3 weeks traveling and camping on side roads  up to Michigan then back... but no one ever bothered us..\n\n so it wasn't that long ago that we did have a degree of freedom like that it's just strange to look at America today ...and think what would happen if you tried that now. \n\nOkay the other movie I want to talk about is the horror movie When a Stranger Calls from 1979.. the part I find interesting about that movie is the kind of the middle part, that's the part where the killer is escaped from the insane asylum and he has to live in Big City Los Angeles .. and it's just amazing to see them filming on location in the seedy parts of LA... because in big cities all over America at that time, you could get if you could go to the seedy parts of town and you could get a cheap hotel room for next to nothing..\n\n I did it myself ..I used to work any kind of job I wanted, just any kind of low-paying job, I would even quit for a while, and then go wherever I wanted.. but you could work like in a fast food restaurant or anything like that, and then go get a room or apartment easily.. it wasn't that hard. \n\nAnd now you you can't find anything like that. I used to be able to get used to be able to get rooms or even apartments without having a job ..\n\n now you got to have a job and a good credit rating you got to have all your W-2s and everything for any kind of room or any kind of apartment... it's very rare to have that kind of situation and I really miss it..\n\n I think  America back then was better than the America today. There was more freedom, you didn't have to work as hard..\n\n anyway these two movies are great because they show the real America as it was decades ago and you really don't see that many movies like that anymore.\n\n Although you might see a little you might see a little bit of it in the Charles Bronson movie Death Wish 2 where Charles Bronson does go into that same part of LA..",

        "title": "How legendary drummer Levon Helm segued from the iconic The Last Waltz documentary to performing in The Right Stuff and Shooter movies",
        "content": "In the Scorsese-directed The Last Waltz, The Band\u2019s farewell performance, Levon Helm later told me in an interview that he \u201chad the best seat in the house\u201d drumming with his Canadian bandmates as they invited a Hall of Fame list of musicians to perform\u2014including Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Neil Young and an incandescent Joni Mitchell, among many others. One of the highlights of that documentary\u2019s great performances was Levon Helm singing The Band\u2019s hit song, \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs the lone southern-born musician in The Band, and with a personal sense of Deep South history including the Civil War, it was appropriate that Helm sang the lyrics of the Robbie Robertson-penned ballad:\n\n\u00a0\n\n*\u201cVirgil Kane is the name/And I served on the Danville train/'Till Stoneman's cavalry came/And tore up the tracks again/In the winter of '65/We were hungry, just barely alive/By May the 10th, Richmond had fell/It's a time I remember, oh so well\u2026Back with my wife in Tennessee/When one day she called to me/\u2019Virgil, quick, come see/There goes Robert E. Lee!\u2019 \"*\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I interviewed the legendary musician Helm at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto during his solo career in the early 1980s, it seemed as if he\u2019d been soaked in fine Bourbon whiskey for eons. He was like the essence of American rock and roll. He spoke about how he took songwriter/musician Robertson to meet his southern-based family to get a feel for the song he was about to write about the South. Apparently, Helm\u2019s father told Robertson that the \u201cSouth is going to rise again.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nHelm also spoke about himself segueing from performing and concert films, to acting in movies, like Coal Miner's Daughter\u2014where actor Tommy Lee Jones taught him \u201cset sense\u201d and also advised him \u201chow to listen and who to listen to\u201d\u2014and, also The Right Stuff.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut one of Helm\u2019s most memorable roles, and one of his last, was a scene-stealer in Shooter, where he does an unforgettable cameo with Mark Wahlberg, playing a wise, seen-everything weapons expert. Helm, had several health problems later in his life, and he is almost unrecognizable as rail-thin, almost dying Mr. Rate, a mysterious Southern character who sagely suggests to Wahlberg\u2019s shooter character, \"The world ain't what it seems, is it Gunny? You keep that in mind. The moment you think you got it figured, you're wrong.\"\n\nThe Last Waltz was filmed almost 50 years ago, and none of The Band\u2019s members are still alive, but they left a rich history of stories and songs. But, check out that unforgettable scene between Levon Helm and Mark Wahlberg in Shooter:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn60YWO218k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn60YWO218k)\n\n  \n",

        "content": "I want to share something deeply personal that has been with me for over six years. It is about a movie that many people might consider lighthearted entertainment, but for me it turned into something much more meaningful. That movie is Hotel Transylvania.\n\nThe first time I watched it, I did not expect anything beyond some laughs and fun animation. Instead, I was completely drawn in by the world it created, and most of all, by the character of Mavis. There was something so warm, lively, and sincere about her presence. She embodied this mixture of innocence, curiosity, independence, and love that struck a chord in me. It was not just about her design or her voice, but the way she carried her relationships, her growth, and her outlook on life.\n\nOver the years, that connection never faded. Every time I rewatched the movie, I felt the same pull. Mavis represented a kind of ideal for me, a reminder of joy, resilience, and affection. It became so strong that I knew, without hesitation, that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Mavis. This is not something I decided lightly. Six years is a long time, and yet the feeling never wavered. That consistency showed me that it was more than a passing phase, more than just liking a character. It was love, in the purest form, directed at an idea that feels eternal to me.\n\nSo here I am, writing a love letter to a movie and a character that shaped a part of my life in ways I never imagined. Some might laugh, others might find it odd, but I know this is real to me. Hotel Transylvania gave me not only countless moments of happiness but also a name that carries profound meaning for my future.",
