        "content": "Hello\nI'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny\u2014but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.\n\nMost movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts\u2014and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)\nIf you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!\nI hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything \ud83d\ude05. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!",

He was excellent in The Last Duel, but I definitely feel his look doesn't lend to roles in period films. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, actors like Tobias Menzies and Mark Rylance seem to blend into period settings more than contemporary ones. \n\nThis makes me wonder, what makes some actors look more \"period\" than others? I think super neat dental veneers and plastic surgeries play a role here (for example, Nicole Kidman in The Northman looked distinctly modern), but I don't think that's the full answer. What are your thoughts? ",

If you ever watched the Mad TV parodies, they only exaggerated a tiny bit. \n\nThank god for Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in Under Sieger who were so crazy they managed to make Seagal seem subtle by comparison. And Kelly LeBrock had Daffy Duck lips while playing a medical surgeon (laugh!!!). \n\nHis movies were SOOOOOOOOOOO dumb!!!!!",

        "content": "Something I realized fairly recently. It's well known that streaming has the massive downside of making you dependent on a remote server instead of having a physical object to own, meaning you \"buy\" something that can be taken away at any point. But a similarly bad issue in my opinion is that, with the slow death of home releases, we lose the \"bonus features\". Director/cast commentary, deleted scenes, making-ofs. Sure, a lot of people probably don't care about it, but a lot probably also do.\n\nPersonally, for me the production-story is sometimes more interesting than rewatching a movie, to the point that I, at one point, spent an absurd amount on a big [Harry Potter Box Set](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/p44AAOSwlqtnZJIR/s-l1600.webp) because it came with literal hours of making-off and similar content. And I'm kinda sad that that era is (soon) over, with something like commentaries just about gone and \"making of\" limited to more or less official snippets you have to dig through youtube for.",

I still haven't gotten around to the James Bond and John Wick films though.\n\nBut oh man, the Mission: Impossible movies might be some of the best action movies of all-time. The first one may be the slow one out of the whole series but even 2 isn't a bad movie in general despite being the worst of the Mission: Impossible movies. Fallout even blows most of the Marvel movies out of the water besides for Captain America: The Winter Solider and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's surprising to me that Tom Cruise does his own stunts for all of the Mission: Impossible movies, if someone like Brad Pitt or Bruce Willis were Ethan Hunt, they wouldn't do most of their own stunts. And the most divisive movie of the series, Dead Reckoning is still actually a really good movie besides for IIsa's death. Just really good movies around.\n\nI really hope that Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is actually the best Mission: Impossible just because of how good it looks.",

        "content": "Famous romantic movie of course, the music, the pottery, etc. That early scene with Unchained Melody is one of the most romantic sequences ever filmed. \n\nAnd it\u2019s also not novel to highlight Whoopi, who won the Oscar here. \n\nBut upon rewatch, it really is an impressive performance.  Whoopi is absolutely electric in this movie. She bursts in like lightning and so smoothly carries the tone from comedy to drama and back again and she pulls that off effortlessly even in individual scenes. She doesn\u2019t even show up in the movie at all till 40 minutes in. \n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant performance and again she won the Oscar so it\u2019s not underrated or anything, but I think it\u2019s often viewed as a sort of silly performance or even a Magical Negro (ess) one, but it isn\u2019t anything like that. She\u2019s just so warm and just so alive, it\u2019s wonderful to rewatch after so long. ",

Prior to this, it was Inception. I can\u2019t really compare the two, but they both leave you guessing until the end. \n\nThis movie was superb. During the cliff scene, I had parts of it figured out, but didn\u2019t really fully believe it until the lighthouse scene. But I never could have predicted everything else that was revealed. \n\nThe ending after that is expected but sad. Who wouldn\u2019t turn out like that if they had experienced what he did. ",

To cheer myself up, I decided to have a Disney movie marathon while coughing my lungs up.\n\nDisney\u2019s animated Tarzan was among the movies I re-watched. For me, the soundtrack remains a masterpiece. I feel like it was perfectly interwoven with the narrative and just amazing in general.\n\nThe opening scene still hits me in the feels, especially with the accompanying music.\n\nSabor herself still gives off a deadly ambiance also. The terrifying sounds she makes and her overall vibe feel incredibly intense, especially with it being a Disney movie,. The way her claws are animated and the fluidity of her movements just feel super deadly, even after all these years. Combined with the background music, her scenes still give me chills, even with the occasional touches of humor thrown into them.\n\nThat's my movie moment/character that still gives me chills, even after re-watching the movie. What's yours?",
