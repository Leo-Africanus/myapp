I am 23 so the movie had me reminiscing the entire time. Can\u2019t help but wish I was 17/18 again with my only priorities being girls and alcohol. The ending was so bittersweet tho. I had never really noticed it before, but now I\u2019m a little older, with most of my high school friends having drifted away, the final escalator scene really hit home. They were both happy, met girls, were excited about their lives ahead, but at the same time they both felt themselves drifting onto different paths and understood that they can\u2019t be best friends forever. The final scene where Evan drifts out of view of Seth, that really hit me. Maybe because I\u2019ve finally accepted that me and my best friend since primary school have drifted apart. It just seems to capture the moment of initial realisation so perfectly. It\u2019s mad because when I was a teenager, I never thought SUPERBAD would have me in my feelings. Anyway, brilliant film. ",

You could tell that Joseph Kosinski knew how to adapt the source material of his unfinished book (which the movie is based on) as a movie and it shows that he knows how to direct a perfectly-well done non-IP based film. It heavily relies on real locations rather than soundstages, the CGI and set design looks much better than today's Marvel movies, and of course, we all know Tom Cruise's performance is outstanding. Even though it leans more on the drama side rather than the action side, the action sequences are well-done and lastly, the cinematography and imagery are gorgeous to look at. Oblivion is worth a watch if you like sci-fi and Tom Cruise movies despite being not received positively by critics and audiences when it came out.",

        "content": "I was listening to the flash gordon soundtrack in the car to work the other day - my favourite tracks being specifically:\n\n1. Flash Gordon luring war rocket Ajax into the clouds\n2. Vultan's theme/the attack of the hawkmen\n3. The absolute banger battle music once the fighting gets to Ajax itself.\n\nAnd i was thinking - in terms of modern movies, this scene is so small in scale - a single spaceship getting attacked by an army of hawkmen, and yet, it is so goddamned epic. This scene IMO is one of those legendary movie moments inseperable from its music - in this case, several BANGER tracks from Queen.\n\nAnd I started tangenting - could this scene and therefore the entire movie, ever be re-created where it remotely does justice to this wonderful blast from the past, rich in camp and just so, so fun.\n\n\nFor me, this movie left a strong impression on me when I was young (im just 50 now). I distinctly remember the absolute foreignness, almost freakishness of the hot hail, then the FREAKY faces in the off-colour clouds. Those opening scenes, the sound of the planes engine soaring etc.\n\nThen it just got better and better - the music, the characters, the setting. Everything from the crazy design of the Hawkman palace and its arena of death, to the swamps of Arborea with their horrific russian rouletteesque game, to cruising through orange clouds on a rocket cycle.\n\nI just cant imagine a movie doing Flash Gordon justice the way this movie did.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

It has a lot of great build up throughout but also has a very peaceful melody to it. What are some of your favorite individual tracks from films? Can be from any type of film such as horror, action, comedy, or even in mediums like animation. Interested to see what people say.",
