In every kind of movie whether it\u2019s an action movie, a rom-com, a mystery. Everything. \n\nI need a movie that will genuinely stump him. Something so out of left- field he didn\u2019t even see it coming. \nNothing super scary though, we\u2019re not horror film people. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to give a list of movies we have watched bc there are so many. But to give an instance of how wide across genres it goes: we watched \u201ccrazy, stupid love\u201d the other night and he pretty much guessed some of the ending. We watched the first \u201cKnives Out\u201d last night. He guessed it too. Granted these may not be too hard to follow and predict, but he does it it nearly every movie.\n\nThanks in advance! ",

I never noticed it before, or if I did, I just took it as a friendly nod to his buddy but after rewatching it several times it stood out to me in a different light for some reason and I think it's brilliant \n\nWhat are examples of this happening to you with movies you love to rewatch?

I wanted to share this *script-to-screen* clip from **Nosferatu** (2024) by Robert Eggers\u2014an incredibly rich screenplay that at times reads like literature \ud83d\udc49 [https://youtu.be/Qg9-IYDlOts](https://youtu.be/Qg9-IYDlOts) \\[it's the opening scene\\]\n\nAfter a deep dive into the script ([Nosferatu Screenplay](https://www.screenplaywise.com/2567/36/nosferatu-2024/)), you can even spot some \\*deleted\\* scenes that didn\u2019t make the final cut! One striking example is on page 33, where a haunting shot of Orlok\u2019s shadow looming over Ellen\u2014used in the film\u2019s promo\u2014was originally scripted: \n\n&gt;**INT. HARDING HOUSE. GUEST ROOM \u2013 NIGHT**\n\n&gt;ELLEN stands by the window. She watches the ships pass in the harbour. Her white skin is even whiter in the moonlight.\n\n&gt;Slowly, a SHADOW drifts toward her, reaching... IT IS THE SHADOW OF ORLOK\u2019S HAND... SHE HEARS THE FAMILIAR WHISPER OF HIS LANGUAGE... THE CLAW GRASPS HER TIGHT... ELLEN feels the shadow overwhelm her.\n\n&gt;She is seized with terror. Her breath quickens... she is under his spell...\n\nMoments like this highlight Eggers' masterful visual storytelling. What do you think of the changes from script to screen? \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udc80",

        "title": "You, me and Dupree is absolutely terrible",
        "content": "This movie was just added to Netflix and I remembered enjoying it years ago, but this movie is absolutely terrible. It got to the point where I almost didn't want to finish the movie.\n\nFirst off as someone who likes Owen Wilson, his character in this movie is completely unlikeable, I'm not sure if that was meant to be the point or what. He moves in then breaks all rules set for him, and when he actually does something good, it seems like it was only thrown into the movie in order for people to not completely hate Dupree.\n\nThe plot makes no sense and it tries to force the fact that the main character, Carl, is the bad guy so hard it confused me how anyone in the movie wasn't on his side? His best friend moves in then immediately sleeps naked on the couch, spends their money with no way to pay them back, burns down half their house while having sex, and then openly masturbated onto Carl's socks. And I'm supposed to believe Carl's the bad guy because he didn't write some thank you letters? His wife forces him to kick out Dupree then a day later forces him to take Dupree back in. When Carl tries to explain why he's always home so late she doesn't believe him and takes her father's side. And then gets drunk with Dupree and takes his side when he starts yelling at Carl about being late. \n\nNow I don't know if I'm the crazy one here but if my best friend got drunk late at night with my wife and then started eating breakfast with her every morning, I would start to think somethings going on aswell. Along with Dupree making creepy noises while watching Carl's wife get sugar for some reason? \n\nBut nope, according to everyone in the movie Carl is the one who should change. After Dupree attempts to break into the house after being kicked out Carl's wife invites Dupree in for dinner. And after some antics from Carl's wife's father, Carl lunges at Dupree and then leaves the house. Which then puts Carl's wife into a position where she is ready to LEAVE Carl and move on. Stating that she knows Carl loves him but \"it's not enough.\" Let me restate the only things Carl has done the ENTIRE movie that could be considered bad are 1. Not writing thank you cards. And 2. Lunging at Dupree.  But he's supposed to keep a cool head and apologize to his wife after being constantly antagonized by her father and dealing with Duprees shenanigans while she takes Duprees side on every confrontation and won't listen to Carl about her father. \n\nThis is throughout the whole movie with different little things here and there that make this pile of trash almost unwatchable to me. I don't want to be forced to think someone's a bad guy especially when you write them to literally NOT be a bad guy. That's all.\n\n\n(The movie is trash don't watch it)",

Awesome story with awesome and entertaining characters.\n\nI loved the chance to see Immortan Joe and the Citadel again, and it gave us another fantastic scene of how much authority he holds over his minions. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even bother to respond to Dementus\u2019s comments, he has the people eater do it for him.\n\nThen that leads to a fantastic scene of a random war boy being chosen to represent how all of them would willingly blow themselves up in the Immortan Joe\u2019s name, or as the people eater words it\n\n\u201cAmong us, are 972 devout warriors. Any one of them, if chosen, would\u2019ve done the same. Each would die historic for the Immortan Joe. That\u2019s why you\u2019re fools, you\u2019re all fools for coming here!\u201d",
