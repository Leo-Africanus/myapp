        "content": "Jurassic World at least tried to recapture the spirit of the first movie. Although it wasn't as good it did fall back on the same message of commercialism ruining the natural order of things.\n\nFallen Kingdom's plot is so baffling. The dinosaurs went from being completely terrifying killing machines to now just cartoon characters like when Blue winks at the audience and pretends to be dead. Also Hammond's former business partner uses the exact same DNA cloning techniques that were used on the dinosaurs to clone his deceased daughter into another person who becomes a main character. \n\nDominion goes even further to the point where the dinosaurs are just a background noise for the movie. The plot centers around some billionaire who wants to engineer a bunch of locusts to destroy the world's crop supplies so people will buy his food instead, oh and there's some scenes with dinosaurs here and there. Also the original cast came back to remind you you're watching a Jurassic Park sequel.\n\nAt this point JP3 seems like the last faithful sequel which is not really a good thing",

Well this was mine. \n\n\nOddly enough, whenever the topic of scary movies comes up in a group conversation, no one has ever heard of it. I\u2019ve rewatched it now as an adult showing people this crazy fever dream from my childhood and honestly this is a solid movie. The art direction and design is pretty spectacular. Despite a tight plot and novel imagery it kind of got panned and I\u2019m not entirely sure why. \n\nIf this posts only achieves one thing in getting even one person to watch this movie. I will be satisfied ",

Literally I cried at the first scene where aunt Lucy and uncle Pastuzo decided to give up visiting London so they could raise the cub. Another tearjerker is at the end when Mary was trying to break Paddington out of the train underwater, and Paddington gave up and gave the smallest head shake. Not to sound ridiculous but I have a dog that looks very much like a small bear, and I think I'm projecting hard onto my precious baby pup lol\n\nThe movie even gave Buchanan a cute ending, where we see that what he really wanted was to perform again and be appreciated. So sweet. \n\nI can't believe I only heard about how good this movie is recently and decided to watch it. It is now a favorite movie of mine!",

Gen X has a very unique perspective like no others because we've seen pre-internet, start of it, and our current technology. It's truly amazing and so interesting but it would be even more amazing if stuff like (in this movie) really happened. I cry like crazy at the end...like I just close my eyes and picture that reunion with my own father. Anyways, I'd like to hear about anyone else's reviews on the movie. Thanks!",
