He\u2019s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.\n\nWell, The Blind Side is on TV and it\u2019s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what\u2019s on film I\u2019ve seen (or at least know about).\n\n",

I love so much about the franchise, and can find something to enjoy in most of the different shows/movies, even if they're generally not well regarded.\n\nThe fourth movie though, despite being an even number and apparently quite popular, just doesn't do anything for me. I dont know if it's the departure from the usual space opera setting, the over laboured fish-out-of-water gag of the crew going back in time, or the heavy handedness of the environmental message, but for one reason or another I just cant get on board with it.\n\nHaving said all that, I dont hate it. I can see why people like it - it takes a risk in changing up the setting, the individual performances are generally pretty good, and the \"save the whales\" message is pretty hard to take issue with. \n\nSo overall - I dont like it, but I do *respect* it.

Ive watched 50+ movies over the year and zombieland is easily my favorite movie of all time. Tallahasse mafe me laugh so much. Real genuine ones which is rare from me. Then the other thing thats funny is he relates to my dad because they both just want twinkies in life. Anyways when the girls betrayed tallahasse and columbus i genuinely crashed out and got mad at them. When Bill Mercer died i literally cried and watching them bond made me happy. I was literally shouting no and turn back when he was about to get shot. Then when i thought tallahasse was gonna die i got really sad and mad at the girls and i laughed and got sad for tallahasse when he shot the twinkies. The movie is so well made!",
