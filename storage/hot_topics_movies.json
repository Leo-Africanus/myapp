So many cool ideas for a film in this genre like the viewing room where we see a man get cooked alive by the sun. The space craft they're in has one of the coolest designs I've ever seen in a space/scifi film. Personally, I fully believe that the film stuck the landing as well. However the shaky cam at the end is nauseating and there's a certain bit towards the end that I rolled my eyes at. But other than that I really don't have very many other complaints this shit rocks. \n\nIf you haven't seen Sunshine and you're a fan of scifi I highly highly recommend it. This is one of the greatest films to get high to as well if you partake. I was in awe during multiple scenes on my first watch after smoking a bowl. Don't go in expecting a super realistic and grounded space film. Just go in expecting a fun ass movie and you won't be dissapointed. ",

I suppose it dabbled more in memory, than time, per se. The idea of being able to perceive language as a non-linear medium is absolutely fascinating to me. \n\nAnd Memento. Wow. That\u2019s probably my favorite Nolan movie I\u2019ve seen up to this point. I figured out pretty early on that the black-and-white colored scenes were moving forward linearly, and the fully colored scenes, backward. So, I guessed they would intersect at some point. But, I could never have guessed they would have met in the way they did. \n\nThe way the two different timelines were inter-spliced was absolutely brilliant on a first viewing. But that being said, I don\u2019t think it lends itself to an even better second viewing in the way other Nolan films do. My best explanation for that is: because the story is being told backwards, the lead up to the \u201cending\u201d is REALLY the lead up to the beginning. Whether you agree or disagree with that, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.",

        "content": "There was a movie in Bollywood a couple of years ago called 'Animal' that was commercially successful, but widely panned for having a corrosive effect on the minds of the public by not only being misogynistic, but also pushing a very destructive and toxic idea of what it means to be masculine. \n\nI was wondering if there has been a movie that you would say has been corrosive to the minds of the public. (Let us exclude wartime propaganda films such as Triumph of the Will)",
