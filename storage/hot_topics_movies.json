        "content": "This documentary was so incredibly sad. It messed with my feels so much. I\u2019m not a nascar fan but maybe I\u2019m biased since I\u2019m from North Carolina and my dad watched nascar every Sunday. I also lost my dad so maybe that\u2019s why? I didn\u2019t know a lot about the story before but man\u2026what a story! I\u2019m shocked at how much this documentary affected me. Anyone else wanna weigh in? I feel like I need to talk about it haha. It\u2019s on prime. ",

        "content": "I think sometimes people tend to overlook the soundtrack of a movie or don\u2019t bother paying to much attention to it.\nPersonally for me, the soundtrack can even carry a bad movie and make it  into a good one if that even makes any sense\u2026.\nA good example of this might be Batman vs Superman\u2026.or maybe someone might have a better example. \n\nBut movies like the dark knight have an epic OST from beginning to end, anything with \u201chans zimmer\u201d attached to it, is already going to be good. Another film that comes to the top of my head is \u201cface off\u201d with John travolta and cage.\nI want to know other films that people like or have taken notice to the composers abilities.",

The guy working for him (maybe as security) realized the rich man is a wanted fugitive who had plastic surgery to change his appearance. And is willing to turn him in for the money? -the way off the island is in the ships in bottles as a clue maybe? -the action happens during the party with all the guests -newer movie (within the last 10 years maybe)\nI don\u2019t remember any female main characters I think it was mainly males and the rich guy was blond. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s not glass onion lol ",

I guess Penguins counts but, whatever) Which one is your favorite? Why is it so good in your eyes? I, personally find Madagascar 2 as the best, but if anything, that's from a Bias of the fact I had such a long time of watching it, but I think it has good memes, memorable scenes, and is just enjoyable.\n\n  \nNote: I may not respond to your responses for a while; as I am just starting to use PC Reddit, and don't have the mobile app installed right now, have a good day/night and thanks for a response if you do!",
