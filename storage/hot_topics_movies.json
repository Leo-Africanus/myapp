There\u2019s so much I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate in my first viewings. Every frame is so carefully curated and layered, the attention to detail in this movie is astounding. Every shot is so meticulously crafted, and expertly captured, there isn\u2019t a single shot in this movie that doesn\u2019t look like a painting. The cinematography and directing are absolutely top notch. As far as directing goes, it doesn\u2019t get better than this. George Miller is a master of the craft and such a brilliant artist. He really created such a monumental film. Watching the action sequences I have no idea how he did most of that, especially knowing the vast majority of the action in the film was done with practical effects. I love everything about this movie, every time I watch it I appreciate new things about it. George Miller really caught lightning in a bottle with this. So grateful for this movie.",

A normal R rating would have sufficed. Or maybe this would have been NC-17 when it came out, but would score an R or even a PG-13 if it was released today.\n\nFilms like that?\n\nWhen I think of films like this, the first one I think of is A Clockwork Orange.

        "content": "I grew up in the 80's and 90's watching all the big action movies. Introducing my sons (8 &amp; 10) to some of my own childhood favorites can be hit or miss. I even find myself groaning at times and feeling like they haven't aged so well. I am aware some parts of action movies are not appropriate for younger viewers, and I do monitor what my kids watch. I also realize I cannot shelter them from everything and try to use questionable content as teaching opportunities, which is much more than adults cared to do for me when I was a child watching these movies. That said, they recently came across JCVD movies and really enjoyed them. They even liked them over more populare movies by more popular action stars. My kids are very observant and we noticed some aspects of his *on screen* persona in contrast with other characters portrayed by other actors. \n\nIn his roles, generally:\n\n- He usually plays an everyman type of character that is relatable to a wider audience.\n\n- He doesn't typically want to fight or go looking for trouble, but fights back to defend himself when attacked, driven by honor, or protecting those less capable. \n\n- He is usually fighting or crusading on behalf of a family member or loved one that he feels morally obliged to stand up for.\n\n- He doesn't immediately resort to using guns or other weapons and more often than not fights hand to hand, rather than killing. \n\n- He prefers a fair fight or being the underdog against a bigger and stronger opponent over dominating others. \n\n- He places a large amount of emphasis on the training, mental focus, and traditional aspects of being a martial artist instead simply an agent of destruction. \n\n- He is respectful and protective toward female characters and doesn't go out of his way to be overtly misogynistic or objectifying.\n\n- He is playful, warm, and caring toward children when he encounters them, often speaking softly at eye level or engaging in fun with them. \n\n- He is rarely boastful or conceited, and shows a righteous indignation toward authority figures he feels have wronged him or held him back from his pursuit of an honorable cause. \n\nThese are some things we discussed about his movies and why my sons have chosen him as their favorite action star of the \"old school\" movies. Is there anything missing here, or are we totally off base? \n",

So much so, when he finally switches to the hero, it feels like a victory. Kurt is an underrated actor really. He has more chops than many seem to get. So many great roles, though.\n\nThere's also his role in a little documentary I worked on recently: [John Carpenter's Escape from New York | Low Budget. Legendary Results.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUu4pHSOSN4)",
