There will always be the classic Christmas movies that we all can fall on, but there isn\u2019t too many that I can recall within this current decade that has hits me as much as the holdovers. From the sentimental moments Da vine Joy, to the hilarious back-and-forth with Dominic and Paul , to the heartbreaking moments with Dominic\u2018s parents. I will now watch this film every Christmas time.\n\n",

I couldn\u2019t find anything anywhere. Not online, not in print shops, not even after trying to reach out directly to the film\u2019s production team (I actually tried\u2026 zero response \ud83d\ude05).\n\nSince so many fans seem to have the same struggle, I finally decided I\u2019d just recreate it myself, staying as true to the \u201890s look as possible.\n\nSame black-and-white vibe with that subtle blue tint\u2026 Alyssa\u2019s face framed the same way\u2026 the serif title in the exact spot\u2026 even the quote under the red censor bar rebuilt accurately. I matched the typography, the shadows, the contrast, everything. And it\u2019s clean enough for an 18\" \u00d7 36\" print.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this here because I know how many people love this movie and how impossible it is to get a proper poster.\n\nIf anyone wants the full printable files (only if it\u2019s allowed by the mods, not trying to break rules), just drop a comment, I\u2019ll directly reach out to you or DM.\n\nHope this makes at least a few Chasing Amy fans smile today. \u2764\ufe0f",

We're here to answer your questions.\n\nIf you want to know more about us, here are our credentials:\n\n* Russell Dodgson (**His Dark Materials**, **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2**) : [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4203233/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4203233/)\n* Dorothy Ballarini (**Wicked: For Good**, **Guardians of the Galaxy**): [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4809197/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4809197/)\n* Darren Naish (**Alien Worlds**, **Prehistoric Planet**): [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4595065/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4595065/)\n\nOur mission was to create the illusion that a modern natural history crew traveled back in time. This meant adhering to strict \"blue chip\" documentary standards\u2014using long-lens photography, camera jitter, and heat haze to ground our CGI in reality.\n\nFrom an artistic and technical standpoint, we delivered over 1,250 4K shots featuring 69 scientifically accurate hero animals. This required intense collaboration to ensure every skeletal structure was fossil-accurate, alongside complex bi-directional simulations for fur interacting with deep snow, mud, and tar.\n\nWhether you\u2019re interested in the bi-directional FX sims, the on-set puppeteering in extreme climates, or the paleontology behind the designs, Ask Us Anything!\n\nWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow Tuesday, December 9th, at 1 PM ET/6 PM GMT to answer your questions.\n\nAsk away, we\u2019re excited to talk all things prehistoric, icy and wonderfully complex!\n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m starting watching movies with my dad again, we used to do it when I was a kid, then life/work got in the way and we just kinda stopped. Now I finally have a bit of time, and this is the second day in a row he's asking me to watch something.\n\nThe thing is\u2026 I honestly don\u2019t know what he likes besides \u201caction.\u201d That\u2019s the only genre I\u2019m sure about. Yesterday he asked me to put something on and luckily I ended up choosing \"Rush Hour\" with Jackie Chan. We both enjoyed it a lot, fun, a bit chaotic, good action/comedy mix.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m mainly looking for action movies (it's okay if they also have some comedy), preferably on Netflix. But if you have recommendations outside Netflix, feel free to drop them too. And if you think there\u2019s something outside the action genre that could still work for a dad\u2013kid movie night, I\u2019m open to that as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

So wild.\n\nIt's a bit weird that they went with comedy for this film, but at least it leaves room for at least one of the other fantastic drama to get some recognition. I feel like this was a great year for the genre.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Its style; the shots, the movement, all amplifying the world Chopper lives in, in his own head -fast, twitchy, violent and unpredictable.",

Boxing, kickboxing, MMA, Judo, Jiu Jitsu, Wrestling, Pro Wrestling - even though it's actually performance art I'm counting it for practical purposes - any of it.\n\nMovies I've seen in this genre: Rocky Series of course and Karate Kid, Warrior, Red Belt, Never Back Down, The Fighter, Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, Kickboxer, Bloodsport\n\nSo any sort of movies of this type that aren't in this list I haven't yet thought of would be great if they exist. I realize I may have already covered all the good ones in the list but perhaps there is a particular standout I haven't been made aware of yet. Perhaps a Netflix movie even.",
