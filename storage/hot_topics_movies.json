I do love Goodfellas, but this to me is an equally great movie, on it's own merits. Unlike some Best Picture Winners, this actually deserved it a whole lot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00hucqshg1ig1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35212b3a58ff67600e90e23d3c420b1fc343e5d\n\nThis movie spells epic in so many ways, just that Buffalo Hunt scene, would place it among the classics. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c33a2yvjg1ig1.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=848666d29f6a599c26f53147072554f4e846a326\n\nAnd to think this was Kevin Costner\u2019s first movie as a director. Interestingly none of the studios backed the movie, saying the Western was a dead genre, Costner, put his faith in the movie, and the rest as they say is history*.*\n\nThe movie opens with a brilliant battle scene, where Field Lt. John Dunbar( Kevin Costner) a Union soldier, makes a suicidal run into the Confederate line, that makes him a hero. However when asked for a choice of his posting, he chooses the Frontier, a decision that results in raised eyebrows of Major Fambrough( Maury Chaykin). His reasoning is simple\n\n*\"Yes Sir.. Before it's Gone\"*\n\nThe Frontier then was considered a punishment posting, where no one was really interested in settling then, but then Dunbar puts it about himself\n\n\u00a0*In trying to produce my\u00a0 own death, I was elevated to the status of a living hero.*\n\nA reluctant hero, who was just content to live by himself, away from all the pomp and glory. \n\nThe shots were Costner proceeds into the wilderness just on his horse is superbly done, and Capt Cargill who hands him charge of  \u00a0Ft. Sedgwick his outpost, is more than relieved to leave the place.\n\n*I\u2019ve looked for that wagon from\u00a0\u00a0 Fort Hays just as you have\u2026 day\u00a0\u00a0 after miserable day. All I can say\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is that I\u2019m proud of you. Get your\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 things men, we\u2019re leaving this place.\u00a0\u00a0 The army\u2026 can go to hell.*\n\nDunbar however sees this as a place where he gets to see Buffalo and the Indians, a sentiment not shared by his associate Timmons who sees it as Hell. Timmons is ambushed, slaughtered and scalped by a group of Pawnees, in a rather gruesome scene.Dunbar is totally alone now in the wilderness, having to face hostile Native Indians, and his only companions now are his horse, and a wolf which he befriends calling it \"Two Socks\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3hhdztng1ig1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a716dd91c9df51410373e38622658b330f0ab533\n\nActually for close to 15-20 minutes, Dunbar is the only character in the movie, framed against the wilderness, as you can feel the sense of isolation. And then the nearby Sioux tribe members begin to make their contact with him Kicking Bird( Graham Greene), the old veteran Ten Bears.And Wind in The Hair who has nothing but contempt for the White men, and feels the same towards Dunbar.  He also gets drawn to Stands with a Fist( Mary McDonnel), a White woman raised by the Sioux, fully adapted to their way of life.\n\nThe way Costner explores the relation between the White and Native Indians, their initial feeling of mistrust, how he overcomes them slowly, the bonding he has with Kicking Bird is superbly shot.  The dialogues especially giving an insight into the ways of the Sioux and dependence on hunting. \n\nWhile sympathetic to the Native Indians, Costner also shows their more negative side, the intra tribal conflicts that were as violent. One very poignant scene, where the Sioux have lost badly in a battle with the Pawnees, and the mourning that follows the death of the tribe members, including Stands with a Fist, when we see her for the first time. Also usage of native Indian actors brings in that authenticity, where they don't end up as side shows.\n\nAgain the movie does not get into the White Savior mode here, Dunbar is more a person who is trying\u00a0 to\u00a0 understand\u00a0 their\u00a0 way\u00a0 of\u00a0 life, sympathetic to their cause, in fact the Sioux turns out to be his savior later on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6d9740sg1ig1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8590bb7b38d32a7bac72be111819dd8aeada8105\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3edmzwqg1ig1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68bc71253400bb76f5c5fce83e8c013cb24a501c\n\nThe Buffalo Hunt scene of course is one of the greatest movie scenes ever shot, especially that shot of the buffalo running across the vast open plains, and John Barry's BGM just elevating it.\n\nKevin Costner has had some great movies in the 80s- Bull Durham, The Untouchables, No Way Out, however his career went into a free fall in the mid 90s with some utterly disastrous choices, before he came back in the 2000s.

In fact it was Silverado in which Costner starred, that sparked his interest in the Western genre. \n\n",

Pike River is a drama that depicts a mining tragedy that affected an entire community and their fight for justice and accountability.

Those are the movies I\u2019m hunting for right now.\nI\u2019m open to absolutely any genre: thrillers that shocked you, romances that felt unexpectedly real, indie films with amazing storytelling, mind-bending sci-fi, animated movies that hit emotionally, foreign films with a fresh vibe, or even cult classics that deserve more love. Language, release year, popularity \u2014 none of that matters as long as it genuinely surprised you in a good way.\nBonus points if it\u2019s something underrated or not constantly talked about. I love discovering hidden gems that somehow slipped under the radar but are totally worth watching.\nAlso, if you want, share why it surprised you (no spoilers please!). Was it the acting, plot twist, cinematography, soundtrack, or just overall vibe? Those little details usually help others decide what to watch next.\nBasically, I\u2019m trying to build a watchlist full of movies I might otherwise miss \u2014 the kind that remind you why you love cinema in the first place.

Again, both are fictional, but they really really do a great job at telling an emotion filled story. \n\nI know it was meant to be a murder mystery sort of thing, but honestly, I liked this better. Just as there's no conclusive truth to it (though I too agree with the murder hypothesis), that last conversation with the doctor really sort of cements how much of a burden he must've felt himself to be. \n\nI also really like the scenes from his deathbed, because they sort of show how he suffered throughout, how only Theo really was there but all he could do was hold his brother and watch through his suffering as was the case for their whole lives. The doctor who was supposed to help him, doesn't really do much, and everyone else thinks of him as too far gone to care. \n\nI know they could've just made it differently and for some the hand-drawn thing might've been difficult, which is what I expected, but I really appreciate the way they made this. \n\n",

        "content": "Just watched Saturday Night Fever because I was curious about John Travolta\u2019s role, but I knew nothing about the film other than disco before watching.\n\n  \nI was immediately pulled into Tony\u2019s glamorized nightlife and his status as the king of his local club. The music and dance sequences are electric, but what surprised me most was how much emotional weight sits underneath all that spectacle. Frank\u2019s character, even with the limited screen time he gets, really stuck with me. His quiet frustration and moral unease subtly push Tony toward seeing his life differently. I also loved the religious symbolism throughout, which adds to the sense of guilt, longing, and wanting something more.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, though, was how much the film trusts its audience. This film isn\u2019t endorsing the racism or misogyny it shows, it\u2019s portraying them as normalized parts of Tony\u2019s world that slowly leave him feeling empty. The injustice of the dance competition and the rape scene aren\u2019t there just for shock; they\u2019re meant to break Tony\u2019s illusions about success, masculinity, and belonging. Compared to a lot of modern movies, which often feel the need to spell out their morals, this approach feels refreshing. The film assumes you can think critically and sit with discomfort, and that makes it feel more honest and real.\n\nIt\u2019s been an interesting window into that time period. Definitely in my top 15 so far.",
