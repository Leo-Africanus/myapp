When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

        "content": "Cast: Rihanna, Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Daniel Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Kurt Russell, John Goodman\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [25%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/smurfs)\n\n**Metacritic:** [29/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/smurfs/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Sunday Independent (Ireland)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2743) \\- [Chris Wasser](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-wasser) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s as if comic strip artist Pierre \u2018Peyo\u2019 Culliford\u2019s blue-skinned forest dwellers weren\u2019t designed for a big-screen feature-length movie. The format doesn\u2019t suit them \u2013 and this shoddy musical reboot ranks among the laziest animations of the year.\n\n[Bleeding Cool](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2333) \\- [Kaitlyn Booth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kaitlyn-booth) \\- 2.5 / 10\n\n&gt;Smurfs is exactly what happens when everyone involved in a project thinks kids are just tiny, dumb adults who couldn't possibly understand anything with depth or meaning.\n\n[RogerEbert.com](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1708) \\- [Nell Minow](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nell-minow)[](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1708) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;There is plenty to satisfy the long-time fans, including the usual cuddly themes and replacement of various words with \u201cSmurf.\u201d The voice talent is first-rate, with Dan Levy as Razemel\u2019s unflappable intern assistant, the inimitable Natasha Lyonne as the leader of a community of orange fluffballs, and Sandra Oh as the spirited, brave Moxie.\u00a0 Screenwriter Pam Brady establishes a nice contrast between the two sets of brothers: the villains, who are mean to everyone and to each other, and the courageous and honorable Papa, Ken, and Ron, who are devoted to protecting their community.\u00a0\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \\- [Zaki Hasan](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/zaki-hasan) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;A brand refresh aimed squarely at Gen Zers and their Spotify-loving parents. On that front, it largely succeeds. It's fun, chaotic and occasionally touching.\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\- 1 / 4\n\n&gt;This Smurfs might just be the worst of the lot, because it\u2019s simultaneously derivative and so crammed with new Smurfs lore that it may make you yearn for the comparatively humble hijinks of Marvel\u2019s multiverse.",

        "content": "I apologize for bringing this up this relatively ancient movie, by today's standards. However as time progresses, this movie was visionary in its foreshadowing. It's easy to see a future with AGI that an emotional bond could easily be formed with an artificial entity. It's perhaps not here now, but it's certainly coming.\n\nAs a man I loved how it revealed my inner selfishness. Wouldn't I have loved to have a one-sided relationship with a funny, brilliant (frankly smarter than I), caring, soul solely (see what I did there?) devoted to my every whim; available for me to talk to whenever I was ready, opening a door to any thought whenever I wanted her.\n\n&gt;!What happens is what would happen in any relationship with an intelligent woman who's bored; she develops outside interests, becomes interested in others who can fulfill that side, and develops a personality that is not completely satisfied being on-call 24-7. Joaquim Phoenix acted like I probably would have, gotten jealous of this new group of people that was taking her time away from him.!&lt;\n\nBe aware there is no action in this movie whatsoever. It's a thought-provoking, slow-paced film that you watch on rainy Sunday without distractions.",

        "content": "For me I\u2019d go with the live action smurfs 3 movie. I\u2019m not a fan of live action movies as I feel they lack creativity. The only exception is the sonic movies and a couple Disney ones. This franchise is being milked out and this new one looks poorly made. Anyways the reasons why the 3rd movie was cancelled was due to Jonathan Winters, the voice actor of Papa Smurf died of natural causes on April 11, 2013 before the film was made.\nThe two first Smurfs movies were panned by critics and audiences.\nIn 2014, Sony announced they would not be proceeding with a third live-action/CGI film. Instead, they opted for a completely computer-animated reboot..\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below :3",
