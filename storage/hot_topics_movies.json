        "title": "Where have all the movies gone? (a streaming rant)",
        "content": "I subscribe to Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and a few smaller services like Dropout and Nebula.\n\nAnd yet every time I think of an older movie I want to watch, it's not on any of them. Sometimes it's on one of the services I don't subscribe to, like Peacock, but a lot of the time it doesn't seem to be available for streaming anywhere without \"renting\" it. \n\nAre we really back in the 90s where I've got to rent movies and make sure i finish them within 48 hours before my rental is up? \n\nI certainly prefer to watch movies straight through in one sitting, but I'm busy. I have a life, a toddler, and things that demand my attention. I'm lucky if I get an hour of uninterrupted time in an evening to watch stuff. I already pay for too many services; I shouldn't have to pay-per-view and still worry about finishing a movie before it expires. \n\nThis sucks. \n\nAs for buying physical media, that's a great solution... sometimes. But like a lot of people these days, I don't want to be tethered to my couch. I watch across a series of devices, from my TV in my house, to the TV in my shop, to my phone.\n\nAnd yes, I know about the high seas, but that's not for me. I *want* to stream content legitimately, but damn if they're not making it difficult. ",

        "title": "Since Hollywood is making a \u201cSocial Network 2\u201d they should also make a \u201cCatch Me if You Can 2\u201d. This time the REAL TRUE STORY on how a small time crook conned the world into believing he was a big time con man. This story is more incredible than the original",
        "content": "It\u2019s weird how sometimes I can find out supposed \u201ctrue stories\u201d play a little fast and loose with the facts and it just doesn\u2019t bother me. The film is so good and entertaining I don\u2019t care. Catch Me if You Can? It\u2019s not one of those films. \n\nMan, is a damn good film. Great music, script, acting, directing. It\u2019s incredible. It fires on all cylinders. Except one. The \u201ctruth\u201d cylinder(I can\u2019t believe i just wrote that. It\u2019s late. Give me a break). And this one gets to me. A lot. \n\nMany of you know by now Frank Abagnale is/was full of it. Most of the crap he claimed to do he never did. But the real story is how he was conning people all the while he was a supposed \u201cstraight arrow\u201d. He was never a cheque expert. Never worked for or with the FBI. He holds no patents. All his company does is peddle a shady cyber security subscription program that got caught selling its users data. \n\nThe real story is how this huge blockbuster movie came out, nominated for Academy Awards, made by the biggest names you could ever get for a movie at the time. Spielberg, Hanks, DiCaprio? Frank himself even did press for the movie!\n\nAnd not a single MAJOR newspaper, TV network or magazine looked into the shit Frank spew. How is that possible? Oh a few small papers did here and there. They went nowhere. Frank was still making insane speaking fees as of a few years ago. Telling the same lies. If this happened today? That shit would be everywhere. Spielberg conned by a small time crook? Hanks? Leo? JOHN WILLIAMS???\n\nThankfully his BS is a lot more well known, but all most people know is that most of the movie didn\u2019t happen as they say it happened. Most people can forgive that. They don\u2019t know about the real victims. The ones he was conning even after the books came out. Or the women he assaulted. \n\nI suggest everyone give this link a watch to find out the real truth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVe-NF75-2s\n\nSo I say a sequel deserves to get made. \u201cCatch Me If You Can, Again\u201d. If Zuckerberg &amp; Social Network are getting one, why not Frank &amp; Catch Me if You Can?\n\nIt should be about the failure of the mass media to do the thing they should be doing. Looking into and verifying unbelievable claims. That this guy was able to go as long as he did, as publicly as he did? It\u2019s a real indictment on the western media. Yet another one.",
