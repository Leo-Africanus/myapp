He\n\n- works hard\n- is generous with his friends and colleagues\n- has pain in his heart from childhood trauma but rather than feel sorry for himself, he tries to pay forward any kindness he has received\n- protects and provides for his loved ones\n- has compassion with those less fortunate than him\n- does the morally right thing despite overwhelming cost and risk to himself\n\nIt's a quiet but intensely profound film and it has deeply impressed and inspired me.",

Yesterday I watched The Menu for the first time and the only assumption I had of it was that it was maybe about food. Totally blown away by how good it was and ultimately what it was about. Such a great mix of black comedy with weird tense moments. If I had read a brief synopsis or watched the trailer, the unexpectedness of what takes place would have been ruined.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt doesn't always work out where I can avoid things like this; I saw the trailer for Companion and then read a comment about Jack Quaid begging people not to watch it, and I totally get that. Because any element of surprise for the film is ruined now. It happened last year with Longlegs too. Saw the trailer. Read the hype. Went to the cinema so excited to see it. Couldn't believe how terrible the second half was.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDoes anyone else purposefully try to set out and watch films this way; blind as a bat. And you only watch it because you hear the name bandied about so much?",

In the 90\u2019s I thought Bodi was such a bad ass dude-against-the-system spiritualist rebel. Now I watch it and think he\u2019s a self-serving prick that got a lot of people killed, and set in motion a situation where he could have gotten an ex-girlfriend tortured to death.\n\nToday when I watch it I wonder WTF Utah is doing just letting Bodi go surfing after he caused the deaths of undercover officers, his crew, and legit got Utah\u2019s partner shotgun blasted in the back. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just gonna\u2019 let him go surfing, bro?\u201d\n\nKind of amazing what I was cool with as a 90\u2019s teenager. Then Bodi seemed to have some sort of noble cause and I forgave him for a helluva lot of bad. Now I\u2019m like \u201cYooooo that dude belongs in a cage, man.\u201d\n\nThe same with the movie Heat, which was a favorite of mine in the 90\u2019s. As a teenager, I thought Deniro\u2019s character was awesome and rooted for him completely in the end to blow away struggling family-man Pacino, simply because he was cool and so Rock &amp; Roll on his heists. I watched it for the first time in forever recently and for the first time ever found myself rooting for Pacino at the end, which is a complete turn around from how I used to view this movie.\n\nIt\u2019s wild how you watch these movies tons of times in a different era of society and your own life and always experienced the movies one way, then you watch them again now and experience them a completely different way and wonder how you didn\u2019t always see it the same way despite numerous, numerous viewings.",

        "content": "Even more specifically, the actions and choices made by the characters directly impact the next event and make the situation worse or bigger somehow.\n\nThe best example I can think of is [this clip from Malcolm in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0). If you can't watch it, Hal has to fix a light bulb, so he grabs a light bulb, but notices a problem with the shelf. In doing so, he realizes the shelf is unstable, so he grabs a screwdriver from a drawer. The drawer, is squeaky, so naturally he looks for WD40 to correct that, but it's out. So he hops in his car to get some more WD40, and wouldn't you know it, his car won't start. Lois comes home and sees the light is out. She goes to the garage to tell Hal to change the light, and he yells back, exasperated, \"What does it look like I'm doing?!\"\n\nAnyway, what movies you can think of which more or less follow this kind of pattern with cascading chaotic sequences? What's the most entertaining example you can think of?",

It\u2019s a film that lingers in your mind, sparking conversation long after it\u2019s over.\n\nThe movie, based on the life of T. E. Lawrence, follows his efforts to unite Arabian tribes and lead them in a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. As an Arab that has bedu ancestry it is amazing how this film played out.",

        "content": "In the recent years when I've rewatched The Breakfast Club, I've noticed that Andrew (played by Emilio Estevez) is actually the best character in the movie in my opinion. Bender was my favorite after watching the movie for the first few times, but I think Andy is the best character because of how he is the only one in the film to defend almost everyone at some point in the movie. He defends Claire from Bender, Brian from Bender, and Allison from Claire. He liked Allison for who she was before the makeover scene and was the only one who actually checked in on her. He also did the worst thing out of the group to earn him detention, yet was the most remorseful about what he did. Andy was a well balanced character in the movie, being somewhat of a coward by ironically trying to put on a tough guy act for his father and friends for their approval. He also liked to think that he would be the one brave enough to be cool with the others when they went back to school on Monday. Andy is a flawed dude who still sinks under peer pressure, but has a good heart deep down and has the potential to still stand up for what he thinks is right. He's not the best just cause he's the jock/popular guy, but because he probably had the best heart out of everyone else in the group.\n",

        "content": "Just finished watching Atonement (2007) and thought it was excellent. The ending is bitter and frustrating so a great film overall with a wonderful cast who all went on to do well. \n\nBut my lord how loathsome is Briony Tallis. \n\nCan we all agree that there was no atonement in this film. Zero. Briony was arrogant and self-serving to the bitter end.\n\nShe ruins Robbie's (James McAvoy's) life with her lie resulting in his imprisonment and later death. And ruins his sister's (Keira Knightley's) life in turn who was waiting for him to return from war. \n\nShe then goes on to live a full and successful life as an author with this being her 21st novel and she has the audacity, arrogance and smugness to mislead further about how in the end she gave them their happy ending because they didn't get one in life as though this was a merciful act.\n\nThis just rings hollow as she has continued to fabricate her lies and mistruths condescendingly even in old age. There was no atonement or anything close. \n\nAt every opportunity she fails in correcting her lie other than this fanciful version of events she conjures up as to way to forgive herself. The final scene with her, as joyless as ever, caps it all off.\n\nEven in death she harvested their story for personal gain and acclaim only subverting what happened further.\n\nTLDR: Briony Tallis easily walks on to the shitlist for women in literature. \n\n ",

        "content": "So my parents rented this movie at blockbuster some time around 1999 give or take a few years. It was about a Mexican rapper that went on a crime spree. It's either real footage that they made into a doc or it's made to look real. It was convincing enough that my parents turned it off after this scene where there's a guy coming to an SUV to buy drugs. When he sits down a guy from behind him wraps some rope or wire around his neck and suffocates him. Like I said it's either real or made to look real by using regular video cameras and all that. And if it's fake these men are some of the best actors ever. The only other part I remember was some cctv footage of the rapper stabbing a guy with a screwdriver in a parking garage or something like that.",

        "title": "Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? ",
        "content": "There are lots of good addiction movies but I'm not sure how many are very realistic. Like take the case of Requiem for a Dream. It's a terrifying movie and a unique experience of horror but not so much a realistic drug movie. It's more like what if everything goes wrong times 100.\n\nSpecifically, it's sort  of a horror movie that uses drugs as its language, than a movie about what a life of addiction looks like. It gets some details wrong too, like in reality heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. But no denying the movie works great as anti-drug advertising. Show that to some young person to scare them straight.\n\nLeaving Las Vegas, in contrast, is a lot more \"realistic,\" or accurate in terms of what it's like for someone to abuse alcohol and become addicted. I find it to be one of Cage's best films. If you think Cage sucks as an actor, just watch this movie. Or if you think drinking is fun, just watch this movie to see how drinking can easily become a tool of self-destruction.\n\nThe movie is in some ways boring and depressing, nothing like your typical movies about people drinking and partying, but that's what alcoholism is. It's when you take refuge in drink, when you become its slave, when you drink because you have to and not because you want to. It's a slow suicide.\n\nSo my question is which addiction movies you find realistic, especially if you or someone you know has done drugs or alcohol.",
