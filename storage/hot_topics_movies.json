While Netflix is giving this visual feast just a three-week theatrical run ahead of its streaming debut, it begs to be experienced on the big screen.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi/) (95): \n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is a remarkable achievement that in a way hijacks the flagship story of the horror genre and turns it into a tale of forgiveness. James Whale, one suspects, would approve \u2013 and Mary Shelley, too.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/frankenstein-review-jacob-elordi-guillermo-del-toro-1235147197/) (B):\n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s second Netflix movie is bolted to the Earth by hands-on production design and crafty period detail. While it may be too reverently faithful to Mary Shelley\u2019s source material to end up as a GDT all-timer, Jacob Elordi gives poignant life to the most emotionally complex Frankenstein monster since Boris Karloff.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/30/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi star as the freethinking anatomist and his creature as Mary Shelley\u2019s story is reimagined with bombast in the director\u2019s unmistakable visual style\n\n[RadioTimes](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/frankenstein-review-2025-guillermo-del-toro/) (5/5):\n\n&gt;Perhaps its hyperbole to call the film del Toro\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 especially a story that has been told countless times. But this is a work that is the accumulation of three-and-a-half decades of filmmaking knowledge. Gory and grim it may be, but it is a tragic tale told in a captivating manner.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/frankenstein-review/ ) (80):\n\n&gt;Cleaving closely to the source material, del Toro wants to explore the trauma that makes us, mankind's capacity for cruelty, the death we bring on ourselves through war, and the catharsis of forgiveness \u2013 all notions that make Frankenstein relevant in current world politics and social media savagery.\n\n\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nWritten and Directed by Guillermo del Toro:\n\n&gt;A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.\n\nCast:\n\n* Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein\n   * Christian Convery as young Victor\n* Jacob Elordi as the Creature\n* Mia Goth as Elizabeth Lavenza\n* Christoph Waltz as Henrich Harlander\n* Felix Kammerer as William Frankenstein\n* Lauren Collins as Claire Frankenstein\n* Lars Mikkelsen as Captain Anderson\n* David Bradley as Blind Man\n* Sofia Galasso as Little Girl\n* Charles Dance as Leopold Frankenstein\n* Ralph Ineson as Professor Krempe\n* Burn Gorman as Fritz",

My thoughts: what a bizarre, unique, gem of a movie. Hard to even categorize. Yes it's a comedy, but only because it accurately reflects the absurdity of Stalinist politics. It manages to be over the top while staying basically true to history. The chaos, performative grief, scheming, and backstabbing following Stalin's death is played perfectly by a cast of heavy-hitters who make it all the more farcical by playing it straight. Overall, I really liked this movie, but it's probably not for everyone. Thoughts?",

However, when tragedy strikes and Hamnet dies at a young age, it inspires Shakespeare to write his timeless masterpiece \"Hamlet.\"*\n\nCast: Paul Mescal, Jessie Buckley, Joe Alwyn, Emily Watson\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamnet)\n\n**Metacritic:** [95/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hamnet/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Vulture - Bilge Ebiri](https://www.vulture.com/article/hamnet-review-the-most-devastating-movie-ive-seen-in-years.html)\n\n&gt;*Hamnet* is devastating, maybe the most emotionally shattering movie I\u2019ve seen in years. I did not really expect to cry *this* much. That\u2019s not just because of the tragic weight of the material, but because the picture reimagines the poetic act of creating *Hamlet*. Shakespeare\u2019s play sits on the highest shelf, fixed by the dust from centuries of acclaim. It is about as unimpeachable as a work of art can be. And yet, here is a movie that dares to explore its inception. The attempt itself is noble, and maybe a little brazen; that it succeeds feels downright supernatural.\n\n[Clayton Davis - Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/hamnet-telluride-oscars-buzz-jessie-buckley-paul-mescal-1236500107/)\n\n&gt;The moving and fictionalized portrait of grief and loss that inspired one of history\u2019s most treasured playwrights held the audience in its grip for 125-minutes, where audible sounds of sniffles and crying filled the venue, testifying to the film\u2019s emotional depth.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Daniel Howat](https://nextbestpicture.com/hamnet/) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Devastating in all the best ways, this is a gut-wrenching tale of the way grief pulls us apart, and how we try to pull ourselves back together again. Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s naturalistic, sensitive direction helps the heavy emotions take center stage. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal have never been better.\n\n[The Playlist - Gregory Ellwood](https://theplaylist.net/hamnet-review-jessie-buckley-paul-mescal-are-utterly-extraordinary-in-chloe-zhaos-expressionistic-wonder-telluride-20250830/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;But despite some stellar sequences throughout the entire film, Zhao saves her gut-punch for the final act. There are two moments in the last ten minutes of \u201cHamnet\u201d that may stick with you for months on end.\n\n[Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/hamnet-review-jessie-buckley-1236502623/)\n\n&gt;As conceived by \u201cNomadland\u201d director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, \u201cHamnet\u201d is so emotionally raw as to be almost excruciating at times, featuring a heroic performance from Jessie Buckley as Shakespeare\u2019s wife and the mother of his children \u2014 although as presented, she could be the mother of us all \u2014 the grounded, near-shamanic spirit forced to confront the death of her son, Hamnet. Meanwhile, Paul Mescal plays Shakespeare, who pours his grief into \u201cthe Danish play,\u201d but both the actor and character are eclipsed by the feminine elements of this story.",

Yes, there are some things that point to it being real, and I'll touch on why those are misleading later. \n\nBut first, the reasons I think it's all a dream.\n\nThe big smoking gun IMO is that the Rekall staff correctly predict *everything* that happens:\n\n* The guy selling Quaid on the \"trip\" lays out the high level plot line of the movie (the fancy hotel he stays at, the love interest, the landmarks he sees, the alien stuff)\n* While Quaid is going under the love interest he selects on the \"character creation\" screen is identical to the one he ends up meeting. One of the techs mentions \"blue sky on Mars? That's new\" which is what happens at the end of the movie. And if you watch the screens closely as he goes under, they briefly show the alien atmosphere generation plant where the climax takes place.\n\nBut perhaps most damning is the interaction he has with Dr. Edgemar in the Hilton hotel. First, notice that Dr. Edgemar is the same guy that appears in the Rekall commercial. Why would an agent working with Cohaagen also be doing Rekall commercials? But the most damning thing is what he warns Quaid will happen if he shoots him:\n\n&gt;The walls of reality will come crashing down.  One minute you'll be the savior of the rebel cause, then, next thing you know, you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.  You'll even have ridiculous fantasies about alien civilizations--as you requested.  But in the end, back on Earth...You'll be lobotomized.\n\nNotice *all* of this does happen after Quaid shoots him. He *does* become the savior of the rebel cause and then sure enough the next thing he knows he's Cohaagen's bosom buddy, and then after that he finds himself in alien ruins. But IMO the most important line is **\"the walls of reality will come crashing down\"** because as soon as Quaid shoots him *the walls literally come crashing down*. People may interpret that as a tongue-in-cheek warning that there's a bunch of goons on the other side of the hotel wall that will come crashing in (which they do), but that doesn't explain why for the rest of the movie *walls keep crashing down*. For example, when Quaid meets Kuato the walls in the catacombs *also* come crashing down. As was foretold, his new reality is crumbling down around him.\n\nThen, after being captured by Cohaagen, Quaid is placed in a Rekall machine to restore him to Hauser. There's an important line here that's easy to miss. As Quaid struggles to get out one of the techs warns him **\"If you don't keep still, you'll end up psychotic.\"** Remember how when Quaid wakes up in the Earth Rekall facility he's struggling to get out of the machine? That scene takes place *right after* he goes under. What if while going under Quiad had started to struggle? He would have dreamed about struggling, then had a psychotic break. Him being anesthetized in the dream might have just been the point where the dream finally took over and he calmed down. And indeed, it's right after that point that everything goes off the rails.\n\nBefore I go into why evidence suggesting all of it is real isn't as convincing as it might seem, I want to touch a little bit more on some of the above plot points:\n\n* Why would Richter attempt to have Quaid take a pill to (presumably) kill him in the hotel when he already had his armed agents ready to burst through the wall? Why not just burst through the wall without warning while his guard is down? Richter wasn't trying to take him alive since Cohaagen says he wasn't aware Quaid was a mole and Richter really was trying to kill him which nearly ruined everything. The scene doesn't make any sense *unless* Dr. Edgemar was telling the truth.\n* The alien atmosphere generator that's shown on screen in Rekall and the climactic fight scene couldn't have been known about by Rekall. At the start of the movie there's a newscast where they briefly mention \"rumors\" of a alien artifacts being found. Quaid also mentions to a guy on Mars that the alien stuff is just rumors. So there's no way Rekall could have had such an accurate representation of the atmosphere generator that gets shown on the screen, the same exact generator Quaid finds on Mars. It doesn't make sense unless the whole thing is a Rekall implant.\n* I hesitate to add this because expecting scientific accuracy in an 80s/90s sci-fi action flick is silly, but there's no way that one alien plant could have added an Earth-like atmosphere to Mars in less than a minute.\n\nNow there are some reasons to think it wasn't a dream and I'll explain why I don't think those are very convincing vs. what I've talked about so far:\n\n* The side-eyes Quaid gets from his wife and coworker when talking about going to Rekall. Obviously this can be interpreted as them being agents the whole time and knowing to keep Quaid away from Rekall, but this could also just be Rekall's bad safety reputation making them concerned that Quaid might be so obsessed with Mars that he takes the risk.\n* There are scenes without Quaid in them. A lot of people argue this proves it has to be real, because Quaid isn't there so if it's his dream how would those scenes be happening? My argument is that it's a movie and its easier to tell the story with those sorts of scenes. But ignoring the movie aspect, I don't think it's a leap to suggest that the Rekall implant works like a video game that has NPCs doing their own thing even if you're not around.\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he thinks everything that happens in the movie is real. But of course that's his view, he was playing the character who thinks it's all real. The director, meanwhile, has said the opposite, that it is Quaid having a psychotic break and the fade to white at the end is him getting lobotomized.\n\nTo whoever made it this far, thanks for reading. What your thoughts? What do *you* think happened?\n\n",

It\u2019s not as virtuoso a blend of social commentary and wacko violence as, say, Park\u2019s countryman and occasional collaborator Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite,\u201d but it\u2019s a kick nonetheless.",

It\u2019s hard to imagine the under-30 set recognizing the significance of a star of Springsteen\u2019s stature making an album in his bedroom \u2014 not his first, but his sixth, which made it all the more radical \u2014 effectively paving the way for the DIY indie-rock sound that followed.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/springsteen-deliver-me-from-nowhere-movie-review-1235148204/) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;\\[Jeremy Allen White\\] doesn\u2019t look a ton like Springsteen... but his performance is steeped in a truth so natural and unforced that by the end of the film you almost forget that he\u2019s playing someone else. Cooper\u2019s film wants to be the \u201cNebraska\u201d of rock biopics, but it lacks the finesse to retain the essence of that sound when transferring it into the body of a commercial biopic. In that sense at least, it all too perfectly articulates how difficult it can be too move forward when something is holding you back.\u00a0\n\n",
