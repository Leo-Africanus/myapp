        "content": "I consider the Star Trek reboot trilogy, especially Star Trek (2009) to be among the very best action movies made in this IP era. The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.",

I remember really liking \"Pet Detective\" and feeling let down by \"When Nature Calls\" because it failed to improve upon or at be as good as it's predecessor.\n\nThe Miami setting and detective mystery setting of PD lends itself better to Ace Ventura. In PD, Ace Ventura is annoying and strange to everyone around him, but he gets away wirh it because he is actually a good detective\u200b. Also, Ace isn't as much of a bad ass in WNC. He can catch a bullet with his teeth, but he can't dodge a sphere? His character just seemed inconsistent in the sequel.\n\nDoes anyone agree? Disagree? Let me know!\n\nEdit: I do agree that WNC has a lot of great lines and some great scenes. It did get a few cackles from me. I guess I just prefer PD overall.",

To the point that some shots of John have significantly different lighting despite taking place in the same scene. \u200bIt seems pretty clear that someone thought that they should somehow include John Wick in the spinoff for marketing reasons and trashed the sister storyline for that, replacing it with what we got.

Especially the scene where he helped Lois rescue Superman. The music was a bonus - perfect. \n\nNathan was as perfect as Guy Gardner. I never expected that. He made the perfect comic book to film. Hope we get more. ",

I'm sure we'll still get glimpses of his old stunt crazed Ethan Hunt persona in Top Gun 3 or the rumored Days of Thunder sequels if or when they finally move forward but I wouldn't mind seeing a return of the Tom Cruise from Last Samurai, Tropic Thunder or Mangolia. The dumb action stuff is great but I think everyone wants to see him do something different and fresh. ",
