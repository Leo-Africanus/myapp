        "title": "I rewatched all of Tom Cruise\u2019s films from Endless Love (1981) to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023) and ranked the 295 running moments in his filmography.",
        "content": "Earlier this year, in anticipation of the release of [*Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning*](https://youtu.be/fsQgc9pCyDU), I decided to rank all of Tom Cruise\u2019s running scenes in the *M:I* franchise. I\u2019d worked on several *M:*I data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the 100ish running moments. When the list was completed - it felt incomplete, so I decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography. Starting with 1981\u2019s *Endless Love*, and finishing with 2023's *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning*. Cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films, so I decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list.\n\n**Quick note** \\- His X handle always makes me laugh\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nipy05v8czwe1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ad8d85fd8050287ab4770953933c0844f559f1\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the list:\n\n* I found and ranked 295 moments\u00a0\n* I counted running, sprinting and jogging. The amount of time doesn\u2019t matter either. In *Top Gun* there\u2019s a one-second shot of [him running to hit a volleyball](https://youtu.be/okyLAKclleo). It was included.\u00a0\n* A short blurb was included for list items 295 - 26\n* Timestamps have been included for the top 25. Some of the timestamps may be a little off for you. It depends on where/how you watch the movies. For me, it was a mixture of DVDs, Blu-rays, Vudu and streaming channels.\u00a0\n* I researched the top 10 scenes and wrote more about them (and included YouTube links)\n* This list is obviously subjective, but after going through Cruise\u2019s filmography for the fourth time since 2018, I am very happy with the top 10\n* There is zero chance that our lists will match up, so don\u2019t be surprised if the 295 moments don\u2019t line up with your list.\u00a0\n* For some of the scenes, I split them up into moments. I just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else - I split up the running moment into parts.\u00a0\n* If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the top 10 and this list, I recorded a podcast episode about the  data collection and ranking process. It\u2019s fun. You should listen to it. The podcast is called [*Movies, Films and Flix*](https://www.spreaker.com/episode/bonus-episode-the-tom-cruise-running-special--65723787) \\- you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I also have a show called *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* that you should listen to as well.\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s the list!**\n\n295.

The Firm - Chases after Abbey - This is the first time we ever get to see Tom\u2019s super running form.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\n**Top 25!**\n\n\n\n25. *Collateral* \\- Subway running followed by a beautiful jump - Dude is pissed. - 01:46:10\n\n24. *The Mummy* \\- \u201cSlip in, slip out. Just like we always do.\u201d Then it cuts to them being shot at whilst running away. - 00:10:15\n\n23. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Keep going straight? - He runs into an office building and smashes a window. 01:34:53\n\n22. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Why is he running in a circle? Great overhead shot of cruise sprinting up stairs, losing the goons, and running around the upper floors of the cathedral. - 01:32:59\n\n21. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Roof running and two amazing jumps. - 01:33:48\n\n20. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- During the bathroom fight Hunt runs at a guy and slams him through a wall. Great stuff. I love how he really doesn\u2019t want to do it. - 00:32:38\n\n19. *Minority Repor*t - Runs up to the house and has to stop a potential murder. - 00:15:28:00\n\n18. *Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol* \\- Runs away from the Burj Khalifa - Looks awesome. Brad Bird shoots it from every angle. I love how the camera looks up at him.\n\n17. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- \u201cEthan he\u2019s getting away from you, you\u2019re going to have to go faster! - Cruise absolutely books it during a roof run that ends with the jump that broke his foot. Epic. - 01:34:20\n\n16. *Jerry Maguire* \\- Airport running. - 02:06:05\n\n15. *Mission: Impossible II* \\- He runs in slow motion so he can jump out of a building - Wonderful - 01:25:58 - He also runs while holding two guns (and shooting them at the same time). Awesome hair work\n\n14. *Risky Business* \\- He takes a drunk guy out of a train and runs back into it. - 01:20:45\u00a0\n\n13. *Days of Thunder* \\- He races Robert Duvall - It\u2019s a good time. 01:42:54\n\n12. *War of the Worlds* \\- Cruise runs away from the aliens. Amazing scene. - The aliens are silly for thinking they can blow Cruise up. Dude has ash all over his face. - 00:26:29\n\n11. *Collateral* \\- Runs out of a hospital and across an overpass. When he starts running I don\u2019t think he'll ever look faster on screen. - 00:52:25\n\n  \n\n\n**10.** ***Edge of Tomorrow*** \\- \u201cArrest this man.\u201d - In an all-timer Cruise moment, he tries to escape arrest and It ends badly - 00:07:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/EO4Mt9DDV-Q)\u00a0\n\nMoments before Brendan Gleeson\u2019s character yells \u201cArrest this man,\u201d Tom Cruise delivers an all-timer Cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered:\n\n\u201cI just inspired millions of people to join your army. And when the body bags come home and they\u2019re looking for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you? I\u2019d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.\u201d\n\nCruise enters Gleeson\u2019s office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly. It\u2019s perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting. Director Doug Liman did a great job weaponizing Cruise\u2019s charm in this scene, and It\u2019s fun watching a guy who can\u2019t escape an office building becoming a world-saving soldier.\n\n\n\n**9.** ***The Firm*** \\- The final chase scene. He runs, jumps, goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed AND he\u2019s holding a briefcase. 02:12:23 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vCzkK_AJ0&amp;pp=ygUUVGhlIGZpcm0gY2hhc2Ugc2NlbmU%3D)\u00a0\n\n*The Firm* is Cruise\u2019s first film to fully showcase his soon-to-be-famous running form (elbows and knees). We get a glimpse of it at the 68-minute mark when he\u2019s chasing down Jeannie Tripplehorn. But, it\u2019s not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as he\u2019s running away from Tobin \u201cJigsaw\u201d Bell.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**8.** ***Far and Away*** \\- In a neat transition,\u00a0 Cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion. Talk about explosive running.\u00a0 01:40:13 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/NajSnF9AspA)\u00a0\n\nI love how Ron Howard cuts from a sprinting Tom Cruise to an explosion. It\u2019s silly and it always puts a smile on my face. I also love that the movie ends with the Land Run of 1893.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**7.** ***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** \\- Cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car. It is very funny and the MI score helps make it better - 01:12:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/WK8X6m_wEbg)\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is *Mission: Impossible*, I can\u2019t just cross a street and get in a car.\u201d - McQuarrie talking about a conversation he had with Cruise on the *Rogue Nation* commentary.\u00a0\n\nWhen putting together the top 10 I always knew that this three-second moment would be included. It\u2019s a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that Cruise doesn\u2019t take himself seriously. It\u2019s made even better by the knowledge that Cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his ill-fated car jump. Also, the ensuing dialogue (What are you talking about?) is delightful. At this point in his career, Cruise was on a hot streak and it\u2019s fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**6.** ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout*** \\- Iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot - Dude looks amazing and he almost catches Cavill - 01:36:25 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/Sjn3ELLcy2U)\n\n\u201cI loved doing this, but it hurt.\u201d - Tom Cruise - *Fallout* Blu-ray commentary.\u00a0\n\nWatching Cruise run across The Blackfriars Railway bridge is an all-timer Cruise moment for multiple reasons.\u00a0\n\n* It looks great and is a perfect trailer moment\n* \u201cI\u2019m jumping out of a window.\u201d - Great line - I love the reaction he gets from the people in the office. They\u00a0\n* Tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry\n* Director Christopher McQuarrie said - \u201cHe was going for it.\u201d\n* The score rules\n* It\u2019s a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story.\n\n\n\n**5**. ***Mission: Impossible*** \\- Cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first \u201cI look awesome while running in an action film\u201d work. - 31:59 - Lots of fish die\u2026.. [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8HHeT4Eo6A&amp;pp=ygUiTWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIGZpc2ggcmVzdGF1cmFudNIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D)\n\nThat one was particularly very crazy - Talking about the scene on The Graham Norton Show\n\nTom Cruise was already a big star in 1996, but this moment made him a gigantic \u201caction movie\u201d star. He had been in *Top Gun* (sitting in a plane), *Legend* (lots of rolling and crouch running), Days of Thunder (*more sitting*), Far and Away (*boxing*), and *The Outsiders* (fisticuffs), but *Mission: Impossible* saw him entering a new phase of his career. This moment was everywhere in 1996 and it\u2019s one of the most iconic images of the *Mission: Impossible* franchise. It gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from Tom.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**4.** ***Risky Business*** \\- A cigarette-smoking Cruise (wearing sunglasses at night) runs up to some teenagers while the song \u201cMannish Boy\u201d plays on the soundtrack This is the moment when Cruise became Tom Cruise - 01:07:26 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/adZvM19Qnb0) (starts at 53 seconds)\n\nWearing a suit coat, black shirt, black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette, Cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates. The moment lasts only seven seconds,\u00a0 but it\u2019s a turning point for Cruise. Also, the song selection is perfect.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**3.** ***Vanilla Sky*** \\- Cruise runs through an empty Times Square - 00:03:37 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/-kNdNC-2wPU)\n\nThe groundwork for the Times Square running in *Vanilla Sky* was set up in the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*. In the Cameron Crowe-directed movie, Cruise dramatically runs through an airport -\u00a0 and it looks great. Years later, while filming *Vanilla Sky*, Crowe and Cruise pulled some strings with the city of New York and were able to close down Times Square for three hours on a Sunday morning in November. The idea was that Cruise\u2019s character hates being alone, and he dreams that he\u2019s alone in one of the busiest places in the world. It\u2019s total vanity, but I love that Cruise has a running scene in an empty Times Square.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**2.** ***Collateral*** \\- He throws a chair through a glass window, then WIPES out on the chair and just keeps running. It\u2019s his most aggressive running ever. - 01:44:50 -[ YouTube Clip (starts at 2:37)](https://youtu.be/_pTzb4rl5Y8)\n\n*Collatera*l not only features the best sitting performance of Tom Cruise\u2019s career, it also features his most aggressive running. Tom\u2019s character Vincent is a straight-up killer and it\u2019s fun watching Cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightning-fast footwork. There\u2019s a moment towards the end when Vincent is chasing down Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith - running in heels), and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it. However, Cruise mistimed/misjudged the chair\u2019s trajectory and he WIPED out on the chair and fell to the ground. The neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running. It\u2019s a perfect showcase for Cruise\u2019s tenacity and toughness and I love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film - and so does Mann who felt like it added to the realism of *Collateral*. It\u2019s a seconds-long moment, but I love that nothing can stop Cruise from running.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**1.** ***Mission: Impossible III*** \\- Cruise runs across some rooftops and then he SPRINTS through a Shanghai fishing village - 01:44:10 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqV-jDl0h8&amp;pp=ygUhbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDMgc2hhbmdoYWkgcnVu0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)\n\nIn 2006, Cruise had been running in movies for 20+ years and had some memorable sprints in *War of the Worlds, The Firm, Minority Report, Collatera*l, and *Far and Away*. However, his sprinting in *M:I 3* (which took 6-7 takes to get perfect) made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history. It\u2019s the fastest Cruise has ever looked, and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside Cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the Shanghai sidewalks. During the Blu-ray commentary, director J.J. Abrams says \u201cI loved watching you run\u201d to Cruise, and I totally agree. It\u2019s apex Tom Cruise running.\n\n  \n**Make sure to check out my other** [**Reddit data posts**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LundgrensFrontKick/) **if you like this one!

        "content": "Just rewatched Whiplash and that ending hit different this time. Everyone talks about how epic the final scene is and it is but TBH it kind of cemented how much Andrew completely lost the plot by then.\n\nThe whole movie builds up this toxic cycle between him and Fletcher, and yeah, it looks like Fletcher is the manipulative villain while Andrew is just this ambitious underdog. But by the end, it\u2019s not that simple. Andrew needs Fletcher\u2019s validation. He\u2019s been so brainwashed that he\u2019ll go to any length for that one moment of acknowledgment.\n\nAnd Fletcher.. well he\u2019s a wreck too. He loses his job, his respect, everything but still clings to this idea that greatness only comes from suffering. In that final scene, he basically traps Andrew, tries to humiliate him and Andrew still gives him what he wants. It\u2019s messed up. They\u2019re not enemies, they\u2019re enablers.\n\nThere\u2019s no real \u201cwinner\u201d here. They both pushed each other past the edge. And while it ends with that incredible solo, it\u2019s not triumphant. It\u2019s tragic. Andrew isn\u2019t free..he\u2019s all in, and there\u2019s no coming back. He\u2019s chasing this impossible standard that\u2019ll probably destroy him.",

        "content": "I love watching this stuff late at night. Not like the A list ones like Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs...  but the direct to vid kind. Not horror but more thriller territory.\n\nThese movies have a bunch of things in common... besides being on Tubi...\n\n* They\u2019ve all been\u00a0remastered\u00a0and look great... not those cheap, oversaturated digital transfers you sometimes get with obscure titles.\n* 2) They're all real decently-made B-indie thrillers not like super cheepos.\n* 3) They involve serial killers.\n* 4) Most have surprisingly solid casts and a few have well regarded directors.\n* 5) They're all a little bit weird.\n\n**Fear City**  \nThis one was a real surprise. Directed by\u00a0Abel Ferrara, it stars\u00a0Billy Dee Williams, a young\u00a0Tom Berenger, and an about-to-be-famous\u00a0Melanie Griffith. The plot centers around a serial killer targeting strippers and their bosses in NYC. Billy Dee plays a hard-as-nails cop with some raw, standout scenes... he\u2019s seriously great in this. Everyone is, actually except the killer, oddly. You see him early (not a reveal), and he's almost laughably bad, like a weirdly silent rock trying to act. Still, it works in its own unhinged way.\n\n**The Killer Hour 1982 (the** clairvoyant)  \nA serial killer is handcuffing victims in bizarre ways. A psychic develops a strong connection to the case. Meanwhile, a TV talk show host (a young Perry King) sees it as a chance to boost his career, and a detective caught between them (also trying to be a comedian doing impressions) is trying to solve the case while navigating friendships and romance. lol\n\n**Stranger by Night 1994**  \nSteven Bauer\u00a0is terrific as a detective who\u2019s blacking out and starting to believe he might actually be the killer he\u2019s hunting. Classic B-movie setup: clunky side characters and obvious plot points, and feels very direct to video but Bauer's performance really grounds it and makes it work better than you'd expect.\n\n**Blind Date 1984**  \nThis one is\u00a0really\u00a0*strange*. A photographer, still obsessed with his ex, thinks her new boyfriend might be a serial killer. While spying on them, the boyfriend chases him, and he runs into a tree and goes\u00a0blind. From there, the movie totally shifts gears into a sort of tech-drama as he learns to navigate the world again with the help of a computer system that lets him \"see\" in stick figures. This is most of the movie oddly. Eventually, we return to the serial killer plot very late in the film. It\u2019s unevenly paced, but it kept me watching.\n\n**The Rain Killer 1990**  \nSet in a gloomy, rainy L.A., a serial killer is murdering women, and the lead detective has a personal connection to the case. This one sits firmly in B-movie territory but has a decent lead and a noir-ish vibe that gives it some style.\n\n**Traces in Red 1992**  \nMore serial killings, more cops, more partners, and lots of tangled personal relationships.\u00a0Jim Belushi\u00a0stars, and your enjoyment will probably depend on your tolerance for Belushi doing Belushi things. It's B-movie cheese fun if you're in the right mood.\n\n**Killer's Delight 1976**  \nMid-70s grindhouse vibes. A serial killer is stalking young women across California. Misogynistic. A determined cop is on the case. It\u2019s pretty by-the-numbers, but as a time capsule of '70s California, it\u2019s got style and charm.\n\n**The Stranger 1987**  \nBonnie Bedelia\u00a0(the wife from\u00a0Die Hard) plays a woman with amnesia after a traumatic accident. Someone is trying to kill her, and she doesn\u2019t know why. Her doctor tries to piece together her returning memories before it\u2019s too late. A nice mix of psychological thriller and slasher.\n\n**The Banker 1989**  \nThe title is misleading... he's not really a banker. He\u2019s a psycho killing prostitutes for a South American god or something with a crossbow. Glossy late-\u201880s vibes, sleazy charm, and an awkward killer setup make this one stand out a bit. Supporting role for Grease/Taxi star Jeff Conaway. He's seen better days. But Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) raises the bar here.\n\nAnd finally the one that got me into the rabbit hole...\n\n**NIGHT GAME (1989)**  \nRoy Scheider is great as usual as a Texas cop tracking (not a shark this time) a serial killer targeting young women in a coastal town, all while the Astros chase a playoff spot. The film is misogynistic... even by late '80s standards, with graphic kills, macho cops, and Scheider\u2019s character engaged to a woman 25 years his junior, which feels icky. Still, it\u2019s well-acted and nicely shot. While light on action, it delivers a solid investigation and plenty of scene-chewing, character-driven dialogue as it dips into slasher territory. A flawed but entertaining watch.",

        "content": "Director: Gareth Evans\n\nCast: Tom Hardy,  Jessie Mei Li, Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker, Justin Cornwell\n\nLogline: *After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/havoc_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [59/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/havoc/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-netflix-1236198216/)\n\n&gt;With Hardy in fine form at the wheel, *Havoc* knows what its audience wants. It also looks great, with regular Evans DP Matt Flannery\u2019s dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors. The setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night. The fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in Cardiff suggests there\u2019s lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in Wales.\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1842207/havoc-movie-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;To be clear: I love a good, violent action movie as much as the next dude, but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another. Perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better. Instead, it's just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion. By the time \"Havoc\" ended, I felt as exhausted as Hardy's beaten and bruised character. I suppose Evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality, but there's only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-1236375320/)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a reason big-studio producers looked to Sundance darlings like Colin Trevorrow, Rian Johnson and Jon Watts to handle their tentpoles: not because those guys are great at action, but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting. That\u2019s precisely where Evans wreaks the most havoc, ignoring (or simply not understanding) what connects us to such characters in the first place \u2014 and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy Netflix vehicle is dead on arrival.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/havoc/) \\- 6/10\n\n&gt;After years of waiting, it feels like \u201cHavoc\u201d was never going to reach the pre-conceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to. It\u2019s clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography (mainly due to Hardy\u2019s more than apparent changes in beard thickness), there\u2019s doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that Evans envisioned. Still, when \u201cHavoc\u201d hits, it only reminds us how awesome it feels when Evans gets to do his own thing. Even a flawed Gareth Evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today.\n\n[Empire - Beth Webb](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/havoc/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;There\u2019s also something refreshingly egoless to it; Hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head. Around him Evans utilities his full cast, throwing greener actors like Quelin Sepulveda, who plays Charlie\u2019s partner Mia, into the eye of the storm, armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive. The result is a throbbing, bone-crunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying, glorious flourish (you\u2019ll never want to see a fishing harpoon again).\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;Instead of elaborate exchanges of close-quarters strikes and counters, the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second. Despite the advanced choreography that Evans and Flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the *Raid* movies, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic.\n\n[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tom-hardys-havoc-review-the-action-extravaganza-of-the-year/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* is such relentless, hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist. Nonetheless, those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga, whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat. Disappointingly, Evans (who wrote the script) shortchanges Olyphant in a role that\u2019s barely one-dimensional and receives no stand-out moments\u2014to a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with Hardy. The director makes up for it, however, with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpses\u2014and set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass, splinter, and bodily debris\u2014that tips the material into sensory-overload territory.\n\n[Collider - Tania Hussain](https://collider.com/havoc-movie-review-netflix-tom-hardy/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* might deliver on its promise of blood, guts, and glory, but it\u2019s these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its self-induced chaos. While the vision by Evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler, it rarely lands with meaning, which also feels like an injustice to the filmmaker\u2019s incredible past work. Despite a top-tier cast and bone-rattling action to keep you engaged, the Netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution. It\u2019s watchable, even entertaining in bursts \u2014 but beneath all the bruises and broken bones, there\u2019s not much else to hold onto.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/havoc-review-netflix-tom-hardy-1235117850/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter) \\- B-\n\n&gt;Rote as Evans\u2019 plot might be, and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters *definitely* is (pour one out for Jessie Mei Li, whose screen time as Walker\u2019s new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story), he has a well-developed ear for ice-cold gangster speak, and he isn\u2019t afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance. It\u2019s enough to forgive him \u2014 and/or the movie gods \u2014 for making us wait so long to see him do it again.\u00a0",

I think it captures quite well what's wrong with \"civilized men\", in particular, to how we relate to more \"primitive societies\", and I think it has a very strong moral message, or perhaps a few! In addition, I think the story is quite entertaining and inspiring. Watch where you drop your Coke bottle!",

And then I was surprised to see it had Brendon Gleeson and had to marvel at why such a good actor would do this movie. The movie was soo different from the other stuff he normally does, I wonder why he choose to do the project. His performance was so over the top, a stark contrast from his measured and subtle acting in most of his other roles. He must have been given a great pay day. ",
