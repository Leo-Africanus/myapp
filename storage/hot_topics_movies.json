        "content": "Hi all, I went to see the new biblical horror movie *The Carpenter's Son* featuring Nicolas Cage and FKA Twigs this evening. The movie was alright, but something very strange happened at my AMC (Boston Commons 19). When I went to check my seat the app said the movie was sold out, which is strange given the controversial nature of the film and the little advertising its received. What's even stranger is that the entire theater was empty save for 1 other person. After the film ended I checked the AMC app to find out that the 7:30pm showing was also completely sold out. Tomorrow's showings are seemingly normal, but I am wondering if this happened anywhere else. My theory is that some church or religious media org bought up the tickets to stop people from seeing the film, but that has no backing lol. I am posting this hoping to see if anyone else experiences this. Besides this strange happening I would recommend the film, especially if you enjoy Nicolas Cage!",
