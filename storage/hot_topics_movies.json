        "title": "Introducing the Fantasy Box Office Game: Two years ago I met a redditor who was running a Fantasy Box Office League game from an Excel spreadsheet and now it\u2019s a fully functional website. Get ready for the 2026 Box Office year with us!",
        "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

        "content": "I watched the 2025 Frankenstein a day before watching Children of Men. I was about to joke how Frankenstein shows how badly men want to give birth and this film was definitely inspired by that but I can't.\n\nIt's too beautiful for that. The dystopian world in the film might seem hopeless but characters portray otherwise. There is this slick contrast between the world and the characters. They reek of courage and hope unlike the world.\n\nThe famous scene shot in one take when the fishes and army ceasfires after hearing a baby's cry is such a powerful one. For a moment the world seems full of hope and peace; all because of a baby. Only for the firing to begin right after. This as per me is a contrast between the world we can have and the world we have made into our reality. We keep getting glimpse of this hopeful world through different characters be it Theo, Julian, Jasper, Miriam, Marichka, the family that helped them and finally everyone; from the people in the building to the army when there was ceasefire.\n\nPersonally speaking I feel like this film portrays today's situation really well. We might not be infertile(yet) but the hatred people seem to have for one of their own knows no bound. Looking at it; everything may seems like the end of the world but then you meet someone like Theo, Julian, Jasper or Marichka and the world starts glimmering with hope.\n\nAlright, that's it. Thank you for listening to my Ted talks and I hope everyone of you get pregnent quickly.",

        "content": "So I\u2019ll admit when I first saw the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol starring Jim Carey, I was kind of unimpressed. Another Polar Express style film, this time costing 200 million dollars(!!!), of a movie we\u2019ve seen dozens of iconic adaptations for. \n\nBut then one year I caught it on TV and was just blown away by Jim Carey\u2019s Scrooge. And now it\u2019s become what I consider to be the best Christmas Carol adaptation. It\u2019s neck &amp; neck with Mickeys Christmas Carol(whose only weakness is that it\u2019s not long enough!). Yet it\u2019s Jim Carey who really impresses me. This is not phoned in, not just another role. The man gives it his all and gives what I think is one of his finest performances. \n\nI can\u2019t say it enough. Carey is a stunning here. He plays multiple roles(including 2 of the Ghosts) but his Scrooge is something else. I honestly believe that had this been live action instead of animated, he might\u2019ve received an Oscar nomination. \n\nHis performance in the \u201cGhost of Christmas Past\u201d sequence really gets to me. \u201cI could walk it blind folded\u201d. This is a Scrooge who seems generally amazed &amp; awed by the things he\u2019s seeing. \n\nI think a lot of people get turned off on the movie because it\u2019s done in that Polar Express motion capture style. There\u2019s one or two moments when the technology keeps us at an arms length but generally I find the visuals here to be terrific. Scrooge flying through the city, in the night sky? Great stuff. \n\nSo for those of you out there who maybe got turned off from the motion capture style, i really suggest giving this film another shot. I did and I\u2019m so thankful. It\u2019s just a wonderful Christmas film with a very underrated Jim Carey performance.",

        "content": "There's this low budget Japanese cult movie called Versus from 2000 or so that I was obsessed with as a kid. It's basically about a bunch of Yakuza that guys go to meet up with some escaped convicts in a forest where all the people they've killed over the years start rising from the dead, and it turns out both the convicts and the boss they were waiting for are more than they seem.\n\nNow according to the filmmakers, especially the director, the lead actor Tak Sakaguchi delivers his dialogue terribly in a lot of scenes, which I guess is unsurprising for an early effort from an inexperienced director like Ryuhei Kitamura was. I don't know if he's wooden in his inflection, emotes incorrectly, or what because I can't speak a single sentence of Japanese.\n\nRobert Rodriguez also speculated about his breakout feature El Mariachi that he figured Americans took it more seriously and got more out of it because the fact it was in subtitled Spanish convinced them it must be more highbrow that the kind of silly, contrived B movie that it he felt it actually was. One of the lead villains was 19 years old and delivered his lines very woodenly in Spanish but looked old enough to still be intimidating to an English speaker. \n\nAre there any movies you've seen from your home country being watched by people in other countries where you think you'd enjoy them less if they were native speakers of your language?",

        "content": "Edit: I think I've figured out why I'm responding to this material the way I am. Lately I've been watching a number of short videos giving coaching tips about what makes for good and bad acting, and what makes for a good audition. There is a striking similarity between the way Fay Grim's characters deliver their lines, and what is being sold as bad acting based on contemporary guidance! \n\nI'm a big fan of Parker Posey. I know she is one of those performers whose style is idiosyncratic. It's why she turns up in so many peculiar, almost niche roles. When I saw she was the lead in Fay Grim I was instantly excited.\n\nHaving watched this, I'm now a little baffled. There's something \"off\" about the storytelling. Aside from the choice to shoot or display the frames at skewed angles (we used to call it shooting for porn) there's something about the stilted delivery of the lines that seems to be trying to evoke a particular style that isn't typical, but that also doesn't feel new.\n\nIt's like the director is trying to evoke film noir, but somehow there's something that feels 80s about the execution.\n\nDoes anyone know what I'm talking about? Can anyone shed light on the weird energy this film is conveying?",

        "content": "I\u2019m rewatching Dark of the Moon and I forgot how much casual mass murder happens the whole time on screen. You really see it first with the Laserbeak blasting families in their home and pushing Ken Jeong out of a window. Then the car chase on the DC highway when they just start flattening cars left and right - there\u2019s a weird blood splatter effect when Transformers start transforming that feels odd because we know the robots don\u2019t bleed red. \n\nThen when Sentinel and the Decepticons take over Chicago, they just start vaporizing people on screen. When Sam and his buddies roll up, they\u2019re attacked and the incoming craft literally turns people into skeletons a l\u00e1 Sarah Connor\u2019s dream in Terminator 2. Sam definitely tries to blunt force trauma + electrocute Dylan on screen and Optimus does some gnarly mutilation to Megatron with a shotgun execution to Sentinel. \n\n\nIt\u2019s nice to see, because frankly for all the massive fights that happen in all the movies, they typically gloss over the fact that thousands of people are probably obliterated in these massive skyscraper destruction scenes (e.g. Shockwave).",
