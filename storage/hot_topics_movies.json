When she actually says it at the end and the music plays it like it\u2019s a twist, I was like \u201cwait, this wasn\u2019t just a given? I thought this was crystal clear from the beginning?\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a few movie twists like that where the director clearly thought it was a twist and you\u2019re just like\u2026 really? THAT is a twist? It would have been a bigger twist for that NOT to be the case. \n\nThe other one for me was Charlize Theron being a bad guy in Reindeer Games. The whole time I was watching it I just kept waiting for the moment she\u2019d do something psychotic. And she does. \n\nBy the way what doesn\u2019t count is if everyone kinda new going into a big franchise movie what would happen. Like a lot of people went into Infinity War 99% sure a lot of people were going to die. That doesn\u2019t really count. I\u2019m talking movies that at least pretended like you were supposed to be surprised by a twist. ",

It was previously released on DVD and blu ray but they are both long out of print and have never been given another release, it's not even available for streaming.\n\nSome people believe it may have something to do with music clearance rights with the soundtrack but there is no definite answer as to why Disney and 20th Century Fox haven't given this gem a new release.

Honestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting much because a lot of new releases nowadays feel kind of corny. But this one completely surprised me. It made me laugh, and I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good! I was hooked from start to finish, especially with how the plot took unexpected twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. The way the real Santa Claus stepped up in the story gave me chills, it was like watching a Christmas John Wick.\n\nI\u2019d give it a solid 7. I loved Santa Claus in this movie! Sure, it\u2019s violent (the title says it all), but it was so much fun and it made me smile, so I had to write about it here. If you still haven\u2019t watched it, go check it out on Netflix. I wish Santa was real and honestly, that version of Santa was super cool!",

        "content": "I watched the first season of True Detective in the course of the last weeks and I was totally blown away, especially by the performance of McConaughey and also by how well written his character was. It made me want to re-watch Interstellar, since I remembered his acting to be really good in this one, as well. \n\nSo I finished watching the movie a few minutes ago and during watching it, it became clear to me that his character's personality as Rust Cohle in True Detective is the exact opposite of Joseph Cooper's one in Interstellar. While Cohle sees humanity as a flawed, cancerous anomaly of mother nature, which, in his oppinion, would do best by stopping reproducing at all, Cooper believes in the good traits of society so much, that he even risks never seeing his family again, to get the chance of finding a new home for the human race. Both find themselves in a cruel world, where the bad habits of humans have negative impacts on their lives and both share the destiny of having lost a loved one, yet they couldn't be more different in their beliefs and their motivation to endure.\n\nI really love both of McConaughey's performances on their own, but it's the thought of him mastering the challenge to impersonate two absolutely contradictory characters in the same year, both in a very authentic way, which leaves me in awe.\n\nMaybe this is and was quite obvious, back in 2014, and has already been discussed, but it came to me right now and I really wanted to share this :)",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t seen this movie since 2005 but just rewatched it and it blew my mind. Incredible performances, balanced surrealism, and insanely ahead of its time in my opinion. The \u201csilencio\u201d performance scene stands out to me. The emotions in this movie, the dream like states, the conspiratorial scenes; it all comes together in such a cohesive way. I\u2019m reminded of when they intro Betty, and she\u2019s overacting positivity to the degree of a 1940s American film, almost certainly deliberately. And then the cut to her grandparents smiling maniacally as they take a cab. David Lynch is almost like the Ween of movies, his films capture all genres. Like in Mulholland Drive, there\u2019s horror, drama, comedy, romance, suspense, mystery, and more. This film is an insane achievement for David Lynch in my opinion. ",

        "content": "Anyone seen this? How have I not heard of this? Just saw it at the top to my Netflix suggestions and we gave it a go and it\u2019s hilarious. Directed by the first and only time director who did cinematography for a ton of great comedies and Joker and Joker 2 (don\u2019t hold that against him). But the man has an eye for talent and it shows in this movie. Classic trope and montage filled comedy but executed to the highest degree. \n\nEd Helms and Owen Wilson play brothers who bounce off each other beautifully, the typical stuck up and loose and cool characters you\u2019d expect but it\u2019s quickly turned on its head through they\u2019re adventure to find there father and each situation and guest star is funnier than the last.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say more but give it a chance. I can\u2019t believe I never heard of this. It\u2019s charming and nostalgic and just plain hilarious. ",
