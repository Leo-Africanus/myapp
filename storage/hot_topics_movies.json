We shot Coyotes in 21 days in Bogota. It just premiered at Fantastic Fest and comes out in theaters Oct 3rd.  \n\nWe\u2019ll be back here attempting to answer questions today (Thursday 9/25) at 6 PM ET.

        "title": "Rufus Sewell and Danny Houston should be in a movie together where they are both the good guys.",
        "content": "bonus points if everyone assumes that they are evil anyway. Both actors have a long career almost exclusively playing bad guys. I don't think Danny Houston has ever played a good guy or likable character, and Rufus Sewell really only had Dark City where he got to be a hero. However even that film features most of the supporting cast thinking he is probably a serial killer. They are both handsome and charming actors but it really feels like they are constantly cast as the sneering, smarmy, sociopathic bad guy. Sewell has a Knights Tale, Man in the High Castle, and even most recently played Prince Andrew in Scoop. Danny Houston has been the bad guy in X-men, Wonder Woman, The Crow, and even the recent Naked Gun. Come on hollywood you have the chance to do the funniest thing. ",

Movie itself was fantastic and PTA is a magician and I don't think there is anyone that can bring so much layers to a scene and make it so cinematic while it not looking over the top. Can't wait for Anemone and for One Battle after Another (booked tickets for tomorrow).",
