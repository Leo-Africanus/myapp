But I was struck by how bad of an actress Abigail Breslin was. She no longer had that natural acting ability she had as a kid where she'd just disappear. As a grown girl/woman, she came off as wooden and whiny. And I've seen the same on some other movies she was on as an adult. It would explain why her fame dried up. Because child actors can cross over  if they can adapt. I mean, the Fanning sisters are doing well. \n\nAnother one is Corey Feldman. Went from being a big movie child star in the 80s to being a joke in the 90s and up, with the Cosplay Michael Jackson moonwalk and La Toya hair and his godawful singing. Dude has released Collectors Items of albums nobody bought. Maybe in Madagascar where Honesty did quite well.",

        "content": "*A brother and sister witness a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.*\n\nDirector: Danny Philippou; Michael Philippou\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [96%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bring_her_back)\n\n**Metacritic:** [72/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bring-her-back/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Mashable](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2685) \\- [Kristy Puchko](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kristy-puchko)\n\n&gt;*Bring Her Back* is extraordinary. For those who found *Talk to Me* sensationally scary, this follow-up will thrill with its deeply deranged tale of heartache and body horror. But the Philippous went deeper, presenting a character-driven drama with flares of psycho-biddy and religious horror. That heady combination not only makes for a satisfyingly scary as hell movie, but also a profound one.\u00a0\n\n[Slant Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/821) \\- [Rocco T. Thompson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/rocco-t-thompson) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;Looking at the work of Ari Aster, Oz Perkins, and many other modern horror filmmakers, much of the genre is currently entrenched in examining grief and trauma cycles in endlessly reducible patterns, traceable across generations from parents to children, that exist outside of the individual or unit, often as a satanic or supernatural influence that destroys from without. *Bring Her Back* is different, and uniquely devastating, in showing that grief\u2019s causes may be external, but its manifestation is entirely internal: lonely, shapeless, ugly, and unfathomable.\n\n[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \\- [Sean Boelman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/sean-boelman) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;All in all, *Bring Her Back* shows a massive step forward for the Philippou brothers. Although it\u2019s much more of a slow burn than *Talk to Me*, and its story is a tad generic, the excellent character work, performances, and horror scenes make this a horror flick that you won\u2019t be able to shake.\u00a0\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \\- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;The Philippous, leveraging makeup magic and other practical effects, relishes in the corporeal terror of death and its devastating aftermath. When they can translate something into a tangible sensation, like the camera effects of focus that take viewers into Piper\u2019s distorted field of vision, the film operates within a comfortable range for the directors. Where they struggle to locate resonance is in the emotional realm.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-lattanzio) \\- C+\n\n&gt;A taxing experience. Except not taxing emotionally, where it should count, as despite the Philippous\u2019 flair for craft, they here don\u2019t quite connect the dots from horror movie that features grief to a horror movie that\u2019s truly about grief.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Matt Schimkowitz](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/matt-schimkowitz) \\- B\n\n&gt;The Philippous escalate the tension carefully, choosing the right moments to tear into their characters. *Bring Her Back* becomes increasingly brutal as it veers into its last act, but it also adds too many swerves, layering up twists that don\u2019t amount to much. Some land better than others, but the movie works best on a visceral and emotional level, carried by Hawkins\u2019 mania and the textured sound design that feels like pouring glass in the ear canal. Like a punk band turning four chords into pure angst, *Bring Her Back* turns familiar trauma-based horror into a traumatic experience. To sit through *Bring Her Back* is to endure it.",

It all makes for an exhausting show of empty vanity.\n\n[Toronto Star - Alexander Mooney](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/the-weeknds-hurry-up-tomorrow-is-a-laughable-psychodrama-thats-not-only-bad-its-boring/article_953efb71-c023-4616-908a-e0cc601b9a16.html) \\- 0.5/4\n\n&gt;The film\u2019s circuitous narrative takes two agonizing hours to unveil its true colours, with desperate, borrowed abstractions striving to ennoble the flailing creative endeavours of the artist whose subconscious we\u2019re trapped in. \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is remarkable in its ceaseless and shameless capacity for failure, constantly finding new and innovative ways to fall flat on its face.\n\n[Globe &amp; Mail - Brad Wheeler](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-hurry-up-tomorrow-is-an-eye-acting-exhibition-and-moody-music-video/)\n\n&gt;In one way or another, Tesfaye has been telling this story of toxic relationships and inner unrest through the Weeknd his whole career. He has hinted that he would be putting the stage persona to rest. If this film is any indication, it needs to happen tomorrow.\n\n[We Live Entertainment](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2789) \\- [Aaron Neuwirth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aaron-neuwirth) \\- 'D'\n\n&gt;The intensity that should seemingly be shared by Tesfaye and Ortega doesn\u2019t quite emerge as effectively as needed. Instead, there seems to be some dark comedy on display, intentional or not, that undercuts the results.",

The human brain can be compared to a supercomputer but also very much like a library as depicted in the film and I love the difference between them as Abra in her youth only has her room and filing cabinets (compartmentalization much?) compared to Rose who has lived much longer life, has a vast and grand library representing her mind. I think it's a very striking and on the nose visual representation. ",
