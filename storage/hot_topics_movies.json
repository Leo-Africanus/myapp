Inspired by James Gunn\u2019s dog Ozu, we captured every subtle gesture, emotion, and furry leap to ensure Krypto felt like a genuine canine first, only one who happened to have superpowers.\n\n\\-The Fortress of Solitude: We designed the Fortress using more than 6000 reflective crystals, each one a challenge in shading, lighting, and rendering.\n\n\\-4D Gaussian Splatting: A first in feature film, we used 4D Gaussian Splat to create Superman\u2019s Kryptionian parents hologram.\n\n\\-And also the Engineer\u2019s nanite power suit, SupermanRobots, Lex vs Krypto fight scene and more! You can learn about our work here: [https://www.framestore.com/work/superman](https://www.framestore.com/work/superman) \n\nWe\u2019ll be back today (Tuesday 8/16) at 3PM ET to answer your burning questions.

More dumb jokes. \n\nIMO they really did an amazing job bringing back the vibe of the originals. So freaking refreshing. \n\nLeslie Nielsen fucking crushed that role. \n\nLiam Neeson also crushed it.

At first I thought it was going to be a boring movie that I would watch just for the sake of watching a movie of his choice with him. But fortunately, Frailty is one of those \"few exceptions\". This movie is SO GOOD. I'm surprised it isn't more popular. The story was gripping, the pacing was certainly slow but never enough to be boring, the performances are great (RIP Bill Paxton), and the final twist was good too. I was completely in awe while watching it, I totally expected it to get worse at some point but it's actually really consistent in my opinion. I rate it as a 9/10, definitely one of the best movies of 2001 for me\n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the movie?",

How many action movies can you count where people chase eachother with tuktuks?!\n\n\nLike I said in the title what really makes this movie stand out to me is the fact that Tony's really hitting his opponents and it genuinely shows. The stunt guys are always wearing big wigs, hats, beanies, or layered clothing to hide the protective pads their wearing. It's nuts. The fight choreography is gorgeous in this, Tony Jaa's movement is so fluid and rhythmic, he really brought out the beauty of Muay Thai.\n\n\nThe story is also pretty decent, the simple story of a country bumpkin having to team up with a scummy city slicker to return hope back to their village is pretty cute.\n\n\nI think it's a tie for me between the fight club battles and the final fight for the best fight scene in the movie",

I want to go blind into something someone already enjoyed so much.\n\nSo I ask you: what\u2019s a movie, either popular or not as publicly known, maybe even a bit niche or from a specific country, that you have a great memory of, and would like to forget as to enjoy it fresh again?",

        "content": "There are quite a few upcoming young actresses under 25 that have done good work and show a lot of promise for having a long great and successful career.  Which of them do you think will end up flourishing into the future A list actresses with a great trajectory, accolades and filmography?\n\nHere is a list of some of the most popular ones along with their age for reference:\n\n* Milly Alcock (25)\n* Sophie Thatcher (24)\n* Rachel Zegler (24)\n* Isabela Merced (24)\n* Thomasin McKenzie (24)\n* Sadie Sink (23)\n* Sophia Lillis (23)\n* Jenna Ortega (22)\n* Millie Bobby Brown (21)\n\nPersonally I think out of this group Sadie Sink will end up having a great and lasting career and will end up being part of the new generation of A listers. She has already shown her range and acting shoes in several projects like The Whale and Stranger Things,  is very charismatic and likeable and looks to be easy to work with.\n\nHow about you? Which one do you think will end up having the best career?",

All of a sudden she sees her old crew carrying the gold crates onto the new ship..that incredibly intense song by Mudvayne starts rolling, and at the end of the pack is the demon who she thought she killed, slow motion walking up the deck behind them, peers over at her, nostrils flared while maintaining constant eye contact with her, then smirks at her and she screams \u2018NOOOOOO!\u2019 while the ambulance doors close on her  \n\nChills.

I was amazed at how many had used it for filming, including the X-Men franchise, Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Chicago, etc, etc. All told, [according to IMDb, 57 movies](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=casa%20loma,%20toronto,%20ontario,%20canada) have been shot here, either inside or on the grounds.\n\nIs there any other real-life (non studio) location that has been used as much? I'm not talking about landmarks that appear in movies, like the White House, London Bridge, or the Louvre, but locations that were repurposed to use as a scene.",
