Spielberg's version of West Side Story.\nWell, I saw it and I liked it, despite having a 6.5 on Filmaffinity.\nThe pace is good, the script is quite acceptable, but the car chases are on another level. Lily James, by the way, looks gorgeous. I recommend it.\n\nHave you seen her? You like me? I would like to know your opinion.\nGreetings.",

Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.\n\n\"What's it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?\"\n\nThere\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties, that was rare.. anyways I just find it refreshing and think the movie has aged remarkably well!",

        "content": "Edit: It's TBS (2008)\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to find a film I watched about 10+ years ago, so I think it was made in early 2000s or late '90s. It's a psychological thriller(?), not mainstream, probably European\u2014maybe Scandinavian or from Northern Slavic countries.\n\nHere are the details I remember:\n\n- entire film has a bluish/blue tint/filter or I remember it like that because I was little \n\n- main characters are a blonde girl and a guy who's bald I think\n\n- the guy has large scars on his back that look like whip marks, which he got from childhood abuse\n\n- he kidnaps (and possibly rapes) the girl\n\n- I remember them running away through a forest and a river at some point\n\nThe ending scene is very memorable: the guy is holding the girl's necklace as a keepsake, and he is in a brutalist concrete building (lots of raw concrete, very stark). He kills the girl at the end. Edit: she finds a necklace box that contains jewellery from other murdered girls, so he kills her because she found it (?).\n\nThe atmosphere is tense and dark, more of a psychological thriller.\n\nThe film was shown on TV in late evening or night hours.\n\nEdit: main characters were both in late teenage years or early to mid twenties, the guy is a serial killer (and a serial rapist), I remember it like that\n\nIf anyone recognizes this film or can help identify it, I would be very grateful!\n\nThanks a lot!",
