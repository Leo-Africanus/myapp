I think a lot of movie fans don\u2019t understand that musical fans hate a bad film adaptation of a musical even more than they do. I am personally offended by Russel Crowe as Javert in Les Miserables. \n\nAnyway, I think we should take a second to appreciate how good movie musicals can be. What is everyone\u2019s favorite movie musical and why? Also, if anyone has more thoughts on why musicals get hate from movie lovers I would love to hear it. (Other than the classic excuses about realism vs. corniness that don\u2019t apply to the good stuff)\n\nMy favorite is Cabaret (1972). I highly recommend movie musical skeptics give it a shot. It is serious and political with eight Academy Awards (it was up against the godfather too!). It is especially relevant to the climate in America right now and the musical numbers are diegetic if you are picky about people breaking into song.",

        "content": "There are some movies that seem to get better every time you watch.\n\nMy votes go to The Big Lebowski  , The Irishman , Casablanca , Carlito's Way , Saving Private Ryan , comes to me right away. There are some which I did not like at a young age but when I got older I gave them another chance and they became surprisingly better.\n\nWhat is your choice for a movie which gets better and better every time you watch it?",

        "content": "This is such an underrated film that went completely under the radar. It\u2019s a dark, gritty, crime film about steel workers in Pennsylvania that get into the world of illegal fighting. It has a great cast, Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Willem Dafoe, and Forest Whitaker. Woody Harrelson is a great villain in this, terrifying and you don\u2019t even see him in it, he disappears in the role, and it\u2019s one of my favorite Christian Bale movies, him and Affleck give great performances!",

Thought I knew where we were going then yeah, not so much. Had to LOL when Benicio spanks the whore when they\u2019re all fleeing the whorehouse. Hah! Gonna have to watch it again to catch everything that\u2019s happening. Highly recommended. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

Maybe not Hollywood-level, but something that felt like a total leap of faith?

        "content": "As a kid, \"Big\" (starred by Tom Hanks) was just a fun fantasy about getting to be an adult overnight. But rewatching it now, it\u2019s a bittersweet story about lost childhood, the pressures of adulthood, and how we often take youth for granted. It\u2019s charming but also kind of heartbreaking when you realize how much Josh had to give up.",
