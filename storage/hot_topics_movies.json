Avoiding spoilers and not knowing any scenes is a bonus.\n\nMost of the time I don't even read synopsis, i always go blind into the movies now (of course if it's not known widely what it is about) and it's been great.",

        "content": "***EDIT #4- Putting this at the top because it's an important development: she wants me to clarify that she hasn't always disliked ALL animated films. She liked the first Toy Story (although hasn't shown any interest in the sequels) and swears i convinced her to watch \"a movie about two girls and there were race cars (?what?).\" Also, anime is back on the table for some reason, so that opens up a lot of possibilities.\n\n\n***EDIT-this has gotten way more traction than I expected. I appreciate everyone 's input so far and it's unlikely I'll be able to respond to everyone. A couple of notes:\n\n1- I don't know exactly why she doesn't like animation. She just can't seem to get interested. I've tried in the past, I have. It hasn't captured her attention.\n\n2- Despite some very good recommendations, I'd like to avoid traumatizing her completely (Grave of the Fireflies, for example)\n\n3- She likes a variety of genres, so it's hard to narrow it down. She's also incredibly difficult to shop for, in the same way. She's very much a \"I'll know what I like when I see it\" person.\n\n****EDIT #2- Some great options so far. Lead contenders right now are probably Up, Wild Robot, Wall-E, Spiderverse, Incredibles, Iron Giant, Flow (I haven't seen this one yet either), Shrek.\n\nAbsolute no-no's, and you should be ashamed of yourselves (you know who you are) Heavy Metal, Watership Down, Grave of the Fireflies\n\n****EDIT #3- I've tried in the past. I thought we were on to something when she said she'd watch the Buzz Lightyear movie, but that was a stinker and she hasn't tried again since then.\n*.*.*.*\n\n\nMy wife has never enjoyed animated movies, so I'll usually watch any animated films on my own when they're released on a streaming service. She has just told me that I can pick any one animated film for us to watch together. Anime and any significantly older film (like classic Disney) won't fly. What should it be? I think it's got to be something that hits deep emotionally. Up? Wild Robot? What are your thoughts? \n\nThis could be my only chance to add animated films to out list of watchables.",

        "content": "This may not resonate with some of our younger readers for whom race relations has been explored in detail over the past 50 years or so.  But try to go back 50 years.  Until 1967 interracial marriage was illegal in some states until  Loving vs Virginia where the Supreme Court struck down a 1883 decision legalizing these laws.  Jackie Robinson became the first black major league baseball player just 20 years earlier.\n\nSo looking from that point of view. let's look at these three movies and his performances.  \n\nIn the Heat of the Night has true vistuoso performances by Poitier and Rod Steiger.  Steiger as the bigoted sheriff, Poitier as the black detective Virgil Tibbs.  A must see for pure raw emotion.   After thoroughly demolishing the Sheriff's railroading of someone in front of the widow of the murder victim and the very important owner of the town factory.  Like other ignorant bullies, he falls back on name-calling and demonizing the other.\n\nSheriff: \"Virgil, that's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia.  What do they call you there\" \n\nTibbs: \"They call me Mister Tibbs\"\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is a less emotional, more reasoned approach to race relations.  Also having Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn was great.\n\nTo Sir With Love, may be best remembered now for the theme song by Lulu looks at disenfranchised youths and racism.  Shows the power of respect, for ourselves and others.",

        "title": "Blockbuster versus Tentpole",
        "content": "(Get your \u201cold man yells at cloud\u201d meme out.)\n\nThis is kind of driving me to distraction, the misuse of the term \u201cblockbuster\u201d when what they mean is \u201ctentpole\u201d.\n\nA blockbuster is a movie that is a big hit; it refers to people lining up *around the block* waiting to buy tickets. The word itself derives from really big conventional bombs during WWII that would blow up a whole city block. It\u2019s interesting to me that when a film is a hit it is named after a specific type of bomb, but when it\u2019s not a hit it\u2019s just called a bomb.\n\nAnyway, a film that hasn\u2019t yet been released or has just recently released can\u2019t be a blockbuster until it makes a ton of money.\n\nA tentpole film has traditionally meant the type of four-quadrant crowd-pleaser that is *most likely* to become a hit (and hopefully turn into a blockbuster) that earns enough money to pay for all the mid-list and lower-budget films the studio also releases during the year. They\u2019ll make a prestige drama to win awards which might break even at the box office, but count on a film with mass appeal to draw the crowds and pay the bills. (Typically with associated ancillary sales of toys and other merch.) The moneymaker holds up the circus tent that the smaller, less-popular acts also play in. Hence \u201ctentpole\u201d.\n\n(Of course the problem these days is that it\u2019s almost all tentpoles and few mid-budget movies. Every major studio is swinging for the fences like it\u2019s a home run derby rather than releasing a mixed slate of films because streaming has changed the dynamics. Still, the definitions remain.)\n\nSide note: can we also stop saying \u201cverse\u201d when we mean \u201cversus\u201d? It\u2019s one more syllable ya lazy nogoodniks! Same for \u201cverbage\u201d instead of \u201cverbiage\u201d. It makes one sound like the slow kid in class.\n\nOther side note: I get that language changes over time, but some changes are just dumb and should be resisted because it impedes communication. It\u2019s like when people say \u201ctaunt\u201d when they mean \u201ctaut\u201d, or write \u201clead\u201d when they mean \u201cled\u201d.",

        "content": "*\"When the girl of his dreams (Amber Midthunder) is kidnapped, everyman Nate (Jack Quaid) turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected strength in his fight to get her back.\"*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine_2025/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [69/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/novocaine-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1236157792/)\n\n&gt;The numerous fight scenes, which often lapse into extreme gore, are as amusing as they are exciting. *Novocaine*, which amusingly employs REM\u2019s \u201cEverybody Hurts\u201d to accompany the opening credits, would probably have eventually worn out its welcome (it still feels overlong at 110 minutes) were it not for Quaid\u2019s terrific performance.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1235101694/)\n\n&gt;The film makes a great case for Quaid as action hero, Midthunder as romantic charmer, and Berk and Olson as being ready to step out of their horror-centric background.\n\n[Collider - Jeff Ewing](https://collider.com/novocaine-2025-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a gory, bonkers action-comedy premise anchored by a set of strong performances and a surprisingly poignant meet-cute, making for a wildly memorable action outing.\n\n[Screen Rant - Rachel LaBonte](https://screenrant.com/novocaine-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Suffice to say, *Novocaine* takes you on a rollicking adventure that, once it begins after Sherry's abduction, doesn't really let up. Sure, there's some tonal awkwardness with the actual bank heist scene \u2014 it's far more distressing than anything else in the movie \u2014 but between the humor and Quaid's performance, there's so much fun to be had here that it's easy to just sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\n[IGN - Lena Wilson](https://www.ign.com/articles/novocaine-review)\n\n&gt;Novocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky \u201cman who feels no pain\u201d premise may lead you to believe. This movie breathes new life into old ideas, with an original hero buoyed by the charm of Jack Quaid and a heroine who ably beats the damsel-in-distress allegations. Novocaine is smart, but not so self-aware that it\u2019s likely to alienate anybody; sharp, but not without feeling.\n\n[Looper - Audrey Fox](https://www.looper.com/1806454/novocaine-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Novocaine is packed full of inventive action set pieces that are alternately gruesome, goofy, and sometimes even both at once. It may not be for everyone, but it kind of feels like the gold standard for this very specific brand of action comedy.\n\n[DEADLINE - Gregory Nussen](https://deadline.com/2025/03/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1236313943/)\n\n&gt;This is not the blistering action satire that *Hot Fuzz* is, but it\u2019s not the somber, balletic revenge plot of *Wick*, either. *Novocaine* is, frequently, a riot, but one wishes Jacobsen\u2019s script would have gone through another draft to iron out some flimsier details. It doesn\u2019t help that some late plot developments feel bizarrely convenient or else invalidate much of its own setup.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Rocco T. Thompson](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/novocaine-review-jack-quaid/)\n\n&gt;We\u2019re used to heroes who can take a licking and keep on ticking, but *Novocaine* takes action-movie invulnerability to brutal comic extremes. Starring Jack Quaid as a timid not-quite-everyman on the trail of the bank robbers who kidnapped his would-be girlfriend, the film offers little novelty beyond its hero being a human pin cushion, but it\u2019s stuffed with enough creative violence to make even jaded action fans squirm in their seats.",

        "content": "Many remakes aim to introduce classic films to a new generation, updating visuals, tweaking storylines, or modernizing themes. Some breathe new life into beloved stories, while others feel like a fresh take on a familiar concept. However, there are also remakes that seem to exist without a clear purpose\u2014films that don\u2019t improve upon the original, add anything meaningful, or even justify their own existence. These often leave audiences wondering: Why was this even made?\n\nWith that in mind, what do you think is the most unnecessary remake?",

        "content": "I'll be the first to admit, Congo isn't a great movie. But it's a lot of fun, well acted, good pacing and fun scenes. It seems like a great 90's Popcorn action-adventure movie. I do know that ever sense Congo came out it's been considered one of the worst movies ever. For a long while in the late 2000s to early 2010s, when list articles were more common, Congo would often appear on the lists of worst movies or biggest box office disappointments. \n\nBut why? I get it doesn't follow the book at all. The book has more of a darker/horror-adventure tone and the film is more light hearted PG-13 adventure. Is that basically why everyone choose to hate it? I am also going to go on a whim that most of the audience never read the book either and there are many other movie adaptations that don't follow the book closely and are still consider good movies.\n\nWas it basically all the same critics and audiences that also hated on Waterworld which for a long while was also considered a bad movie or the worst movie. \n\nCongo isn't perfect but I always rewatch it every few years and find myself enjoying it every time.",
