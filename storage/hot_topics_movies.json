        "content": "Hi r/movies,\n\nI\u2019m Mark Dossett, creator of The Town That Cried Bigfoot \u2014 a lost 1978 documentary about a small-town Bigfoot hoax that spirals into murder. But the deeper you dig, the stranger it gets \u2014because none of it\u2019s real. Not even the town.\n\nI built this film completely backward \u2014 starting with real 1970s news footage I found, then reverse-engineering a fictional murder, a cryptid hoax, and a made-up southern town buried inside real news footage.\n\nLet\u2019s just say... if you Google \u201cWeyburn, Virginia\u201d while watching, you might start to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAsk me anything about editing the truth into lies, creating fake towns, tricking Google, Bigfoot folklore, Blair Witch-style worldbuilding, or how the hell any of this even worked. Or anything else you want to discuss.\n\n**Film info:**\n\nThe Town That Cried Bigfoot\n\nGenre: Faux Documentary / Mystery / True Crime (kinda sorta)\n\nRuntime: 47 minutes\n\nWritten, Directed &amp; Edited by: Mark Dossett\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\nIn the winter of 1978, four desperate councilmen in Weyburn, Virginia staged a fake Bigfoot sighting to save their town from economic ruin. The plan worked \u2014 until someone turned up dead.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker\u2014 none of this ever happened. The footage is real. The town is fake. The hoax is real enough to show up on MapQuest. This is a hoax within a hoax \u2014 crafted to feel like a lost documentary buried in public access archives.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg)\n\n**Where to Watch:**\n\nAmazon Prime Video: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN)\n\nGumroad (Download the full film for $5 and support the filmmaker):\n\n[https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film](https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film)\n\nOfficial Merch: [https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com](https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com)\n\nAlso streaming on select free platforms: Stash TV, Fawesome TV, and Xumo.\n\nAsk me anything!

But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1888624/elio-pixar-movie-review/) (75):\n\n&gt;The frenetic pace may keep kids hooked, but parents will appreciate the sequences when Elio hits the pause button and allows audiences to sit in the silence \u2014 of complicated ideas, of emotionally challenging conversations, and of the wonders around us we too often fail to appreciate.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/elio-review-pixar/) (70):\n\n&gt;But despite how charming and fun Elio is, it still falls prey to some of Pixar\u2019s occasional problems. Yes, this is a story of intergalactic adventures and a wide universe of possibilities, but it still can get a bit convoluted at times.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/elio-review-pixar):\n\n&gt;Overall, it\u2019s an entertaining bit of summer fun.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/elio/) (80):\n\n&gt;Robert Zemeckis\u2019 Contact for kids.

He was lucky the one guy joined him, otherwise the kid would have gotten the chair.\n\nThen he brings up all the holes in the evidence, and breaks the others one at a time.

Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; The impressive craft of these scenes extends to Kosinki\u2019s exploration of the various technologies, like road simulators, used to help drivers gain any advantage. Of course, there are some unrealistic elements in F1, moments that might have sticklers raising an eyebrow, but the film doesn\u2019t feel any less dramatic than the real thing.\n\n-[Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-damson-idris-joseph-kosinski-1236291870/)\n\n&gt; The action is hardly dull, but the sheer disconnect between the wowee zowee immediacy of the race footage and the mezzo mezzo excitement it inspires suggests that tuning out the noise isn\u2019t as easy as Sonny Hayes might seem to think. \u201cSometimes when you lose, you win,\u201d Ruben tells his old friend. And sometimes when you win, this solid but underwhelming blockbuster contends, you still lose.  \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt-1235133092/): C+\n\n&gt; With the action confined to stadium racetracks, you wonder why Kosinski didn\u2019t give the audience more of a consistent eagle\u2019s-eye overview; that would have helped. But maybe he just counted on the thrill of speed, and the specter of death, to be the film\u2019s engine. Is there a suck-in-your-breath cataclysmic crash? Of course there is, but we\u2019re invited to exhale from its consequences too easily. In \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d someone asks why race drivers do what they do, and a racer\u2019s girlfriend replies, \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to go very fast.\u201d Yes it is, but that in itself isn\u2019t enough to make a marvelous movie.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/f1-review-brad-pitt-javier-bardem-damson-idris-1236432987/)\n\n&gt; Top Gun: Maverick's Joseph Kosinski assembles an all-star crew in front of and behind the camera for F1, and they craft a technical marvel of a movie. It\u2019s gorgeous and thrilling to look at, with top-notch editing backing up Brad Pitt\u2019s IMAX-consuming charisma. It's a faithful devotee to the sports-movie formula that\u2019s kept from greatness by a few too many unnecessary components and a finish line that maybe should\u2019ve been closer than two and a half hours away. But in spite of that, it\u2019s still a hell of a ride.\n\n-[Clint Gage, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinsky): 7/10 \"good\"\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d is slick enough to capture your attention for an hour and a half. Again, unfortunately, it\u2019s 2 1/2 hours long. The repetitive story, stale characterizations, portentous self-celebration and oddly flaccid take on the masculine drive just keep puttering along, long after our interest has waned. It\u2019s a classic car that looks brand new \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t had a lube job in decades.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt/)\n\n&gt; Motor racing is a sport in which constituent team members seem to be competing against each other as much as against the opposition, and so it ought to be an ideal subject for a movie treatment. There\u2019s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular.\n\n-[Pete Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt): 4/5\n\n&gt; Whether or not it finds it audience (and there are probably a lot of easter eggs for viewers who know a hell of a lot more about Formula One than I do), F1 is proof that brand Pitt is still a viable option and, like Tom Cruise, can still hold a movie the old-fashioned way, putting pedal to the metal.\n\n-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinski-old-school-racing-drama-1236435474/)\n\n&gt; Joseph Kosinski has done it again. F1 combines unparalleled access, pioneering filmmaking and moving redemption arcs to deliver an exhilarating cinematic experience. What will he attach a camera to next?\n\n-[Sophie Butcher, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/f1-the-movie/): 4/5\n\n&gt; With those warnings in place, buckle in. For flash and rumble, F1 doesn't have an equal this summer. Roll down the windows and enjoy the ride.\n\n-[Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/f1-review-brad-pitt-phenomenal-racing-scenes-dull-script-11755916)\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d leans extremely rousing, though intrigues when it mines the strategic idiosyncrasies of the motorsport and the psychological and physical toll it takes to be a champion. There\u2019s a mental health angle touched on that, if explored more, would have led to a great albeit bleaker movie. Not that this thing deserves a participation trophy. Watching Pitt burn this much rubber, and with macho panache, puts \"F1\" in the winners' circle.\n\n-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/17/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt/84222638007/): 3/4\n\n&gt; F1 couldn\u2019t feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that\u2019s the current obsession of millions, yet couldn\u2019t feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P.

Its like he wasnt human anymore. Though there was some humor in the scene where the drill instructor started insulting him lmao. But that doesn't take away from the horrors of that one scene. Its so well directed. Its like one of the most memorible moments in the movie and in film history i would say. ",

I loved it, it's so crazy.\n\nHowever it being such a big box office bomb and critical failure. I wouldn't be surprised if it made him more wary to be himself as much and became more of a director for hire.\n\nLooking forward to rewatching King Arthur again actually, it's so nuts.\n\nEDIT: The montage, the dlalogue, the big ass snake towards the end, the slow mo 360 degree camera shots are so insanely over the top hahahaha, it's time to make it a cult classic.",
