I\u2019m Jenny Jue, casting director for The Wedding Banquet (now in theaters), Okja, Snowpiercer, Inglourious Basterds, The Brother's Sun, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2, and more. I love discovering breakout talent and building unforgettable ensembles. AMA!\n\nI'll be back at 8 PM ET today (Wednesday 4/30) to answer your questions. Ask me anything!\n\nView the official trailer for \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d here: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nMy credits:\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/)\n\nUp next: \"Untitled Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (Paramount/Avatar Studios), \"Mike and Nick and Nick and Alice\" (20th Century Studios), and \"Ballerina Overdrive\" (Amazon Studios).\n\nMore bio information:\n\nCSA Award-winning Casting Director Jenny Jue, whose two-decade career includes standout collaborations with Quentin Tarantino (\"Inglourious Basterds\"), Bong Joon Ho (\"Okja\", \"Snowpiercer\"), and Netflix\u2019s \"The Brother\u2019s Sun.\u201d\n\nJenny\u2019s latest project, \"The Wedding Banquet\" (Bleecker Street), is a 2025 reimagining of the Ang Lee classic, directed by Andrew Ahn and starring Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran, Joan Chen, and Youn Yuh-jung. Premiering to rave reviews at Sundance and in theaters nationwide April 18, 2025, the film explores queerness, chosen family, and generational identity with depth and humor. Jenny spent two years casting the project, navigating the unique challenges of post-strike independent filmmaking while shaping an ensemble that feels instinctive and human.\n\nJenny\u2019s path to casting was anything but conventional. Raised in Southern California by a family of engineers, she initially pursued a pre-law track at UCLA. But a last-minute internship with iconic casting director Johanna Ray (\"Mulholland Drive\", \"Twin Peaks\") changed everything. Jenny spent nearly a decade under Ray\u2019s mentorship before founding her own company, Downtown Casting, in 2012. Since then, she\u2019s become the go-to casting director for auteurs seeking global talent and emotional authenticity\u2014balancing the demands of prestige cinema with stories that feel intimate, lived-in, and often underrepresented. Her work spans genres, from the from the stylized action of \"Kate\" to the unsettling realism of the BAFTA-nominated documentary \"The Social Dilemma.\"",

You could argue he doesn\u2019t get to do anything that reaches into, say, DDL level emotion for There Will Be Blood for abandoning his child or De Niro smashing up a concrete wall in darkness in Raging Bull, but the scene where Murray reads Mozart\u2019s music for the first time is the best acting I think I have seen in a film. \n\nComes down to personal taste rather than anything objective I suppose.

Michael and the girl walk past the camera bashfully flirting, followed by a group of female relatives chaperoning and chatting amongst themselves, and then followed by two guys with shotguns. You can see the whole story of Michael's time in Italy in a single moment.\n\nIt's a great shot, and funnily enough I can totally see the resemblance to some shots in Fury Road -- where the camera kinda lingers and lets different characters and groups fall in and out of frame, in a way that tells an effective mini-story.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite shots that tell their own stories?",

When I watched it again much later with context after watching the series, I was certainly more engaged then the first one since I understood the characters and the overall world, but also didn't have much of an emotional reaction as I expected, and I've always wondered whether that was just down to me having seen it before without realising it, or if it was down to my tastes and the way I think about films just being different then it was before.\n\nBut that's just my experience; has anyone else been in this situation, and what was your experience during or after?",

        "title": "I finally saw the Conan The Barbarian movies and they were nothing like I expected",
        "content": "I recently bought Mortal Kombat 1 on sale with all the DLC and was trying to figure out who to play.\n\nI decided to go in reverse order on the character select menu which made me choose Conan first. I knew very little about the movies or character other than Arnold plays him\n\nSo after playing Conan I really started enjoying him and decided I needed to see where he came from.\n\nMy expectations were that Conan The Barbarian and Destroyer were just dumb 80s action movies and there would be a lot of violence and bravado without much substance.\n\nBoy was I wrong. Instead I found its an Epic Dark Fantasy movie with awesome music, tons of camp, and a great performance by the late James Earl Jones.\n\nBoth movies reminded me of a DnD campaign. I did not expect the movies to be so nerdy in the fantasy element. I was expecting Expendables level of dumb but instead I got Lord of the Rings movie before Lord of the Rings.\n\nI liked how the movies did little to explain things or even hype up certain moments. There's a part in Conan 1 where Conan gets crucified. Any other movie would have a super hyped up, dark and depression lead up to him getting tortured, etc.\n\nIn the actual movie, James Earl Jones says \"crucify him\" and it immediately just jumps to Conan on a tree with 0 build up.\n\nSimilarly Conan somehow sneaks into the enemy stronghold at the end with absolutely no fighting any guards and gets all the way to Thulsa Doom to kill him with 0 explanation. \n\nIt doesn't feel the need to baby the audience and I like that.\n\nConan 2 felt more like a standard fantasy adventure until the end. I did not expect the final battle to be against a giant fish monster god.\n\nMy wife and I ended up really enjoying the movies and I can tell why they are cult classics. \n\nI really enjoyed all the side Characters. Valeria was badass. Subotai was a total bro helping Conan after just meeting him. Malak made a good comedy relief while being super helpful in key moments. Zulu was a badass and had some awesome goofy facial expressions throughout.\n\nI'm glad I decided to finally watch these cult classics. Is the 2010 reboot with Jason Mamoa any good?",
