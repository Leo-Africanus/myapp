        "content": "Sing Street (2016) is my favorite \"feel good\" movie and I believe it is a perfect one. \n\nFor anyone who has not seen it, Sing Street is a musical set in Ireland in the 80s. It follows a young kid who has a lot of negativity going in in his life. He meets a girl he starts to like and creates a band to impress her. \n\nI think Sing Street succeeds where many \"feel good\" movies struggle. Many of these movies have a character with certain struggles in their life but in the end they are able to overcome them and change. However my issue with these turns are often that they (as well as the plot of the movie) ventures into \"fantasy\" land. The character actions are outlandish and over the top. Moreover, there are no consequences for these outlandish actions. I understand that the feeling associated with these actions are supposed to be a sense of control but more importantly freedom. However, they always make my wish that I could get a sobering but optimistic conclusion. \n\nThis is exactly where Sing Street succeeds. For one, it is able to leverage it musical genre (which blends well with fantastical elements) to heighten the reality and get a but not outlandish without sacrificing the grounding emotional core of the situation. Moreover, the film ends at just the right point where we do not see a character get into trouble but be happy or completely improve their life. Instead we see an ending where that can be defined as \"potential for improvement\" rather than actual improvement. I really enjoy this framing because it emphasizes the character choices and struggles over the actual end result of their actions. And that makes me feel good. \n\nThere's more to the movie that makes it a perfect \"feel good\" movie but this is one that I really like. So all in all, I love Sing Street and I think everyone should watch it. ",

That feeling of dread, awe, sadness and terror all rolled into one.\n\nAnnihilation: the music in the final act makes my heart palpitate!\n\nNope: when the antagonist revealed their true form, I had the weirdest feeling come over me. Can't explain it.\n\nMother!: this was just crazy chaos, buy perfectly put together once you realise the story.\n\nMen: wow. Just utter shock at the final act and having to relive it over and over again!\n\nThe Fountain: the visuals of him in the bubble are just beautiful.... and when he drinks sap, it scared the crap out me. But the love story is just heartwarming throughout.\n\nAny suggestions for more? Please let me know!\n\nThe Fall\nMr Nobody\nInterstellar\nBlack Swan\n",

        "title": "I finally watched \"Grave of the Fireflies,\" and I am devastated.  It is one of the few movies I have watched that lived up to what people promised it was.",
        "content": "Just watched *Grave of the Fireflies* for the first time. I went in knowing it had a reputation for being devastating, but even then, nothing could\u2019ve prepared me for how emotionally brutal it is. It\u2019s not just unrelentingly sad... it\u2019s an unflinching portrait of the horrors of war, not actually through battles or explosions, but through starvation, isolation, and the quiet, slow loss of innocence.\n\nWhat really hit me was how personal it all felt. This wasn\u2019t just a tragedy of circumstance, but it was also a tragedy of pride. Seita\u2019s decision to leave the relative safety of his aunt\u2019s home wasn\u2019t just impulsive; it was fatal. I understand he was a child trying to protect his sister and preserve their dignity, but in trying to shield her from cruelty, he ultimately exposed her to a much worse fate. His pride wasn\u2019t villainous, but it was misplaced, and it cost them everything.\n\nWatching Setsuko deteriorate, not just physically but emotionally, was agonizing. She never had a chance to truly understand what was happening. Her firefly funeral is one of the most haunting and bittersweet scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in animation. Her ashes... the scene was so beautiful yet completely gutting. It really drove home how war erases childhood, not just through violence, but through neglect and abandonment.\n\nThis film doesn't try to make a statement so much as show you the raw, human cost of war. It\u2019s not cathartic. It doesn\u2019t offer hope or redemption. It just leaves you with silence, and maybe that\u2019s the point. Because some losses don\u2019t have meaning. They\u2019re just gone.\n\nIf anyone ever tells you animation can\u2019t be serious art, show them *Grave of the Fireflies*. It broke me and I think that\u2019s exactly what it was meant to do.",

        "content": "Rad (1986) is hands down my top pick! The movie is admittedly not that great but it's extremely fun and loaded with charm. It showcases great BMX riding accompanied by an awesome soundtrack and if it weren't for these rockin' tunes the movie wouldn't be half as enjoyable as it is. Right from the start you're hit with a killer BMX montage cut to \"Break the Ice\" by John Farnham (one of several songs he did for the film). Shortly after that you hear \"Get Strange\" by Hubert Kah as Cru (the lead character) evades the local sheriff through a lumber yard. Later on you're treated to feats of gracefulness as Cru and Christian (Cru's love interest) BMX boogie to \"Send Me an Angel\" by Real Life. The film's best song is however saved for last when Cru is qualifying for Helltrack and music is of the utmost importance to put the audience right in the thick of it all with our protagonist. It's at this moment that you get what is easily one of the most determination inducing songs ever written... \"Thunder In Your Heart\" by John Farnham. Rad is worth watching for these sequences alone and you'll undoubtedly find them difficult to not enjoy due to their fun nature. If you're in the mood for a good cheesy time then I highly recommend taking this ride with Cru and letting the film put a little thunder in your own heart.",
