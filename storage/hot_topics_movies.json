        "content": "Last night I rewatched Blade Runner 2049, and it clicked in a way it didn\u2019t when I first saw it years ago. \n\nPart of that is probably me, but part of it feels like the presentation. Watching it on a large projected screen in 4K made the quieter moments easier to settle into. Scenes of K moving through fog, rain, and empty spaces didn\u2019t feel slow this time. I found myself noticing layers of mist, dust, neon light, and scale that I barely registered before. Some of those wide shots stopped feeling like background and started feeling like spaces you could actually sit inside. \n\nI\u2019m watching on a jmgo n1s 4k and I\u2019m not sure whether this comes more from the setup or simply from how well this film translates to 4K. Either way, it really made me feel that some movies genuinely benefit from a bigger screen and higher detail. Curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. Are there movies you didn\u2019t fully connect with until you watched them again in a better format or on a bigger screen?",

So I sat down to watch a supposedly good movie about a family in the heyday of 80s wrestling.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a drama but I had no idea it was going to be so utterly devastating! Why didn't anyone warn me?!\n\nI thought the first half of the movie was solid, if a little slow. I was even finding my attention drifting a little bit at around the 50 minute mark.\n\nBut then the second hour of this movie is somehow 3 hours long and just a mesmerising tragedy that doesn't relent or shield you from the events that steadily punch you in the heart. Not many cheap thrills or twisty turbines, just a morbid sense of neverending 'Ah, fuck...' moments.\n\nI wouldn't say it was a perfect movie, but it was stoically devastating in a way that few stories are, and beautifully executed, if sometimes a little heavy-handed. I'd absolutely recommend it to any who haven't seen it.",

        "title": "Who Else Has Temple Of Doom As Their Favorite?",
        "content": "Been in a bit of an Indy mood as of late and particularly for this one, which I'm unashamed to say is my favorite of the saga. If Temple Of Doom is your favorite Indiana Jones movie or at least in your top two, this is the topic for you. Thought it'd be fun to have a topic devoted to TOD and those who love the film and rank it in the upper two of the series. I ask no haters or dislikers of the film please, if you don't care for it that's fine, but this isn't the topic for that.\n\nTOD has always been my favorite Indy film. It was my very first one I ever saw (and fitting too, it being a prequel to Raiders and all), and what an introduction to Indy's world at the age I saw it at. The film that most epitomizes Indy as a character and the one most alike the classic adventure serials and pulp adventure novels that influenced the character in the first place. It even evokes the 1950s-era EC Horror comics with it's use of colors. I always enjoyed how TOD is equal parts dark but still very fun, having some good humor that never undermines the tension and it isn't afraid to go into some very Horror-esque territory. I can totally see it being something of a gateway film for Horror fans at a young age. Some dislike the lack of Nazis and a biblical-oriented relic, but that's part of why I like it because it isn't trying to be Raiders all over again and goes for something different and it works all the better for it. Mola Ram is hands down the most terrifying and evil Indy villain ever, and I never minded Willie Scott or Short Round (still upset he didn't return for DOD). Some of the greatest, most thrilling and iconic moments in Indy history alone are from TOD with the likes of the Club Obi-Wan escape, the spike chamber, the sacrifice, the mine cart chase and the bridge climax. TOD has arguably the best music score as well, especially the Slave Children's Crusade theme, which is always gets me energized. It's usage during the scene when Indy emerges from the shadows right before he punches the Thuggee guard gives me chills every time. I always liked how in this film Indy is actually relevant to the plot and outcome, and directly defeats the main villain; in the other four, the villains kill themselves with their arrogance and greed, but here Indy actually plays a pivotal role in the plot.\n\nTOD being my favorite Indy film is a hill I'll die on. It's right alongside Raiders as the best for me. Both movies are Indy at his purest and edgiest, and TOD feels like it was truly the last intense all-out installment before the remainder of the series became more family-friendly. Wonder who else here feels similarly to me and cites TOD either as their favorite or at the very least in their top two of the saga. It's a peak adventure film and peak vintage Spielberg.",

        "content": "When I was younger, I was really snobby when it came to movies. If I watched something that I didn't deem Oscar worthy, I'd feel like it was a waste of my time and money. I likely thought this way because I would go to the theaters and spend around $10 for every movie I watched. Regardless, this mindset was very limiting and made me not enjoy a lot of movies that were probably entertaining.\n\nNow, with streaming services, I can casually watch many movies without the worry that I am wasting my time AND money. This has caused me to lower my movie requirements to one simple thing; entertain me.\n\nI don't care if a movie is silly, has a low budget, or even has bad writing or acting. If I was entertained throughout it's runtime, I walk away pleased. I pretty much enjoy almost every movie I watch now (unless it's so bad, it's bad) and when I do watch a movie that I think is great, it is even more of a treat.\n\nI just have a more casual mindset towards movies now and it is a blast. I even enjoy watching rom coms and animated movies with my wife now, which I never would have bothered watching before. Does anyone else agree/disagree or has had a similar experience? Please share!",
