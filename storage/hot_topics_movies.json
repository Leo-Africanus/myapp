        "content": "Hi r/movies \u2013 I'm Fleur Fortun\u00e9, the director of THE ASSESSMENT, in theaters now from Magnolia Pictures. Starring Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Olsen, Himesh Patel, and Minnie Driver,  the film had its World Premiere at TIFF 2024, and played at the Zurich Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, and more. The film is my feature directorial debut, but I've been directing music videos (like some for Skrillex, Drake, Pharrell Williams, and Travis Scott), commercials, and shorts until now. More on the film:\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT follows Mia (Olsen) and Aaryan (Patel), a successful couple who hope to become parents in a near future where resources are extremely limited and the government keeps firm control over reproduction. They are assigned an assessor named Virginia (Vikander), who moves into their home for seven days to evaluate whether they deserve to move forward in their parenting journey. What Mia and Aaryan are hoping is a routine test quickly unravels into a psychological nightmare, forcing them to question the very foundations of their society and what it truly means to be human.\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT is now in theaters, and you can check out screenings in your area here: \n\n[https://www.theassessmentmovie.com/movie/the-assessment/book-now](https://www.theassessmentmovie.com/movie/the-assessment/book-now)\n\nOfficial Trailer:\n\n[https://youtu.be/bYmELiSalx0](https://youtu.be/bYmELiSalx0)\n\nTalk to you all later!

        "title": "March 21-23 Box Office Recap: It was another terrible weekend, as 'Snow White' flopped with an awful $85.3 million worldwide, against a $270 million budget. Meanwhile, 'The Alto Knights' also flopped with just $3.1 million domestically.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/t9od7mdwgpqe1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbdf627ab9d7355869c0772f7334f9c0b3a6c65\n\nAnother brutal weekend at the box office.\n\nDespite topping the box office, ***Snow White*** massively flopped in its opening weekend, indicating it was a bad apple after all. But that wasn't the only flop this weekend. WB also released ***The Alto Knights***, and it had one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters. Oh and there was also the long-delayed debut of ***Magazine Dreams***, which unsurprisingly tanked in 815 theaters.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $68.5 million this weekend. That's off a rough 30.3% from last year, when ***Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*** topped the box office.\n\nDebuting in first place, ***Snow White*** flopped with just $42.2 million in 4,200 theaters. This debut is lower than the live-action ***Dumbo*** remake ($45.9 million), coincidentally another adaptation of a very old Disney property. It's so far off from other recent films like ***The Little Mermaid*** ($95.5M), ***Maleficent*** ($69.4M), and ***Cinderella*** ($67.8M).\n\nThe bad news don't stop there. These numbers are eerily similar to the debut of ***The Marvels*** ($46.1 million), which also had a similar budget to ***Snow White*** ($270 million). So yep, ***Snow White*** is performing right on par with one of the biggest flops in movie history.\n\nWhile Disney has had success with their live-action remakes, there's always that black sheep that deviates from the formula and that's the case with ***Snow White***. The film had a similar case to ***Dumbo***, in that the original films are very old (the original ***Snow White*** is 88 years old and ***Dumbo*** is 84 years old). While the public is aware of these films and know they're iconic, perhaps their popularity hasn't been as big as other animated films like ***The Lion King***, ***Aladdin*** or ***Beauty and the Beast***.\n\nIt didn't help that ***Snow White*** has been done to death for the past decades. So it falls into the same problem as other stories like ***Robin Hood***, ***The Three Musketeers***, or ***Sherlock Holmes***, in that the public can recognize them but that doesn't mean they'll watch everything with them. Of course, some hit bigger than others. In 2012, ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, a dark reimagining, made almost $400 million worldwide. Simply put, the Disney remake didn't offer much to differentiate itself from other adaptations.\n\nAlright, now we have to address two big problems with the film, which are main factors for its performance. The first involves the Seven Dwarfs, which are, obviously, pivotal to the story. Back in 2022, Peter Dinklage expressed his frustration with the film, deeming it a \"backward story\". So Disney decided to simply... make the Dwarfs with CGI instead of casting actors with dwarfism. And the design used for the film simply looks... awful. Even though Dinklage faced backlash for his comment, it was Disney who made the decision to listen and act upon it. But that's not everything.\n\nRachel Zegler has been the subject of media attention since 2022, when she made comments joking about the Prince and Snow White's characterization in the original film. These comments have been in the eye of the public for the past years, drawing negative attention to the remake. Gal Gadot didn't escape criticism either; not just for her perceived lack of acting range, but because of her Israel support. Whether you agree or not with everything just mentioned, it's clear the general audience wasn't content in the slightest with anything.\n\nSo that's basically it. It's a simply a factor of so many decisions that went awry, as well as an incredibly high $270 million budget. Disney knew this, which is why they scaled back on the premieres and press junkets for the film. Add in very weak reviews (44% on RT), and the film has already lost so many people.\n\nAccording to Disney, 68% of the audience was female and 47% was in the 18-34 demographic. Even though it's a family film, only 15% of the audience was 17 and under. So kids were pretty much not interested in the film.\n\nThe long term prospects for ***Snow White*** don't look great. It received a lukewarm \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes, and suggests word of mouth will only be a bit better than its reviews. With competition like ***A Minecraft Movie*** coming up, ***Snow White*** is unlikely to leg out and it's set to be one of the lowest Disney remakes. For now, a domestic total around $110 million is likely. Which means it will make less money than ***Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*** ($184.9 million) and that's not even adjuste for inflation! Another failure for Disney this year.\n\nSteven Soderbergh's ***Black Bag*** kept the second place spot, earning $4.2 million this weekend. That's a good 44% drop from last weekend, although its numbers are still way too small to make it look notable. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.7 million, and it will finish with over $20 million domestically.\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** may have weak word of mouth, but the very lack of competition is working wonders. The film eased just 29%, adding $4 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $192 million.\n\nAfter topping the box office last week, ***Novocaine*** felt a gut punch this weekend. The film dropped a very rough 58%, earning $3.6 million this weekend and falling to fourth place. That's just brutal, although it's a better drop than Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***, which collapsed 67.7% (but ***Companion*** faced the Super Bowl in its second weekend). Through 10 days, the film has earned a meager $15.6 million, and won't make it much further than $20 million, especially with three wide releases coming up this weekend.\n\nWith the loss of PLF screens, ***Mickey 17*** suffered another rough drop this weekend. It dropped 51% and added $3.6 million this weekend. The film has earned a very weak $40 million, and with the film hitting PVOD tomorrow, it will continue falling. For now, it should finish with around $45 million domestically.\n\nIt's not until sixth place where we find the other newcomer, WB's ***The Alto Knights***. Debuting in 2,651 theaters, the film flopped with a horrific $3.1 million this weekend. That's one of Robert De Niro's worst debuts as leading man, as well as the 26th worst debut for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters.\n\nThe film achieved some notoriety, given that it was the first film greenlit by David Zaslav when he joined Warner Bros. Discovery back in 2022. But there were already signs that the film would struggle. For starters, director Barry Levinson had a very successful career... but that peaked in the 90s. His films in the 21st century have been flopping across the board, suggesting he might not deliver the quality he once commanded. Not to mention that gangster films haven't fared well in the past few years.\n\nThere's also the very weird decision to cast Robert De Niro in the roles of both Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, even though they are not twins nor anything. WB has also moved the release date, and the first trailer didn't premiere till two months ago, which is a very short release window for a major film. And despite the amount of names attached, reviews were very poor (39% on RT). The film simply couldn't overcome the \"been there, done that\" feeling that plagued other gangster films.\n\nAccording to WB, 58% of the audience was male. Unsurprisingly, it skewed massively old; 77% of the audience was 35 and over, and 33% over 55. They gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore, which is simply not good for its long-term prospects. With many new releases coming up, ***The Alto Knights*** will disappear quickly from theaters. It would be a surprise if it finished anywhere close to $10 million.\n\n***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** added $1.8 million this weekend. That's a 41% drop, which isn't bad, but it's kinda rough for an animated film. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $6.5 million so far. Despite these low numbers, Ketchup looks content with its performance, given that they are currently bidding $50 million to acquire ***Coyote vs. Acme***.\n\nIn eighth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39%, adding $1.5 million. That takes its domestic total to $37.8 million.\n\nIn ninth place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 42% and added $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $95.6 million and it's on its last legs to hit the $100 million milestone.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***The Last Supper***, which added $1.3 million this weekend. That's off 51% from last week, which is a very bad drop for a Christian drama. Through 10 days, the film has earned $5.3 million so far.\n\n2 years after its debut in Sundance, ***Magazine Dreams*** has finally hit theaters. Released by Briarcliff in 815 theaters, the film tanked with just $701,365 this weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone; you really expect the public to pay a ticket for a film with Jonathan Majors?  \n\nRLJ Entertainment also released ***Ash*** in 1,136 theaters, but the film flopped with a terrible $689,144. Expect it to fade quickly.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Snow White*** led the overseas box office, yet its numbers were far below the most pessimistic scenario. It debuted with a very weak $43.1 million overseas, for a terrible $85.3 million worldwide debut. Wow, not even hitting $100 million is pathetic. The film had very weak numbers in the UK ($5.1M), Mexico ($4.1M), Italy ($4M), France ($3M) and Spain ($2.6M). With a debut this soft, you can count on something: the film is not making it to $300 million worldwide, and $250 million could be in danger if it collapses. As mentioned, this cost $270 million. Big, big failure.\n\n***Mickey 17*** added $8.7 million this weekend, taking its worldwide numbers to $109.8 million. The best markets are South Korea ($19.6M), UK ($7.5M), France ($6.8M), Germany ($3.6M) and Mexico ($3.3M).\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $3.1 million, allowing the film to cross $200 million worldwide. The best markets are the UK ($22.5M), Mexico ($16M), China ($14.4M), France ($14M) and Korea ($11.4M).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Love Hurts* | Feb/7 | Universal | $5,800,440 | $15,683,090 | $17,561,938 | $18M\n\n- Well, it truly lived up to its title. ***Love Hurts*** has ended its run with a very poor $17 million, below its already low $18 million. While Ke Huy Quan is in the middle of a return to films, this was an offer he was better off turning down. He reportedly accepted the role after Steven Spielberg convinced him. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThere's three wide releases this weekend. And while ***Snow White*** will probably continue at the top spot, one film will fight to be as close as possible.\n\nThat film is Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man***, starring Jason Statham. The plot is... come on, you watch a Jason Statham film for the plot? What's important is that it's action, that's it. Statham is a very reliable name, with his latest film, ***The Beekeeper***, earning over $150 million worldwide last year. \n\nThere's also the release of A24's ***Death of a Unicorn***, which stars Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega as a father and daughter who accidentally hit and kill a unicorn, causing them to be hunted down by its parents. Despite a promising premise, reviews out of SXSW aren't glowing (currently at a middling 64% on RT).\n\nThe other release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which follows a family that sees a strange woman, dressed in all black, staying in their yard. Blumhouse is currently not at its best; their previous film, ***Wolf Man***, was one of their few box office flops. With a very generic premise and lack of buzz, it'd be a surprise if this film got close to $10 million this weekend.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

Would you guys like to light them off?\u201d \u201cLet me join your crewwwWWW?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking green tea all goddamn day!\u201d \u201cYou guys, the bathroom here is nuts!\u201d \u201cUltimate punch!\u201d \u201cPussyyyyyyyyyy\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Rod and I like to party.\u201d \u201cI said you look shitty! Goodnight, Denise!\u201d\n\nPerfect soundtrack! Effing EUROPE songs throughout. The \u201cYou\u2019re The Voice\u201d montage! We know the story takes place in the age of the internet, but when? It\u2019s timeless, sorta. 80s glam metal songs with earnest lyrics, clothes vehicles and houses that could put you in any of the last five decades. \n\nStill cannot believe this movie even exists. Thank god it does. With all of the frightened studio execs unwilling to take risks on anything because audiences are unpredictable and unreliable, for Paramount to basically go, \u201cOK idiots, here\u2019s $25 million, go make a movie,\u201d it\u2019s baffling to me. It\u2019s also a shame this movie is still not as well known as it deserves. I would have thought, y\u2019know, long tail rules, \u201cHot Rod\u201d would have made its money back by now.\n\nI\u2019m dropping this here for appreciation of a damn funny movie that deserves more viewers.",

        "title": "\"Flow\" - How the Cat-Whale dynamic resonated with me after my mom's suicide",
        "content": "I finally watched Flow yesterday at one of the last screenings here in France, and feel so spoken to. As someone who has lost a lot of people these past few years and felt responsible for the actions of others, the theme of people entering and leaving your life during their own journey gave me a lot of parallels.\n\nBut the Cat's relationship to the Whale really resonated with me, in my heart before I could explain it. I first saw this dynamic as a \"help where you can and accept when you can't\" moral:\n\n&gt;The Whale saving the Cat, while literally lifesaving for the Cat was just a bit of effort on the Whale's part, maybe just an afterthought in its day. However, this situation could only be manufactured through the absurd scenario of the flood, where Whale just happened to have the skills needed to help. When the flood ends, the Cat is the only one with the skills/intelligence to get the rope out of the tree and help save the animals on the boat. When the Cat finds the Whale again -beached in a forest, another absurd scenario-, there is nothing he can do other than comfort the Whale while it dies. We aren't all built with the right tools for every scenario, and some problems are beyond our means, we are not able to save everyone, even if that person had previously saved us and we feel indebted to them. A very stoic moral that preaches forgiving yourself.\n\nBut I couldn't figure out why it was so powerful to me, so I went for a walk under the nighttime drizzle after the movie. I then realized that I saw the Cat &amp; Whale's relationship as that of me and my mother, who lost her battle with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago. \n\n&gt;In addition to saving the Cat, the Whale was following the boat, serving as a source of comfort in a sea of danger. If something goes terribly wrong, the Whale would be there to save the Cat again. My mother, and most people's parents, was that source of comfort, and it's thanks to her that I am alive today, simply by virtue of being her child. She followed my boat as I sailed through the troubled waters of divorced parents, being moved as a child to a country whose language I did not speak, and through any other challenges in my life.\n\n&gt;I have spent the past 2 years guilting myself since I found her dead. With a better son, she would still be alive -despite the fact that I had already stopped 2 of her attempts and was the only thing left giving her joy in life-. And while that may be partly true simply due to the butterfly effect, for the most part, I have to accept that the external circumstances (bipolar disorder &amp; suicidal / a beached whale in the middle of the forest) were far too overwhelming. \n\nIf I watched \"Flow\" and could \"forgive\" the Cat for not being able to save the Whale, then I have to forgive myself for not being able to save my mom.",

        "title": "The one Disney animated film that BEGGED to be made into a franchise/series but never did? THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE. Oh how I wish we could\u2019ve had more adventures with Basil of Baker Street",
        "content": "I know everyone always goes on about the Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladdin etc. (&amp; those are wonderful films)\n\nBut for me? 1986\u2019s \u201cThe Great Mouse Detective\u201d is the **PERFECT** animated Disney film. I love practically every frame. The music, the voice acting &amp; animation? It\u2019s wonderfully charming. Disney doing Victorian era London is always special &amp; atmospheric. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know the premise? It\u2019s simple. What if Sherlock Holmes\u2026was a mouse. Solving mice crimes. All while living in mouse hole tucked away in actual human Sherlock Holmes address of Baker Street\n\nThis movie was completed in that sweet spot where Disney had yet to make the switch to digital coloring(aka digital Ink &amp; paint aka the CAPS system) and so this film has that warmth &amp; charm that was a little bit lost when the conversion was made circa the early 1990s. It does have a very early CGI sequence in an animated film, the terrific Big Ben Clock climax. (The gears were created digitally and then traced over, not actually rendered out to film or composited digitally)\n\nSo what makes the film so special? The characters. The characters! I know this isn\u2019t technically \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d BUT if it were, this would be my favourite rendition of the great detective. \n\nLike all great Sherlock adaptations it\u2019s the Sherlock/Watson relationship that is the true measure of success and this movie takes the cake. David Q Dawson is our Watson stand in, he\u2019s a caring albeit clumsy mouse, compared to Basil\u2019s man(er..mouse) of action. They just have terrific chemistry. You buy them as friends instantly. \n\nAnd it\u2019s this reason more adventure were needed. I don\u2019t care in what form. Straight to video, animated series or legit theatrical sequel. So long as the same voice actors were used? Give me more! But alas, it was not meant to be. After Little Mermaid and the rest become huge cultural juggernauts, there was no more room for the relatively modest successful fare like The Great Mouse Detective. And we are all the poorer for it. Also unlike most those other films, this isn\u2019t a musical. There\u2019s one scene where characters break out in song. And it\u2019s great.\n\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered if Disney would do the same \u201clive action\u201d remake route befallen to so many of the animated films. Maybe in time but you\u2019ll never do better than Vincent Price as Ratigan, Barrie Ingham as Basil and Val Bettin as Dawson. RIP.\n\nAnd that score by Henry Mancini? Now that\u2019s a theme! Remember when we had memorable musical themes? \n\nSo? For those who haven\u2019t had the pleasure or for those who have &amp; haven\u2019t had the pleasure in awhile, go check out The Great Mouse Detective, bask in its charm, warmth, heart and splendor. \n\nThis movie deserved to be a franchise.",

He played the role well and was a good fit for it, I thought.\n\nMost of all, holy Hell! This was a great movie. A solid thriller with a well-thought mystery behind the premise. There was enough action to keep it moving along, without going over the top, and only one car chase scene, which had a funny conclusion. That's Pittsburgh for you!\n\nI'd watch it again and if you haven't, it's worthwhile.",

I knew nothing about it prior to watching, read no reviews or opinions, and now I can totally recommend it to anyone interested.\n\nAnd if you indeed are curious, it's a relatively slow and atmospheric horror that touches upon the topic of cults, the people involved in them, and those who manage to get out.\n\nAnyway, what about you?

        "title": "The Monkey &amp; the generational curse of your father's unresolved issues",
        "content": "Just saw The Monkey last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! As always after seeing a movie I came to reddit to read a bunch of discussion threads and see what folks are saying. Lots of people talked about enjoying the campy kills and dialogue. Turning into pink mist from being electrocuted but your leg somehow flies off and smacks Theo James? \"It is what it is...the word of our Lord.\" Good stuff! What I haven't seen as much talk about is the meaning of the film. Maybe it's been posted about already and I just haven't seen it, but I got the impression some viewers were unhappy with the lack of lore for the monkey-demon itself. I thought there was a clear and neatly-resolved message inside the delightfully silly package so I thought I'd add my two cents review.\n\nTo me the monkey represents the emotional burden of men, especially fathers\\*, who repress their traumas, become stunted, and end up hurting those around them. The film shows us this harm to others on two parallel levels: the realistically fucked up relationship of an emotionally distant dad and his son, and the fantastically gruesome harm perpetrated by the monkey.\n\n\\*Of course the message works for anyone but I think fatherhood and masculinity is the most explicit. All four characters involved in the struggle over the monkey are men with dad issues. The main antagonistic relationships are dad-son, brother-brother, dad-step dad. Elijah Wood's foil to the main character is literally a \"fatherhood expert.\"\n\nHal and Bill both become a type of man in this vein: Hal emotionally repressed and distant, Bill physically violent. In real life a man like Bill wouldn't need magic monkey powers to kill people over his emotions. Family violence is a common tragedy, and at least in part this is because a patriarchal society demands men repress their emotions and become islands unto themselves (\"she was my mom too\" \"I never thought of it that way\"). The monkey kills people around the brothers because there is an evil generational curse on them, but it's only a magic one for film reasons. The real generational curse is that emotionally unavailable fathers wreak havoc on people, especially their sons.\n\nThe movie resolves when the brothers open up to each other and Hal confronts death (literally) along with his feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. By doing this in front of his son he's choosing to deal with his emotions in a healthy way and end the vicious cycle. Likewise about the monkey he says they have to \"recognize that it's ours and keep it close\" so it can do further harm. The evil bastard monkey was the emotions we repressed all along!\n\nFor me it was exactly what I wanted it to be: enjoyably campy and dumb in the best way, but with an actual message buried in the tomfoolery. Watching it with this in mind made me enjoy the movie more and also made the ending feel quite satisfying.\n\n4/5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

        "content": "I love this movie. After rewatching it I was reminded at how well made and beautiful everything is. The special effects still hold up tremendously today, despite being over 70 years old now. The physical sets of the Nautilus are outstanding, as are the miniatures used for exterior shots of it. Speaking of which, everything done underwater is mesmerizing and the effort and stuntwork required to get such shots is highly praiseworthy. Let's of course not forget the amazing squid attack sequence which is some of the best practical puppetry I've seen. And the plot too, I find to be a brilliant mix of character conflict and thrilling adventure of discovery. The discussions held between Captain Nemo, Ned, Pierre, and Conseil  about the ethics of humanity and our usage of warfar are genuinely fascinating and not just a black and white topic. All thanks to the performances from everyone on the cast. And lastly, the real oceanic filming locations are another big positive I admire as it truly makes you feel like you're going on this grand voyage to various exotic destinations. \n\nThat all being said, this movie doesn't seem to be boasted about too highly in terms of classic cinema, apart from just having a good Rotten Tomatoes score. I rarely ever hear it even being mentioned. So I honestly wish more would watch 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for it to have a resurgence of appreciation in today's modern discussion of film. Because it 100% deserves recognition for its stellar filmmaking and writing on display. ",

        "content": "\r\nNot all of Chekhov\u2019s guns have to be physical objects, for instance we see it all the time in monster movies. The monsters weakness is revealed or discovered, and later used against it. To give the audience the information that the werewolf is weak to silver, but never put it into practice, creates the same narrative void as is the protagonist found a physical \u201canti werewolf gun\u201d only to never use it.    \n    \r\nI would like to bring up the fact that the whole movie, 9(2009), is built around an unfired \u2018Chekhov\u2019s idea.\u2019 We are directly given information that in my mind, built up a completely different and non-traditional ending that I was so excited for, only for the movie to fall on it\u2019s face into the \u2018generic ending\u2019 puddle, including a good ol\u2019, out of nowhere, Deus Ex Machina.   \n    \r\nA quick synopsis:\r\nThe movie 9 is set in a post apocalyptic world, the story starts with a scientist, the last remaining human, transferring the last part of his soul into a sack puppet using a device referred to as the Talisman. The scientist dies after the transfer.   \n    \r\nThe newly created sack puppet, labelled \u20189,\u2019 heads off into the apocalyptic wasteland, only to be attacked by demonic robot creations. 9 eventually meets up with sack puppets 1-8. Hijinks ensue and eventually we meet the evil \u2018Fabrication Machine,\u2019 an evil machine that was corrupted by the warmongering government, resulting in it building murder machines that eventually turned on humanity and led to the lifeless wasteland the movie takes place in.   \n    \r\nThe evil Fabrication Machine obtains the soul transfer Talisman, and begins hunting down the sack puppets, eventually sucking the souls out of 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 into itself.   \n    \r\nFor the grand finale, 9 gets the Talisman back from the Fabrication Machine, and suddenly the Talisman that has up until now only ever been a soul transference device, becomes a Deus Ex Machina laser that goes pew pew pew and kills the Machine, freeing the souls of the sack puppets (but not reviving them.) Ultimately this ending leaves just 3, 4, 7 and 9 to a bleak future, just the four of them in the endless expanse of a ruined world.   \n   \r\nNow, what is the Chekhov\u2019s information I want to moan about? Throughout the movie we learn the following:   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist from the beginning is the one who created the Fabrication Machine, he was a good man who built the machine to build and create for peace.  \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Fabrication Machine is corrupted by the government, but the Scientist specifically says that: \u201cMy creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul\u201d.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist with his benevolent soul, has transferred his soul into the 9 sack puppets. \u201cYou are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul.\u201d.  \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Fabrication Machine could easily destroy the sack puppets physically, but seems to go out of its way to specifically absorb their souls using the talisman. Note that the machine already has a specific slot/port on it to use the talisman presumably designed and installed by the Scientist.    \n    \r\nSo what ending did I see being built up with this information? Lets review:    \n     \r\n\u2022\tThe machine is designed to create, it just chooses to create death. It still could create life, at least artificial life, should it have a change of heart.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe machine is evil specifically because it lacks a soul, however the Scientist included a way for it to absorb souls, since it already has a port for the Talisman. This implies the Scientist already had the Talisman and soul transfer technology before building the Fabrication Machine.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist transferred his \u2018good soul\u2019 into 9 sack puppets. The Machine hunts down the Talisman and sack puppets, prioritising absorbing their segments of soul over physically destroying them.   \n\r\n\u2022\tDid the scientist plan this all along? Was the machine always meant to have a soul, but the government stopped him? Was releasing his soul into the wasteland in the form of sack puppets a desperate attempt at self-preservation, or a last ditch effort to provide his corrupted creation with the soul it both needs and craves to fulfil its original benevolent purpose?      \n     \r\nSo, what happens if the machine captures all 9 puppets? It\u2019ll have a complete soul, the one thing it needed to not be a dick. Maybe it can find and help any remaining humans, or just create a new world of its own creations?    \n     \r\nA lot of this information was dumped on the main character, 9, right at the end, just before he laser blasts the machine. However, the end I saw coming, and was really excited about, was the idea that 9 would have to convince or trick the remaining sack puppets to sacrifice themselves to the Fabrication Machine, allowing the Scientist\u2019s soul to reform the machine and start rebuilding the world.     \n     \r\nPros of my ending:    \nInteresting, dramatic, unexpected. Something different from the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after. In my opinion the original ending is actually pretty bleak, yeah they defeated the BBEG but there\u2019s nothing left of the world, just the four remaining sack puppets, two of which are mute with childlike personalities. The original ending doesn\u2019t set up any kind of post-movie goals or motivation for the remaining sack puppets, they don\u2019t even need to eat or drink. Do the characters plan to just sit in a ruined building somewhere and twiddle their thumbs?    \n     \r\nCons of my ending:    \nIt\u2019s heavily implied that the Scientist was the last human, there isn\u2019t really any world for the Fabrication Machine to rebuild once it turns good. Maybe there are survivors or untouched countries beyond the setting of the movie? The Scientists plan of just releasing his soul through sock puppets and just hoping that his machine eventually hunts them all down is a bit convoluted, could he not just find the machine himself?    \n      \r\nIt\u2019s noted on: https://nine.fandom.com/wiki/Deleted_Scenes - Trivia.    \n      \r\n\u201cAt some point during the preproduction, they had an adaptation where 9's soul actually gets sucked into the Fabrication Machine, and meets its soul to discover that the Machine was really \"0\".\u201d.  \n    \r\nWhich hints at a similar concept, but implies the Scientist put the evil part of his soul into the Machine?\r\n",
