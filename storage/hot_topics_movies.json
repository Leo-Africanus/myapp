In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn\u2019t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?",

        "content": "I rewatched *A Bug's Life* recently. I haven't seen it in literally over twenty years. It has a story about being true to yourself, finding your way, worker explotation, bullying, etc but it's nothing too deep for a film, especially a family film.\n\nIt felt refreshing. It's not a tearjerker. It doesn't have a super strong commentary about life. It's just a fun film to watch.\n\nAs a kid, I always wanted a sequel. I would think \"Why did Toy Story get so many sequels and not it?\". As an adult, I realize there's really no need for a sequel. It's self-contained. Pixar could do stuff set in the bug's world or make shorts about the circus bugs, but there's no need.\n\nPixar struggles with the weight of their success. Everyone expects their films to be top-tier, 10/10. They have a reputation for some of the best CGI animation in the industry, and some of the sweetest family geared films as well. Pixar films not seen as Oscar Bait art films, but their films are known for being impactful.\n\nBut not every studio can make bangers all the time. Their films can't all *be* roaring successes. Even if their films are great, not all of them can be as emotionally investing as \"Soul\" or \"Toy Story 2\".\n\nWhen their films fail to meet expectations, it's noticeable. No one talks about \"A Good Dinosaur\". \"Brave\" and \"Cars\" are highly controversial amongst Disney-Pixar fans as well.\n\nEveryone expects Pixar to release a certain type of film. They have different expectations than other studios like DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky, or even Disney itself. Not all their films can meet this expectation. \n\nPixar's bar is too high for their own good. They've been a gold standard for animated films for decades now.",

        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

Can\u2019t wait to spend this weekend on the couch enjoying your recommendations :)",

The film keeps one actor from the original cast and replaces the rest with Muppets.\n\nI offer *Pulp Fiction* retaining Ving Rhames.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing what gets offered.

        "content": "I finally watched Aftersun yesterday and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since. I had a genuine sob fest after watching it, and it easily became my current favorite film, not just because it\u2019s good but because I relate to it heavily. My dad suffered with horrible depression basically during my entire childhood and my adolescence, and it affected my family in every way. I have my own complexes from it as the eldest daughter as well. I related to the film down to Calum\u2019s idealism in (naively) wanting so badly to create pure memories for his daughter when he\u2019s doing almost the opposite. My dad has also made many promises to pay for things that he could never actually pay for. I\u2019m in my late 20s now and once in a while he\u2019ll attempt conversations with me about his paternal regrets that make me very uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, yeah, this movie wrecked me. My chest has been aching since I finished it. So naturally I want to watch more movies with similar themes. They don\u2019t HAVE to exactly be about troubling father-daughter dynamics but it\u2019s a plus if they are. I generally just like movies that are devastating and effectively address the pains and traumas that people experience in a realistic way, especially if they relate to mental or physical illness OR loss.

        "content": "A great confrontation scene in my opinion has the aspect of good chemistry between the actors/actresses to deliver such forceful dialogue. Do you have a favorite?\n\nFor me, top of my mind are (in no particular order):\n\n1. **Her** \\- Joaquin Phoenix+Rooney Mara - when they are signing the divorce papers. \"You fell in love with your computer?!\" The way she delivered it with such disgust is amazing.\n2. **The Social Network** \\- again Rooney Mara but with Jesse Eisenberg - \"You will go through life thinking that girls dont like you because you are a nerd. And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that won't be true. It will be because youre an asshole.\"\n3. **Heat** restaurant scene with DeNiro and Pacino - despite having a common ground they wont stop on what they are doing\n4. **The Dark Knight** with Bale and Ledger - \"See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.\"\n5. **Inglorius Basterds** opening scene aka Christoph Waltz' epic scene - \"You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?\"\n6. **Marriage Story** \\- Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson - \"Everyday I wake up and I hope youre dead!\"\n\n",

I'm aware that it's probably Good/Bad, but I still enjoy it. \nI love The Family Man, but I'm not sure if it's actually Good, or not. Let me know what ya'll think! \ud83e\udd19",
