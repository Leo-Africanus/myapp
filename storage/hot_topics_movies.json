        "title": "December 20-22 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' tops 'Mufasa: The Lion King' in the domestic market. While 'Mufasa' leads overseas, its $122.2 million worldwide debut is very underwhelming. Meanwhile, 'Kraven' and 'War of the Rohirrim' collapsed 72% and 73%, respectively.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/pa090wakvn8e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad30e582d782417c82593228c0a7bf97e777c0f\n\nThere was a new box office king, and it wasn't Mufasa or any other lion.\n\nThat honor belonged to ***Sonic 3***, which managed to outgross ***Mufasa*** to top the box office. The latter still won the foreign box office, even if the numbers are way below the expectations. In limited release, A24's ***The Brutalist*** had one of the best per-theater averages of the year so far. While last week's newcomers, ***Kraven*** and ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** had poor drops after their anemic starts.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $139.7 million. That's up a massive 62% from last year, when ***Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom*** topped and flopped.\n\nDebuting in first place, Paramount's ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** earned $60.1 million in 3,761 theaters. That's below the $72 million debut from the previous film, but that's not really a cause for concern as of now; December titles are often known for decreasing openings but strong legs.\n\nWhile not a franchise best, this is still a very solid debut. As the previous film teased, the introduction of Shadow was key to the hype. Adding Keanu Reeves to the mix was also a strong choice to get the Internet going wild. It's a film where Paramount aggressively campaigned and got people talking. The fact that there were 3 ***Sonic*** films in the span of almost five years is impressive, especially when the third film has the strongest reviews so far. While it might sound disappointing that the film didn't outperform the second film, at least it has the December excuse. \n\nAccording to Paramount, 59% of the audience was male and 43% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which is the same score as the previous films. Despite its lower-than-expected opening, it's gonna have some legs through the holidays. For now, $200 million should happen. Paramount clearly believes in the franchise; they already announced development on a fourth film before the film even opened. \n\nHaving to settle for second place, Disney's ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** earned just $35.4 million in 4,100 theaters. That's down a massive 82% from the 2019 film, which broke so many records back then. Even if we have to accept that December lowers the opening weekend numbers, that's still a horrible drop.\n\nDisney clearly believed in the potential of the 2019 ***Lion King*** remake. After all, it earned $1.6 billion worldwide. But the thing is that the film's reputation is not the same as it was 5 years ago. The audience liked the film and ate it up, but like a lot of live-action remakes, the audience moved on afterwards. All while the criticism for the 2019 film just increased. \n\nBut still, how can it explain a 82% drop? Even if we have to ignore the fact that people moved on from the 2019 version, there's the fact that this is completely new story with new songs. There's no nostalgia to be milked here, and the prequel aspect is also a double-edged sword; we already know Mufasa and Scar will live and eventually become enemies. Audiences can simply skip the film and won't really miss anything, unless you're insanely passionate to learn questions like... how did Rafiki got his staff? Even with the presence of a fantastic filmmaker like Barry Jenkins, you can tell this was just a paycheck; it's sitting at a weak 57% on RT. So if you didn't care or forgot about the 2019 film, there are no reasons to check this out.\n\nAccording to Disney, 54% of the audience was female and 39% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a fine \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is lower than the previous film. Even if the film legs out to a 6x multiplier, that would still be just $212 million, which is like 60% down from the previous film. Needless to say, it's unlikely there will be a third ***Lion King*** film.\n\nUniversal's ***Wicked*** was on third place, easing just 38% and adding $14.1 million. That takes its domestic total to $384.5 million, and it should continue holding incredibly well through the holidays.\n\nAfter topping the box office for three weekends, ***Moana 2*** was hit by ***Sonic*** and ***Mufasa***. The film fell to fourth place, and it had another rough drop, officially losing to ***Wicked*** on the weekends. This time, it fell 50%, adding $13.2 million this weekend. While the film has had a huge opening weekend, the legs are leaving a lot to be desired. The film has made $359.1 million, and it has zero shot at hitting $450 million domestically. That's quite disappointing, signaling that the film was very front-loaded.\n\nAngel Studios also released ***Homestead*** this weekend. Opening in 1,886 theaters, it earned a solid $6 million. While critics lambasted the film, the audience gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore. It should hold well thanks to the holidays, but it would be a surprise if it came anything close to $30 million by the end of its run.\n\n***Gladiator II*** is still showing some legs, even if they arrived a little too late to make a difference. The film dropped 40%, adding $4.5 million this weekend. The film has made $154 million so far, and the holidays should get it to around $170 million.\n\nAfter its pathetic debut, ***Kraven the Hunter*** didn't save face on its second weekend. The film earned just $3 million, which marks a horrible 72% drop, almost on par with ***Morbius***. Through ten days, the film has made a poor $17.3 million so far, and with four films opening in wide release, it will continue falling. Even with the holidays, it'd be a surprise if it made much more than $25 million domestically.\n\nAmazon's ***Red One*** had its worst drop so far, falling 65% and earning only $1.4 million. With more theater drops on the way, it's now guaranteed to finish below $100 million, which is quite disappointing.\n\nSo ***Kraven*** had a horrible drop, yet ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** was ready to introduce itself. It made just $1.2 million this weekend, which is a horrible 73% drop and the worst drop in the franchise. The film has earned a meager $7.3 million, and it's gonna struggle to hit $10 million lifetime, which is just pathetic. Just a few minutes ago, it was announced that the film will hit digital at home on December 27, just 2 weeks of theatrical exclusivity. Ouch.\n\n***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** rounded up the Top 10, earning $780,000 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $38.4 million. It has a few more days to make money before completely free falling.\n\nA24's ***The Brutalist*** debuted in 4 theaters. Despite its commanding 215-minute runtime, the film earned $266,791, which translates to a very strong $66,698 per-theater average (third best of the year). With strong awards buzz on the way, the film will continue expanding in the coming weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nIn some consolation, ***Mufasa*** topped the foreign box office. Even though that's by default; ***Sonic*** didn't debut in any market, opting to start its international run on Christmas.\n\nWith that out of the way, ***Mufasa*** debuted with $87.2 million in the overseas markets, for a $122.2 million worldwide debut. That's far below the projected $180 million debut, and a far cry from the original. It had soft debuts across the world, with its best numbers in China ($7.8M), France ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.1M), the UK ($5.5M) and Germany ($5M). Even with the benefit of holidays, it's tough to see the film making much more than $600 million worldwide, more than $1 billion below the 2019 title. Which means it will break the record for the biggest sequel-to-original drop.\n\n***Moana 2*** added $32.8 million this weekend, as its worldwide total is nearing $800 million. The best markets so far are France ($46M), UK ($37.6M), Germany ($29M); Mexico ($26.2M) and Brazil ($24M). That billion is gonna take a few more weeks.\n\n***Wicked*** added $12.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $572 million. The best markets are the UK ($60.8M), Australia ($22.5M), Korea ($13.1M), Mexico ($9.6M) and Germany ($8M). \n\nIn some notable news, ***Gladiator II*** has finally crossed $400 million worldwide, with a $416.3 million run so far.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEK**\n\nWe'll have four films hitting wide release.\n\nThe first is Robert Eggers' new film ***Nosferatu***, a remake of the 1922 film. Eggers is coming off ***The Northman***, which was his highest grossing film. Even though it wasn't theatrically successful, it was reported that it broke even through ancilliaries, which is why this film exists. Pre-sales are very strong for its opening day, and with fantastic reviews so far, it looks like Eggers might have a new highest grossing film.\n\nAnother release is Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown***, which stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The film has earned very good reviews, but Chalamet has received acclaim so far, building strong awards buzz. Perhaps we're looking at another sleeper hit.\n\nA24 is also releasing ***Babygirl***, which stars Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. Once again, another title with decent reviews so far, and Kidman earning Oscar buzz for her performance.\n\nThe final title is Amazon's ***The Fire Inside***, which marks Rachel Morrison's directorial debut, written by Barry Jenkins. The film stars Ryan Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry, and follows the true story of American professional boxer Claressa \"T-Rex\" Shields as she trains for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Amazon's ***The Boys in the Boat*** performed quite well last year, so perhaps this could surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

The entire infrastructure would collapse, buildings would rumble under all the weight of the snow. Power failure, Electricity and water shortages. Moral sinking. People fighting over food etc. The government trying to find solutions. I thought of this idea because we want to go to Bosnia for the holiday, where it\u2019s been snowing for the past 3 days, so it\u2019s going to be hard driving there. There\u2019s also been a power out today. Hopefully tap water will stay and power will probably come back tomorrow. That made me think what if it just dosent stop snowing, how would civilisation survive. I would love see my imagined scenario visualized to watch a movie, if there isn\u2019t one there definelty should be one.",

This film would've had major legs as a miniseries. It created a new tone for noir. And since then, I don't think one film has come close to matching this blend of genres. A tin of TV shows have tried their hand. And some are quite brilliant (Better Call Saul, Poker Face, Ozark). I promise you if you seek this flick out, you will thank me. And if you don't like Sarah Silverman, the start of this movie is just for you.",

Every single frame looks like it belongs in a museum - from the opening shot, the blocking, compositions, lighting, mind-blowingly masterful. The cryptic, unexplored elements of the universe (the giants!). The Green Knight himself. \n\nBut seriously, why don\u2019t more people bring this one up when they\u2019re talking about A24\u2019s best? It\u2019s weird in all the best ways, super ambitious, and just unapologetically doing its own thing. I get that it\u2019s not for everyone\u2014it\u2019s slow and kinda cryptic, but that\u2019s what makes it so good, IMO. It feels like an old-school myth come to life, and it\u2019s just dripping with atmosphere. Anyone else feel the same? Also, kind of a Christmas movie in a strange way.",

Condenses a really in depth alternate history into a 5 minute sequence set to \u201cthe times they are a changin\u201d\n\nWe see the rise and fall of costumed heroes, and after reading the \u201cbefore Watchmen comics\u201d the fate of the Minutemen seems even sadder. Dollar Bill is killed from his cape getting stuck in a revolving door. Silhouette is killed in a hate crime after revealing her homosexuality. Mothman is forcefully sent to a mental hospital after a mental breakdown. In the corner of the last supper scene, you can see Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis confiding in one another, a little Easter egg to their own relationship that they always had to keep secret\n\nThere\u2019s something incredibly disturbing to me seeing the images of these cheesy golden age parodies having such dark ends, which I think is really well done. The contrast of Dollar Bill\u2019s bright blue and red starred suit being covered with blood in a very unceremonious situation",

One is a heart warming film with amazing art, sound, script, and acting, that used Simmons amazing voice to bring Santa to life. The other is Red One. \n\nObviously many actors have played the same character in a series like Mission Impossible, 007, Marval/DC, etc. and the quality of those movies can vary within the series. And also, some actors just have a \"theme\" that they are well known for like Matt Damon playing \"Guy who is lost and needs to be rescued by others\" or The Rock always playing \"Intense Adventure Guy\". \n\nBut as I ask in the title, has any actor played basically the same role in unrelated movies, something specific as \"CIA agent attempting to prove himself innocent of a terrorist plot\" or similar and had such VASTLY different reviews as JK Simmons got for Klaus and Red One?\n\nSorry for such a specific question, I just realized I can't thing of very many similar things to this where it seemed like a home run for him to play Santa, but then he does in live action... And it's bad. \n\n\nClaus* not clause ",

Shaves his beard. \n\nEven when Joe becomes Santa... he seems hesitant and awkward. Ernest naturally has a love and understanding of Christmas. Ernest is also a master of impressions; so he could easily pull off a convincing Santa if needed.\n\nWhy wasn't Ernest picked as Santa's replacement?",

Leatherheads is the only football movie I know of that has an older time setting as its set in the 1920s, but it\u2019s a comedy and not very good. What I really want to see is an earnest biopic showing a piece of football history. There\u2019s all these stories from Pre-War football especially in College Football history, with many of the big ticket rivalries spanning well over 100 years. Does anybody know if this has been portrayed in film?",

        "content": "Just saw this yesterday and looks like it hasn\u2019t been discussed here in a couple years. Never knew this movie existed somehow! \n\nI really enjoyed it for the most part, but I could see how you could find it boring, or pointless.\n\nMy main question is:\n\nDo people think Paterson was actually content? \n\nYou could look at it like, this guy lives a simple life with a woman he loves, and creates just for the sake of creating. He doesn\u2019t need anything more.\n\nOr you could look at as a somewhat depressing story. This guy, and his wife, want to do more, want to live a bigger life, but they\u2019re stuck. \n\nIn my mind it\u2019s somewhere between the two. Like, there is part of him that wants more. But he also realizes he\u2019s lucky in the grand scheme of things, and he doesn\u2019t take his nice, quiet life for granted. \n\nMaybe his military experience has something to do with it. He saw some shit over there, and now he just wants to live a peaceful, if unremarkable life, far away from the chaos of war. \n\nAnyway, just curious what others think since I have seen a bunch of different interpretations around.

        "content": "I can\u2019t find it. The movie is a Sci-Fi kind of movie. I only remember a few pieces of details from the movie and I\u2019ll try my best to describe. The movie starts with some military team on a mission. One of the soldiers of the team sees a weird blue/whiteish thing in the middle of a room and cant figure out what it is. The white thing turns out to be ghost-like being that is really powerful. Later in the movie, the military tries to kill these ghosts with a tank and the ghosts destroy the tank like it\u2019s nothing. The military then discovers that they can use some sort of black sand like material that weakens these ghosts. At the end of the movie. They discover a really big place that turns people into these ghosts. I don\u2019t know what the purpose is for turning people into these ghosts is. I hope this made sense and I tried my best to describe it without it sounding funny. If you have more questions please ask in the comments I\u2019ll reply pretty quick ",

        "content": "I had been putting off this movie since like forever but I gave it a watch today and I hated the movie, hated how real it felt, hated knowing this was a real story. The movie seems like it will stay in my life forever.\n\nI have watched other depressing movies like Manchester by the Sea. But this movie truly changed my perspective of life. Setsuko didn't deserve to be brought up in such a time.&gt;! Seita didn't deserve the stress of becoming orphaned and taking care of his sister alone.!&lt; I've been reflecting a lot life can really change soo fast. Also definetly do not watch this movie a day before your birthday.\n\n&gt;!Knowing that the siblings will die from the start I thought would ruin the movie but when ever something good happens I knew the eventual fate of these siblings which made me sad even at the happy moments.!&lt;\n\nSeita was a flawed individual no doubt the sense of pride he had led to the eventual events of the movie. &gt;!I wonder if he just stuck it up helped the aunt, cleaned the dishes etc but ig he was too prideful being the son of a navy soldier!&lt;\n\nI found out that the poster shows a bomber if you up the brightness which is evermore sad.  \nThis was truly an horrific time, all the things in school that I have learnt about WW2 they only showed statistics some of the horrors the alied nations went through, but nothing relating of how the innocent japenese civilians suffered",
