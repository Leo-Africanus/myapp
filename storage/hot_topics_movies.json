Said to my friend group I was disappointed and when they all had seen it gave me the \u201cyou just didn\u2019t understand what was going on\u201d or I must of been confused when watching it so it wasn\u2019t as good.

        "content": "I'll begin by saying that I am not referencing the premise of the movie. Of course, the technology presented was too futuristic but that's beside the point. I'm referring to the insane plot choices that had me cackling throughout the playtime. This wasn't even close to my first time seeing Face/Off but below are some of the things that made me realize how dumb (still a fun watch) this movie really is. \n\n  \n1.) Although they make it clear that it's not only Archer's face they will be changing during his secret procedure, I don't think they emphasized that every single aspect of his outward appearance would be changed. You see him get his scar removed (back to this later) but Troy was sleeping with Archer's wife while wearing his face. That would imply that they either have the exact same sexual anatomy, his wife is completely clueless, or they surgically made Archer's body identical to Troy's. \n\n2.) Throughout the entire film, Archer and Troy shoot thousands of rounds at each other, try and blow each other up, etc. While I get Archer wanted revenge, the two of them clearly didn't care if they were going to get their real face back as I can't imagine the surgery they both received would be able to just fix a shot up face. If their goal was to get their identities back, firing bullets with little to no aim seems like the wrong approach. \n\n3.) Speaking of the shootout scenes, the FBI gives ZERO fucks about children as seen when they raid Troy's friends hideout. Adam almost got shot in every part of that scene. \n\n4.) Random callout but with hindsight, having Danny Masterson play the guy who assaults Jamie was a bad call. \n\n5.) The absolutely most absurd part of this entire movie was Archer's starting motivation and the ending of the movie. Clearly, Archer's vendetta against Troy was due to Archer's son being killed. When he goes in for his first surgery, he asks to not have his scar removed as it reminded him of his lost son and the reason he was doing the secret assignment in the first place. Cut to Archer meets Adam, Troy's biological son, who reminds him of his boy. Adam's mom dies, Archer kills Troy, yada yada. When Archer is finally getting his surgery to get back to his normal appearance, he says he doesn't need the scar back anymore. Fine. A little strange seeing as how important it was at the beginning of the film but maybe Troy being dead will help him and his family move on and remember his boy together. Then you cut to Archer returning home to his family and realize he's been making this essentially random kid (Adam) wait on the porch for him to call him in and announce him as their replacement son to the family's delight. \n\n  \n10/10 would highly recommend",

        "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nFor our buddy\u2019s bachelor party, we\u2019re brainstorming challenges, and one of them involves him watching an absolutely terrible movie beforehand. Not necessarily a long one \u2014 just something unbearably boring, painfully bad, or nearly impossible to sit through.\n\nDuring the bachelor party, we\u2019ll randomly quiz him about the movie at the most inconvenient moments.\n\nSo, hit us with your best (or worst?) suggestions! What\u2019s the most god-awful movie you\u2019ve ever seen?",

        "content": "Definitely Mellish from Saving Private Ryan. I love how it's silent for a few moments then the Germans shoot back through the wall, hitting the other GI in the neck. \n\nOne sticks his head out and Mellish drops him but the rifle goes empty so he rushes the last German. It's a scrappy, dirty fight which seems to last FOREVER, while the GI is still laying there bleeding to death. It breaks my heart hearing Mellish calling out for Rieben, who had been busy taking out the 20mm cannon. They're fighting for so long that the GI bleeds out.\n\nMellish did have the upper hand - he was on top with the knife but the German reversed and disarmed him. Then it was over for Mellish. I like that they showed humanity and that the German didn't take pleasure in stabbing Mellish.\n\nIt's actually a very accurate portrayal as well - The Fallschirmjager, German paratroopers actually held the most hand-to-hand combat victories in all of WW2. You can tell by his camouflage he's not regular German infantry. ",

        "content": "Great movie. Really love the shot of them gutting the fish before the fight, but I\u2019m not sure what it really means. Is the fish poisonous? Is it to show that they can afford to waste resources that the back of the train would die for? Is it just an intimidation tactic? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just the last one, as it is an unsettling image, but it just seems kind of random",

I've always enjoyed movies about time travel as well as romantic comedies, and this one involves both of these and is quite entertaining. Meg Ryan does an excellent acting job as always, and Hugh Jackman does as well. I won't give away any spoilers, other than to say that it's a romantic comedy concerning a relationship between a modern woman and a man from the 19th century who accidentally ends up in 2001, when the movie was made.

This isn't a great example but I think of how \"into the furnace\" there is a few points where you hear news casts in the background that aren't references or shown but sort of add to the setting even tho they are easy to miss",

I don't want to give too much away but, unlike some other creature features, the acting is pretty good and includes James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, and James Arness. Although a lot of the science behind the movie is just wrooooooong, it's a fun watch!\n\nIf you enjoy creature features, drop the name of your favorite in the comments!",
