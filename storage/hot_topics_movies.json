Set in 50 BC, it follows the adventures of a small village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. The titular hero, Asterix, is a diminutive but cunning warrior who, alongside his loyal, super-strong friend Obelix, defends their village with wit, bravery, and a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, granting temporary superhuman strength. Obelix, perpetually strong due to falling into the potion as a child, carries a menhir and loves wild boar and brawls.The series blends slapstick humor, clever wordplay, and historical satire, poking fun at Roman bureaucracy and cultural stereotypes while celebrating Gaulish camaraderie. Each album sees Asterix and Obelix embark on quests\u2014whether thwarting Caesar\u2019s schemes, exploring foreign lands like Britain or Egypt, or protecting their village from internal strife. The comics are renowned for their vibrant art, memorable characters like the tone-deaf bard Cacofonix, and timeless appeal across generations. Translated into over 100 languages, Asterix remains a cultural icon with comic books fans around the world!",

It was Stanley Kubrick's final film that ended up transferring to Steven Spielberg. It goes in truly unprecedented directions I didn't (but should've) excepted that are characteristically Kubrickan.\n\nI've just rewatched Sunshine and I'm thinking of Space Odyssey 2001. Now I'm watching some horror films because I'm in the mood for darkness.\n\nBut I get a little impatient with horror as it often turns into either a slasher flick or a mystery with a killer or a monster in it. I think what I really wish I had more of were movies that take us to the philosophical end of life as we know it, and explore that horrific fantasy.\n\nI'm just super inspired by \"what if\" scenarios about what humans would do if Earth could no longer be inhabited or some other extinction event.\n\nWhat are some \"end of Humanity\" movies you liked?",

I wrote a huge paper on this in college and the movies were Scar Face\u201d and \u201cBlow\u201d. What should my third movie be?\n\nThink the American Dream, but where the protagonist comes from poverty, experiences all the malice of greed, etc. it starts amazing and they get it all, but lose it all. Ideally, drugs or something similar like money. Any ideas?",
