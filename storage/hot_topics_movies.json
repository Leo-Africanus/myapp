And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie.

Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?",

It's is a masterclass in paranoia-driven horror, elevated by groundbreaking practical effects that remain iconic. It's creeping sense of distrust with the crew is amazing. It also expertly fosters an atmosphere of escalating tension, where no one can be trusted and every glance or hesitation deepens the dread. The practical effects by Rob Bottin are astonishingly. And of course the score is chilling. What did you guys make of the ending?",

        "title": "What happened to the Daniel Craig era James Bond series?",
        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

Just finished it and oh my... That was something. \n\nBrutal story... Goes deep into the darkness of drugs and leaves you there. Don't know what to think right now... But likely a movie that will stick for a while. \n\nDon't remember ever watching something close to it. \n\nEllen Burstyn was... phenomenal. So was the rest of the cast to be fair. \n\nWhat a movie.

        "content": "I can't count the number of times when I go into a movie expecting one thing and ending up getting something very different. The trailer can be deceiving, so can be comments from fans and critical reviewers. \n\nBut there been situations I've been pleasantly surprised, where I initially read the premise and thought  I'll skip it because the premise sounded bad (boring, stupid, extreme, absurd) but ended up seeing it years later on TV and I was like Wow, can't believe that premise worked!\n\nCase in point the movie Lobster. I won't say it's my favorite but it was definitely worth watching. And the premise is so weird. It's about a bunch of people forced to pick a romantic partner in a short time because the alternative is they will turn into animals. Of course you can laugh at it but it's played serious, which creates a situation that is absurd and yet you can't look away from it. \n\nIt's almost like you decide to pretend you're a cloud or something, but then you do it so well that people being to wonder what it would mean IF you were a cloud. It's almost the opposite of the situation where someone takes a serious theme, like child abuse, and does such a bad job (bad script, editing, casting choices) that it doesn't connect with people at all. \n\nThat's why I like movies with a seemingly bad or weak premise that turns out well. I think that's art, to be able to make me see something or think about it or care about it, when I would not have otherwise.",

        "content": "I had heard of this movie before but I never looked into it. I saw it pop up as a recommendation on Prime, saw the rating and several actors that I recognized, and decided to give it a go. Part way into the movie I stopped even trying to figure out the guilty party and just got lost in the fun story.   \n\nThe movie was done and the credits were rolling and only then did I discover that there are two more movies! Before I knew it I had finished all 3 and started looking into if there will be a fourth (seems so but I don't think production has started).   \n\nThese were some fun and intriguing movies. If you haven't watch them and you enjoy murder mysteries then I highly recommend them!",

        "content": "I always like to stay for the end credit scene, whether there is one or not.  Even before end credit scenes were a common thing, I always like to watch the credits because it gives me some time to think about the movie and wind down before heading out.  (Plus I don't have to leave in a big crowd of people.)  I also feel like the point of credits is to watch them and care about the work that went into the project.  I also like seeing the song titles/performers and the special thanks stuff.\n\nSo generally it's not a big deal for me to stick around until the end and not be rewarded with an end credit scene.  But I do know there have been moments when I've waited, and an end credit scene did happen, which would get me excited for something cool or interesting, and then the actual scene was a little lame or pointless.  No specifics come to mind right now, but I thought I'd ask and see if any of you have had an end scene that made you madder than you'd have been if it simply didn't exist.",

        "content": "\"The Remarkable Life of Ibelin\" (or just \"Ibelin\" on IMDB) absolutely broke me. \n\nIt's a documentary about  Mats Steen, a Norwegian man who died in 2014 of a degenerative muscular disease. The disease was progressive and by his teens he was wheelchair bound, his condition just got worse from there. In his adult life he became engrossed in the online RPG World of Warcraft, which saddened his family as he withdrew from them. However, Mats left them his login info for the game when he died...\n\nHis parents decided to log in and post a message on his account about his passing... they were immediately flooded with Mats' online friends reaching out with their condolences and stories of online friendship. The family digs into his account and discovers that Mats was not simply gaming, but living a very rich and fulfilling life in the game where he was not limited by his condition. He made many friends, genuinely affected those he cared about and even found love. His online community mostly had no knowledge of his real life condition.\n\nI cried multiple times, but absolutely bawled at the end at his funeral when some of his guildmates attended his funeral and the woman that he had a genuine, loving and complicated relationship with was one of his pall barers.\n\n15/10 - cannot reccomend it enough.",
