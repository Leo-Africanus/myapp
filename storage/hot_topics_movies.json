        "content": "This is something I've noticed in movies from the 2000's to now. A lot of modern movies don't even bother showing a dedicated title sequence to set the mood at the beginning of their movies anymore like they used to.\n\nTake the first two Terminator films for example, both made by James Cameron, they both have terrific title sequences with the signature main theme playing during the sequence.. not only to set the tone, but to introduce the films literary themes and music theme to come into use later.\n\nBut the later Terminator movies don't have title sequences.. the movies just kinda start, with a very boring title cards (with the exception of Salvation)\n\nI can remember heaps of action, sci-fi &amp; horror movies from the 70's 80's &amp; 90's having great title sequences, Halloween 1, 2, 3, 4, Terminator 1 &amp; 2, Total Recall, Speed etc.. Now some of these title sequences were better than others but they all essentially served the same purpose, to set the mood and introduce the literary themes and music themes of the movie. And tbh they were cool!\n\nWhat stylistic choice in modern Hollywood caused the Title sequence to slowly fade away from movies?",

Is it remotely \u201cbelievable\u201d? No. But \u201cNobody 2,\u201d like \u201cNobody\u201d before it, unfolds in its own weirdly grounded action-fantasy universe. Odenkirk has the ability to make behaving glumly fretful seem like a form of slyness; he\u2019s really creating a conspiracy with the audience.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-sharon-stone-1236342504/) (80):\n\n&gt;The filmmakers keep things moving at such a brisk pace (the film clocks in at a mercifully brief 89 minutes) that you go along for the ride, and there are so many terrific action sequences and injections of mordant, deadpan humor that it proves wildly entertaining.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk/) (79):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s like a National Lampoon movie where Chevy Chase is a mass murderer. That\u2019s a great pitch, dang it, and Timo Tjahjanto throws it at 105 miles per hour.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/nobody-2-review/v) (70):\n\n&gt;So while the familiarity is felt throughout, it's hard not to cheer, chuckle, and cringe at all the chaotic mayhem that unfolds in Nobody 2. It's not trying to be anything other than an ultra-violent late summer action flick, and if you go in expecting to watch some gnarly kills, brutal fist-fights, and gun-fu, you'd have to think pretty hard to feel disappointed.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-2-review) (70):\n\n&gt;Though not quite as strong as the first, Nobody 2 still consistently reminds us of how much fun it is to watch Bob Odenkirk unleash the action hero few expected he had within him. \u00a0\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1938864/nobody-2-movie-review/)(70):\n\n&gt;Will Nobody 2 set hearts aflame? No. If this had been the first \"Nobody,\" no one would have been clamoring for a sequel. But it is a glorious Saturday matin\u00e9e, a brisk trifle for the waning days of summer. It's the kind of movie that you'll remember better for the friends you saw it with than the movie itself. And that can be one of cinema's most important functions.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-1235144840/) (C-):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s really no sense of any particular care or passion in the sequel, which frequently feels like the hurried Wikipedia plot summary of a more fleshed-out film that doesn\u2019t actually exist.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDirected by Timo Tjahjanto:\n\n&gt;Workaholic assassin Hutch Mansell takes his family on a much-needed vacation to the small tourist town of Plummerville. However, he soon finds himself in the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator, a shady sheriff, and a bloodthirsty crime boss.\n\nCast:\n\n* Bob Odenkirk\u00a0as Hutch Mansell\n* Connie Nielsen\u00a0as Becca Mansell\n* John Ortiz\u00a0as Henry\n* RZA\u00a0as Harry Mansell\n* Colin Hanks\u00a0as Abel\n* Christopher Lloyd\u00a0as David Mansell\n* Sharon Stone\u00a0as Lendina",
