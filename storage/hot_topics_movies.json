        "content": "For me, I\u2019d say Nicolas Cage. His filmography is extremely versatile, he has made some all time great classics, and he has made some really crappy films. He has made tons of action films, a bunch of horror films, thrillers, comedies, dramas etc. he has made huge blockbuster Hollywood films, and extremely low budget direct to video movies, and everything in between. Plus he has an extremely long catalogue and is still making a bunch of films to this day. There is something for everyone in Nicolas Cage\u2019s filmography!",
