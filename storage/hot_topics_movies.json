That scene where he prays to all religions lol\n\nAnd the soundtrack is amazing! \n\nDid anyone go watch it when it was rereleased last year. \n\nI think severely underrated. \n\nMy favorite scene will always be the prison warden getting all excited when he finds his treasure, and then going crazy when the bug eats his brain and he goes crazy and runs and crashes into the wall. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nI still remember my parents taking me as a kid to watch this movie in 1999.

The terrorists make a rule where they do a headcount of the kids and teachers every hour on the hour and for every kid missing they will execute 5 others.  So Sean Astin character sneaks out to hand US Army people intel of all the terrorists but is delayed getting back.  And here is the stupid part... To try and fake out the headcount to make it seem like everyone is there, one of the more prominent characters tries to get his head counted twice by sneaking up the line.  The guy that tries to do it = the biggest blackest kid in school made up of mostly white kids and like maybe 2 other black kids that are quite small AND don't wear glasses!!!  If you are trying to fake out the terrorists like this... don't choose the one guy that stands out a lot and will be easily remembered.\n\nWhat stupid things have you seen in a movie?  Scenes or moves by characters that make you genuinely scratch your head....  And I don't wanna read any comment about running away from a T-Rex in high heels!",

Damn that movie fucks hard, the quick edits, the comedic timing, and Peter Weller giving his best makes it all just work.\n\nIt's a little dated but man Robocop is amazing. I think the director is amazing. Everyone is trying their best and \"bitches leave\" being the only line everyone remembers is crazy. Just so many good scenes in that movie, I felt tears coming up when he's in his house remembering his family. I wish we had a good remake directed by Villenvue.",

If you\u2019re interested at all in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s process I have an interview with him on my page as well. There was so much I wanted to talk about in this film but I decided to keep it to how Denis uses body position, its relationship to the camera and how it\u2019s used to bring out Louise\u2019s journey. \n\nHope you dig it!",
