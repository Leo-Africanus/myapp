Any examples would be appreciated as I find I will automatically dismiss a film based on a rating rather than actually watching it and making up my own mind in fear of wasting time watching it.

I've tried to rationalize it over the years, thinking Kilmer's shutout from Oscar consideration must've been the result of some funky AMPAS politics, because it sure as hell wasn't due to a lack of artistry or execution on his part.\n\nSome will argue that the field of Best Supporting Actor nominees was exceptional that year (Tommy Lee Jones won for The Fugitive),but Val's \"Doc\" stood toe to toe with the best of them, and he was deprived of a nomination altogether.\n\nThere's something about how he delivered the quietly violent \"Doc\" persona with charm, humor, and swag. I guess sometimes a great performance doesn't need a statuette attached to it to stand the test of time. ",

        "content": "Having just recently watched Avatar: Fire and Ash, the depiction of Eywa gave me intense chills and I REALLY want to see more things like that. More depictions of unfathomably immense entities. Beings that are just insanely massive.\n\nMassive Kaijus work, but the closer they look to people the more goosies it gives me lmao.\n\nNot so much old Godzilla flicks, though, 'cause the \"forced-perspective-dude-in-a-rubber-suit\" thing does nothing for me.\n\nIt feels like I have Megalophobia, but like in a good way. It doesn't scare me, it thrills me and I want more of it.\n\nIt's hard to really put into words what I'm specifically looking for, what's gonna scratch that itch. I just know it when I see it.\n\nLike at the end of Cabin in the Woods, when the Ancient One's hand juts out from the ground and it's enormous. Like that, but MORE! I wish there was more than just a had there.\n\nUgh. I wish I knew a better way to describe what I want here. Hopefully I'm making enough sense that some of y'all can recommend some stuff like that.\n\nAlso I know this is the movies subreddit, and that's mostly what I'm looking for, but if anybody has any video games or comics that do this thing well too, or even really detailed prose in a novel, I'd love that as well. (The God of War games do this kinda thing REALLY well. Particularly GOW3)\n\nThanks in advance to anybody that's able to decipher what I specifically am looking for lmao",

        "content": "My wife and I came from a sneak preview IMAX showing yesterday and basically said \u201cwe get it now\u201d. We both thought this was the closest that we will come to seeing \u201cThe King\u201d like we bought a ticket to a show.\n\nMost of us know of Elvis through clips on social media and the music that\u2019s endlessly played, we've never been fortunate enough to really view just how much of a showman he was.\n\nIn this doc, Baz is really working at his fullest strengths and using compiled footage, most of it never being seen before, of Elvis\u2019s style/flair to come off as a \u201cforce\u201d on the screen. He is magnetic when he is gyrating and losing himself to the music.\n\nElvis was a really special musician, and this doc really shows off why that was.\n\nI believe a wide release is scheduled for this week alongside Scream 7. If you even like some of Elvis\u2019s stuff, you should see this movie if you have nothing to do. And see if it\u2019s possible to see it on the biggest and loudest screen in your local area.",

I can honestly say it is one of the best movies, I have ever watched. It captivates the working class of 1960s England so well. I genuinely couldn\u2019t get my eyes off of the screen, especially at the end. From the moment he befriends Kes to all way to the end. \n\nSorry, I don\u2019t know how to describe the film without spoiling too much.  ",

        "content": "&gt;Donghwa is a fledgling poet in his thirties. He rejects material aspirations and seeks to lead a life dedicated to truth and beauty. On a lazy afternoon, he drives his girlfriend, Junhee, back to her parents\u2019 home outside Seoul. In the driveway, they run into her father, who is strangely interested in Donghwa\u2019s dinged up old car. He takes it for a spin around the block, then invites Donghwa to stay and meet the family: him, his wife, who also writes poetry, and Junhee\u2019s reclusive sister, who practices the gayageum, a traditional string instrument. They end up wiling away the day together, visiting a temple by the river, climbing the hill near the house, watching the sunset, and, sure enough, imbibing drinks. Egged on by Junhee\u2019s dad, Donghwa gets progressively more drunk as the day advances. Finally, he makes a fool of himself at dinner. Then everything begins to unravel for the poet: his relationship, his art, his revolutionary ideals.",
