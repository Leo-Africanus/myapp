Like its predecessor, it's delightfully silly, but now we're in an era where those movies aren't made as often... and when someone tries, it's a 50/50 chance they land it. *Happy Gilmore 2* is a solid return to the kind of film that, honestly, there should be more of. Some jokes run too long, don\u2019t land, or could use another draft. It's a constant stream of cameos, which is overall fun but sometimes a little distracting. But, at its core, the sequel is a good-natured charmer about a troubled everyman who is trying hard to grow up without losing himself in the process, and it gives us a lot to laugh about on the way. What more can you ask for?\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/review-adam-sandlers-happy-gilmore-2-may-be-worst-sequel-of-all-time/)\n\n&gt;With all due respect to *Grown Ups 2*, *The Ridiculous 6*, and *Sandy Wexler*, *Happy Gilmore 2* is the bottom of the Sandler barrel\u2014a grim disaster that not only sullies the good name of its ancestor, but so badly flails on its own limited terms that it suggests the A-lister should concentrate on dramatic parts and leave the immature comedy to others.",

He then sticks his tallywhacker through the hole, teasing the girls with it, which they all laugh. Enter MS BALBREAKER. She sees the tallwhacker sticking out into the room. She starts to move towards it, unbeknownst to the boy himself. Soon as she approaches, she grabs onto it with both her hands, attempting to keep him there. \n\n\nThis scene, to this day, it's still one that cracks me up to no end. Interesting side note, the director of Porkys (a very hard R film from the early 80s) is also the director of A CHRISTMAS STORY. ",

So far, I think Home, or the Dwayne Johnson project are the most likely to get made next, but that I what I think based on what is said. I know he almost made Sinatra and the Jesus Project back-to-back but those plans were cancelled. I feel it is up in the air on what Scorsese will do.",

        "content": "*After moving to the countryside, a supernatural encounter starts to transform a couple's love, their lives, and their flesh.*\n\nDirector: Michael Shanks\n\nCast: Dave Franco, Alison Brie\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/together_2025/reviews) (55 reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [76/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/together-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Austin Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/28) \\- [Richard Whittaker](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/richard-whittaker)\n\n&gt;Could a non-married pair of actors have given these scenes such terrifying poignancy? Of course. And there\u2019s no guarantee that a married acting couple would have been able to translate the weight of intimacy to Millie and Tim. If anything, that offscreen chemistry rarely translates and just feels gimmicky. Brie and Franco is like watching Burton and Taylor or Newman and Woodward: as performers who know each other so well, they have synergy but also provide the space for them to reach out and pull back from each other. Their scenes together \u2013 which make up most of the film \u2013 pulsate and breathe. When those elaborate set-pieces start to add in some creatively grisly special effects, they merely clarify the visual component to the established subtext. When *Together* gets weird, it can do so because of how painfully relatable it is.\n\n[NPR](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2070) \\- [Aisha Harris](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aisha-harris) \n\n&gt;*Together* is a fun body horror-comedy about a couple (real-life husband-and-wife Dave Franco and Alison Brie) stuck in a rut but unwilling to do anything about it. When they move to the country, they stumble upon a cursed cave that forces all of their unspoken issues to the forefront in the most visceral and icky ways possible. Writer-director Michael Shanks' third act fumbles a bit in its predictability, but Brie and Franco lock into the offbeat humor of the film's premise, and the special effects are a marvel.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [Kate Erbland](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kate-erbland) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;And, oh boy, does Shanks \u2014 and his very game stars and producers \u2014 take those seemingly trite relationship observations to wild ends over the course of this delightfully unhinged spin on the body horror joint. While it\u2019s easy to poke holes in some of the logic Shanks\u2019 script seems to think is baked right in \u2014 without spoiling too much, we\u2019ve got *a lot* of questions about how much the wider community is clued into what\u2019s really happening\n\n [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;Shanks could stand to develop more finesse (and better writing) in the emotional drama. But even if he\u2019s killing time in his first feature before letting loose a heap of corporeal mayhem, *Together* marks him as a talent to watch. It\u2019s an ideal midnight date movie for the non-squeamish.\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fun (in a rather bumptious way), it stars two very good actors playing a couple who have as many issues as couples do in real life, and it works as a totally unhinged yet far from mindless thriller built around a Big Idea.",
