YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED (2024), the dog-friendly screening series and zine CANNES DOGS, underground one-day Vancouver film festival OFF-VIFF and the new FRENCH LESSONS (2025).\n\nAfter visiting one of LA's \"Valley\" neighborhoods for a period of time (and enjoying a joint or two), Anna and I began to feel the menacing reality of surveillance cameras not only surrounding us, but speaking to us and were compelled to make a short film about it called HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED.\n\nThe short played over two dozen festivals across the globe like Fantasia, Morbido, SXSW Sydney, but as we started to approach the digital release, we knew it was important to do something different than just simply throw the film up on Vimeo or YouTube. Instead, we've decided to create a never-ending surveillance loop where the film could live online in a new form: [hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nWatch HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED online as part of the ENDLESS LOOP today for free -\n\n[hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nTeaser Trailer\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1019440725](https://vimeo.com/1019440725)\n\nSynopsis: On a trip to Los Angeles to visit a new flame, Anna finds herself lost, stoned and alone\u2026 or is she?\n\nBack tomorrow Friday 5/16 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions!\n\n",

        "content": "Yesterday, I got to see The Call, a surprisingly engrossing thriller with Halle Berry as a 911 phone operator trying to save Abigail Breslin's kidnapped teen bimbo who's being held hostage by a crazed Ed Gein wannabe played by Michael Ecklund. \n\nSay what you will about Berry, she is a committed actress who gives it her all and I couldn't take my eyes away from her. But I was struck by how bad of an actress Abigail Breslin was. She no longer had that natural acting ability she had as a kid where she'd just disappear. As a grown girl/woman, she came off as wooden and whiny. And I've seen the same on some other movies she was on as an adult. It would explain why her fame dried up. Because child actors can cross over  if they can adapt. I mean, the Fanning sisters are doing well. \n\nAnother one is Corey Feldman. Went from being a big movie child star in the 80s to being a joke in the 90s and up, with the Cosplay Michael Jackson moonwalk and La Toya hair and his godawful singing. Dude has released Collectors Items of albums nobody bought. Maybe in Madagascar where Honesty did quite well.",

Shults changes aspect ratios and halfheartedly revives some 360-degree shots from *Waves*. Tesfaye grapples self-pityingly with his weaknesses. Keoghan natters. Everyone sheds elegant tears when recalling the vague traumas of their backstory. The movie is 105 minutes long and would feel stretched thin even if cut down to the cutscene bookends of a music video. It is a thing you can see, technically.\n\n[RogerEbert - Clint Worthington](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hurry-up-tomorrow-weeknd-jenna-ortega-movie-review-2025) \\- 0.5/5\n\n&gt;\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d takes its star\u2019s caterwauling about how *hard* it is to be famous and heartbroken for granted, and expects its audience to roll with every self-inflicted wound. It\u2019s vapid, meandering, and insistent on its own profundity as a tale of an artist reckoning with fame. If you\u2019re looking for a pop star prodding at his image, turn to the far superior \u201c[Better Man](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/better-man-robbie-williams-film-review)\u201c; at least Robbie Williams has a sense of humor about his personal foibles. The Weeknd expects you to clap when he weeps.\n\n[Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3848) \\- [Charles Koplinski ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/charles-koplinski)\\- 0/5\n\n&gt;You don\u2019t watch this film so much as try to survive it.\n\n[BloodyDisgusting - Meagan Navarro](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3868604/hurry-up-tomorrow-review-an-exhausting-psychological-exercise-in-vanity/) \\- 1.5/5\n\n&gt;What\u2019s meant more as a baptism by fire that could double as a metaphorical rebirth instead rings hollow. That Shults and Tesfaye opt for a more experimental, emotion-driven form of visual storytelling over conventional narrative further alienates. It all makes for an exhausting show of empty vanity.\n\n[Toronto Star - Alexander Mooney](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/the-weeknds-hurry-up-tomorrow-is-a-laughable-psychodrama-thats-not-only-bad-its-boring/article_953efb71-c023-4616-908a-e0cc601b9a16.html) \\- 0.5/4\n\n&gt;The film\u2019s circuitous narrative takes two agonizing hours to unveil its true colours, with desperate, borrowed abstractions striving to ennoble the flailing creative endeavours of the artist whose subconscious we\u2019re trapped in. \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is remarkable in its ceaseless and shameless capacity for failure, constantly finding new and innovative ways to fall flat on its face.\n\n[Globe &amp; Mail - Brad Wheeler](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-hurry-up-tomorrow-is-an-eye-acting-exhibition-and-moody-music-video/)\n\n&gt;In one way or another, Tesfaye has been telling this story of toxic relationships and inner unrest through the Weeknd his whole career. He has hinted that he would be putting the stage persona to rest. If this film is any indication, it needs to happen tomorrow.\n\n[We Live Entertainment](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2789) \\- [Aaron Neuwirth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aaron-neuwirth) \\- 'D'\n\n&gt;The intensity that should seemingly be shared by Tesfaye and Ortega doesn\u2019t quite emerge as effectively as needed. Instead, there seems to be some dark comedy on display, intentional or not, that undercuts the results.",

Like renting out a small private theatre, having snacks and drinks, popcorn etc. Maybe meeting once a month or so to watch a movie that is voted on by the group. (Thinking maybe provide the group with a few options to vote on each month to select one). Then we watch it together, and spend the after hours discussing anything we think of it. Sounds like a fun and cool concept to me, just curious if anyone else has done anything like this. ",
