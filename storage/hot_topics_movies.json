This it does not by trying to reinvent the wheel but, rather smartly, by addressing the elephant in the room, locating the action in a kitsch yet somehow timeless retro-future more befitting *The Jetsons* than *The Avengers*. It also benefits from a smart script and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this \u2014 really quite moving performances from its four charismatic leads, being arguably the best of Pedro Pascal\u2019s releases this year.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1236466922/) (80):\n\n&gt;True to its subtitle, the film feels like a fresh start. And like this summer\u2019s blockbuster \u201cSuperman\u201d reboot over at DC, that could be just what it takes to win back audiences suffering from superhero exhaustion.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/) (80):\n\n&gt;With an exemplary cast and shiny new alt-universe to enjoy, this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar\u2019s too low for you, then it\u2019s also the best Marvel movie in years.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/) (90):\n\n&gt;The Fantastic Four: First Steps is set in a world that I wouldn't mind living in. Even if there are occasional, ineffable cosmic deities plotting to devour me, and terrifying silver aliens ripping my soul apart with their eyes. \"First Steps\" is a superhero movie where we're already better. And I love that.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/07/22/fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-movie-review/85302239007/) (75):\n\n&gt;After two mediocre 2000s film featuring Marvel\u2019s legendary superhero family, and an atrocious third outing in 2015, the foursome makes its Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in a combo sci-fi/disaster flick full of retrofuturistic 1960s flavor.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-leads-team-back-retro-future-11776476) (75):\n\n&gt;From its Saul Bass-inspired opening credits to its callbacks to Saturday morning superhero cartoons, it practically vibrates with its sense of time and place.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-ebon-moss-bachrach-joseph-quinn) (70):\n\n&gt;These First Steps might not be the great strides I was hoping for, but they are sure footing for the Fantastic Four to officially leap into the MCU.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/fantastic-four-first-steps-review-b2793808.html) (60):\n\n&gt;In fact, all the ingredients are perfectly lined up here, and, in the right combinations, and with the pure wonderment of Michael Giacchino\u2019s score, The Fantastic Four: First Steps does shimmer with a kind of wide-eyed idealism. And that\u2019s lovely.\n\nDirected by Matt Shakman:\n\n&gt;On the 1960s-inspired retro-futuristic alternate universe known as Earth-828. the Fantastic Four must protect their world from the planet-devouring cosmic being Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer.\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic\n* Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman\n* Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm / The Thing\n* Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm / Human Torch\n* Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal / Silver Surfer\n* Paul Walter Hauser as Harvey Elder / Mole Man\n* Ralph Ineson as Galactus",

I think the irony of this movie was that the main character never once shot a bullet (that could kill) the entire time! He was able to disarm, capture, and defend without ever using a firearm and THAT is such an ironic twist that I absolutely loved. It was clearly a movie about political reform and corruption within the policing system and it was done in a way that wasn\u2019t a cliche. It was too long for me to want to rewatch it anytime soon but I would easily watch it just to dissect the movie. I give it a 8.5/10 but the premise of the story and the actors who played in this movie were phenomenal. I can see why it\u2019s Emmy nominated.",

It's like a spiritual successor to the show.\n\n\nI also love how this is sort of a satirization of John Wick. Instead of someone breaking into Keanu's home and killing his dog, someone &gt;!breaks into Peele's house and abducts his cat Keanu!&lt; lmao.\n\n\n\nI would also like to shout out Luis Guzm\u00e1n for being hilarious in this despite his very brief appearance.",

That guy walked, talked, and breathed a Yank as Dickie Greenleaf.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.\n\nOne reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform\ntheir American counterparts attempting British accents. I\u2019d go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.\n\nThe one exception is Forest Whitaker in \u2018The Crying Game\u2019.

        "content": "I was living there when it was being filmed, and we all wondered how the town would be depicted. Would it play on tired clich\u00e9s of run-down New Mexico? Would it look like trash?\n\nI\u2019m here to say that the town is \u2014 geographically and physically \u2014 almost exactly as it is depicted! The population is a little smaller than implied, and obviously there are no shootouts in the streets. But other than that, you could go to Truth or Consequences and retrace most of the scenes step-by-step. Our Bullocks grocery store, the side streets with arched doorways, the Geronimo museum with the statue of Geronimo. Garcia\u2019s Bar is even there (though it\u2019s not open). The only thing he left out was all our hot springs spas (the name used to be \u201cHot Springs, NM\u201d). And the sheriff\u2019s house was filmed in Santa Fe, judging by the trees. \n\nAri Aster is himself a New Mexican, and he showed respect to our dusty little town by not dressing it up, and not running it down. No imaginary geography, just a few out-of-place residences, but otherwise it\u2019s T or C. I appreciated that. ",

        "title": "Despite the topic being as relevant as ever, Bowling for Columbine (2002) has aged very poorly as a Documentary",
        "content": "I remember watching this in school when it was relatively new and being blown away by it. Really shook at how it presents the state of the world.\n\nI decided to go back and watch it and.... hoo boy. It has not aged well.\n\nI guess as an aughts piece of subversive media it has entertainment value - I certainly see a lot of his techniques still used today, especially in Youtube Video Essays. But as a documentary its hard to get past how shoddily it's put together.\n\nTo start with, BfC is extremely anecdotal at points when it wants to be. For example, to disprove that violent films cause violence, he asks the same 3 Canadian teens he's been talking to the whole film if they like violent films and they say yes. When one street interviewee says they think America has higher gun crime because it has a higher Black population, Moore seriously retorts \"That's weird, cause I saw Black people when I was in Canada!\" To be clear, what's particularly annoying is that I agree with the core message, but he \"answers\" these questions is the poorest way imaginable. For horror movies, logic would say just show that they perform as well in the Canadian Box Office as America. The Black population one is trickier, as (especially at the time) they did have a significantly lower Black population per captia. But that makes it more important to disprove the link between race and violence - would even make a good segues into the real issue of poverty and violence. Ah, but he \"solves\" that issue by going to one nice looking \"\"slum\"\" and saying \"Wow, Canada's slums are super nice, no poverty in Canada!\" I don't know what's more insulting, that he thinks we're that easily tricked, or that people seemingly were by this at the time.\n\nIt is aggravating the number of times Moore makes an argument, and then gives evidence in the form of asking some stranger on the street a question. \"Are there violent crimes in Canada? Let's ask this random halfcut woman I found at a bar.\" In 2025, voxpops have largely gone out of style. Rightfully criticised for being low quality, cherrypicked and anecdotal. They were more popular back when BfC was thrown together, but that doesn't make their heavy use any more forgivable.\n\nSpeaking of segues, that brings me to the next, bigger problem. For as bad as it is when Moore phones in his evidence, it's a whole lot worse when he is straight up disingenuous. There's a famous scene where Moore gets a gun from a bank to show how easy it is to attain one. The fact that he's getting a gun from a bank is such a wild thing, you'd think it stands up as it's own piece of ludicrousness. Instead, Moore chooses to really keep harping on the \"free\" part. \"I want an account with the free gun!\", \"When do I get my free gun?\", \"Well there you go, I got a free gun!\". He walks out triumphant, a testament to how easy it is to get a gun from a bank. Only, he never mentions that you only get the gun when you deposit $200. To be clear, I agree with the core point. Guns are/were too easy to get in America, but I wouldn't say dumping 200 for a shitty single action hunting rifle is good evidence of this (EDIT: I am informed the rifle is actually alright quality).\n\nBut given the choice between hard hitting facts and dressed up sensationalism, Moore always seems to choose the latter. The thesis of BfC is that there is no one single cause for America's gun violence (though it heavily, heavily suggests the News is the biggest culprit) - and part of that core argument is an odd section where Moore seemingly argues that ease of access ISN'T a problem. He goes to Canada and purchases a comically large number of shells from Wallmart. Wow! You can get armed so easily here, but where are the mass shootings? Well it's probably because Canada's news media is just so darn nice and polite! Everyone leaves their door unlocked here (in the middle of the day in nice neighbourhoods while their inside)! Even the Politicians are polite and calm!\n\nExcept that's obviously complete BS. He's able to buy a lot of bullets because bullets are not the issue. I'm  in the UK, where guns are largely completely banned - but I can get bullets just as easily (EDIT: To people questioning this, go to literally any Gun CLub in the UK). He very blatantly and clumsily skirts the elephant in the room - is it easy to get a GUN in Canada? I have no idea if it was at the time, because he completely neglects that pretty important question. And much has been said for him cherrypicking news segments to make the Canadian media seem \"nice\" when it could/can be just as sensationalist as it's American counterpart. This is so much worse than his \"Ummm ackstually, I saw a Black guy in Toronto\" because he's being deliberately duplicative. And AGAIN, it's frustrating because the News Cycle does have a LOT to answer for, but this is so not the way to highlight that.\n\nSpeaking of disingenuous, and honestly flat out cringe. I'd be remiss not to mention the infamous Diet South Park segment where he presents a bizarro, citationless version of history to explain why Americans have a gun culture. Wherein he states the NRA was founded by the KKK, that the colt pistol was made to stop Slaves rebelling, that slaves didn't want revenge or compensation for being slaves (complete with a drawing black man sniffing a posey, awhh), and that most gun crimes are committed by white suburbanites in gated communities. In other words, Moore tries to pin the entire gun culture on white people hating black people. I'm not one to say racism isn't an issue in America (or indeed, the world) but this is a bold ass claim to make - and not one sold in a convincing manner. I also find it bizarre that this little cartoon, and indeed the whole documentary, ignores the constitution - a pretty big elephant in the room in regards to why a gun culture exists. I have to imagine Moore either felt tackling that issue was either too complicated or controversial - either way, a poor job done exploring the topic. This segment in particular got Moore in hot water with Matt Stone, whom he interviewed. By putting it right after the interview, the implication is the South Park guys made it. Not only do you not want work you didn't make attributed to yourself, but one so strawman-y and full of errors.\n\nBut even his interview has issues, where Stone ponders that \"If only the Columbine kids realised that high school is over soon! They wouldn't be bullied anymore! Don't they know the weedy victims end up millionaires and the bullies end up working in MacDonalds!\" On its own a pretty trite concept that's only really true on TV, but whatever. The real issue is the idea that the Columbine kids were bullied into it. For all the documentaries efforts to disprove this and that as the cause, it seems happy enough to perpetuate the lie that school bullying was a major factor. It's well known now that, while people didn't like Eric and Dylan nor treat them nice, it was because they chose to be outcasts and mean to their peers. A bullied pair standing up to the jocks? Give me a break, THEY were the bullies.\n\nSpeaking of, Moore himself has also gotten criticism since the movie came out as being a bit of a distasteful figure, and there are definitely elements of that here. At times BfC seems less like a documentary and more like a diet version of Borat. There's an infuriating scene where Moore approaches an officer on duty monitoring a scene after a suspicious person with a gun was spotted. \"I want to report a crime! Look at all this pollution!\" Moore says to him, \"I can't see the Hollywood sign, who should you arrest for this?\" Obviously annoyed, the officer brushes him off and walks away. \"Wow, he's doesn't care about the real issues, what a dick right?\" BfC suggests. No, I just see Moore being a complete asshat to someone trying to do their job.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and yeah, this is part of a bizarre section where he and a lawyer argue that gun crime isn't even as big a deal as the news makes it out to be. What about pollution? What about welfare programs? They walk down an LA street to prove that things aren't as bad as its been made to seem. Of course, this is when the police turn up due to a gun report - and no, the irony of this happening on the street they were using to highlight how not-dangerous LA is is not addressed. While I think we can all agree that those are real issues too, looking back in 2025 and seeing him trying to claim \"Well shootings aren't really that bad an issue, not compared to pollution. Why isn't COPS about catching polluters or white collar criminals?\" is actually insane.\n\nIt's hard to make the Borat shtick work because you're always at danger of the audience flipping on you, of siding with the \"pranked\" civvy. Part of a way around this is comedians will either make themselves the butt of the joke and the civilians simply reacting to them (like Eric Andre), or to just let them talk and put their own foot in their mouth. Moore does neither. He is always the aggressor, and he always carefully edits to make himself seem like the epic troll who won that interaction. You can play a drinking game for whenever Moore does a little one liner to his interviewee and then hard cuts. Got em! Dunked on em! No need to see their reaction or rebuttal! I won, let's move on!\n\nAnd that's it in a nutshell really. **I agree with large parts of this documentary**, but that makes it all the more annoying with HOW it presents and tackles these issues. From poorly citated arguments, to misdirection, to straight up lying, to bad comedy - it's a mess. I wouldn't blame anyone for arguing that BfC hurts it's own stance from just how shoddily duct taped together it is. I'm sure a lot of people will argue or say \"Well for the time it was very impactful. For the time, it brought attention to this issue and got people talking about it. Things are worse now, if only people listened to him!\" My retort would probably be that Columbine itself was the impact. The tragedy itself got people talking about it. BfC rode that sensationalism in much the same way the News cycle it criticised did. It brings shockingly little to the table. If, like me, you remembered BfC this way, I would recommend rewatching it, I think, like me, you'll be shocked at how poorly its aged.",

Despite this, Iran is actually considered to be a very important place for film because of its unique style. Let's see what everyone thinks is the best!\n\nThe rules that you really should read before commenting:\n\nI) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Big Trouble in Little China was nominated under China....but that's..... set in San Francisco. So please make sure it is SET in the listed country. Mainstream American made movies are totally okay. A good example from China being Mulan. Yes that is English language and yes that is a Disney western movie. Movies like this are still helpful to add to the conversation because they bring light to other cultures to Americans that otherwise would not get interested in those other cultures. HOWEVER, let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. Also, if a movie is split between a few locations I\u2019m looking for where it\u2019s rooted.\n\nII) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.\n\nIII) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.\n\nIV) Nominate only one movie. I won't count any votes towards comments that mention 2 or more.\n\nV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. **Make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.**\n\nDay 10: Indonesia- The Raid (2011) directed by Gareth Evans\n\nDay 9: India- 3 Idiots (2009) directed by Rajkumar Hirani\n\nDay 8: Hong Kong- In the Mood for Love (2000) directed by Wong Kar-Wai\n\nDay 7: China (mainland)- Hero (2002) directed by Zhang Yimou\n\nDay 6: Cambodia- The Killing Fields (1984) directed by Roland Joffe\n\nDay 5: Brunei- Yasmine (2014) directed by Siti Kamaluddin\n\nDay 4: Bhutan - Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom (2019) directed by Pawo Choyning Dorji\n\nDay 3: Bangladesh- The Clay Bird (2002) directed by Tareque Masud\n\nDay 2: Bahrain- Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford\n\nDay 1: Afghanistan- Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak\n\nHere is a [letterboxd list](https://boxd.it/L1lwe) featuring each winner as we progress through the entire world.",

It\u2019s like they know the moments they shared were real and they were sharing once last hoo-rahh before it came to end.\n\nI wish I could better put it into perspective, but I just found that scene so special.",
