        "title": "Sunshine (2007), I cannot believe I put off watching it for so long.",
        "content": "Yesterday I watched Danny Boyle's Sunshine from 2007. This is a movie that \"I've been meaning to watch\" pretty much ever since it came out. I remember being in grade school and seeing the trailer and thinking \"that looks cool, I should watch it\", and then I never actually did. From time to time the movie would pop up somewhere and again I'd think to myself \"I should watch it\" and then I'd forget and years would go by again. Well yesterday was finally the day I sat down and watched the film and I was honestly blown away. I seriously did not expect it to be that good.\n\nFor starters I am a huge sci fi fan, and usually I tend to gravitate towards realistic, \"hard\" science fiction as much as possible. Think of the Martian, The Expanse, Gravity, Apollo 13, etc, stuff that tries to be as realistic as possible. That being said it's not like I don't understand the concept of creative license and I do believe that the story always takes precedence over technicalities and realism. \n\nSunshine is a bit weird in that regard because part of it is very grounded and realistic while other parts of it are pure fantasy. While a bit jarring at first while trying to figure out where the movie stands exactly on that regard, it was absolutely the right call for them to make. The story is gripping, engaging, and the feelings and emotions are masterfully conveyed to the viewer mainly visually rather than dialogue. Which leads me to my next point, the visual effects for this movie are incredible. It's hard to believe it came out in 2007 because it puts many modern movies to shame. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised because the late 2000s were a golden age in terms of VFX as the convergence of classic film making effects and CGI came together in the best way, with film makers using each to their strengths while using each other to cover their weaknesses. This is in contrast to today where there is often an over reliance on CGI. \n\nThis movie was made for only 40 million. That was a more hefty sum back then in terms of a movie budget but by today's standards that's low budget. And yet you would never call this movie \"cheap\". The set design is impeccable, the CGI is impeccable, the practical effects blend seamlessly with everything, and of course the story is the real star of the show, keeping you engaged and pulling you into the mind of the crew throughout. \n\nGo watch the film now.

        "title": "Movies that were only made so that the studio could keep the rights to an IP",
        "content": "Licensed movies have been a thing for over a century, studios or producers make a contract with the owner of an IP to make a movie based on their property. As time went on, things got more complicated, especially since movies based on established IPs became more valuable. Sometimes, a studio would get the rights to a movie, but then not actually make the movie by the time the rights would revert back to the owner according to the contract. As such, sometimes a studio would make a rushed movie it otherwise wouldn't want to make just so that they can keep the rights, either so that they can make a better and more profitable movie later, so that they can then renegotiate or sell the rights to someone else, or just out of spite because they don't want another studio to get the rights.\n\nOne of the most infamous cases of this is with the Fantastic Four, it happened to it twice. In the 90s, Constantin Films made a rushed Fantastic Four movie just so that they could keep the rights, but never had any real intention of promoting it or even releasing it, because the contract only said the movie had to get made, not that that it had to be released. Over 20 years later, Fox would similarly make a bad Fantastic Four movie solely so that they could keep the rights and prevent Disney/Marvel Studios from using the property. Not that it mattered since a few years later Disney would simply buy Fox.\n\nA much older case is The Hobbit. A producer had the film rights to Tolkien's work, but couldn't get a proper movie made in time before the contract expired. As such, they made 12-minute \"animated\" film (actually just picture book drawings with minimal movement and narration) based on The Hobbit and showed it once in a small theatre in Manhattan, thus preserving the rights. Tolkien would have to pay him 100,000 dollars to get the rights back. It has to be [seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnVL1Y2src) to be believed.\n\nAnd then there's Dick Tracy. Ever since the 1990 film, Warren Beatty has kept the film rights to Dick Tracy. Every few years, he releases a short \"film\" or TV special that's basically just him dressed up as Dick Tracy talking in order to meet the minimum requirements to keeping the rights to the IP. He just doesn't want anyone else to have the rights as long as he lives it seems.\n\nSo what other movies were made solely so that someone could keep the rights to an IP longer?",
