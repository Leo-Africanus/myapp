Compared to those kinds of turns, Elordi\u2019s role didn\u2019t strike me as particularly demanding or transformative, nor did it feel like something only he could have pulled off.\n\nTo me, it felt like a well-executed performance that a number of capable actors could have delivered at a similar level. That\u2019s where I struggle to see the case for an Oscar nomination, where the bar is (or should be) set much higher than competence.\n\nCurious to hear what others think? What specifically about his performance stood out to you as awards-worthy?",

Every conversation that happened on screen was so damn captivating. I was completely immersed. Not a single line was wasted. The soundtrack was amazing the entire way through. The narration was perfect. The acting was top-notch, but the overall message of the film, and the style in which it was told is something I haven\u2019t seen or experienced in a very long time. The best comparison I can make, and one I thought of multiple times during my initial watch (there will be many more) was \u201cBig Fish\u201d a fantastic movie in its own rite. Definitely in my top ten. I think I might like this one better. Never before have I been so moved by a picture. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s heartbreaking but it\u2019s also wholesome and inspirational. I honestly just sat there, jaw wide open, mesmerized by what I was seeing. I\u2019m snowed in on a bitterly cold Saturday afternoon with nothing else to do and chose this movie on a whim. No trailer, no snippet, no recommendation, I didn\u2019t even know this movie existed until a couple of hours ago and know now for a fact that it\u2019s one I will never forget. This might be my new favorite movie!",

        "content": "The rating in IMDb is 5.8/10.\n\nViewer rating is a bit extreme on both sides.\n\nHalf is \u201cjust watch with low expectations and don\u2019t question anything, then it is a very enjoyable movie to watch - same level as Armageddon, and better than most Transfomer movies\u201d\n\nThe other half is \u201cdon\u2019t waste your time, what a horrible movie that doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d\n\nAnyway, I always have this guilty pleasure of disaster/fight the monsters and save the world types of movie.  I love Pacific Rim 1 (I know it mainly it\u2019s because it has Guillermo del Toro as the director), however 2012 is below my limit.\n\nBattleship is \u2026 non stop action.  Hence it doesn\u2019t give you much time to question the plot.  The alien is not super powerful, which kind of a fresh air (?).  In fact, the alien is not really the bad guy.  At least they have no intention to kill living beings, if they don\u2019t have intention to kill first.\n\nCast is \u2026 ok.  Nice to see Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, who I had no idea who he was in my last watch (at least 7 years ago).  I don\u2019t listen Rihanna\u2019s songs so her acting doesn\u2019t bother me.  And I do like they used real life veterans as actor / extra.\n\nIt was a not bad movie to kill time and shutdown my brain in a summer afternoon.\n\nThank you for reading my confession.",

        "content": "The novel is a US classic. It deserves a comparable movie adaptation.\n\nCharly (1968) was so disappointing though.\n\nThe 2000 TV movie was an improvement. Matthew Modine was a better Charlie. The ending was more impactful too. But it was still an old school network TV movie. It was one of those cases where the cast and crew did the best they can within the limits of what they had.\n\nThe novel is near timeless because you can easily imagine the story is taking place in the modern day. Only a few tidbits here and there gives away its 1960s setting.\n\nWhat a new movie needs is a voice over narration from Charlie. The novel wouldn't be as acclaimed as it is if not for his unique first person POV. That the previous movies neglected this is baffling.\n\nEDITED to add that they can also *sparingly* show his written words on the bottom of the screen as he is narrating. Similar to captions or subtitles. Or a shot over his hand as he is writing. Certainly not throughout the entire movie but at key points to show his improvement and regression.",

It\u2019s great for selling A24 vibes to the millennial &amp; gen-z audience they've captured, but it really undersells their best flicks when those movies need specific messaging\u2014why this story matters, why it\u2019s different, why you should show up\u2014beyond just being an A24 movie.",

Its depiction of Hell. Ive never known a visual comparison more apt in its time. \nThe writing, still, holds up. There are holes in continuity.  Sure. But its a film about death. Do those rules even apply?\nProve me wrong.",

I dont know, It resonate with me.. that situation where you dont want to be a burden to anyone,  he let a muffled shout in a pillow so that no one would hear it.\n\nso yes, looking for a movie like that, here are other inpo movies I've watched\n\nBoston  \nWarrior  \nMancher by the Sea  \nThe hunt (Jagten)  \nI'm thinking of ending things\n\nplease suggest any sad movie to watch over the weekend\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nthank you \ud83e\udee1",

        "content": "Just came back from seeing this in a theater.\n\nThe cast is incredible. I just kept being surprised... it's them... oh it's her. Oh it's him. So funny. I knew who some of the leads were gonna be but they just kept coming...  Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn to even small roles like Billy Zane, John Corbett, Thomas Hayden Church\u2026 on and on.\n\nIt looked beautiful on a big screen. George Cosmatos was a solid, no-frills director, but this looked like a painting. The cinematographer also did Rosemary's Baby and Bullitt.\n\n**(edit... since I wrote this I've learned the first director, Jarre the screenwriter, was fired for being slow... Cosmatos came in and finished it on a technical end but some think he quit too he didn't. Kurt Russell took a leadership role and helped steer the story by the end... others claim it was Kurt and a group effort... either way it was a troubled production)**\n\nThe story was based on real events, but there were some threads that seemed messy. Didn\u2019t matter though... everything else made up for it.\n\nKurt Russell... what can you say?\n\nAnd Val Kilmer\u2026 holy crap. I found his death scene more moving than it probably was meant to be, since he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s incredible in this.",
