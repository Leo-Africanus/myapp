        "content": "I had this movie on the back burner for literal years. Heard a little about why people weren\u2019t so hot on it when it released, understood why. I had zero expectations really besides the trailer and knew it wasn\u2019t some space faring action movie. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t even love the plot but I think it was the world really. It\u2019s one of the few movies that made you really feel how exhausting and long space travel could be. It really felt like I went on a journey with the protagonist. It felt absolutely grande from the opening on the space antenna, to the launches and vistas arriving on different planets. \n\nI loved how we watch Roy take his journey starting on a commercial flight, to the more treacherous journey to Mars and eventually beyond. By the time we got to Neptune I really felt like we were billions of miles away from where we started on Earth. It felt mysterious every step of the way. \n\nBy no means was this movie perfect but it left me wanting more. Despite plot holes or characters not having enough dialogue it felt so realistic. It really felt like this could be what a future in space looked like. I loved all the little details and things that just made me think like how the one character he met on mars was born there! How insane is that?! The whole time I kept thinking of the logistics of getting everything to these planets as well, it must have been a huge effort. \n\nThe action and suspense I thought was sprinkled in very well. The strange space pistols, pirates, the way how there was minimal sound when explosions and bullets are flying on the moon. The incident on the Cepheus too, so brutal how that one woman died during take off. \n\nSo much of it was so raw and intense. I think the minimal and somewhat flat dialogue actually made it feel more real. The research baboon was such a shock to me too. I loved that idea and it was horrifying. I feel like you could tell a million stories in this universe without things getting too alien or paranormal. I was honestly expecting aliens in the end, but I think not getting them was the right choice but I still would have loved to see how this movie portrayed it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is that makes me love this movie so much, it\u2019s only grown on me since I\u2019ve seen it. I think it\u2019s an amazing example of how a movies world building and aesthetics can truly draw you in and give you something besides the story to lean on. \n\nFor me this movie was the definition of \u201cit\u2019s about the journey not the destination\u201d there\u2019s been recently. I\u2019d loved to hear others thoughts, I know this movie was mildly received but it\u2019s not often we get something unique like this imo. ",

        "content": "I rewatched The Other Guys for the first time since it came out, and I liked it way better than the first time I saw it. In 2010 I was kind of Will Ferrell'd out after being a big fan in the Anchorman era. \"Aim for the bushes\" is an all-timer, Michael Keaton kills it, and I had a blast whenever Ray Stevenson was on screen (RIP). However, the biggest impact for me was the end credits. \n\nSince the main plot point revolves around financial fraud, the credits are a series of infographics displaying the basics about Ponzi schemes, government bailouts, and CEO compensation contrasted to worker salaries. These numbers have only ballooned further in the last decade and a half, as have the societal frustrations. It was a really clear and effective way to get a message about class inequality across at the end of a great action comedy.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't seen it or doesn't remember much about it, it's definitely a solid watch, and it's under 2 hours, which is always appreciated.",

        "content": "I've watched quite a few movies just because they are often mentioned in this sub, as I respect all your opinions. \nMost of them were absolute hits (12 angry men and Edge of tomorrow, the unbearable weight of massive talent and Gattacato name a few), but I just now finished watching Pacific Rim and it did not click for me at all. \n\nIt's referenced here a lot as one of those perfect action movies, but I was a bit disappointed. Just not my thing I guess, which might not be so strange as I have no affiliation with the whole anime thing as well.\n\nThat's the risk for going in blind except for the comments in this sub and it's a risk I am very willing to take, as most of those films were absolutely brilliant. \nJust made me wonder what movies other people here watched because of this sub.",

        "content": "I just finished seeing this movie, I remember when it came out two years ago, but for some reason I didn't pay it much heed. I wish I went back to undo it. Oh this movie is incredible. As the title says, I was extremely satisfied with what I got. Culture, magic, myth, violance.\n\n\nAnd it has that usual Robert Eggers weirdness and silliness that everyone loves.\n\n\n\nWhat can I say about the story? A well played out revenge epic. I love how creepy the whole thing feels. Idk why but I felt like things kinda started getting wobbly near the third act. It wasn't bad enough to damper my enjoyment.\n\n\nI love the atmosphere of this movie, really creepy and pagan feeling. I love how the supernatural element is consistant through the movie but really lowkey and eerie. Always just crouched in the background.\n\n\nThe acting was great, the music was great, the cinematography was artistic af. I loved the shooting location, the long shot scenes are so good.\n\n\nThis was totally Shakespearean right? I realized the guy is called Hamlet and he meets three witches that tell him his fate.\n\n\nThe moment that cemented my opinion and the climax of the movie for me was definitely the &gt;!Valkyrie escape dream!&lt;. What an incredible visual.\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of things in this story reminded me of Berserk. The whole revenge plot, the savegry, the creepy magic, the protagonists journey etc.",

        "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is an apocalyptic film just as much as it is horror.",
        "content": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, aside from the obvious slasher/exploitation flick, a film about the decay of society and the breakdown of systems.\n\nListen to the radio news broadcasts: Grave-robbing, murder, cholera epidemic, city wide fires, suicide, building collapses, oil reserves burning, and heat waves with no end in sight.\n\nNotice how *nothing* goes right or according to plan.\n\nSally wants to check on a relatives grave, only to be led off by a stranger. Franklin cannot take a piss without getting hurt. They pick up a hitchhiker, he\u2019s bad news. They want to go see the old family house, it\u2019s condemned. They want to go swimming, the swim hole dried up. They want gas, there isn\u2019t any. Franklin and Sally want to drive away, the keys are gone because Jerry took them. The Sawyers need food, it\u2019s scarce so they resort to cannibalism. The Sawyers dinner doesn\u2019t go over well, etc.\n\nSystems are breaking down. \n\nThe authorities are incompetent, linking the grave robbing to an organized crime ring on the west coast - according to the radio broadcasts.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest most important system which is shown breaking down, the family unit.\n\nThe Hardesty\u2019s are a dysfunctional family. Sally is annoyed with and burdened by her invalid brother. \n\nMirroring that dysfunction is the Sawyer family. Composed of three brothers and a centarian grandfather. Wrought with abuse, mental illness, and poverty.\n\nNo semblance of a nuclear family. \n\nYou see, art is, always has been, and always will be reflective of the times it was produced in. TCM was created at the height of Vietnam, the first energy crisis, Watergate recently happened so distrust in authority was at an all time high, and the youth of the 60\u2019s witnessed their decade end with the Manson Murders. Which terrified a nation and arguably robbed a generation of its innocence way too early.\n\nThe fears of a terrified nation, the sense of doom and hopelessness, bleeds through this film.\n\nIt\u2019s arguably the quintessential apocalyptic film.",
