The concept just seems to cute for me. Not into fairy-story levels of fantasy. \n\nOk dammit; also Mank because I just looked him up and I\u2019ve missed that one.

        "content": "The TLDR of the movie is that Al Pacino is a failing director who creates a new digital actress, Simone. Everyone thinks she's real, and she wins Academy Awards for her performances. Pacino spends the bulk of the movie covering up the fact that she's not real.\n\n  \nAt the time of its release it was given so-so reviews, mostly due to how \"unbelievable\" it was with the technology of 2002. Rewatching it in 2025, it feels like something that could actually happen any day now (or maybe is already happening).\n\nWiki on the movie: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone\\_(2002\\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_(2002_film))",

I am looking forward to watching more good movies, especially from the crime drama genre. I am a huge fan of the Narcos series. I have also watched a movie called 'Curse of Tunnel 5', which was another good movie I watched this month, and it was either Indonesian or Taiwanese.",
