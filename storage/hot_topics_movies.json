He clearly struggles with who was and who is now and genuinely feels uncomfortable being a killer.  But after being triggered by his friend Ned is killed by Little Bill and hung onside the saloon. \n\nWas anybody else this impacted by this movie?

        "content": "I thought this movie will be simple serial killer stuff. Rich guy, secret life, cops chasing him, done. But nah\u2026 it slowly messes with your head.\nBrooks doesn\u2019t act crazy. That\u2019s the scary part. He\u2019s calm, polite, family man. Then he kills like it\u2019s just another task. No emotion. The voice in his head keeps talking, pushing him, judging him. Feels like his real self arguing with him all the time.\n\nThe movie is slow but heavy. Not boring slow, just uncomfortable slow. Like you\u2019re sitting inside his mind and can\u2019t leave.\n\n\nThe daughter part really hit me. When FBI questions her and Brooks starts crying\u2026 that scene felt real. He\u2019s not scared of police. He\u2019s scared because he thinks he ruined his kid. Like \u201cI\u2019m sick\u2026 and now maybe she is too because of me.\u201d\nEnding is dark as hell. \n\nNo happy ending. No cure. He kills that inner voice, not to become good, but because he accepts who he is. And that last feeling with the daughter\u2026 it\u2019s quiet but disturbing. Makes you think the cycle won\u2019t stop... ",
