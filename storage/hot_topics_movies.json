The Long Walk hits theaters on September 12. Ask me anything about the book or movie. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8)\n\n&gt;In a dystopian United States ruled by a totalitarian regime, a group of young men enter an annual walking contest in which they must maintain a speed of at least three miles per hour or risk execution. The contest ends when only one walker remains alive.\n\nIt stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Ben Wang, Charlie Plummer, Roman Griffin Davis, Garrett Wareing, Joshua Odjick, Tut Nyuot, Mark Hamill, Judy Greer, and Josh Hamilton. \n\nI'll be back on Wednesday 8/27 at 12:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\n",

I know there was a novel, but Jesus, how did he channel this character and his destruction so perfectly. \n\nWas watching videos of Tarantino talking about this movie and his love and respect for it. Watched this scene with fresh eyes and it just reminds me of the few but deranged narcissists I've had in my life. \n\nPerfect scene of a narcissist in full abuse mode.\n\nAlso, the end of that scene where Daniel is fatherly, and they have a close relationship is what makes a relationship with a malignant narcissist so painful. \n\nThere were good times. There were great times. But the narcissists are programmed to discard, and those in their wrath and path are made to feel like actual garbage that can be thrown away. \n\nIts confusing. Lewis just nails it",

Keeping all dialogues and sound effects intact, but the background tracks and themes are all completely stripped down to silence. \n\nMy pick would be cinema paradiso, so much of the movies' emotions and hardest hitting moments was super elevated by morricone's all time score. Personally I think the movie would just be good without the score, but its an extremely emotional movie with that amazing score ",

The whole concept of the movie is incredible and feels more relevant now than it did back then.\n\nBut it's that final moment that always hits me. He doesn't have a big angry speech. He just smiles and says \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" and then takes a bow and leaves.\n\nThere's just something so hopeful and terrifying and brilliant about it. It\u2019s one of those scenes that\u2019s just permanently burned into my brain.\n\nWhat are some other movie endings or single scenes that have that effect on you? The kind that you think about for days after you watch it.",
