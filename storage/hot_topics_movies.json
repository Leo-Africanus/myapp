No, but if you've been hurting for a 90s-style comedy that doesn't ask too much of the viewer but gives plenty of laughs in return, I cannot recommend *Let's Start a Cult* highly enough.\n\nI went into it blind and, having now watched the trailer in consideration of linking it in this post, I would suggest doing the same for maximum good-times effect.

He has been sober for many years and wrote the screenplay based on some of his own experiences as a heroin addict. \n\nIt is a really beautiful film, sad but also quite hopeful which in itself feels like a rarity in films about drug addiction.  It is also surprisingly romantic, but without glamorizing their lifestyle.  It reminded me a little of Smashed, the movie about an alcoholic couple starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul.\n\nI am surprised I had never heard of the film considering Dastmalchian has been in everything recently.  Found it on Tubi, very worth a watch if you like indie slice of life type films.\n\n",

I can see why it was so groundbreaking.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why Roy suddenly decided to spare Deckard's life.\n\nI know Roy's death is imminent, but why would that cause him to have any less vengeance? Deckard hunted and killed the people closest to him. He had no problem killing Sebastian, who actually went out of his way to help them. So why?\n\nRoy's final monologue seemed to imply that Roy as a replicant has just as much humanity as a human. Yet moments earlier he was cackling maniacally and happily toying with his prey. If there had been any indication of his humanity earlier in the film, his change of heart would make more sense to me. If his motivations against Deckard had been fueled more by a sense of justice for his fellow replicants, rather than his own survival, maybe I would buy it. But to me, it felt purposefully like classic \"final villain fight\" material, and the mercy decision came out of nowhere for me.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Or am I overthinking it?",

Let\u2019s go back to the late 90s when studios were hoping to find the next Jurassic Park in Michael Crichton\u2019s ready to adapt novels (complete with Sam Jackson). \n\nSphere begins with an excellent premise, the U.S. military finds a crashed spaceship on the bottom of the ocean. They can tell from vegetation growth that it has been there for 300ish years. They assembled a team of experts to descend and investigate. The team enters the ship only to realize it is actually from earth in the future and accidentally traveled back in time after encountering a black hole. There is also a mysterious object aboard the ship that appears to be alien in origin. In my opinion, this is a 10/10 premise for a movie. The cast is also excellent and mostly wasted on the material they are given to work with. \n\nUnfortunately, the promise of this setup is not effectively delivered. The movie struggles to make  use of the plot elements until it finishes in what I consider to be a very silly way. Should this movie be remade, with more of a creeping horror third act like Sunshine? How else could this premise be remade into a successful film?",

        "content": "I rewtached this film tonight, and what can I said thay hasn't already been said.\n\nThis movie is a cult classic of childhood, and one of my favorite sci-fi movies of all time, and probably one of my favorite movies of all time in general, and a great example of a multi-genre film. The world they create here is genuinely visually creative, and wouldn't be surprised if it ended inspiring the look of the Star Wars prequels.\n\nThe Pacing is top notch, and fitting for a film with such a simple and straight forward save the world story, and saving said world with five elements no less (one of them being the element of love). Not to mention the practical effects and practical filmmaking are greatly admired, especially the designs of the costumes and aliens. Of course, the acting is solid. Especially from Gary Oldman, Mila Jovoich, and Chris Tucker. Bruce Willis is great in this movie as well.\n\nOverall, this movie is a cult classic for a reason. Also, Chris Tucker is the best part of the movie.",

        "title": "The Devil's Rejects (Why am I rooting for the bad guys?)",
        "content": "This story follows main characters who are definitely bad people. They are the worst imaginable kind of people. At points, it\u2019s hard to even want to call them people. But\u2026when I watch this movie, I find myself rooting for the Firefly family, who, again, are terrible terrible people.\n\nHow does this film do that? I\u2019d like to think I don\u2019t relate to them at all. In the opening, we see one member dragging a naked dead body though the forest, and another sleeping next to a dead body, where we assume (probably correctly) that that person was raped and tortured. They go through a battle with the cops, and when Baby and Otis make their escape, they run past dozens of people in cages that I only assume were next in line to be raped and tortured. But don\u2019t the Fireflys look cool in their armor? They remind me of Iron Man. So cool.\n\nWhen Mama gets captured, she, without hesitation, puts a gun to her head and pulls the trigger. No bullets. But she didn\u2019t know that, and due to this, we understand that this family will never give up their ways.\n\nWhile on the run, Baby and Otis will also continue to be their true selves. They murder an innocent woman to get a car, and instead of just getting a room to hide out in at a motel, they decide it would be the right opportunity to bring evil into the lives of an innocent family. The perform mental torture, murder, and sexual molestation, all just to pass the time. Baby and Otis have a great time doing it too. Sheri Moon Zombie\u2019s acting choices are great in the motel scenes. The way she is constantly pushing and blowing on the women, all while laughing and smiling the whole time, brings a touch of brilliance to the way she portrays a seriously fucked up woman.\n\nThe last member of this terrible family is Captain Spaulding, portrayed by Sid Haig in what I believe to be his best role. His character\u2019s introduction is an all timer. We cut to him after the shariff refers to him as \u201cCaptain Fucking Spaulding\u201d and he is having sex in a disgusting dirty room. He is also disgusting; it\u2019s not just the room. And then the woman he is with pulls out a gun and shoots him in the face. It turns out it was just a dream. When he is asked if he was having a bad dream, we get a great answer: \u201c50/50\u201d.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it feels to me that Captain Spaulding isn\u2019t as bad as the rest of the family. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he is also a terrible human, but he has a little more going on for him than just a desire to hurt people. We see this with his television commercial for his fried chicken and roadside sideshow business. Also, when he needs a car, he doesn\u2019t go straight into killing someone for it. He\u2019s a little more polite than Baby and Otis. He at least tries to ask for one, you know, for \u201ctop secret clown business\u201d. But he still doesn\u2019t kill for it. Yeah, he punches a woman very hard in the face and then mentally fucks up a little boy for the rest of his life. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter boy? Don\u2019t you like clowns?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure this boy will never ever like clowns, but at least he didn\u2019t die.\n\nSo, as I\u2019m thinking more about it, I still don\u2019t know the answer to my prior question, \u201cWhy am I rooting for the Firefly family?\u201d In exploring some examples of their actions, I believe that I think even less of them now. What helps in making it feel better to root for them though, is the sheriff. Sheriff Wydell, portrayed brilliantly by William Forsythe, is, in a sense, the \u201cgood-guy\u201d of the story. But when we meet him, he is very quick to just open fire on a house, calling it \u201cgod\u2019s work\u201d, and using phrases like \u201cAlabama ass-kicking\u201d. When he gets on the news, he doesn\u2019t talk in terms of bringing the Fireflys to legal justice, he tells them he will bring \u201cthe wrath of the lord up your ass.\u201d He speaks of killing the Fireflys, not about arresting them. He consistently speaks with a dark, low, serious tone. There is zero fun about this person. I have a memory of watching this film at home, and my grandma was watching with me. When Wydell came on the screen, my grandma would say, \u201cI don\u2019t like him; I hope they get him.\u201d Like, whoa Grandma, you do realize what the Fireflys are up to, right? But it shows how the great writing and amazing acting goes a long way into how we feel about the characters of the movie.\n\nThe ending of \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rejects\u201d might just be the best ending ever. But what is funny about it, is that if it didn\u2019t exist, and the movie ended with the prior scene of Baby, Otis, and Spaulding driving off into the night, it would have worked. However, there is no way I\u2019d rather not have the ending that we got. So yeah, they don\u2019t get away with it. They die in the end, (Don\u2019t bring up \u201c3 from Hell\u201d) and never change their ways. They tourture, rape, and murder people, but at least they don\u2019t fuck chickens. I can\u2019t hear Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cFree Bird\u201d and not think about this ending. This whole time, I\u2019ve been rooting for the Fireflys, but now, once the story is coming to an end, I\u2019m realizing that I really don\u2019t want them to get away. They suck as human beings. They don\u2019t deserve a happy ending. As I noted above, one thing about the Fireflys is that they remain consistent with who they are. I\u2019d like to think that some of the lyrics of \u201cFree Bird\u201d are taken from the inner dialogue of all the Firefly family members: \u201cThe Lord knows I can\u2019t change. Lord, help me, I can\u2019t change.\u201d",

I\u2019m curious about which film showed actual smartphones being used by characters in the film for the first time. iPhones were introduced in 2007. Not sure if it was the first touchscreen smartphone that made it to market or not. \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the answers. Lots of stuff with keyboards and styluses. Some answers with non-real stuff too. But not what we would think of as smartphones these days. \n\nSeems like the first Sex and the City movie might be the first on screen appearance of an iphone. Released in May 2008. The Happening was released a month later. ",
