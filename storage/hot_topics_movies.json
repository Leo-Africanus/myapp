(One exception, an exchange between young Thomas and billionaire Owen about what it\u2019s like to be obscenely rich, stands out). By the time it concludes with the inevitable hinting at potential sequels, *Fountain of Youth* just seems desperate in its attempt to launch a viable film franchise for its streaming host.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-apple/)\n\n&gt;It would be nice to report that \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d is harmless fluff, a brisk escapist adventure with a game cast and a few fun set pieces. And I suppose it may be mostly harmless, unless you count wasting your time as a \u201charm\u201d (and I wouldn\u2019t fight you on that). But it\u2019s annoying fluff. It\u2019s tedious fluff. The only thing I wanted to escape was the movie itself. The cast is either trying too hard or not enough, and none of the action sequences blew me away. There\u2019s a bit on a boat that was probably expensive. There\u2019s a fight in a library that\u2019s competent. There\u2019s a shootout at the pyramids between characters we don\u2019t know or give a damn about. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201cfluffy\u201d and \u201cempty.\u201d \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d seems to have found it.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;No matter his gifts for tales about motley crews, this sub-Spielbergian venture isn\u2019t in his rough-and-tumble wheelhouse, the result being a clunky farce that never escapes its ancestors\u2019 shadow.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Ryan Gilbey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-gilbey) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation. As the family name Purdue suggests, Luke and Charlotte\u2019s father believed that some things should remain lost. Would that this had been the fate of the film.",

The conclusion also turns out to be one of more satisfying endings I have seen in some time, perfectly pitched and worth the wait for its human truth, and value that stops just short of sentimental. The real force of nature in *Sentimental Value* is Skarsg\u00e5rd and the film comes alive each moment he is on screen as a man who turned his back on his daughters, even his grandson, for the sake of a career.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sentimental-value-movie-review-joachim-trier-1235125511/) \\- 'A'\n\n&gt;Mercy asks for allowance, where forgiveness demands absolution. Mercy is a means, and forgiveness its ultimate end. Forgiveness is an act, while mercy is a *performance*. The distinction between the two may be subtle, but through the extraordinary grace of Trier\u2019s filmmaking, which here revels in the transmutational power of filmmaking itself, \u201cSentimental Value\u201d renders it larger than life.\u00a0\n\n[The Daily Beast - Esther Zuckerman](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/sentimental-value-is-the-best-movie-at-the-2025-cannes-film-festival/)\n\n&gt;\u2018Sentimental Value\u2019 is the best movie at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. This year on the Croisette, Trier and Reinsve have reunited for this project, a triumph of a film that expands upon and deepens their collaboration. It\u2019s also flat out the best thing I saw at the festival, a movie that slowly wrecks you emotionally as it tenderly unpacks a deeply complicated father-daughter relationship.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sentimental-value-review-aafeksjonsverdi-1236405810/)\n\n&gt;While not as stylistically radical as Trier\u2019s last film, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d this layered family-centric drama (which was also written by Eskil Vogt) shares its ability to find fresh angles on sentiments you\u2019d think that cinema would have exhausted by now. Chief among the previous movie\u2019s revelations was its star, Reinsve, who recalls the laid-back, lived-in and yet entirely modern allure of Diane Keaton during Woody Allen\u2019s peak years, mixed with an unpredictability that can feel positively radiant one second and practically inconsolable the next.\n\n[Vogue - Radhika Seth](https://www.vogue.com/article/sentimental-value-cannes-review)\n\n&gt;'Sentimental Value' might be the best film you see all year. Considering *Worst Person* got best-original-screenplay and best-international-feature Oscar nods, too, *Sentimental Value* should also expect to do well elsewhere, and is, unquestionably, this year\u2019s first serious best-picture contender. And it couldn\u2019t be more deserving. There are so many pleasures to be found in it\u2014the swooningly beautiful way in which it\u2019s shot, its painstaking design, its laidback, low-key, eternally aspirational Scandi aesthetic and costuming. But, in the end, none of that mattered to me, because emotionally, the film hit me like a truck.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sentimental-value-review-renate-reinsve-joachim-trier-1236223376/)\n\n&gt;For what might have been a standard family melodrama in less capable hands, *Sentimental Value* is uncommonly rich in emotional rewards and contemplative in its reflections on the places where we live becoming a permanent repository for our memories, remaining there even after we move on. The movie\u2019s poignancy accumulates gradually, every supple turn expertly modulated as the presence of generations past becomes more tangible.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/sentimental-value/) \\- 9/10\n\n&gt;\u201cSentimental Value\u201d is a film about the weight of home, the bonds of family, and the redemptive potential of art. It\u2019s a story only Joachim Trier could tell after working on \u201cThe Worst Person In The World\u201d and challenging himself, Vogt, and Reinsve to go even deeper than they did previously to tell something that was just as impactful, if not more rewarding. It\u2019s a daunting task to accomplish, but they somehow manage to do so with a film that will be cherished for generations. Reinsve, Skarsg\u00e5rd, Fanning, and Lilleaas form one of the most impressive ensembles of the year, each given the space and time to create compelling and relatable characters that offer rare subtlety and honest truth in their work rather than broad theatrics.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/21/sentimental-value-review-cannes) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Here is an exuberant, garrulous, self-aware picture about an ageing and egomaniac film director and his two grownup daughters; it comes from Norwegian film-maker Joachim Trier, who gave Cannes the marvellous romantic drama The Worst Person in the World in 2021, starring the award-winning Renate Reinsve, who stars in this one as well. The film cycles through a range of moods and ideas, and finally delivers a fair bit of that sentimentality from the title; it\u2019s a movie of daddy issues and cinematic adventures in the manner of Fellini and Bergman, with a gag about overhearing a therapist\u2019s session through the heating pipes, pinched from Woody Allen\u2019s Another Woman.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sentimental-value-review-renate-reinsve-and-joachim-trier-reunite-for-moving-family-drama/5205383.article)\n\n&gt;An actress daughter and her director father explore their family roles in *Sentimental Value*, the sensitive sixth feature from Norway\u2019s director Joachim Trier. On its surface, the film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.",

Which gets it most right?\n\nWhat's good?",

        "content": "Finally watched this film yesterday and I'm not really sure what to make of it. I'm a very casual movie lover so apologies as I'm sure my analysis will be elementary compared to what you all are used to.\n\nThe first part shows community and how tight knit the lads are. The wedding, which is beautifully done, to me, shows how unhinged the characters are going into it. Stanley punching his girlfriend, Michael trying to freak on Nick's girl, Nick being a lunatic, Steven being a virgin?\n\nI really have no idea what the hunt was supposed to show other than Mike is a skilled hunter, but I'm sure there was way more to it.\n\nNow in Vietnam we see that Mike is hardened by war. The lads are involved in Russian roulette, make their escape and get back to safety. \n\nI assume what takes place is Nick finds the only world he can exist in now is at the RR table. He is sending money to Stanley for his love child...maybe? \n\nMike gets back tries to continue on but can't without Nick. They meet, the thing happens and the end. \n\nSo...what is the point? War is hell? The power of friendship? Or am I trying to put something in a box that won't fit?\n\nI understand this is an extremely shorthand summation. I figure if you have the answer you're intimately familiar with the movie and I'm just \neager to hear your answers.\n\nAlso shoutout to the director for capturing Allegheny county. Holy cow is it spot on. \n",
