        "title": "The Total Recall movie fixed a huge dumb problem with the original short story",
        "content": "I've loved Total Recall for years so I wanted to finally read the short story it was based on, \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\" by Philip K Dick. And the short story is... kinda dumb, even compared to a Schwartzeneggar movie. Specifically this one aspect.\n\nThe story and movie are vastly different, but the setup is basically the same in both.\n\nStory and movie: An ordinary man is bored with his average life on earth and endlessly dreams of having adventures on Mars. He discovers a company called Rekal, which boasts it can implant 100% convincing false memories into your mind. He pays for the memory of an epic adventure on Mars in which he's a badass action hero spy. The procedure fails catastrophically because he actually IS a badass spy and just doesn't remember it.\n\nIn the movie, they made a very wise change. Rekal in the film makes sense as a business. Rekal is basically an entertainment company. You have a memory of a thrilling adventure, then it ends and you go back to your life. It's like a movie. You know it wasn't real and yet you have the satisfied feeling of coming home from an epic vacation, only with no personal risk and a lot less financial burden.\n\nHere's what immediately bugged me about the short story. In the story, Rekal is supposed to convince you that their fake memories are real. Period. They give you fake \"souvenirs\" from your adventure. They delete the last couple weeks of your real memories. They even delete your memories of coming to Rekal. You will just wake up at home after your \"adventure\" is over.\n\nMy issue: How is that supposed to work? They expect you to believe you're a spy assassin, but still show up for your shift at T Mobile? To just keep waiting on new orders from the agency that will never show up? What if you try to tell your wife? She'll correctly assume you're insane. What if you get mugged? You'll think you can do John Wick moves on the gunman and then get shot in the face. How can you live an ordinary life believing you're basically a superhero? Rekal is pretty much a company that charges you to ruin your life.",

        "title": "I have a deep love for the movie MONEYBALL. Here's why...",
        "content": "Moneyball is a 2011 film. It was directed by Bennett Miller and adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. \n\nI have seen the movie over 15 times. It took me a while to figure out why I am such a huge fan. Turns out quite a few people on reddit feel the same way. But I think most of the reviews actually miss why the movie resonates so deeply. Here is my theory. It comes down to four things: \n\n**1. It uses the subject of Baseball to show society's evolution into the digial/computer age.** Of course, this is never mentioned in the film. But the real underlying story is how computing technology will eventually disrupt our old way of life. And how some people will kick and scream to stop it, but it is inevitable. Those who identify it first will have the edge. Billy Beane and Pete represent the digital, new way of thinking. The manager and scouts represent the analog age. In a sense it is the most important issue of our time, and it tells it through baseball, America's most beloved, but aging institution...genius. \n\n**2. It is a love/hate letter to capitalism and therefore, America**. Again, never mentioned explicitly. But Moneyball is also a story about all the evil and beauty of capitalism. It is a story about how capitalism serves the ultra-wealthy and creates an unfair advantage for the few who hold the power and resources (\"there are rich teams, there are poor teams... there's fifty feet of shit, then there's us\"). The game is rigged in their favor.  But...capitalism also forces innovation, Billy's place at the bottom forced him to innovate. And in the end, it got baseball closer to a meritocracy, where individuals are accurately compensated for the value they create. For better or for worse, that is America. \n\n**3. The acting, directing and writing are all remarkable**. Bennett Miller came from a documentary background, so he captured the film in a way that felt like a documentary, using real footage in key moments and recreating it in others. But Aaron Sorkin's dialogue adds a pace and flavor that it unbeatable. And then of course, Pitt and Hill are remarkable. Excellent casting. Not to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman. \n\n**4. Above all else, I believe this movie is about Leadership**. This is the most important one IMO. I don't think anyone watching the movie will realize it until they obsess over it like I did. But really this movie is about Billy Beane's leadership. Humans are addicted to effective leaders. Beane was faced with great adversity, he accurately identified the threat, came up with a solution and found a way to implement his vision, despite great resistance. He also lifted up those around him who believed in his vision, even though they were young and inexperienced. That is what great leaders do. And subconsciously, I think that is the real, strongest draw of the film. And it certainly helps that Pitt is the perfect casting for it. ",

        "title": "'Final Destination: Bloodlines' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Plagued by a violent and recurring nightmare, a college student heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle of death and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.*\n\nDirector: Zach Lipovsky, Adam Stein\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_bloodlines)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/final-destination-bloodlines/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Schech](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236214028/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not whether but *how* the victims will die that gives these films their juice, and *Final Destination Bloodlines* doesn\u2019t disappoint. It does get bogged down in a tedious plotline revolving around dysfunctional family dynamics that makes you impatient for the deaths to start coming. But once they do, the grisly fun resumes. The gory set pieces, involving such things as a lawnmower, a garbage truck, and, most spectacularly, an MRI machine, are so cleverly orchestrated that the audience at the preview screening applauded each one as if they were song-and-dance numbers. The combination of CGI and practical effects works seamlessly, and the sequences are sadistically edited for maximum tension, which is thankfully relieved by frequent doses of mordant humor.\n\n[DEADLINE - Gregory Nussen](https://deadline.com/2025/05/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236394628/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a raucously good time, replete with enough subtle nods to previous entries and cheekily placed music cues for the most loyal of the franchise\u2019s fans. That it also includes some genuinely heartfelt moments, including a nicely written farewell to the series\u2019 lone consistent member William Bludworth (the late, truly great Tony Todd), is a delicious cherry on top of this reliable, horrific recipe dripping in blood and guts.\n\n[IGN - Tom Jorgensen](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-destination-bloodlines-review) \\- 8/10 (Great)\n\n&gt;In Final Destination: Bloodlines, death is the life of the party. There\u2019s little novelty to the boilerplate family trauma plot of this sixth Final Destination movie, but what its comedy-forward take on the franchise\u2019s established formula lacks in thematic depth, it more than makes up for with delightful, well-designed kills and boundless gallows humor. A testament to the powerful, simple joy of a well-executed setup and payoff, Bloodlines\u2019 lethal Rube Goldberg machines are tactile and satisfying, benefiting from a solid blend of goopy practical and visual effects. It\u2019s a fantastic jumping-on point for new fans, but the Final Destination faithful are well taken care of with cheeky references to previous movies and a truly poignant farewell from one of the horror genre\u2019s late kings, Tony Todd.\n\n[The Guardian - Radheyan Simonpillai](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/13/final-destination-bloodlines-review-horror) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;Where Bloodlines excels is in the clever and often diabolical storytelling craft and visuals. There\u2019s a decadence in the film-making that isn\u2019t at odds with the campy nature of Final Destination but instead realizing its full potential.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller ](https://www.avclub.com/final-destination-bloodlines-review)\\- B-\n\n&gt;As the *Final Destination* films have continued on, they\u2019ve gotten meaner, less superficially concerned with survival and more explicitly giddy at the prospect of a nasty death trap or a jumpy \u201ccrushed by a huge thing in an instant\u201d reversal. *Final Destination Bloodlines* embraces this late-period slasher-minus-slasher construction, with Lipovsky and Stein eagerly constructing deaths into applause moments celebrated with the same bursts of bloody confetti. These movies are built to be splattery supercuts showcasing the warped imaginations of horror filmmakers and special effects professionals, exploiting the call of the void that everyday objects can sound throughout our lives. *Bloodlines* does so playfully and lightly, without getting bogged down by franchise lore or pesky cinematic tropes like \u201ccharacters.\u201d The long gap between series entries means the film doesn\u2019t need to subvert expectations, but merely play into them\u2014in doing so, it\u2019s a success as simple as its death traps are convoluted.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Josh Parham](https://nextbestpicture.com/final-destination-bloodlines/) \\- 7/10\n\n&gt;This franchise loves to utilize the wind as an element to signal death\u2019s encroaching presence. It was easy to fall into parody before, but there, it was deployed in a manner that is both unsettling and ludicrous. That is the perfect summation of this film. It swerves towards originality in some places and doesn\u2019t break the mold in others, but it has a firm grasp on exuberant violence that will captivate a cheering audience that revels in a character being squashed under a falling piano. If you\u2019re that type of sicko, then this one will be one of the better rides this series has to offer.\n\n",
