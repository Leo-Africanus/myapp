        "content": "Anyone who saw this movie as a kid, especially in the 80s, can probably remember how shocked they were when this movie ruthlessly killed off the bulk of the cast from the TV series within the first act, including having Optimus Prime, the main hero and symbol of the franchise, getting shot in the gut and perishing on an operating table. This is an insane and seemingly ballsy creative decision (imagine if \"Avengers: Infinity War\" had Thanos killing all the main Avengers in the first act), until you realize why it was done; to sell more toys. The film is a feature-length toy commercial and they were simply clearing out the old line to make room for the new toys. They just did it in the most upsetting way possible.\n\n\"Hey, kids, guess what? Remember all those toys you love and cherish? They're all DEAD! WE KILLED THEM ALL!!!...so how about buying some new ones? We got them right here!\"\n\nOf course, the joke is, they played themselves and not only made what was intended as nothing more than a toy commercial a memorable film, they also were hit with a backlash to Optimus Prime's demise that was so fierce, they eventually ordered the character brought back to life. (The backlash even spilled over to other projects; the similar \"G.I. Joe\" animated movie hastily rewrote a major character death to just going into a coma to avoid a repeat reaction.) Sometimes, the craziest movies can be made for the most cynical of reasons.\n\n",

Sometimes there are themes that make you reflect and ponder over.\n\nThere is a lot written about the future of movies and there is increasing competition from various forms of entertainment for people's time. There are also reports that newer gens are not that much interested in movies as previous gens were.\n\nBut I feel movies have a place in the world and is a beautiful form of art and entertainment.",

        "content": "Sorry if I\u2019m late to this, I just joined this sub literally to talk about this movie. I kinda like war movies, whether it\u2019s something like fury or saving private ryan, there\u2019s TONS of Great War movies. I haven\u2019t seen one like this though. I don\u2019t know really what it was about this one, it was just different. And I have read that it was incredibly realistic, and people with PTSD actually had a hard time sitting through it. But watching the end credits was a really cool finish, especially seeing the actual people go through how they would clear a street/area. So am I kinda overreacting here or was this legit a good movie?",

        "title": "\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" gets a bad rep but it's the one movie in the series which offers you the biggest thrills while also being a big fun adventure and a Horror movie at the same time (PG-13 founder?)",
        "content": "We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. \n\nBut as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. \n\nOh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (\"I'm a Vegetarian!!!\").\n\nAnd I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. \n\nPeople bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. \n\nHarrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once.",

Casino over Goodfellas.\n\n",

        "content": "I\u2019m unsure if this is the right sub but I\u2019m on the lookout for more movies to watch and recommendations.\n\nI have severe social anxiety and I\u2019m dealing with a cycle of Burnout relapses. I\u2019ve been trying everything. My doctor is considering some sort of stress disorder, disassociation or something.\n\nMy therapist suggested staying away from the news, the true crime I used to watch and any content that could be \u201cbad to my mental health\u201d.\n\nWell, today I broke the rules and just watched the movie \u201cUs\u201d (I watched when it was released, but remembered very little). And it was surprisingly good to my anxiety.\n\nI laughed at the comical relief moments. I enjoyed the suspense and also enjoyed the meanings I could take from it. Also led me to acknowledge my own \u201cshadow(s)\u201d and not neglect them (?), at least that\u2019s how I took it. Also, the suspense grows and so does my physical and mental tension, but then these symptoms I already felt anyway gets released. It was a good experience, contrary to my expectations. If I had any.\n\nI feel more grounded and more connected to reality for now. So I\u2019d really like recommendations. I\u2019ve watched \u201cRun\u201d a few years ago and really liked it. Shutter Island. Midsommar. Psychological horror movies. Don\u2019t need to be heavy on the horror, just the building suspense. Also ones that make you think, have or could have deeper meanings. Plot twists. Good movies.\n\nAppreciate it.",
