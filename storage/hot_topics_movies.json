        "content": "Hi r/movies! I'm Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, writer/director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which is out in theaters nationwide starting today, Friday, July 18th.  I've also written and directed Netflix's DO REVENGE (starring Maya Hawke &amp; Camila Mendes), and written and directed Netflix\u2019s SOMEONE GREAT. Ask me anything!\n\nWhen five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences. A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they're forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer... and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.\n\n**Here's our trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs)\n\nI KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is out in theaters nationwide starting today.\n\n**Bio:**\n\nJennifer Kaytin Robinson is making her theatrical debut in 2025 with the new installment of the cult classic I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which she also co-wrote. The film features returning fan-favorites Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the original films, alongside a new generation of talent including Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon, and Gabbriette.\n\nRobinson is also known for her sophomore directorial feature DO REVENGE for Netflix, which she also produced and wrote. The film is a darkly comedic high school reimagining of Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Strangers on a Train\u2019. Its ensemble cast features Camila Mendes, Maya Hawke, Rish Shah, Austin Abrams, Talia Ryder, Alisha Boe, Sophie Turner and Sarah Michelle Gellar, and debuted at #1 globally on Netflix.\n\nHer feature directorial debut, SOMEONE GREAT, which she also wrote, premiered globally on Netflix in 2019. The cast includes Gina Rodriguez, Brittany Snow, DeWanda Wise, LaKeith Stanfield, and RuPaul, among others.\n\nHer additional credits include co-writing the screenplay for Marvel\u2019s THOR: LOVE &amp; THUNDER together with Oscar-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi, which grossed over $760 million worldwide; and co-writing the screenplay for the Max Original feature UNPREGNANT.  \n\n*Ask me anything! I'll be answering questions starting at 3 PM ET.*\n\n",

Where it really enhances what's happening on screen without feeling like the movie is saying \"You're supposed to feel this right now so the music is gonna make you feel this now.\"\n\nInterstellar - \"Mountains\" does a great job of matching the pace of the scene. The curiosity as they're trying to figure out the nature of the planet, and the way the music hits for \"those aren't mountains\" is great sauce for your \"oh shit\" feeling.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy - Defeating the bad guy with the power of friendship is an old one but \"Black Tears\" is great as it ramps up with each member joining hands and the way it crescendos right before \"We're the Guardians of the Galaxy\" really adds to how triumphant the scene feels.\n\nWhat are yours?",

Amazing performances, a ridiculously great script, and for its time that had to have been a  bold ending to do it in that manner. I'm glad with movies like Game Night, the Kenneth Bragnah Nile adaptations and the Knives Out series we're seeing a resurgence of the genre, but I don't believe this movie will ever be topped. ",

Overall, what are your personal biggest miscastings?",

        "content": "I was thinking about this in the wake of the teaser for the final season of \"Stranger Things\" coming out and thus hearing all the tired old jokes/complaints about \"the kid actors are too old for their roles!\" (FYI, for the final season, the kid actors are 19-22 playing 16 year old, which is pretty normal for film/TV.) Those people don't get how this is a time-honored tradition in high school movies, going back to the 50s (\"Grease\" openly mocked it). The 80s films that \"Stranger Things\" draws inspiration from had some especially egregious examples. James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink\" looks like a Wall Street yuppie trolling a high school for jailbait. Alan Ruck was pushing 30 in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off (a decade older than Mia Sara who was an actual teenager when they made it). And to use a \"Stranger Things\" cast member as an example, Matthew Modine was a married dad when he played a high school senior in \"Vision Quest.\" The list goes on.",
