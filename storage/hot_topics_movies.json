Every conversation that happened on screen was so damn captivating. I was completely immersed. Not a single line was wasted. The soundtrack was amazing the entire way through. The narration was perfect. The acting was top-notch, but the overall message of the film, and the style in which it was told is something I haven\u2019t seen or experienced in a very long time. The best comparison I can make, and one I thought of multiple times during my initial watch (there will be many more) was \u201cBig Fish\u201d a fantastic movie in its own rite. Definitely in my top ten. I think I might like this one better. Never before have I been so moved by a picture. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s heartbreaking but it\u2019s also wholesome and inspirational. I honestly just sat there, jaw wide open, mesmerized by what I was seeing. I\u2019m snowed in on a bitterly cold Saturday afternoon with nothing else to do and chose this movie on a whim. No trailer, no snippet, no recommendation, I didn\u2019t even know this movie existed until a couple of hours ago and know now for a fact that it\u2019s one I will never forget. This might be my new favorite movie!",

        "content": "The novel is a US classic. It deserves a comparable movie adaptation.\n\nCharly (1968) was so disappointing though.\n\nThe 2000 TV movie was an improvement. Matthew Modine was a better Charlie. The ending was more impactful too. But it was still an old school network TV movie. It was one of those cases where the cast and crew did the best they can within the limits of what they had.\n\nThe novel is near timeless because you can easily imagine the story is taking place in the modern day. Only a few tidbits here and there gives away its 1960s setting.\n\nWhat a new movie needs is a voice over narration from Charlie. The novel wouldn't be as acclaimed as it is if not for his unique first person POV. That the previous movies neglected this is baffling.\n\nEDITED to add that they can also *sparingly* show his written words on the bottom of the screen as he is narrating. Similar to captions or subtitles. Or a shot over his hand as he is writing. Certainly not throughout the entire movie but at key points to show his improvement and regression.",

I knew who some of the leads were gonna be but they just kept coming...  Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn to even small roles like Billy Zane, John Corbett, Thomas Hayden Church\u2026 on and on.\n\nIt looked beautiful on a big screen. George Cosmatos was a solid, no-frills director, but this looked like a painting. The cinematographer also did Rosemary's Baby and Bullitt.\n\n**(edit... since I wrote this I've learned the first director, Jarre the screenwriter, was fired for being slow... Cosmatos came in and finished it on a technical end but some think he quit too he didn't. Kurt Russell took a leadership role and helped steer the story by the end... others claim it was Kurt and a group effort... either way it was a troubled production)**\n\nThe story was based on real events, but there were some threads that seemed messy. Didn\u2019t matter though... everything else made up for it.\n\nKurt Russell... what can you say?\n\nAnd Val Kilmer\u2026 holy crap. I found his death scene more moving than it probably was meant to be, since he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s incredible in this.",

I mean that scene where Tai Lung fights Master Shifu is some of the best delivery of voice acting I'v ever seen. I know he's been really focused on the John Wick franchise but once he's done with that would love to see him play some more animated characters.",
