        "content": "Sometimes a movie comes out and is completely rejected or beloved by the public, but as the years and decades pass the cultural opinion on it shifts. What movie comes to mind for you?\n\nA big one for me is Batman &amp; Robin. As a gay kid in 1997 this movie was everything to me. The camp, the excess, the stupid puns, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze, the bat nipples, all of it! The movie was widely hated, mocked by its own star, and plans were scrapped for Schumacher\u2019s next Batman movie. The Adam West-ish tone didn\u2019t fly at all in 1997, and resulted in the deeply serious Batman films we still get today. \n\nAlmost 30 years later, I see so much love for this movie all over social media. People seem to have embraced it for the campy, ridiculous good time that it is. Maybe they were kids like I was at the time and we\u2019ve reclaimed it as our own. It\u2019s interesting to see how opinions shift over time. ",

        "content": "Why is it so hard to find? \n\nWhen I started game emulation about 20 years ago I saw the game in my list of ROMs, i remembered the film being around, it was advertised inside a VHS cover or two and I have seen adverts on TV for it but I am not sure if they were for the film being in cinemas or because it was shown on TV at some point here in the UK. \n\nRecently I looked up streaming services that have it and there aren't any in English, i've tried buying it and it's available on VHS and DVD for more than I am willing to pay. \n\nI know it wasn't the most popular or well known film and it was quickly forgotten but I figured it would be relatively easy to find in 2026. I have never seen it and i vary between forgetting about it and looking for it but I have never actually seen it on physical media. I am sure I could download it but that doesn't answer the main question which is why is it not widely distributed like other Robin Williams films? Is it a rights issue or is there something sinister about the film that has caused it to not be deemed as controversial (similar to Song of the South)?",
