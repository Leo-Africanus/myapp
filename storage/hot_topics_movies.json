        "content": "David Lynch has died. I am very young so I don't know a lot of his projects. But recently, just two days ago, I have seen The Straight Story.\n\nThe Straight Story is a movie about an old man who wants to visit his brother. Therefor, he travels 300 miles on a lawn mower. Can you believe it? You should, because it's based on facts.\n\nThe movie looks and sounds good. Beautiful landscapes mix with calm and melancholic music that feels like a soft summer breeze.\n\nOf course, the old man faces some challenges on his way. In Road Movie tradition, there are some stations he crosses, where he gets to know different kind of people.\n\nBut none of them are evil. Everyone is ready to help the man and the man is ready to help everyone. Humanity rules. The word \"Thank You\" means something. Characters inspire each other. Every new situation feels unique and valuable.\n\nThis makes \"The Straight Story\" a wonderful departure from darkness, be it natural, in our all lives, or fictional, before we press play on the next thriller.\n\nI enjoyed this little experience very much. \nEven though I come from germany, which is why my english may not be the very best, I want to say one thing....\n\nThank you, David Lynch.",

Immediately sold on it and popped it on not expecting much.\n\nHoly cow!  Such a fun ride of a movie!  not a typical Ryan Reynolds acting job/vibe.  He really made me feel like he was an awkward silent guy and never once was I think \u201cwow that\u2019s a funny deadpool bit\u201d or thinking of any of his other works cause I was entranced.  lol.\n\nAnna Kendrick also did a great job in her role, along with her coworkers in it lol.

        "content": "There have been a few movies that for one reason or another I really didn't think I'd like so I avoided them only to reluctantly watch them later and be pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them. For example:\n\n- For the longest time I avoided **Tropic Thunder** because it came out around the same time as Pineapple Express and from trailers and initial friends' reactions I feared it was going to have too much of the same kind of dumb comedy, something I normally really dislike. And it's funny because in certain ways that still turned out to be true, but TT just does everytthing - even the dumb stuff - just right!\n\n- I knew it was considered a classic but I wasn't that interested in seeing **Thelma &amp; Louise** honestly for no good reason other than I just didn't think it was going to stand the test of time that well. But, yea, I was very wrong, this is a great movie.\n\n- I normally don't like a lot of 80s horror so I hadn't seen **The Thing** for quite some time. But this is a classic for a very good reason.\n\nWhat are some for you? I'm curious about movies that you really didn't think you'd like, and why, only to be proved wrong.",

It could be a quiet solo trip to the movies. My mind goes back to some of the midnight showings I\u2019ve been to with friends such as *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* or the later Harry Potter films. ",

For me, it\u2019s the Layla piano exit by Derek and the dominos in GoodFellas, the montage of everyone in the crew getting whacked and the beautiful melody of Layla playing is absolutely iconic, that song is forever tied to GoodFellas in pop culture because of that scene! I love it! What are yours?",

It's that ole 'on opposing sides but still respectful' notion. And with just one sentence, you get a whole sense of their relationship and history.\n\nWhat small moments in other films have stuck with you?\n\n(Also, still tickles me every time I watch it that two Brits are playing Americans, while the American plays a Russian).",
