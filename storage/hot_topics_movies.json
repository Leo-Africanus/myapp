But I also think Brian Cox is a great and more believable Lecter than Hopkins.\n\nAdd great cinematography and soundtrack, imho.\n\nWhy do you think this film sank and the whole Hannibal Lecter as an incredible villain didn't catch on until Silnece of the Lambs?

        "content": "\nVisually? Absolutely stunning. The animation is insane, and the action scenes are super well-done. The world-building had so much potential, and you can tell they put a lot of effort into making the different regions feel distinct. But the story? Kinda mid. It\u2019s got a solid message about trust and unity, but everything moves way too fast, so the emotional moments don\u2019t really hit as hard as they should.\n\nAlso, Sisu\u2026 I get what they were going for, but her humor feels really out of place sometimes. Like, it\u2019s supposed to be this serious, emotional journey, and then she\u2019s cracking modern-sounding jokes that just don\u2019t fit. The side characters are cool but don\u2019t get enough time to shine, and the resolution feels kinda too easy considering how big the conflict is.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s not a bad movie at all\u2014it\u2019s fun, it looks great, and it has some solid action. But it definitely could\u2019ve been way better with stronger pacing and more character development. Would I rewatch it? Probably not. I give it a 6/10, and the movie was forgotten pretty fast. What do you guys think? (had to delete and repost to change flair)\n",

        "content": "What makes this scene heartbreaking is the reveal that Del has nothing. These moments with Neal are probably the most human interaction he's had in nearly a decade and this scene where he finally fights back his only response is of what he had in his prior life before his wife's death. When you get that twist at the end of the movie it makes the entire movie that much more heartbreaking. Del's entire monologue is esentially him fighting back by just reininsicng on the life he once had. Amazing performance from Candy who probably would've been one of the better character actors if he stayed alive.   \n  \n",
