        "content": "**How are you feeling about Americana finally hitting theaters? I know you worked on this a few years back.**\n\n*Americana* is legitimately my favorite movie I\u2019ve ever made, which you can print. I\u2019m not worried about any social blowback there. I just think it\u2019s wildly original, the script was so attractive. It was all about the writing, and Sydney Sweeney was just on the come up where everyone was starting to find out who she was because of *White Lotus* and *Euphoria*. When we wrapped, we were told it would go to a festival. A year later, we had it at SXSW in Austin, and we got great reviews, so we were like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re sitting pretty.\u201d Then we were just sitting. There was no pretty. We were wondering what the hell happened.\n\n...\n\n**Where do you think you\u2019re at as an actor in terms of selecting projects? Do you feel you\u2019d found the space you fit in or do you have things you\u2019re still hoping to explore?**\n\nThere\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t done that I want to do desperately. Kevin Costner offered me a part in *Horizon*, but it was one line of dialogue and the character had nothing to them. I don\u2019t need to be a piece of furniture in anybody\u2019s movie. I love Kevin Costner, and I want to work with him, and it\u2019d be an honor, but I also want to do something good. The same thing with Luca Guadagnino, \\[who\\] offered me \\[a role\\] to play the tennis judge during the big matches in *Challengers*. I could tell it was going to be something, and I love Luca, and he\u2019s been nothing but sweet to me, but also I feel way too competitive and way too hungry to eat garnish and pretend it\u2019s a meal. I would rather hold out for the right thing. On the day I\u2019m just going to be all hungry, and then I\u2019m going to look stupid and then I\u2019m going to feel awkward. In Hollywood, I don\u2019t feel like I fit in at all.\n\n**Really?**\n\nNo, I\u2019m an outspoken Jesus guy, but I also can\u2019t stand Donald Trump. I no longer live in L.A. I am obsessed with professional wrestling, and I\u2019ve made somewhat of a career out of that. In a weird way, I almost feel like I fit in the wrestling world more than I do in Hollywood. I\u2019m a way better actor than I am a wrestler, but I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, when I walk into a wrestling arena and there\u2019s a bunch of nerdy fans with signs and autograph stuff, and I feel like one of them. Whereas, when I\u2019m at a Hollywood function or a premiere, it feels like that awkward high school thing \\[where\\] there\u2019s a bunch of pretty people who are saying all the right things, and I\u2019m the only one who wants to truly be some sort of unleashed version of themselves, and I feel very alone in that for some reason.",

        "content": "This is a movie I've been vaguely aware of for a long time. Because of the name, I kind of assumed it would be along the lines of Blade Runner and was way, way off.\n\nFirst impression was the sound, opening the movie with a chair dragging for so long is a bold choice and the music/sound does an excellent job throughout the film.\n\nSecond was the cinematography, interesting shots and lighting, while quite dark, also feels very real. \n\nI was a few minutes in when I was starting to get really impressed by the actor playing Carl, \"this guy is good, how have I not seen him in anything else?\". Checked IMDb, it's Billy Bob Thornton! \n\nLots of actors are talked about for transforming into a role and I don't think I've ever seen this mentioned before, but it's crazy. I would never have guessed it was him, once I knew, I could kind of see some similarity in the eyes, but damn. It can't have been easy keeping his face like that for long shoots and the voice he does is perfect for the role.\n\nThen I saw he directed as well!\n\nThe rest of the cast was great, I think everyone hit their role out of the park. The actor who plays Frank, the kid, had a lot of narrative weight on him and really does well. \n\nAn interesting story too, I can't decide if Carl is one of the simplest characters I've seen or one of the most complex. I wonder how reading the entire bible influenced his views on the morality of his actions? \n\nReally recommend it, very good movie\n\ne: because of all the comments hung up on it, it's not just blade and blade, sling and run can be synonyms \n\n\"I'm gonna run that over to you this afternoon\"\n\n\"I'm gonna sling that over to you this afternoon\"\n\nBoth sentences make perfect sense. It's a transformers/transmorphers kind of thing ",
