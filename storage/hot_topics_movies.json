        "content": "I must say I was a bit skeptic when both of my sons (15 and 17) said they would join me watching Dances with wolves today. Especially when this was the extended version, that would be almost 4 hours. They are both kids of today with all that entails. It's sometimes hard making them keep attention for a short amount of time without any brain stimuli going on or them checking their phones.\n\nDuring todays movie none of them were on the phone one time, the only time they spoke it was about something happening in the movie. We had just one break during a 4 hours movie and it was a short pee break.\n\nThey were captivated. I'm impressed, this has never happened before and we are talking about a movie from 1990 and it is a 4 hours movie, slow even at that time. If this is not peak storytelling and a Grand Slam for the movie I don't know what might be.\n\nIt surely has it flaws we could discuss up and down, but from me to you a highly recommended movie to see with teen children!",

This could be down to a unique or bizarre score, strange scenes, characters that make you uncomfortable, or something else. I'm also particularly interested in films that have this presence but it's hard to explain exactly why... they just bleed a level of unease.",

Where would you rank it? For me the best scene in the movie was when Samuel Jackson talks Chris tucker into the trunk of the car, if you have seen the movie you\u2019ll know, the music is perfect setting the tone just right the song is by the Johnston Brothers ",
