        "content": "I pinpoint that film's release date to be the day Star Wars fans were permanently fractured. Some say *The Last Jedi* did but while that film undoubtedly *expanded* it, this film got the fanbase into an ugly division that has yet to be fully healed nearly a decade later. Before, it felt unified, the love for the original trilogy, the hate for the prequel trilogy and special editions, there was still enjoyment of being a fan. Then *The Force Awakens* comes and fan wars began on how some felt it was a return to form with spectacular effects, emotional beats, and the best acting in the franchise, while others felt it was a safe cash grab that did nothing to respect the lore, got too political, got too childish. The film's outstanding success only made these arguments nastier. I can remember what Reddit and IMDb was like during those days. Disagreements over movies always happened but this felt like the tipping point, especially as people continue to be this argumentative and cruel in their debates. No longer about having friendly disagreements, just to see who's the better \"fan\". I do hope the fanbase can come back to being more unified someday.",

        "content": "Just re watched Superbad for first time in like 3 years. Great movie. Perfectly depicts every teenage/early 20 year old boy\u2019s dream. I am 23 so the movie had me reminiscing the entire time. Can\u2019t help but wish I was 17/18 again with my only priorities being girls and alcohol. The ending was so bittersweet tho. I had never really noticed it before, but now I\u2019m a little older, with most of my high school friends having drifted away, the final escalator scene really hit home. They were both happy, met girls, were excited about their lives ahead, but at the same time they both felt themselves drifting onto different paths and understood that they can\u2019t be best friends forever. The final scene where Evan drifts out of view of Seth, that really hit me. Maybe because I\u2019ve finally accepted that me and my best friend since primary school have drifted apart. It just seems to capture the moment of initial realisation so perfectly. It\u2019s mad because when I was a teenager, I never thought SUPERBAD would have me in my feelings. Anyway, brilliant film. ",

        "content": "I know that this film got mediocre reviews when it came out and is considered one of Tom Cruise's forgotten films but man, it's so underrated to me. You could tell that Joseph Kosinski knew how to adapt the source material of his unfinished book (which the movie is based on) as a movie and it shows that he knows how to direct a perfectly-well done non-IP based film. It heavily relies on real locations rather than soundstages, the CGI and set design looks much better than today's Marvel movies, and of course, we all know Tom Cruise's performance is outstanding. Even though it leans more on the drama side rather than the action side, the action sequences are well-done and lastly, the cinematography and imagery are gorgeous to look at. Oblivion is worth a watch if you like sci-fi and Tom Cruise movies despite being not received positively by critics and audiences when it came out.",

        "title": "Which movies have that hyper-stylized 80s look!?",
        "content": "There is a group of movies that captures that vibrant 1980s aesthetics perfectly!\n\nThese movies are not necessarily good but they are often surprisingly watchable with their high-contrast lighting, neon glows, and saturated primary colors. The movies just pop!\n\nHere I want to collect these colorful and hyper-stylised 80s movies as well as various movies that have successfully imitated the style over the years.\n\n80s movies:\n\n* Savage Streets (1984)\n   * A colorful vigilante movie where everyone wears reds, blues, greens, purples and pinks. There are neon lights everywhere, making these gritty setting stand out!\n* Ninja III: The Domination (1984)\n   * An evil ninja spirit posesses an aerobics instructor wearing colorful spandex and shirts. Everything is in pastel colors.\n* Mannequin (1987)\n   * An interior designer falls in love with a Mannequin that comes alive. Plenty of opportunities for colorful sets in reds, yellows, blues and pinks.\n* Risky Business (1983)\n   * A teen home alone starts a brothel. We are taken through a week of neo dreams! Again pastel yellows, greens, blues and reds.\n* The Breakfast Club (1985)\n   * An coming-of-age story during detention. The teens wear blue, green, red and pink, the lockers are yellow, the walls are green and so on.\n* Chopping Mall (1986)\n   * Killer mall-security robots take on a teenage party. Neon signs, red robot eyes, pink and light blue sweaters. Blue, purple and orange lighting.\n* Death Wish II (1982)\n   * The killer punks wear bright yellow and red vests, wear pink sunglasses and even drive a yellow minivan. The city is full of colorful neon lights.\n* Fright Night (1985)\n   * Red, blue and yellow clothes, neon lights, bluish color grading and green backgrounds.\n* The Slumber Party Massacre (1982)\n   * In this slasher everything is oozing with colors from the girls' clothes to the backgrounds, the cars, the magazines, the pizza guy.\n* The Running Man (1987)\n   * In this game of death the villains, the heroes and the dancers all wear colorful clothes in yellows, blues and orange. Everything is bathed in red, blue and green lights.\n* The Wraith (1986)\n   * A dead guy turns into a car, which turns into a hot dude. This revenge movie is colorful from top to toe, and e.g. has a colorful cars and a colorful diner.\n\n90s movies:\n\n* Career Opportunities (1991)\n   * A janitor and a girl gets locked in at a Target over night. He wears a red jump suit, and everything in the store is used as colorful props for making a fun night.\n\nModern movies:\n\n* Terrifier 2 (2022)\n   * A slasher that perfectly captures the 80s with its pastel colors like blue walls, red shirts, pink lights, and high contrast.\n* Commando Ninja (2018)\n   * The intro montage is exactly what I mean! Orange sunsets at the beach, purple, yellow and neon bikinis, light blue leg warmers. Bad guys in light blue jump suits!\n* The Substance (2024)\n   * Insane body horror with this hyper stylised color palette of the 80s. The movie looks so good!\n* Hot Tub Time Machine (2010)\n   * They go back to a hyper stylised version of the 80s with colorful ski clothes, lights and everything.\n\nWhich movies am I missing?",
