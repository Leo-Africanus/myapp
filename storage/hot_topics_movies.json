The movie is well reviewed, had an immensely popular lead (Gosling) along with a familiar Hollywood legend (Crowe) yet it doesn\u2019t seem to have reached the fame or icon status of a Superbad or The Hangover. In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn\u2019t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?",

I don't even think it deserves an R, it's just that movies this violent usually get one. ",

        "content": "I rewatched *A Bug's Life* recently. I haven't seen it in literally over twenty years. It has a story about being true to yourself, finding your way, worker explotation, bullying, etc but it's nothing too deep for a film, especially a family film.\n\nIt felt refreshing. It's not a tearjerker. It doesn't have a super strong commentary about life. It's just a fun film to watch.\n\nAs a kid, I always wanted a sequel. I would think \"Why did Toy Story get so many sequels and not it?\". As an adult, I realize there's really no need for a sequel. It's self-contained. Pixar could do stuff set in the bug's world or make shorts about the circus bugs, but there's no need.\n\nPixar struggles with the weight of their success. Everyone expects their films to be top-tier, 10/10. They have a reputation for some of the best CGI animation in the industry, and some of the sweetest family geared films as well. Pixar films not seen as Oscar Bait art films, but their films are known for being impactful.\n\nBut not every studio can make bangers all the time. Their films can't all *be* roaring successes. Even if their films are great, not all of them can be as emotionally investing as \"Soul\" or \"Toy Story 2\".\n\nWhen their films fail to meet expectations, it's noticeable. No one talks about \"A Good Dinosaur\". \"Brave\" and \"Cars\" are highly controversial amongst Disney-Pixar fans as well.\n\nEveryone expects Pixar to release a certain type of film. They have different expectations than other studios like DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky, or even Disney itself. Not all their films can meet this expectation. \n\nPixar's bar is too high for their own good. They've been a gold standard for animated films for decades now.",

And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that won't be true. It will be because youre an asshole.\"\n3. **Heat** restaurant scene with DeNiro and Pacino - despite having a common ground they wont stop on what they are doing\n4. **The Dark Knight** with Bale and Ledger - \"See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.\"\n5. **Inglorius Basterds** opening scene aka Christoph Waltz' epic scene - \"You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?\"\n6. **Marriage Story** \\- Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson - \"Everyday I wake up and I hope youre dead!\"\n\n",

        "title": "To whoever recommended Aniara to me on this subreddit...",
        "content": "Thank you and please go fuck yourself (but not really unless you want to in a good way). This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and it's also one of the bleakest stories EVER. It put me into a depressive funk for a week after. Like it is up there with The Pianist for me, but The Pianist somehow has a happier ending, which is really fucking saying something.\n\nHeavy spoilers below so don't read further if you plan to watch this, which I recommend because it is really, really good and I haven't stopped thinking about it since I first watched it 6+ months ago. \n\nI love the concept, I love how it is told (those time jumps get more and more devastating with each one). Watching this movie felt like being repeatedly punched in the stomach, each time with something even more painful and damaging. The last time...I was left in a wasteland of emotions. This movie is so well done, it has permanently changed how I feel about space travel (not just this movie but it was a part of what changed my opinion).\n\nWhat's the point of leaving Earth for a place that is cold and dark and barren? To live in some sterilized environment void of the nature we were born out of.  This movie is really an environmental movie. There is no place like Earth that we can get to, and even if we could somehow get there, what is likely to arrive will be an empty vessel. We can't replace the Earth, this is all we have. Every day we get to see the sky, the green earth, and clear water is a blessing. \n\nI used to believe investing in space travel would lead to a Star Trek universe, but now, I think it's just another tool to help the rich get richer. Space travel will be a part of the distopian future we are headed to, but it will be poor people sent off to live in the darkness and mine minerals for the rich, while the rich stay on this beautiful planet. Elysium will be here, and if we destroy here, the future will be dark and cold for humanity because here is all we have.\n\nHas anyone else here seen this movie? It's one I wish more people would see because it is a solidly good aci-fi and those aren't as common. At the same time, I recommending this to someone feels more like inflicting it on them. \n\nOne last thing, if you need something happy after watching this, I recommend a TV show called Avenue 5. It's got a similar story to Aniara, but it's all comedy and it is fantastic.",

The film keeps one actor from the original cast and replaces the rest with Muppets.\n\nI offer *Pulp Fiction* retaining Ving Rhames.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing what gets offered.

It is not entirely clear for me when the character of Rick develops from \u2018not sticking his head out for no one\u2019 and then actually making a sacrifice.",
