        "content": "\u201cThe film, directed by Miguel Zacar\u00edas, retells the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Mexican actor Jorge Rivero played Adam, while newcomer Candice 'Candy' Wilson played Eve. There are no other actors in the film. The movie is largely silent, with the actors gesturing and calling each other's names to communicate. The film has some opening narration, as well as the voice of God saying a few phrases from the heavens.\n\nThe film gained notoriety because Rivero and Wilson appear fully nude throughout most of the film, with occasional glimpses of genitalia, pubic hair and female nipples.\n\nThe film was picked up by Dimension Pictures. Stephanie Rothman and her husband Charles Swartz supervised re editing and dubbing the film for US release\u201d \n\nIt was a Mexican film titled El pecado de Ad\u00e1n y Eva that released in 1969 but later released in the states in 1973.

        "content": "What are your thoughts on The Curse of the Black Pearl?\n\nI decided to rewatch The Curse of the Black Pearl and I must say, I loved this film as a kid, I still love it as an adult. It\u2019s such a fun, compelling adventure film. The Special Effects I feel still hold up,\u00a0and the Big Action Pieces are great to watch. What I also found with this film is that I feels a little more grounded than the sequels, which I feel dial it up but I like 2 and 3, 4 is okay, 5, I just didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe Cast is great. Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Jack Sparrow and I feel he is at his best with the character in the 1st film. In the 1st film, Jack is a master manipulator who excels at improving his strategy when things go sideways and you can never really tell if he is a joke or if he\u2019s serious. He is unpredictable, he is charismatic, He is just fun to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also great as Barbossa and makes for a great villain and his banter with Depp is fun to watch.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are also good as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but I must admit, without Jack Sparrow, their story was a little bland but It didn\u2019t dissuade me, I still love this film.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I just love this film and rewatching it, it is a great adventure film.",

I never noticed an accent slip. There's certain words that UK/Aussie's usually slip on if their accent skill isn't perfected.\n\nToni Collette for just everything I've seen her in. I think I saw a movie where her natural accent was used but I can't even think of it.\n\nBoth I just assumed were Americans until I randomly found out weren't.\n\nEdit: Yes, I made a mistake and put who's and not whose. I get it. Thank you",

        "content": "*As the Nuremberg trials are set to begin, a U.S. Army psychiatrist gets locked in a dramatic psychological showdown with accused Nazi war criminal Hermann G\u00f6ring*\n\nDirector: James Vanderbilt\n\nCast: Russel Crowe, Rami Malek, Michael Shannon, Richard E. Grant, John Slattery, Colin Hanks\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nuremberg_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [60 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nuremberg/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[TheWrap - Matthew Creith](https://www.thewrap.com/nuremberg-review-rami-malek-russell-crowe-tiff-2025/)\n\n&gt;\"Nuremberg\u201d benefits not only from a terrifying performance from Crowe in a larger-than-life role like those that defined the early part of his career, but also from the ensemble of actors that makes it possible to doubt and also sympathize with the crimes at hand. Shannon and his co-counsel, Richard E. Grant, as British lawyer David Maxwell Fyfe, take the courtroom scenes to higher ground, tearing G\u00f6ring down with carefully crafted monologues. \n\n[NextBestPicture - Jason Gorber](https://nextbestpicture.com/nuremberg/) - 7 / 10\n\n&gt;An incredible performance from Russel Crowe. But for all its bold moments of courtroom antics and mind games between monsters and their keepers, this is an almost insultingly pared down version of events from one of the most important legalistic moments in human history. By providing a convenient in within a broader entertainment, the film certainly introduces newer generations to what transpired, but it provides such a simplified view that it may actually do more harm than good.\n\n[Collider - Ross Bonaime](https://collider.com/nuremberg-review-russell-crowe-rami-makek/)\n\n&gt;Quite frankly, it never hurts for a film to preach the dangers of Nazis and how they can be anywhere and everywhere, but it is a bit of a shame Nuremberg isn\u2019t finding a more compelling, enticing way to tell this inherently fascinating true story.",

No. Is some of its audacious, late 90's contextual, satire going to offend folks for different reasons than it did in 1998? Yes.\n\nBut damn was it an enjoyable ride.",

        "content": "Actor Singer Songwriter Musician\nI\u2019ve followed Mr Karyo, &amp; frankly had somewhat of a crush on him, since the mid \u201890s, after seeing him on a friends home VHS recording of an episode of Taratata. [Taratata\u2019s a French TV show with national &amp; international artists, started in \u201893, since 2015 exclusively live, with interviews, &amp; acoustic musical interludes. It\u2019s quite good &amp; PBS or someone should catch it!]\nThere\u2019s so many films [&amp; TV] I\u2019ve seen since, all those not readily available here in \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 are more than worth the search &amp; I\u2019ve possibly seen all more than once.\nPlus there\u2019s Mr Karyo\u2019s music.\nSome films I first relied on retro or VHS rentals to see: 1987s Le Maine et Sorcier\u00e9 [The Monk &amp; The Witch] aka Sorceress, where as the film\u2019s lead he\u2019s a morally directed monk who makes decisions contrary to church hierarchy, while his vowed to rules &amp; his faith are both tested by the wisdom &amp; charitable acts of a local healer. Acting so masterful, even in his silence. To this day a film favorite. I add that a friend of mine, who hated subtitles, along with surprised to be loving the film &amp; becoming a lifelong fan, later noted that he\u2019d so very oddly, surely for him, barely noticed them. 1989s L\u2019Ours aka The Bear, where it truly visualizes the animal that is man &amp; bear both, &amp; with very little dialogue Mr Karyo\u2019s Tom stayed with me, much with the power of the films intent &amp; the surprising realism of the anthropomorphic bear. 1990s \u2018La Femme Nikita\u2019, as the agents trainer, he radiates sensitivity &amp; focus. Not considered a major role, but still of the most memorable.\nSo many films since, in the theatre &amp; some of the older still via VHS, DVD, &amp; streaming. At the movies, what fun to see him in Bad Boys as a deliciously sinister *real* bad boy. My much missed friend Biara\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f finally saw him &amp; understood my near devotion. Biara\u2019s darling Amir\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f, also so very missed, who initially laughed at our joyful critiques, soon agreed we were spot on. Golden Eye, The Patriot, Kiss of The Dragon, The Way\u2026 &amp; many many more.\nYou may know of Mr Karyo\u2019s music. Yes, this of these too I\u2019m an aficionado. Akin to Nick Cave, Tom Waits, Joe Cocker, Mingus. There\u2019s numerous songs that I very much enjoy, but I\u2019ll leave you with a sentimental favorite. https://youtu.be/R3D76OvRzpA?si=U2pTtOfFJyQpFXqr Probably can\u2019t recall how many times my precious &amp; patient animal cousins that deigned me a worthy roomie suffered my swaying &amp; terrible dancing to this with them in my arms or with the bigger ones on my back &amp; over my shoulder. My meshuga bubbeleh James\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f would play this just to see that. They lovingly endured him too.\nTch\u00e9ky Karyo\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\nRequiescat in pace\n~\nAn aside of sorts: If \u2018someone\u2019 officially &amp; professionally finally shares the film \u2018someone\u2019 officially &amp; professionally must\u2019ve taken, if you LOVE film, you MUST see Cin\u00e9Magique! This Short is of love &amp; appreciation &amp; history &amp; sheer ebullience, all toward the art of cinema, starring a bounty of actors, mixing live action &amp; onscreen acting, with what I\u2019d still testify were astonishing special effects. Ran from 2002 through 2017. The ONLY reason I went to Disney on my only &amp; all-too-short visit to Paris. It was extraordinary!\nSomewhat reluctantly, as are not complete nor professional but for an amateur well done &amp; very much appreciated, I include the best version I\u2019ve found here. Do watch. I think - &amp; hope! - you too will \ud83e\udd29 https://youtu.be/EhbPpUakkXU?si=XQ0PWS0aztUzH2GQ \nIf you\u2019ve read this much you\u2019re either a knowing enthusiast of Mr Karyo\u2019s vast &amp; diverse work or a fellow film fanatic. Thank you!",
