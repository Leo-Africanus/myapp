To me, though, it's just strange to find movies where the filmmakers spent so much time detailing all the aspects of a new reality only to never realize how dull the end product would be. With all the pre-viz cinematics, table reads, and rough edits only to lose sight of the sum of all the parts. Obviously no one knows everything and it's great to take these risks, it's still fascinating.\n\nFor example, [City of Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHf7UhHpmE).\n\n[Mortal Engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsFc2gguEg).\n\n[Tomorrowland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ7O-RrATY).\n\n[Renaissance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ftZhphGgwo) (bit of a cheat since it's animated but the new whiz bang tech for it demanded a solid story idea)",

        "content": "From [Fangoria.com](http://Fangoria.com) in an interview with Bill Skarsgard, when asked about the specific inspirations for the character of Count Orlok in Nosferatu (2024):\n\n&gt;\"There were a lot of different things. There was a Bulgarian movie called\u00a0*Time of Violence*\u2014a great movie, over four hours long, set in Bulgaria in the 17th century. And there\u2019s this guy, the antagonist of the\u00a0movie, taking over a village and forcibly converting Christians, and it\u2019s incredibly violent and horrible. That performance was something Robert talked a lot about in terms of who Orlok could have been when he was alive. We\u00a0talked about\u00a0that one a\u00a0lot,\u00a0and\u00a0various different\u00a0things\u2014little snippets from here and there.\n\n&gt;But that was during the very early stages.\u00a0Once you start delving deeper into a character, hopefully, you start getting inspiration from whatever\u00a0it is\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0actually\u00a0working on,\u00a0and that\u00a0creates seeds that come out of it.\u00a0**Robert also wrote a backstory for Orlok, just a few pages, that he shared with me, which was also very helpful.**\"\n\nI know that in the original movie and the book, Orlok/Dracula wasn't fleshed out since he served as simply being a figure of pure darkness and evil. He didn't need the background or some kind of crazy backstory, he just needed to fulfill the role in the story (alongside backstories not being as much of a focus for the time). But to hear that Robert apparently did some amount of expansion on Orlok's character got me super intrigued, and makes me wonder if anyone actually knows what this backstory is that Robert wrote?\n\nI expect this to go nowhere since the movie is relatively quite new, but I figured I'd ask the wider movie community to see if I can be surprised.\n\nEDIT: I've been *thoroughly* surprised, haha.",

Besides being mesmerizingly beautiful, like a Greek statue in motion, she wasn't just a beautiful woman, she could act and her scenes with Paul Douglas and Thelma Ritter display a prowess in delivering acid-tongued one-liners with aplomb. \n\nSadly, her career started to falter in the 1950s, a string of commercial failures as well as being typecast in sex-symbol parts and never being challenged as an actress. \n\nShe died young in 1965, from a house fire. She was trapped on the second floor of the home by heat and smoke, as the fire had started in the living room. She was found, still alive,  next to the burning living-room sofa, with 80% of her body burned. She died soon after.",

        "content": "Synopsis: Greedy executive Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) hopes to take control of the company he works for by purchasing a majority share -- but he must first devalue the stock. So he convinces the board to appoint know-nothing recent graduate Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). But Mussburger's plot backfires when Barnes' latest invention succeeds, thereby increasing the company's value. Worse yet, undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has the scoop on Mussburger's shady dealings.\n\nHonestly, the synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Especially with Tim Robbins' huge role in Silo, coming back to watch his earnest performance as Norville Barnes is a breath of fresh air.  You'll find deliciously satirical writing and direction from the Coen Brothers, knock out performances by Newman and Leigh - the Hudsucker Proxy is an overlooked gem.  With the focus around New Year's Eve, there is no better time to watch this amazing movie if you've never seen it before.  Infinitely quotable, excellently acted, and supremely unique, I hope more people take the time to watch one of my favorite movies tonight.",

        "title": "Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers inspired LEGO set (My own design)",
        "content": "[https://imgur.com/gallery/lego-wallace-gromit-wrong-trousers-own-design-x4mXZ3d](https://imgur.com/gallery/lego-wallace-gromit-wrong-trousers-own-design-x4mXZ3d)  \n  \nHey everyone!\n\nI\u2019m thrilled to show off my latest LEGO build inspired by one of my favorite Wallace &amp; Gromit films, \"The Wrong Trousers.\" Living in Bristol, this project means a lot to me, mixing the beloved clay characters with the building techniques of LEGO blocks.\n\n**About the Build:**\u00a0After making some well-recieved Star Trek ships, I wanted to create something closer to home. \"The Wrong Trousers\" has the perfect blend of humor and detail that I love working with in LEGO. I saw some cool sets on LEGO Ideas, but they got rejected and the most accurate on there used non-existant bricks. Not my set\u2014all pieces are readily available.\n\n**What\u2019s Included:**\n\n* **Wallace &amp; Gromit Figures:**\u00a0Bring back those classic scenes with Wallace and his clever dog, Gromit. Wallace\u2019s upper body fits right into the iconic trousers, and Gromit is ready to give his signature eye roll.\n* **Feathers McGraw:**\u00a0No set is complete without the sneaky penguin. Feathers comes with a bag of loot and detachable gun in his hand, perfect for tinkering with his stolen control panel.\n* **The Wrong Trousers:**\u00a0The star of the set! The trousers have movable legs with sturdy studs for cool poses and play. Plus, you can take off the controls and pass them to Feathers.\n* **Tea Time Table:**\u00a0Enjoy a classic British tea setup with a detailed table, steaming tea set, cracker box, and a Wendlesydale-on-cracker snack. It\u2019s the perfect place for Wallace and Gromit to plan their next move.\n\n**Size:**\u00a0Wallace stands about 23cm tall, and the other pieces vary in height.\n\n**A Bit About the Journey:**\u00a0Building this set was pure love. I\u2019ve always admired Nick Park\u2019s stop-motion work and wanted to capture that magic with LEGO. Being in Bristol, surrounded by creativity, inspired me to honor this favorite story. Designing everything from the detachable trousers to the tea setup was a fun and rewarding challenge.\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as I did!",

        "title": "This year, I watched over 365 movies. Here's an assortment of favourites, surprises, and thoughts.",
        "content": "So, why did I decide do this? Short answer: Twitch streamer Northernlion and Cine2Nerdle Battles, the former a movie trivia machine, and the latter a movie-trivia PVP game. Hoping some folks are familiar with both or either as explaining makes this giant post even bigger. Anyway, those got me to finally make a Letterboxd, and set me on a movie frenzy which peaked in early January. So I figured I'd try and get through a year's worth. One a day was already kind of out the window as I started late, but 365 seemed surprisingly doable given the appetite I suddenly had for it (and sure enough I went over). There were so many classics I hadn't seen, recent beloved movies I didn't get to see in theatre, etc. Hilariously, I actually thought I'd \"run out\" of the best stuff before the year was out, but of course that's patently absurd, especially with some of the choices I made. I suppose I should apologize up front for the anime movies too, which some might consider boorish to count, but what the hell, I wanted to see them. I ended up with 391 movies new to me, including 11 rewatches, mostly to show my wife or prepare for a sequel. \n\nThat all said, I don't recommend this. It's easy to burn out and just really not be in the mood some days when you're stuck on such a goal. There were some days I put on a movie I knew I wouldn't be too concerned about, and I'm sure you can notice them. And really, I only had the luxury of time to do this since my backshift job allows me a lot of downtime, so yes, I know I'm blessed there. It'd be downright unreasonable otherwise. Anyway, hopefully someone enjoys this read, and maybe discovers a movie they were unaware of or watches something they've been putting off. But really, I wanted to make a post like this also just for me, as something of a year-end review, to go back and recap everything since it can be easy to forget with such a deluge. So I won't feel too bad if this goes unnoticed, as I kind of suspect.\n\nBut enough about all that. [Here's the Letterboxd Diary of what I've seen this year.](https://letterboxd.com/PureLionHeart/films/diary/) Out-front note, I didn't give star scores, as I always hate looking back and being utterly embarrassed by younger me's choices. So I just noted whether I liked it or not, and added my favourites to the appropriate list. I'll mainly use this post to showcase my Top Ten, a list of the surprises both good &amp; bad, and some random musings on actors, directors, genres, whatever. And don't worry, I don't believe there's any spoilers here.\n\n*Top 10 (alphabetical):*\n\n* **Anatomy Of A Fall** - Just an utterly fantastic drama and mystery. There's really not much more I can say, save that Sandra Huller is fantastic and I hope to see her in a lot more.\n* **Asteroid City** - Turns out I love Wes Anderson's work, and this one has enraptured me for reasons I can't really articulate. I still think about it, and devoured YouTube essays as a result.\n* **Coherence** - Thrilling, and a fabulous ending. I had heard it was insanely confusing to understand, but highly disagree, unless you're trying to track everyone, which the movie really points out itself as foolish. The book was real heavy-handed, though.\n* **Dune: Part Two** - Just an amazing follow-up. I've not read the books, but I know I am actively failing the material every time I'm cheering for Paul, but so be it. And God-damn, Austin Butler was amazing with the subtleties. He could not have been hornier for Paul, and I'll stand by that viewpoint.\n* **Hell Or High Water** - Heard good things, but didn't expect such a great, tight plot acted so well. Chris Pine was great, sure, but Ben Foster is the real treat. Been keeping an eye out for his work since.\n* **Locke** - This should not have worked, but dammit, does it ever. Any movie that has me cheering at the end is an all-timer. I was on the edge of my seat since so much could have gone every which way.\n* **Take Shelter** - I discovered Jeff Nichols' work this year, and loved all but The Bikeriders. This one had me uneasy all the way through in the best way. And yes, I'm one of those folks who subscribes to the ending being another dream/episode. \n* **The Hunt** - Damning, depressing, terrifying stuff. More a horror movie than most films I'd watch. Especially as it goes on and things just don't improve. Drives home the ending all the further. Mads' best work, and I say that despite adoring Hannibal.\n* **The Vast of Night** - The biggest surprise of the year, probably my overall favourite just on sheer unreadiness. For all the movies I liked this year, nothing gave me the outright chills except this and Coherence, and this was an order of magnitude stronger. Why such a surprise? I thought I was about to watch It Comes At Night, and had the wrong movie. If there's one absolute recommendation in this entire post, it's this movie. Easily.\n* **Women Talking** - My wife could not have undersold this more. She liked it, and broadly explained it as the women taking a vote about what to do with the men of the town. That's it. I assumed something supernatural, as she's much more into horror and the like. The actual content was much more harrowing and enthralling.\n\n*Surprises (Good &amp; Bad):*\n\n* **The Vast Of Night** - One more shout-out, because my God. Expected a likely mediocre horror, got a feature-length Twilight Zone episode that kept me enraptured the whole way through.\n* **The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs** - So wildly inconsistent, wow. My fault, I didn't know it was an anthology. I could have watched two straight hours of Tim Blake Nelson singing and shooting, and Near Algodones was still good, but the rest did little for me (maybe The Mortal Remains). Not helped by the fact my wife decided to get high to watch it with me during the Buster Scruggs section, and then got subjected to the nightmare that is Meal Ticket at her peak. The poor woman.\n* **Tar** - The wife and I actually gave up on this early on in the classroom section as it seemed too esoteric for us, with no knowledge of the subject matter, but I gave it another crack myself later in the night, then eventually convinced her to go back. So fantastic once the movie fully revealed itself. And I cannot stress enough how surreal it was that just earlier that day, and for the past few weeks, I had been replaying Monster Hunter World...\n* **The Hunt For Red October** - I just find it hilarious they had English, Scottish, Swedish, and New Zealander actors doing Russian accents...\n* **The Killing Of A Sacred Deer** - This was my first Yorgos Lanthimos film, and nearly put my off his whole filmography. The plot is fantastic, but I utterly loathed the monotone delivery throughout. Thank goodness he's loosened up on that. I couldn't imagine Poor Things without the over-the-top deliveries like Ruffalo's.\n* **Sicario** - Good enough movie, but man does it feel unusual for Denis Villeneuve in retrospect of his later work. I also bring this up because I dared to try the sequel and quit less than 10 minutes in when they added Muslim suicide-bombers to the Mexican cartel, and it was blindingly clear the intention and views of the film and filmmakers.\n* **Moonrise Kingdom** - My wife and I were struggling on what to think of this for a decent chunk of runtime, until we finally settled on a description of immense sincerity. We loved it by the end and were actively rooting for everyone.\n* **Ad Astra** - What little I heard about this was as a boring, dull, sci-fi movie. I don't get it at all. Hell, there's a car chase with guns on the moon! And in a spaceship taking off! But who cares, because the contemplative acting and dialogue are the real point, and it's great at that.\n* **Kiss Kiss Bang Bang** - This movie is an enigma to me because from the sum of its parts, it should easily be one of my all-time favourites. I adored The Nice Guys, for example. But I swear, I just couldn't get into it. It just never seemed to come together for me, and I just don't know why. I may rewatch it again, maybe I was just in a bad mood or something.\n* **Mud** - I knew of this solely from Cine2Nerdle and getting beaten with it, and it was my intro to Jeff Nichols as mentioned. I generally don't care for coming-of-age films, but this one was fantastic with the way it approached a boy learning of love in so many different ways. Take Shelter did more for me, but this was very nearly in my Top Ten as well.\n* **Furiosa** - I'll just be honest, this was a let-down for me. Still good, undeniably, but Fury Road is a masterpiece and this just couldn't measure up. Surprisingly, I think one of the biggest faults lies in the soundtrack. Nothing hit as hard, and music was used much more sparingly. It was shocking that the biggest chase scene was nearly silent compared to what Fury Road did at every opportunity.\n* **Babylon** - Incredibly up-and-down. It largely didn't click for me, especially the saccharine ending, except for every moment Brad Pitt was on screen: he was solid gold. And that speech by Jean Smart, too. I loved seeing her since Legion may well be my favourite TV show.\n* **It Follows** - Turned out to be a massive disappointment, really. I think I was expecting a more methodical, robotic force that required clever rule use and the like, and while that's there to an extent to be sure, the continually revealed ability of the creature to think and react diminished things for me. It's less a force of nature, which makes it feel less scary somehow.\n* **I'm Thinking Of Ending Things** - This was half-spoiled for me thanks to a video from Jacob Geller of all things, but I still thought it fantastic, possibly moreso because I knew the premise and went with it.\n* **Can You Ever Forgive Me?** - All the Letterboxd reviews are right. Give them both Oscars. I am very much not a McCarthy fan, but that was an amazing movie. I really need to watch more with Richard E. Grant too, he's a delight.\n* **The Double** - A wild movie, and forgive the pun, but I did a double-take when I saw the director was Richard Ayoade, never expected that. Intrigued the whole time, though I don't think Eisenberg can play a cool version of himself.\n* **Phantom Thread** - Didn't think I'd care for a movie about a dressmaker, but it was Paul Thomas Anderson, who I had come to very much like this year, and Daniel Day-Lewis, so I had to try it. Absolutely did not expect the plot I got, or how much I liked it.\n* **May December** - Most notable to me because I completely misjudged the premise since I had no knowledge going in. I assumed it was Natalie Portman &amp; Julianne Moore who were in the age-gap romance. Fantastic film. Charles Melton sold it all sold well.\n* **Bobby** - Watched this after JFK on a lark, seemed a sensible follow-up. I did not expect to care so much about everyone (well, not Slater's character...). The decaying materialistic relationship, the marriage to avoid Vietnam, the career devotee dealing with retirement. It also helped being Canadian and having little-to-no details on the collateral damage that occurred in that kitchen, and who survived. This one is definitely boosted by recency-bias, but I loved it.\n\n*Lastly, some other random tidbits and musings.*\n\nFirst, genres. I gave some more horror a chance, but I'm still not really into them. But I did discover as a result what is likely my favourite new genre of film, which are basically long-form Twilight Zone/Outer Limits episodes. That's how I'd describe Coherence and The Vast Of Night, and I would be immensely thankful for further recommendations of that ilk. My interest in movies about Hollywood is pretty 50/50: Mank &amp; Trumbo were great, but Babylon mostly left me cold as noted above. The biggest surprise in this avenue, however, is that I don't like mob flicks. The Scorsese oeuvre did absolutely nothing for me this year (though I recall liking the Departed). Others like Donnie Brasco also didn't hit. Not a lot of comedies watched at all either, and that's probably not going to change. Dramas and thrillers are still where my heart lies.\n\nNext, I got to go through a lot of works by specific directors and actors. Jeff Nichols was a lovely surprise, as noted. But Wes Anderson got the deepest dive from me, and turns out I love his style. Still more to see, too. Paul Thomas Anderson also got more viewings from me, and I'm very eager to see the rest of his work, can't imagine disliking any. I quite liked that Paul Schrader trilogy of sad men as well. Meanwhile, I have three notable mixed bags: Soderbergh, Ridley Scott, and the Coens. It's basically a 50/50, which I guess is expected as they both have large bodies of work, and jumping between genres. For actors, I remain unflinching that Jake Gyllenhaal is my favourite actor. Nightcrawler from years past cemented that for me, but I got to see a lot more of his work this year and not an iota of doubt creeped in. Rebecca Ferguson showed up numerous times, and I loved her on screen every time. She really caught me off-guard in Doctor Sleep, a movie I liked a lot more than I expected of such a sequel. The man himself aside, I have got to admit that Jared Leto can absolutely act: Requiem For A Dream, Dallas Buyers Club, Hell, he was giving his all in House Of Gucci even. Jesse Plemons was in so many movies I saw, sometimes in bit parts that just had me doing the Leo DiCaprio meme at the screen, but he's always a delight. \"How can that be profitable for Frito Lay?\" will be quoted back-and-forth between my wife and I for years. Finally, even though I've seen numerous movies with him in them in the past, I had no idea how prolific Jared Harris was. I genuinely, embarrassingly thought that Chernobyl was his first work. Feel free to laugh. \n\nThe most important thing I learned of all though? All it takes to get me to watch a movie is the title. So many watched on the back of that alone, and not all them worth it:\n**All The Old Knives, A Most Violent Year, The Devil All The Time, The Pale Blue Eye, A Cure For Wellness, The World To Come, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Kill Your Darlings, Our Kind Of Traitor**, etc, etc.\n\nSo that's it. A year of movies completed, and I'm kind of proud of it. If there's any movies I've gone through that anyone wants to hear my thoughts on, by all means ask. Or any other questions or remarks. To cut off one: Will I do the same in 2025? God no! I do want to try and keep up on watching things a bit more than previous years, but I think I'll focus mostly on getting older films out of the way(I've only seen one Hitchcock film, for example), and rewatching stuff I've been meaning to for ages. Also probably Nosferatu. If I'm about to obsess on anything for the new year, it's looking like indie games are the culprit after everything I spent in the Steam sales...",

This movie is like \u201cInherent Vice\u201d.  Both have Joaquin Phoenix tripping out and both juxtapose reality and hallucination.  I found it easier to separate the two in \u201cInherent Vice\u201d.  The noise complaint notes left in Beau\u2019s apartment were probably a hallucination.  As far as plot goes, did Grace and Roger\u2019s daughter really commit suicide by drinking paint?  The theater group commune was probably real but his placement in the plot was false.  Did Beau kill his mom or did she die from a falling chandelier?  I think the latter.  Was the end a hallucination or judgment in the afterlife?  Ari Aster sure makes some dark disturbing stuff.  I thought \u201cMidsommar\u201d took the cake until I watched this one.  ",

        "title": "Top 25 Most Anticipated Movies of 2025",
        "content": "To celebrate a big year ahead of us, I\u2019m going to rank the 25 movies I\u2019m most looking forward to in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 2025.  \n  \nJust don\u2019t expect any Marvel or DC movies on here. I\u2019ll try to keep it short and sweet, but I do have a few honorable mentions that have me intrigued:  \n  \n\u2022 DreamWorks Animation\u2019s DOG MAN, which is the spin-off of CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS with an even weirder premise yet an interesting voice cast and style. ---- January 31  \n  \n\u2022 A comedy currently referred to as UNTITLED TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE FILM. I am a big SOUTH PARK fan and I find it interesting that the creators are making a new movie with Kendrick Lamar of all people, but there\u2019s no title or premise announced yet. ---- July 4  \n  \n\u2022 THE BATTLE OF BAKTAN CROSS from Paul Thomas Anderson, who I\u2019m not a big fan of, but his new movie is a crime drama thriller with an Oscar-worthy cast and it\u2019s his first film in IMAX. Still, what is it about? ---- August 8  \n  \n\u2022 Streaming movies that don\u2019t have a release date yet no matter how exciting they are like Guy Ritchie\u2019s star-studded fantasy FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH on Apple TV+ and Guillermo del Toro\u2019s FRANKENSTEIN on Netflix. I mean, we currently don\u2019t know if they\u2019re premiering this year or the next.  \n  \nNote that release dates are always subject to change and there could be surprise movies announced later in the year. Like remember last year when MOANA 2 was announced nine months before release? That was crazy and we might have something like this again. You never know.  \n  \nAs of now, these are my 25 most anticipated movies of 2025.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n25. HAPPY GILMORE 2 ---- 2025  \n  \nThe original 1996 comedy classic is arguably Adam Sandler\u2019s best film, but I never expected this of all movies to have a sequel and it just seems very unnecessary. The Sandman himself returns with Virginia the love interest, Otto the caddy, Hal L. the sadistic caretaker, and of course\u2026 Shooter McGavin. What is exciting about this project is the surprise teaser trailer we got on Christmas morning and the huge amount of cameos joining the main cast. So, why do I have it this low? The fact that I already mentioned how unneeded this sequel is especially after so long, the fact that this sequel is streaming on Netflix instead of coming to theatres from Universal like the original, the fear that this could have too many cameos like ZOOLANDER 2 which hurt that unnecessary sequel, and there\u2019s currently no release date. Well, at least we got a cool teaser and a confirmation that it\u2019s coming this year. I\u2019m guessing the summer in time for golf season, but we\u2019ll see. I just hope it\u2019s at least good.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n24. LOVE HURTS ---- February 7  \n  \nAn action comedy starring Oscar winners Ke Huy Quan and Ariana DeBose might be enough to get butts in seats. I would still wait for the reviews, but the trailer has me intrigued. Quan is a successful realtor whose past as a violent hitman comes back to haunt him when DeBose as his former partner warns him that his gangster brother played by Daniel Wu is hunting him down. This looks like another action-packed good time from 87North.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n23. WOLF MAN ---- January 17  \n  \nMy first big movie of the year ought to be downright terrifying. After the collaboration between Leigh Whannell and Blumhouse on THE INVISIBLE MAN resulted in Universal\u2019s most successful reboot of their classic monsters a few weeks before the pandemic lockdowns began, they hope to recreate the same spooky magic with a modern take of THE WOLF MAN. What was supposed to be a Ryan Gosling project after a successful pitch, the movie stars Christopher Abbott as a father whose arm is clawed by a werewolf and begins to transform into something horrifying. Julia Garner plays his wife and the mother of their scared daughter. Even though Whannell mentioned using body horror movies like David Cronenberg\u2019s THE FLY as inspiration, which are always a big no for me, I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not too graphic. I will hopefully see this in IMAX and it\u2019s good to know that Gosling is still producing.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n22. THE BAD GUYS 2 ---- August 1  \n  \nDreamWorks Animation\u2019s newest franchise brings back The Bad Guys as they struggle to find trust and acceptance as The Good Guys, only to be forced to do \u201cone last job\u201d by an all-female squad of criminals called The Bad Girls. The first movie based on the book series by Aaron Blabey was a good time and it looks like the sequel will take the zany action and comedy even further.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n21. MERCY ---- August 15  \n  \nAmazon MGM Studios\u2019 sci-thriller filmed for IMAX sees Chris Pratt as a detective having to prove his innocence after being accused of a crime. There\u2019s no trailer yet, but it kinda sounds like a futuristic version of Harrison Ford\u2019s THE FUGITIVE. It\u2019s directed by Timur Bekmambetov and co-stars Rebecca Ferguson and Annabelle Wallis.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n20. THE RUNNING MAN ---- November 7  \n  \nSet to be a proper adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s dystopian novel, this will be nothing like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie of the 80s. Like the book, the new movie from Edgar Wright will focus on Ben Richards, a father who becomes a contestant on a deadly game show to win a billion dollars to save his terminally ill daughter. Contestants are chased around the world by murderous people known as Hunters and whoever survives for 30 days will take home the grand prize. Glen Powell will play Ben Richards and it features quite the supporting cast with Katy O\u2019Brian, Josh Brolin, Lee Pace, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, and William H. Macy. Now I don\u2019t know if this movie will take place in 2025 like the book because the year we\u2019re about to go into is literally 2025. And yes, I know the book ends tragically, but maybe if we\u2019re lucky, this new adaptation could have a better ending. I mean if THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION can be a movie better than the book, why not this? Let\u2019s hope for the best.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n19. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY\u2019S 2 ---- December 5  \n  \nFNAF has become quite a cultural phenomenon that garnered a huge fanbase. Despite negative reviews from critics, fans and those curious like me turned out to the first movie in droves. It\u2019s not the greatest horror movie or the best video game adaptation out there, but it was pretty entertaining. The sequel supposedly following the events of the second game will see Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard return as their characters. Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake are all coming back for round two with Toy Freddy teased in the new movie\u2019s teaser poster and Lillard\u2019s villainous character will return as Spring Bonnie shouting \u201cI always come back!\u201d. This next chapter promises to be bigger and scarier with higher stakes at hand, so let\u2019s go.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n18. A MINECRAFT MOVIE ---- April 4  \n  \nThis is a controversial take, but even as someone who doesn\u2019t play the MINECRAFT games, I am looking forward to this movie. Jack Black is the franchise\u2019s most well-known character Steve as he helps a group of people survive the Overworld. This epic and colorful comedy co-stars Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Matt Berry, Kate McKinnon, and Jemaine Clement. The first trailer was incredibly hated for it's CGI, character designs, and live-action nature while moments like a bleating pink sheep, a white llama, and Jack Black saying \"I... am Steve\" were ridiculed and became Internet memes. However, the second trailer and behind-the-scenes featurettes seemed to have earned a more positive response from viewers. I just hope this movie surprises everyone because I want to see this in IMAX.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n17. F1 ---- June 27  \n  \nWarner Bros. and Apple team up for a sports action drama featuring the Formula One World Championship. It\u2019s directed by Joseph Kosinski, produced by the great Jerry Bruckheimer, and filmed with IMAX cameras. Brad Pitt plays a retired Formula One driver contacted by a Formula One team owner and friend played by Javier Bardem and asks him to come out of retirement to mentor a rookie prodigy for the Apex Grand Prix team. It\u2019s going to eventually premiere on Apple TV+, but this must be seen in the best IMAX theatre you can find because the racing should be insane.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n16. THE AMATEUR ---- April 11  \n  \nBased on the novel by Robert Littell, this slick-looking thriller sees Freddie Mercury himself Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who loses his wife in a London terrorist attack. When his bosses will not act, he blackmails the agency into training him as a field operative to embark on a one-man mission to avenge his wife. Laurence Fishburne plays the man training him and asks the agency \u201cMaybe y\u2019all misjudged this individual?\u201d. This film looks badass!  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n15. MICKEY 17 ---- March 7  \n  \nBong Joon-ho won a ton of Oscars for writing, producing, and directing PARASITE. So, what\u2019s his next big project after that? A sci-fi black comedy with an edgy R rating. Robert Pattinson plays a guy named Mickey Barnes who is so desperate to leave Earth that he regretfully signs up to be an \u201cexpendable\u201d: a disposable employee where after one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of their memories intact. When one of his \u201cmultiples\u201d known as Mickey 17 unintentionally survives a human expedition to colonize an ice world, he will go toe-to-toe with Mickey 18. The trailer looks promising and it should be a fun time in IMAX.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n14. ANIMAL FRIENDS ---- October 10  \n  \nOkay, we don\u2019t have an official synopsis yet, but the idea here is that it\u2019s an R-rated live-action/animated road trip action comedy with an all-star cast. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s about talking animals on a road trip for some R-rated reason, but I\u2019m all in for it. The cast or voice cast has the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Jason Momoa, Vince Vaughn, Aubrey Plaza, Addison Rae, Dan Levy, Lil Rel Howery, and Ellie Bamber. I cannot wait to know more, but it\u2019s coming out on the same day as a more anticipated movie to discuss later.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n13. THE ELECTRIC STATE ---- March 14  \n  \nCurrently my most anticipated streaming release of the year, the new Netflix movie sees Anthony and Joe Russo direct an epic sci-fi adventure comedy-drama based on a hit graphic novel set in an alternate 1994 where humans and robots lived side-by-side until a war ended with the robots facing banishment. Millie Bobby Brown stars as an orphaned girl who traverses the American West to find her missing younger brother with the help of his robot and a drifter played by Chris Pratt. The cast for this one is insane as the live-action cast co-starring with Millie and Chris include Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci, Woody Norman, Martin Klebba, and Giancarlo Esposito. That\u2019s not even the end of it. The robots are all voiced by the likes of Jason Alexander, Woody Harrelson, Anthony Mackie, Brian Cox, Jenny Slate, Alan Tudyk, Billy Bob Thornton, Hank Azaria, Colman Domingo, Rob Gronkowski, and Billy Gardell. The craziest part of all this is that this movie was made on a budget of $320 million. Seriously? That much spent on a streaming movie? Why did Universal give the rights to Netflix? This should\u2019ve been in theatres, man. Okay, I might be getting a little carried away, but let\u2019s hope that wherever you\u2019re watching this on Netflix, it\u2019s a TV that\u2019s as big as a cinema screen because damn. This could get insane!  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n12. LILO &amp; STITCH ---- May 23  \n  \nThis needs no explanation other than that it\u2019s the live-action remake of Disney\u2019s animated hit film that made Stitch an icon. Chris Sanders will once again voice Stitch and the new iteration has Zach Galifianakis as the voice of Jumba, Billy Magnussen as the voice of Pleakley, Courtney B. Vance as Cobra Bubbles, and Hannah Waddingham as the voice of The Grand Councilwoman. Like many, I was weary of this getting the live-action treatment, but after seeing what Stitch would look like in live-action along with the news that the movie shifted from a planned Disney+ release to the big screen, I got more excited. I mean, Stitch looks good.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n11. ELIO ---- June 13  \n  \nPixar\u2019s newest original film was originally supposed to come out in March 2024, but had a big delay despite premiering the teaser trailer back in June 2023. Part of the delay was to the SAG-AFTRA strikes and a change in leadership on this and other projects at the studio. You can tell the serious changes made between the first and second trailers, but hopefully it\u2019s all worth it when the final product comes out. The premise remains the same as it focuses on a young boy named Elio who is beamed up into the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Once there, he is mistaken as the leader of Earth and things could get interesting. What makes this film more interesting is one of the directors saying he took inspiration from some classic horror movies, which sounds incredibly unusual and dark for Pixar, but these much-needed risks could help make this their best original film in a long time. As cool as this movie looks, I just wish the studio would give it a better release date as it\u2019s currently scheduled to compete with something more important that I\u2019ll talk about later on.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n10. SINNERS ---- April 18  \n  \nA stylish horror film shot with IMAX film cameras, this is a huge must see. Michael B. Jordan plays twin brothers Elijah and Elias who just want to start fresh in their hometown, only to discover a great evil welcoming them home. Basically, it\u2019s a vampire western and I\u2019m all for it. Combine that with the supporting cast of Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O\u2019Connell, Omar Benson Miller, Delroy Lindo, and Li Jun Li while also having Ryan Coogler in the director\u2019s chair and we are in for some serious movie magic. I\u2019m not kidding. That first trailer is epic. You keep dancing with the devil, one day he\u2019s going to follow you home.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n9. THE BRIDE! ---- September 26  \n  \nYet another horror film filmed for IMAX, this is a sci-fi musical monster movie drawing inspiration from the classic film BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and Mary Shelley\u2019s novel. Maggie Gyllenhaal wrote, directed, and co-produced this strange story set in 1930s Chicago where Frankenstein\u2019s monster asks Dr. Euphronius to help create a companion out of a murdered woman which leads to sparking romance, police interest, and radical social change. There\u2019s no trailer yet, but the premise and cast alone have me pumped. Jessie Buckley is the bride, Christian Bale is Frankenstein\u2019s monster, and the rest of the cast includes Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Peter Sarsgaard, Annette Bening, Julianne Hough, and Jake Gyllenhaal. This could be a treat.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n8. SNOW WHITE ---- March 21  \n  \nA lot of you are going to hate me for this, but I am really excited for Disney\u2019s newest live-action remake as it reimagines Walt Disney\u2019s very first feature film. I know it\u2019s a classic and there\u2019s a lot of defenders out there, but the trailers for this new movie look beautiful. Rachel Zegler is Snow White and Gal Gadot is The Evil Queen. I know there is a lot of controversy with these two, but I\u2019m not paying attention to any of that. Sure, the dwarves look a little uncanny, but they don\u2019t look that bad and they pay tribute to the original Disney classic. The visuals still look magnificent, the production design is breathtaking, and the first couple of times hearing the new power ballad \u201cWaiting on a Wish\u201d had me moved. The classic songs are still part of the story while two new songs written by Pasek and Paul including the one mentioned will be introduced. I really hope people will put their hate aside and give this a chance because it might just surprise you. It\u2019s directed by Marc Webb, co-written by Greta Gerwig, and produced by the producers of WICKED. I will say that while this movie will get an IMAX release, I don\u2019t know if I will be seeing it in such format because many people have been asking me to see this with them and they don\u2019t live near an IMAX theatre. We\u2019ll see.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n7. TRON: ARES ---- October 10  \n  \nWe\u2019re finally getting a third installment in Disney\u2019s cult classic sci-fi franchise. Whereas the original TRON premiered in 1982, we didn\u2019t get TRON: LEGACY until 2010, and now we can rest easy after yet another long wait between movies. In this standalone story, Jared Leto plays a highly sophisticated program named Ares who is sent from The Grid into the real world on a dangerous mission, which will mark mankind\u2019s first encounter with A.I. beings. Jeff Bridges will return as Kevin Flynn even though he supposedly died at the end of LEGACY and the movie is directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning who previously directed the last PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie, MALEFICENT: MISTRESS OF EVIL, and YOUNG WOMAN AND THE SEA all for Disney. So, this sci-fi epic should be in good hands. I just hope this gets the IMAX 3D treatment like LEGACY because the visual effects in that movie were mind-blowing and Nine Inch Nails is in charge of the music. Come on!   \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n6. ZOOTOPIA 2 ---- November 26  \n  \nA sequel to the Oscar-winning billion-dollar original hit arrives after almost a decade and will see Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde go undercover to crack a case involving a mysterious snake named Gary. It\u2019s easy to forget that reptiles were ignored in the first movie, but we will find out in the sequel that they apparently get a bad rep in this world. Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, and Shakira are all returning with Ke Huy Quan as Gary. It\u2019s important to note that if you stayed for the credits of MOANA 2, you will see Gary as a tapestry painting near the end.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n5. WICKED: FOR GOOD ---- November 21  \n  \nThis really needs no introduction as the first part of this two-part adaptation is such a smash hit. I don\u2019t know what to make of the new subtitle, but hopefully that means the \u201cPart I\u201d title from the first movie will be removed in the home video releases because now it\u2019ll just be awkward seeing it when rewatching it. Still, said movie is incredibly better than I expected it to be despite not being a big fan of the Broadway musical. Obviously, everyone will come to see how the story of Elphaba and Glinda ends and hopefully, it\u2019ll stick the landing. For now, let\u2019s just focus on how many Oscars the first movie will win.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n4. THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SEARCH FOR SQUAREPANTS ---- December 19  \n  \nWhere my fellow SpongeBob fans at? It has always been my favorite show even though most of the episodes after the first movie aren\u2019t good. There have been some good ones mind you, but we\u2019re still far from the Golden Age in my childhood yet I still watch the show whenever I get the chance and will always see a new movie on the big screen. This one will see SpongeBob travel to the depths of the ocean to face off against The Flying Dutchman. That sounds like a story from a typical SpongeBob episode, but this movie will have The Flying Dutchman voiced by the legendary Mark Hamill who might use his Joker voice for the role. I can\u2019t wait to see what it looks like, but I just wish Paramount will give it a different release date away from my most anticipated film of the year. I mean, let\u2019s be honest, a Flying Dutchman story is more suited for Halloween rather than Christmas anyway.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n3. JURASSIC WORLD: REBIRTH ---- July 2  \n  \nWe all thought the franchise would end with DOMINION, but now, we\u2019re getting a new standalone story and hopefully, a fresh start. The seventh movie in the JURASSIC franchise takes place five years after the previous film where the planet\u2019s ecology has become mostly inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those who are still alive live in remote equatorial regions with conditions similar to where they were formerly abundant. Scarlett Johansson is a covert operation expert hired to work with Mahershala Ali as a team leader and Jonathan Bailey as a paleontologist on a top-secret mission to obtain genetic material from the three largest creatures in the world\u2019s tropical biosphere, which contains the key to a drug that will miraculously save human lives. When the mission crosses paths with a stranded family, a shocking revelation that has been kept secret from the world for decades will be revealed. I know the last two JURASSIC WORLD movies are hated, but this is for the fans like me and I still think JURASSIC PARK III is the weakest compared to the aforementioned films. Maybe this new beginning could change everyone\u2019s views on the franchise, but either way, I am pumped.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n2. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON ---- June 13  \n  \nBelieve it or not, DreamWorks Animation is going the Disney route and remaking one of it\u2019s most beloved films into live-action. That sounds very concerning as the original animated film that kicked off a trilogy among other things premiered in 2010 with the final film released in 2019. That was six years ago. But there\u2019s six reasons for me to be excited: Dean DeBlois from the animated films is returning to write and direct, a talented young cast, Gerard Butler reprises his role as Stoick the Vast in live-action because no one else can be Stoick regardless of medium, Nick Frost is genius casting as live-action Gobber the Belch, the movie was filmed with the IMAX format in mind, and both the teaser trailer and \u201cfirst look\u201d video are all-around epic. It may tell the same story as the original, but it might also add something new to it and Toothless looks amazing. This is easily my most anticipated of the summer blockbuster season and I can\u2019t wait to see it in IMAX.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \n1. AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH ---- December 19  \n  \nThis is no surprise my most anticipated film of the coming year. The third chapter of James Cameron\u2019s AVATAR saga finally arrives three years after THE WAY OF WATER and we\u2019re getting two more movies in 2029 and 2031. We don\u2019t know what the story is about yet, but there are a few tidbits on what to expect. We will see a tribe of evil fire Na\u2019vi called \u201cThe Ash People\u201d, all of the good and bad characters will return, Jake and Neytiri will continue to mourn the loss of their oldest son Neteyam, new Na\u2019vi characters will be played by David Thewlis and Oona Chaplin, and the narrator of this film will be Jake and Neytiri\u2019s second son Lo\u2019ak. That should be interesting because he really emerged as a character where we all started to root for him more than any other character. That\u2019s because while Jake Sully is the protagonist of the first two movies, as you see in THE WAY OF WATER, he is just a bad father and his cruel treatment to Lo\u2019ak is Exhibit A. Whatever happens, expect me to be there on opening weekend in IMAX 3D. I would also like to dedicate this to producer Jon Landau who tragically died of cancer last summer just a few weeks before he would\u2019ve turned 64. Rest in peace, Jon.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nSo, what do you think?",
