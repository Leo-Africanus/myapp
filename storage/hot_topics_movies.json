        "content": "What\u2019s a movie that isn\u2019t all means good, but just could cut 20-30 mins out either with a couple senseless scenes or 30-60 seconds from a bunch of scenes. Of course long movies can be good, but it can also act as a roadblock. The first two that come to mind for me are Knocked Up and American Pie. Really I think comedies should never exceed 2 hours, you need stamina for a comedy. \n\nKnocked up (133 min) is by all means a good movie. It has a killer cast and tells a story that is engaging but when I catch it front to back, it is an arduous watch. It becomes a chore. It is one of those movies where there are 15 scenes to take a couple minutes out of. I am a big fan of apatow but cmon, bring us 90 min comedies! \n\nAmerican Pie is another one that some of the scenes just hang on just too long. It\u2019s obviously not a movie with a ton of substance but there\u2019s ten mins tha can come off of this a min or two at a time. ",

        "content": "With today being Steven\u2019s 79th birthday, this question was in my mind. He\u2019s my favorite director. He has such a vast filmography. It\u2019s hard to choose just one. \n\nBut what you would say if your personal favorite movie of his or his best movie?\n\nIt changes for me. But I think right now I would say Minority Report. It\u2019s really underrated and was ahead of its time. All the futurism and advance technology in there is fascinating. I love the fusion of action, sci-fi thriller, tech noir and the whodunit genres. \n\nMaking it a shortlist, I\u2019d go with:\n\nMy Top 5\n\n1. Minority Report\n\n2. Jaws\n\n3. Jurassic Park\n\n4. Saving Private Ryan \n\n5. Hook",

They are dipicting the same scene that Sinbad and Arnold do at the end. I have no idea how I didn\u2019t realize that  before\u2026 made me think of if there were any other movies like that. Does anyone know of any other movies like that OR did you not also realize that about the beginning scene in JATW??",

Whether it be because the story, choreography, or just the straight hype it had. \n\nOnes that come to mind are Hector vs Achilles(Troy), Voldemort vs Dumbledore, Bruce Lee vs Chuck Norris, Anakin vs Obi-Wan. \n\nMy personal favorite(not what I think is best) is Jake Tyler vs Ryan McCarthy from Never Back Down(2008) mostly for nostalgia and hype.",

        "title": "What acting performance felt deeper than the movie around it?",
        "content": "Sometimes an actor feels like they are playing a different film than everyone else. Not in a bad way, but in a way that adds depth the movie itself never fully reaches.\n\nFor me, Joaquin Phoenix in Joker felt like this. No matter how you feel about the movie, his performance felt fully formed. The body language, the silence, the slow breakdown all felt intentional. It felt like he understood the character at a level deeper than the script around him.\n\nAnother example is Adam Driver in Star Wars. Even when the story felt messy, his performance carried real conflict and emotion. It felt like he knew exactly who Kylo Ren was, even when the film did not.\n\nThese performances make me wonder how often actors carry a movie further than the direction or writing allows.\n\nWhich performance felt like the actor understood the film better than the movie itself did?\n\nThank you.",
