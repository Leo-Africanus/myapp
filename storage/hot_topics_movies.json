        "title": "V For Vendetta (2005) is more relevant now that when it was released",
        "content": "It's been nearly two decades since V for Vendetta (2005) hit theaters, and while it was powerful then, it feels downright prophetic now. The film (adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novel) depicts a world gripped by authoritarian rule, where fear and control are used to suppress dissent, manipulate the public, and eliminate those who don't fit a rigid, regime-approved mold. Sound familiar?\n\nOver the past several years, we've seen a troubling global shift toward far-right politics and fascist rhetoric. Governments are cracking down on dissent, scapegoating marginalized groups, and using mass surveillance and propaganda to consolidate power. In America, book bans are rising, protests are being criminalized, and political leaders openly flirt with authoritarianism while spinning their actions as \"preserving democracy.\" Meanwhile, corporations and media conglomerates control narratives just as tightly as the Norsefire regime did in V for Vendetta. The line between fiction and reality is thinner than ever.\n\nTo fans of the original graphic novel, and I am one\u2014yes, I know, the book did a lot of things better. Alan Moore\u2019s work was sharper in its critique of Thatcher-era Britain specifically, and the story had more complexity in certain areas. But that doesn\u2019t mean the film was bad. In fact, I\u2019d argue it made a few changes that I actually like (though I won\u2019t go into spoilers). The movie, despite its differences, still stands as a powerful and necessary story\u2014one that feels chillingly relevant today.\n\nAlso, Alan Moore hating adaptations of work is par for the course. He's entitled to that opinion as an artist, but the film stands on its own.\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t watched V for Vendetta in a while, I highly recommend revisiting it. It\u2019s no longer just a dystopian cautionary tale; it\u2019s a mirror reflecting where we might be headed if we\u2019re not careful. And remember! Ideas are bulletproof.",

        "content": "So I saw Blue Velvet for the first time last night and I was just blown away! For me, it was one of those movies that demanded to be seen again which I did today. I can\u2019t believe what I just watched and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see this earlier considering I\u2019ve seen (nearly) every film David Lynch has made.\n\nFor starters it\u2019s a good old-fashioned film next to anything that followed. It looks and feels like it\u2019s set in the \u201850s. It looks like Vertigo. It\u2019s a beautiful film. The set design. Just gorgeous to look at.\n\nBut it\u2019s the evil that lurks underneath that perfect suburban setting. That early shot of the black insects amongst the green grass says it all. The nasty little things that remain hidden are part of the beauty that we do see. They come hand-in-hand. Literally as we see by the end.\n\nI know a Frank Booth. I have a Frank Booth in my life. He\u2019s a tragic figure. He can\u2019t love but he wants to. But he can\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s loveable so anyone who shows him love he assumes is a liar. So he destroys. Mostly people through verbal or financial abuse. He won\u2019t accept nice gestures from people because he sees it as fake and insincere. Only nastiness is genuine. \n\n\nI read recently a question asked about Satan and why he rejects God knowing that to do so will ultimately bring upon himself his own destruction and it is a good question. The Bible calls it the Mystery of Iniquity. Nobody knows. That is the tragedy of Frank Booth types.\n\nSpeaking of mysteries, Julee Cruise\u2019s Mysteries of Love is so haunting perfectly encapsulating this bizarre mystery story. \n\n\n",

I remember seeing one \"reviewer\" talking about how there's \"no good remakes\" as you can see a poster for \"A Star is Born\" (2018) in the background and they weren't being ironic. There are other examples of how this type of content has really hampered movie going and watching. ",

That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/) (70):\n\n&gt;Wilson\u2019s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He\u2019s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark\u2019s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s motormouth), and Wilson\u2019s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie\u2019s when-you\u2019re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we\u2019re thinking, \u201cWasn\u2019t the earlier Captain America more\u2026super?\u201d\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/) (40):\n\n&gt;At 118 minutes, *Captain America: Brave New World* thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*, *The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford\u2019s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in that franchise\u2019s final installment.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (30):\n\n&gt;\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d was directed by Julius Onah (\u201cLuce\u201d), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the real problem is that we weren\u2019t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film\u2019s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fitting enough that \u201cBrave New World\u201d is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It\u2019s even more fitting that it\u2019s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers\u2019 shadow, but there\u2019s still no indication that the MCU ever will.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/) (40):\n\n&gt;While *Brave New World* is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits\u2019 teaser \u2014 you knew there would be one \u2014 feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might [once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something\u2019s coming, we\u2019re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (4/10):\n\n&gt;In trying to do so much all at once, *Captain America: Brave New World* forgets what made its title character a relatable fan-favorite. Instead, we get a narrative that is as convoluted as it is boring, visuals that are as unappealing as they are uninspired, and a Marvel movie that is as frustrating as it is forgettable. Had this been a random C-list Marvel hero, that would be forgivable, but for a character as revered as Captain America, it's a huge disappointment.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/12/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-harrison-ford-juggles-green-screens-red-fists-and-vanilla-plotting) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Brave it might be, but there\u2019s nothing all that \u201cnew\u201d about the world revealed in this latest tired and uninspired dollop of content from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nDirected by Julius Onah:\n\n&gt;Following the election of Thaddeus Ross as the president of the United States, Sam Wilson finds himself at the center of an international incident and must work to stop the true masterminds behind it.\n\nCast:\n\n* Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Captain America\n* Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres / Falcon\n* Shira Haas as Ruth Bat-Seraph\n* Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley\n* Xosha Roquemore as Leila Taylor\n* J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson as Copperhead\n* Giancarlo Esposito as Seth Voelker / Sidewinder\n* Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns / Leader\n* Harrison Ford as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross / Red Hulk",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xygf1gfbgzie1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88c98a3a3051eaf4c8468b90b091737eeede6098\n\nI have been wanting to talk about this for a long time.\n\nSo we know that Genndy Tartakovsky's next movie is *Fixed*. We also know that it was to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures with New Line Cinema on board, and that it was rated by the MPAA in September of 2023. We also know that on August 9, 2024, the film was dropped by WB as part of cost-cutting measures in Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nHowever, this film is also and mainly a film from Sony Pictures Animation. SPA got back the distribution rights, and the film was being shopped to other distributors.\n\nThe last update we got on *Fixed* was in late 2024. In an interview with Collider's Steve Weintraub, Tartakovsky said: \"We're looking for a distributor. It's not dead by any means. Sony has it and so they're looking for somebody to distribute it.\u00a0It's a kind of unicorn. It's a 2D animated, rated-R film, and so they're trying to find the right partner in a world where they don't even make rated-R comedies, live-action, for the most part. It's hard to find somebody to believe in this thing, but I feel like we're getting closer and closer. So, the status is it's not dead. It's not shelved. It's finding a partner to release it.\"\n\nWhen the news of WB dropping *Fixed* broke, Netflix was named as a contender for distributor, as they have distributed fellow Sony Pictures Animation films *The Mitchells vs. the Machines*, *Wish Dragon*, and *Vivo* (all 2021). Netflix also seems to have a positive relationship with Sony Pictures as a whole, as recent films from Sony's Columbia Pictures/Tristar Pictures/Screen Gems have gone to the streamer as part of a pay-1 window deal, the upcoming *K-Pop: Demon Hunters* (from SPA) is debuting as a Netflix original this year, and an animated Ghostbusters pic was greenlit at the streamer not long ago. In fact, a handful of SPE's movies went to Netflix: Columbia's *Fatherhood* (2021) 3000 Pictures' *Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover*, Tristar's *Matlida the Musical*, and Columbia's *The Man from Toronto* (all three 2022).\n\nHowever, the caveat I see with Netflix is that it passed on distributing last year's *Harold and the Purple Crayon*, so it's possible that Netflix would pass on *Fixed*.\n\nHowever, this whole release situation begs the question: why doesn't Sony Pictures just release it under themself? I mean, 1.) It is a film from its *own* animation studio, and 2.) Sony Pictures had no problems distributing 2016's *Sausage Party* (an R-rated animated film), let alone under Columbia. One could argue that *Fixed* is 2D, and 2D is seen as less viable than 3D. True, 2D movies are seen that way in the industry, but again, it's a film from Sony Pictures' *own* animation studio, unlike *Sausage Party*, 2016's *The Angry Birds Movie*, and last year's *The Garfield Movie*, all three which are not from SPA.\n\nWe've seen Sony Pictures take risks with the films they release, in an age where Hollywood is barely prioritizing anything new theatrically. From Sony Pictures, we saw both *No Hard Feelings* and *Anyone But You* (two R-rated comedies) do well in 2023, with both films labeled as \"saving the dying rom-com genre\".\n\nSo it shouldn't be hard for Sony Pictures to just release *Fixed* themselves. Besides it has a reason budget of $30 million, so all Columbia just has to do is push the marketing. But if Columbia has cold feet with *Fixed*, there's always Tristar. The recent films released by the Pegasus studio are reasonably budgeted, and despite misses this decade like 2020's *The Broken Hearts Gallery* (released at the height of the pandemic), 2022's *I Wanna Dance With Somebody*, *The Book of Clarence*, and *Here* (both last year), it has had hits this decade like *The Woman King* (their highest grossing film this decade), *Thanksgiving*, and recently *One of Them Days*.\n\nAll Sony Pictures has to do is release it themselves, and importantly, have faith in it. Last thing we need is for this to be the next *War of the Rohirrim*.\n\nAnyway, these are my thoughts on *Fixed*'s release schedule. We need to let those in charge know we want to see this movie.
