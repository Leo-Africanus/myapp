Especially when it comes t the characters. Dorothy isn't the only main character of the series, and the Wicked Witch isn't truly the main bady of Oz.\n\nI am really surprised that there hasn't been a successful TV show made from these books, let alone a movie **trilogy** (or to some extend, an MCU of the OZ) Like there are so many unique characters in the Oz world that a movie can be made from them.",

        "content": "Last night purchased \"Excalibur\" 1981.  I was 13 when I first saw it in 1981. I remember being riveted to it for some reason. Maybe it was the visuals, the music or the far away place feeling it gave me.\n\nBy the 90s, I had purchased it and VHS and watched it again. Seemed kind of over the top and slow, and confusing.\n\nFast forward 2025. I was sitting here on Thanksgiving even, and remembered a few scenes from it. \n\nStarted watching on Youtube.\n\nBOOM! 10 mins later, I'm purchasing it and starting it alone on my laptop with ear buds. \n\nSome things that stood out to me at 57 that I didn't get until now:\n\n1. Merlin - He's basically a non-human. Multiple times, referred to as such. As a kid, I thought he was just a wizard. He's a pagan. Would not have picked that up as a kid or even understood it. He's got some lines that are literally genius, and I'm not sure the movie would have worked without him.  \n2. Sex and Violence - Wow, didn't realize how sexual it was, almost homoerotic at times.   \n3. The use of light - Never remember noticing how they played with light and reflections to denote power and magic.\n\nThat got me thinking, what other movies could I go back and watch as an aging person from the 70s and 80s and totally see them different.\n\nStrangely enough, \"Falling Down\" just hits different the past few years.

        "content": "Idk if this kind of mistake/ post is allowed here but, in Volcano, near the end of the movie Tommy Lee Jones has to heroically sprint from his assumed safe place to watch the detonation to save his daughter and the little boy she is in charge of.  However, when TLJ sees the two children and runs over to them it shows that they are close enough for him to run to in just a few seconds. In the shot of him running to them we see the building *collapsing* directly behind him *right* where he was standing seconds before! He had to be standing in the danger zone just to see his daughter/ the boy.  ",

        "title": "I watched Hugo (2011) with my kids. Great movie, but an even better experience",
        "content": "The movie was very good. But the experience we had as a family watching it was incredible. \n\nMy 11yo kept quoting 'absolute cinema' to me, and\u00a0rather than just say \"You don't know Scorsese\" I decided we should watch the one kid oriented movie he's made. \n\nThe movie itself is a homage to early cinema. Which lead to us having so many great discussions. \"Is it true that when people first watched the movie about a train arriving at the station that they screamed?\" \"Wait, that rocket in the eye of the moon was from a real movie?\" (Yes kids, and that movie not only came out decades before the moon landing, but before the first aeroplane.) We talked about all the real life stunts Buster Keaton nearly killed himself for, we talked about silent film. We talked about physically cutting out frames as film film editing. \n\nAll those fun discussions arose from the plot of the movie. It sent their minds racing about how movies work in a way they've never thought about before.  \n\nThe search function on our Google TV occasionally stops working, so I had to navigate to the movie in the first place by playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon. OBAA (which was on the home screen) to Leo, to Marty, to Hugo.) \n\nMy eldest was shocked, he didn't understand how I got there so easily, so I got to explain to him what six degrees of separation is, and how to play it. I gave him a few easy ones to work out, using his favourite movies, (link FNAF to The Hunger Games, absolute layup) which was a fun way to introduce him to movie trivia. \n\nBut then I got to cap it off by telling him that I could link him personally to this movie within six steps. We live in regional Australia, so we don't have many Hollywood connections. But in 1947, an actress called Jean Simmons (not the one from Kiss) was touring Australia and wanted to see a sheep get sheared, went to a farm in the middle of nowhere, where my great grandfather was a shearer, there's a photo of them together while he's working a sheep. So the link is: Kids --&gt;Me --&gt; Bupar --&gt; Jean Simmons, --&gt;(through Howl's Moving Castle - they play old/young Sophie) --&gt; Emily Mortimer who is in Hugo. His mind was blown. \n\nOne other great movie moment was that my younger child, quiet morbidly, always asks if any of the actors have died since the movie came out. So we got to talk about exactly how cool Christopher Lee was.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, the movie was very fun. But the moments that sprung from it, and discussions we had together, were absolute cinema.

        "title": "Plot holes caused by adaptation changes",
        "content": "Adaptations inevitably make changes to the source material, either adding new elements or cutting out scenes or characters. Sometimes though, these changes create plot holes that weren't in the source material, either contradicting something that was already established, or omitting an explanation (which isn't necessarily a plot hole, but still very annoying).\n\nFor example, the Wizard of Oz infamously ends with Glinda the Good Witch telling Dorothy that she had the power to go back home all along with her Ruby Slippers. When asked why she didn't just say that from the start, she claims that Dorothy wouldn't have believed her, which is a rather questionable assertion. The original book has no such problem, there the Good Witch of the North and the Good Witch of the South are separate characters, the Good Witch of the North is the one that gave her the shoes, and Glinda the Good Witch of the South is the one to tell Dorothy how to go home at the end of the story.\n\nSo what other notable plot holes or weird leaps in logic weren't in the source material but were caused by adaptation changes?",
