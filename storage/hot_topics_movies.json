        "title": "'Nightbitch' (2024) with Amy Adams got pretty terrible reviews and we almost skipped it but are very glad we didn't. I cannot recommend it highly enough for current and recent toddler-parents.",
        "content": "9:30pm, our three-year-old daughter is finally down, and my wife and I decide to crash on the couch and watch TV for \"20 minutes\" before switching off our consciousness for a few hours and doing it all over again.  I was an indie film nerd in my former life and am slowly getting back into it after the mind void of the first two years of parenthood.  As it turns out, that 20-or-30-minutes before lights-out every night is the perfect time to start up a weird new film and determine whether or not it's worth sticking with.  If it's intriguing, that is the film of the week and we'll watch it in three segments over the next few evenings.  If it's not, no big loss.\n\nSomething about *Nightbitch* appealed to me, probably Amy Adams and the unique premise, but I knew that it had pretty terrible reviews (and not just from casual film viewers but from indie film nerds too -- generally not a good sign).  But I suggested it to my wife, thinking that it would probably be a stinker and that we'd give it 20 minutes and then never think of it again.\n\nWrong.  We kept our eyes pried open for an hour-and-a-half to see it through to the end.  We had no choice --we were in a state of enraptured catharsis.  We have been discussing the film whenever we have a free moment for the past three days.  This ridiculous film somehow opened up a little hidden vault of empathy that my wife and I didn't know that we had for each other.  Watching it together on the couch after a day of battle did more good than ten couples counseling sessions.  That was **us** up on the screen in so many ways, and we were seeing each other and ourselves in this detached and absurd way that just melted away all of our built-up defenses.  It also made us take notice of the ways in which our individual personal strengths had averted at least some of the struggles that the on-scene couple was going through.\n\nI understand why *Nightbitch* was not popular.  As a *film*, it's no *Casablanca* or anything, just a pretty standard indie dark comedy, sometimes a little on-the-nose or messy.  For someone who has never been through the...  experience...  of toddler-parenting, I can see how it would feel like 100 minutes of nausea-inducing psychological torture with a healthy side-serving of cringe.  But, if you're going through this, or went through it recently enough that your brain hasn't smoothed over the rough edges of your memories -- this film was made for you, made for us.  And for those of you, I know that you might be thinking, \"Why would I want to see that on the screen?  That's my every day.\"  Well, that's where the artistic aspect of it all comes in.  The film presents the struggle that we all know too well in absurd, darkly humorous ways that just might give you a fresh perspective on parenting and on yourself.  And I think anyone would go a little bit easier on themselves (and their partner, should they have one) after viewing *Nightbitch*.",

        "title": "The wife in Pursuit of Happiness is as almost completely justifiable",
        "content": "I grew up thinking the wife in Pursuit of Happiness was a bitch but as an adult, I completely understand her. \n\nThe movie tells us at the very beginning they were doing decently enough as a middle class/working class family *until* Chris invested their entire life savings into a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device whose concept and price tag would have been immediately bullshit to any sensible person. A man as intelligent as the movie sells Chris to be, would have to be extremely arrogant in order to pursue it. \n\nImagine you have a small child and your husband throws everything away on a delusional business idea. That alone alone would be justifiable enough for a divorce but to make matters worse, he refused to count his losses and get a real job to help support their family. She worked countless hours and seemed to do the brunt of the child care while he wasted all day and night trying to sell those machines. When he gives her last minute calls to tell her she\u2019ll have to pick up their son, he is almost sociopathic in his annoyance when she complains about how it effects her job or that she won\u2019t have any break. When she is finally at her wits end from the stress and desperation of their situation, he tells her that he wants to take a low paying internship to be a stockbroker. His wife and child were a breath away from starving on the streets while he jumps from one outlandish dream to the next. She was right to cut her losses at the moment. \n\nHer only failure was not fighting harder to keep custody of their son since she seemed to have slightly better financial stability and job security. She should not have let Christ guilt and bully her into believing their son was better off with him. Chris loved his son but a person who would selfishly allow their child to be homeless on the street so he could keep a low paying internship instead of getting a decent paying job has no right to keep custody of that child. Chris could have still been an active parent by visiting him instead of forcing his son to live that way. \n\nThe only reason why it\u2019s heartwarming is because he got the job in the end instead of he and his son being shanked one random night while living in public bathrooms. The reward doesn\u2019t justify the risk he took with his son\u2019s safety just so he could be a father. ",

        "title": "The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan, one of my favorite films",
        "content": "*The Village*\u00a0by M. Night Shyamalan is one of my all-time favorite films. It\u2019s a film I feel is highly underrated and doesn\u2019t get enough credit for its depth and complexity. For me, it\u2019s a cinematic gem that dives into the human psyche, exploring how fear shapes societies and personal identities in a way that few films dare to.\n\nAt the heart of The Village is its exploration of fear\u2014not just the fear of the unknown or the creatures in the woods, but fear as a tool of manipulation.\u00a0&gt;!The Elders intentionally cultivate this fear to control and limit the villagers\u2019 lives.!&lt;\u00a0Fear isn\u2019t just an emotional response to a threat; it\u2019s a driving force in the village, shaping everything from their beliefs to their behavior. What makes this film so powerful is how it shows fear as both a societal construct and a personal experience. The fear instilled in the villagers dictates their choices, confines them to the \u201csafe\u201d world they know, and even affects those who perpetuate the fear. This dynamic reinforces the chilling truth that the fear we\u2019re taught to embrace can sometimes be more damaging than the very threats it\u2019s meant to protect us from.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the film is Ivy, the blind protagonist. At first, her blindness might seem like a disadvantage, but as the story unfolds, it becomes a symbol of strength and resilience. Ivy represents the idea that even when we are \u201cblind\u201d to the truth, we still have the ability to overcome obstacles.\u00a0&gt;!In fact, her blindness becomes an asset, allowing her to see past the lies the village has been built on. She\u2019s able to question what others blindly accept as truth, and in doing so, becomes the hero of the story.!&lt;\n\nWhat really stands out to me is the way the film builds up the fear of the monsters. Throughout the movie, we, like Ivy and the rest of the villagers, are terrified of these creatures. The idea of the monsters becomes so much scarier than the monsters themselves. The fear is what\u2019s truly terrifying, not the actual beings.\u00a0&gt;!The Elders have carefully crafted this fear to maintain control, and the film does a great job of showing how fear can be more powerful than reality itself. When we finally see the \u201cmonsters\u201d for what they really are, it\u2019s a revelation\u2014not just for Ivy, but for the audience. It\u2019s in this moment that we see how much the villagers have been lied to, and it\u2019s a powerful shift in perspective.!&lt;\n\nThere\u2019s so much more I could touch on, but these are just a few of the key reasons I believe The Village is a masterpiece. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s layered with symbolism, thoughtful commentary, and emotional depth.\n\nA few other things I love:\n\n* The muted colors throughout the film, which create a sense of isolation, and the use of\u00a0&gt;!red!&lt;\u00a0as a symbol of danger and warning.\n* The haunting score, especially the violin solos that not only enhance the emotional weight of the story but also promote a sense of silence that mirrors the isolation of the village.\n* &gt;!The fact that even when the truth is revealed, the villagers continue living in this world of fear. It\u2019s a stark commentary on how difficult it can be to break free from a reality that has been ingrained in us, even when the truth is fully understood.!&lt;\n\nIf you haven\u2019t watched\u00a0*The Village*\u00a0in a while, I highly recommend giving it another chance. It\u2019s a film that challenges you to think deeply about the nature of fear, control, and how we shape our own perceptions of the world around us.\n\n(This is my first post, so I\u2019m not sure if I used too many spoiler bars. Even though the film is over 20 years old, I wanted to ensure this review doesn\u2019t spoil anything for those who haven\u2019t yet had the chance to experience it.)",

        "content": "Amidst the kaleidoscopic backdrop of the psychedelic 60s, a shadowy figure emerges, wielding a devilish charm and a penchant for chaos. Diabolik, the notorious thief, orchestrates a symphony of mayhem across a nameless European landscape, driven by a lust for wealth and a thirst for adrenaline. Alongside his seductive accomplice, they dance through a world of danger, their clandestine escapades fueled by a desire for thrills and riches. But as the stakes escalate and adversaries close in, Diabolik finds himself entangled in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, where every twist and turn could spell either triumph or downfall.\n\nStarring: John Phillip Law, Marisa Mell, Michel Piccoli\n\nDirected by: Mario Bava",

        "title": "Which disaster movie gives the best feeling of \"calm before the storm\"(yes this can include horror like Zombies, it just has to be large scale)?",
        "content": " One of my favorite aspects of these movies is the moments before the disasters. We, the audience, know what is coming. The characters don't. It's this feeling that something big is unfolding and none of these characters has any clue that the world around them is about to end. \n\n We are often times treated to snippets of news reports in the background, often ignored by the main characters. They're either too busy with work, or they just flip the channel as soon as the news anchor describes a big event or breaking news comes on.   \n   \n If it's more horror-oriented, you think about which one of these characters is gonna die a horrible death. You fear for the family, you fear for the world in the movie.\n\nThe other aspect of these moments is that you attribute them to your own reality and wonder \"What if this was our situation, our moment before disaster?\"\n\n  \n For me, It would be like War of The Worlds and the Dawn of The Dead remake. \n\n  \nWar of The Worlds because the whole calm feels foreboding. You're with this family and you're seeing signs on the news about what is unfolding. Everything seems mundane but the vibe is just knowing shit is gonna go down and this family has no clue.\n\nDawn of The Dead because it gives a feeling of impending doom. Considering the type of movie it is. Because the whole scenario is horrifying so you're watching a glimpse of life before it turns into a nightmare..\n\n  \nBonus mention would be Threads, because the scenario can be a potential reality for us all, and we all relate to watching the news about wars and escalation. Especially since the Russian invasion. So it's more horrifying because it is a more relatable sense of dread and uncertainty.",

        "content": "I love all the openings of Snyders films, each one is basically the highlight of their respective movie.\n\nSucker Punch has a great one, Sweet Dreams is played in the background in an awesome rendition as it sets the stage of how Babydoll ends up in the asylum.\n\nIt\u2019s overly dramatic, it\u2019s edgy, it\u2019s very 2010s, but I really like it, especially with the title card of the rain on the car window. Aesthetically the whole thing is perfect. I like this grungy shithole version of the 1940s we see in the main reality of this movie, and how it contrasts to the colorful extravagance we see later on",

        "content": "I was always under the impression that Sergio Leone invented this. But upon watching Alfred Hitchcock Presents (season 1 episode 3), I noticed they used that shot, in a scene where 2 men are pointing guns at each other. This was from 1955, about 10 years before Leone's man with no name trilogy. It may not look as close up as Leone's shots, but considering the aspect ratio, it is the same. If you crop off the top and bottom.\n\nSo my question is, when was this type of shot first used?",
