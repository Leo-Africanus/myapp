        "title": "Introducing the Fantasy Box Office Game: Two years ago I met a redditor who was running a Fantasy Box Office League game from an Excel spreadsheet and now it\u2019s a fully functional website. Get ready for the 2026 Box Office year with us!",
        "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

        "content": "I\u2019m rewatching Dark of the Moon and I forgot how much casual mass murder happens the whole time on screen. You really see it first with the Laserbeak blasting families in their home and pushing Ken Jeong out of a window. Then the car chase on the DC highway when they just start flattening cars left and right - there\u2019s a weird blood splatter effect when Transformers start transforming that feels odd because we know the robots don\u2019t bleed red. \n\nThen when Sentinel and the Decepticons take over Chicago, they just start vaporizing people on screen. When Sam and his buddies roll up, they\u2019re attacked and the incoming craft literally turns people into skeletons a l\u00e1 Sarah Connor\u2019s dream in Terminator 2. Sam definitely tries to blunt force trauma + electrocute Dylan on screen and Optimus does some gnarly mutilation to Megatron with a shotgun execution to Sentinel. \n\n\nIt\u2019s nice to see, because frankly for all the massive fights that happen in all the movies, they typically gloss over the fact that thousands of people are probably obliterated in these massive skyscraper destruction scenes (e.g. Shockwave).",

Your dad comes home from work with a random DVD he grabbed from a discount bin at the supermarket for like, 5 bucks. You pop it in, and instantly it becomes one of your favorites movies, you watch it 20, 30, 40 times through your whole childhood, then, poof, it slowly fades from your memory as DVDs go out of style and you grow up go to college and move out.\n\nYears later, you\u2019re scrolling through YouTube, and suddenly a trailer for that same movie pops up in your recommendations, and all those memories your ADHD brain somehow made you forget come rushing back.\n\nFor me, that happened today with two movies: Secondhand Lions (2003) and Little Nicky (2000).
