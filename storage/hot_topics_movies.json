        "content": "Hi Reddit. I'm Eric Lin. I directed ROSEMEAD, which stars Lucy Liu, Lawrence Shou, Orion Lee, Jennifer Lim, Madison Hu, and James Chen. It opens nationwide and in Canada this weekend 1/9.\n\nROSEMEAD is the first feature I've directed though I've shot many films as a cinematographer. Some of those films include HEARTS BEAT LOUD, THE SOUND OF SILENCE, I SMILE BACK, EQUITY, and THE EXPLODING GIRL.\n\n**ROSEMEAD's synopsis:**\n\nInspired by the harrowing true story, Lucy Liu transforms in a riveting, career-redefining performance as an ailing woman who takes drastic measures to protect her troubled teenage son (Lawrence Shou). As his dark obsessions grow and time runs out, she is forced to make impossible choices: how far will she go and what is she willing to sacrifice? Set against the simmering tensions of a Chinese American community, ROSEMEAD is a gripping portrait of a family pushed to the edge.\n\n**Watch the trailer here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD](https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD)\n\nIt's a story about the desperate need for connection and it's a film that was meant to be seen and shared with other people. Please check it out in theaters this weekend.\n\nI'll be back on Tuesday 1/13 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to chat.\n\nAsk me anything! Talk to you all on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Whenever a new Wuthering Heights movie is announced, the same conversation starts again about casting, accents, age, or whether Heathcliff will be brooding or angry this time. All of that matters, but there is a bigger problem that almost every version trips over.\n\nThey turn the story into a tragic romance.\n\nIn the book, the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is ugly, obsessive and destructive to everyone around them, including themselves. It is not soft nor tender. It is two people feeding each other\u2019s worst impulses for years. That discomfort is the point. The novel feels like a slow emotional disaster where no one learns in time and no one comes out clean.\n\nMost adaptations sands that down. They frame it as doomed love, add swelling music, give the characters prettier motives and suddenly the story becomes something easier to sit with. You get longing instead of cruelty. You get passion instead of damage. The result is watchable, but it is no longer the same story.\n\nThat choice is understandable. A straight adaptation of the book would be bleak, repetitive in its bitterness and hard to sell as a date-night movie. But once you remove that harsh core, Wuthering Heights turns into just another period drama with nice clothes and sad eyes.\n\nI am genuinely curious what this new version will do. A version that stays honest to the book would probably divide viewers and annoy a lot of people. A safer version will likely look good and be easy to market, but forgettable in the long run.\n\nEither way, it feels like this story keeps getting remade because filmmakers love the mood and the setting, but struggle to live with what the story is actually saying.",

        "content": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask or if discussions on old movies are allowed? (If not mods, I apologise and would be grateful for any suggestions as to a better sub) but I\u2019ve been rewatching this movie a lot lately and I\u2019m curious.\n\nI was born in \u201888 in north England which is when (I think, give or take a year) was when Big was set and filmed. My mum was a single parent then, before I was 2, surviving on disability benefits in a small north wales town with absolute sod all in it so certainly didn\u2019t benefit from the employment opportunities, transport, nightlife, status New York City does. I recently asked her, in the context of Baskin\u2019s pay (it\u2019s never said how often he gets paid) how far his wage would go, assuming it was weekly, when she was a single parent on benefits in 1988, and I assumed a weekly pay and rounded up Baskin\u2019s pay for the month to 4.3 weeks to get roughly $800/\u00a3800 per calendar month (which is how we get paid in the UK, usually).\n\nMy mum then told me that rent alone, for a one bedroomed, in disrepair flat in a poverty-stricken north wales desolate town was \u00a3299 a month alone.\n\nWhich got me thinking - how did Baskin survive on $187? Either he gets paid multiple times a week, taking his spoken wage to potentially double what we\u2019re told in the movie, or his wages don\u2019t make sense. Or I\u2019m ignorant (highly possible).\n\nSo, for those who were working age adults in 88, living in or near New York City, does Baskin\u2019s wage make sense or was it just a number they pulled out their arse?\n\nI know he was paying $17.50 a night for a room in the hotel which even by north Wales standards was cheap, and which alone comes to $122 a week or $526 a month, hence my confusion. Could you live off $55 a week after housing in New York of all places? Enough to even afford take out? (Luxury apartment he later upgraded to not included as I assume a hefty pay rise with his promotion in that).\n\nSo I\u2019m just curious if anyone can make the maths work for me or if it can be debunked as poetic licence.\n\nI know it\u2019s a very involved and somewhat silly question but the continuity geek in me really wants to know :)",

Given his acting, I didn\u2019t think he really recognized him but I\u2019m not too sure.",

See the movie only in theaters and IMAX February 13.\n\n&gt;Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive jewel thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose string of heists along the 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime, his path crosses that of a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads. Convinced he has found a pattern, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) is closing in, raising the stakes even higher. As the heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are faced with life-defining choices\u2013and the realization that there can be no turning back. \n\n&gt;Adapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter). Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte round out the cast. ",
