The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze.

They befriend a local journalist and with her help attempt to find the group behind a crime wave in New York City.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAdapted from the early \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics\u201d with characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the movie achieved the then-seemingly impossible feat of bringing its reptilian heroes to full live-action with a team of puppeteers and a voice cast led by Brian Tochi (Revenge of the Nerds, Police Academy 3: Back in Training) as Leonardo, Corey Feldman (Stand By Me, The Goonies) as Donatello, Josh Pais (The Station Agent, A Beautiful Mind), as Raphael, Robbie Rist (Balto, \u201cDoc McStuffins\u201d) as Michelangelo and Kevin Clash (\u201cSesame Street,\u201d Muppet Treasure Island) as Splinter, the Turtles' master.

I thought, \"This is a voice, this is a brain working in concert with voice, and this is someone who loves storytelling in cinema.\" You could just tell right on the page. So I was ecstatic to get to be any part in that film. And it just so happens the way he cast it, I would randomly text Tony Tost and be like, \"Hey, what about so-and-so for this or that?\" I do that with everything I act in, whether I produce or not. I'm always just giving ideas and trying to be helpful. And Tony knew exactly who he wanted for every role. And he was really dogged about knowing what he knew and sticking to his vision. And then when I saw the movie, I was like, \"Oh my God, he got great performances out of everyone.\" There's no weak link in the bunch. It's a film that is so dependent upon the writing and the actors, you know? We don't have any big budget-y stuff to throw at you. So it really had to work, and like I've been saying in all my press, I think it's the best movie I've ever been a part of. I really, really do.",

        "content": "**Freakier Friday**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/freakier_friday) 79% (61 Reviews)\n\n&gt;Freakier Friday doesn't reinvent the original's story so much as it swaps the formula around for a frothy good time, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan easily slipping back into roles that fit them like mixed-and-matched gloves.\n\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/freakier-friday/): 63 (27 Reviews)\n\n**Reviews**\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/freakier-friday-review-jamie-lee-curtis-lindsay-lohan-1236336468/):\n\n&gt;I think I would have preferred a shot-for-shot remake to this painfully stretched cash-grab.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/08/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-1236477451/):\n\n&gt;What worked once, twice, three times (and maybe four) still delivers on the premise, providing laughs, plenty of slapstick opps and genuine emotion thanks to a game cast still showing us what it is like to inhabit other bodies and live to tell about it.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-1236478106/):\n\n&gt;Freakier Friday scores as skewed Disney family fairy tale. It just doesn\u2019t score as rollicking Rube Goldberg personality-transplant comedy.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-leads-sequel-millennials-deserve-11784813) (A-):\n\n&gt;It's a heart-on-its-sleeve ode to strengthening and forging bonds, the power of deep and unconditional love, and the warmth and safety of one's chosen family, most especially when it's at its freakiest.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/freakier-friday-review-1235143006/) (B+):\n\n&gt;Curtis and Lohan\u2019s commitment naturally extends to some bouts of dizzying physical comedy.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/freakier-friday-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;With Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis in perfect form, Freakier Friday is a legacy sequel done right that will make you laugh and cheer equally.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s still sweet, it\u2019s still funny, it\u2019s still freaky, and it\u2019s still Friday. Thank God.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1931316/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis/) (8/10)\n\n&gt;When it comes down to it, \"Freakier Friday\" is lively, fun, charming, and just plain delightful.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-q6335qmhk?region=global) (4/5):\n\n&gt;In the end, I missed the storytelling honesty and the mother-daughter dynamics of the original. But only just.\n\n[Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/freakier-friday/freakier-friday-review-disney-lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-nisha-ganatra) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;All Freakier Friday really has to do to live up to the 2003 movie is be sweet and funny, and in that sense it succeeds.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/freakier-friday-review-hilarious-jamie-lee-curtis-steals-the-show/) (See This):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s no novel reinvention, but it\u2019s cute enough to at least partially overcome its strained and uneven structure and performances.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/05/freakier-friday-review-jamie-lee-curtis-freaky-friday-franchise-lindsay-lohan) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s Curtis who embodies the story\u2019s wacky spirit.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/freaky-friday-lindsay-lohan/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;The film is an Etch-a-Sketch wiped clean; unobjectionable fun, if a trifle anodyne.\n\n[The A.V. Club] (https://www.avclub.com/freakier-friday-review) (C):\n\n&gt;When this nearly two-hour movie enters its intentionally laughless final stretch, Freakier Friday feels more and more like the extended encore of a reunion concert\u2014not least because that\u2019s essentially where it takes place.\n\n[Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/freakier-friday-review-lindsay-lohan-b2802082.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Instead, the talent of tomorrow has to play second fiddle to a generation\u2019s inability to let go of the past. And that\u2019s something a quick body swap can\u2019t solve.\n\n---\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;22 years after Tess and Anna endured an identity crisis, Anna now has a daughter and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might strike twice.\n\n**Cast**:\n\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Tess Coleman\n* Lindsay Lohan as Anna Coleman\n* Julia Butters as Harper Coleman\n* Sophia Hammons as Lily Davies\n* Manny Jacinto as Eric Davies\n* Mark Harmon as Ryan\n* Chad Michael Murray as Jake\n* Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Ella\n* Rosalind Chao as Pei-Pei\n* Vanessa Bayer as Madame Jen\n* Christina Vidal Mitchell as Maddie\n* Haley Hudson as Peg\n* Ryan Malgarini as Harry Coleman\n* Lucille Soong as Pei-Pei's Mom\n* Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Elton Bates\n* Jordan E.
