        "content": "I absolutely love Speed Racer 2008 and I find it incredibly creative and unique. I still haven't seen anything truly like it since then. First off, wow is this movie visually unique, and in my opinion visually stunning. It looks like a moving comic book, a live action cartoon or anime. It doesn't just look like one either, everything is very heightened and stylistic, the way characters talk, the cinematography, and all the vibrant colors make it look and feel like a live action cartoon/anime. Another thing the action and racing scenes are crazy, you've got races on hot wheels meets wacky races meets fever dream race tracks, cars can defy the laws of physics and do so constantly, but it's so frenetic yet so smooth and fluid/slick looking. There's this one shot towards the end with speed slickly maneuvered down the track, and there's a split second close up of the 6 on the side of the car. Man, I love shit like that, it's badass and creative to me. Not to mention there is both car fu with cars literally bonking into each other and doing a car version of pro wrestling, there's actual kung fu as well, with full on martial arts scenes.\n\nDespite all the chaos, there is genuine sincerity and it has a heart, and even something to say. It has an anti mega corporation and corruption message, themes about standing up for what's right and what you believe in, and it owns that message. Another nice detail is the family genuinely cares about each other and helps each other through hard times, which I find kinda rare to see done so sincerely in a family movie like this. Also racer X is awesome, and like a batman and daredevil hybrid. Speed is awesome too and just a genuine good person, at least from what I remember. Finally, this movie is just fun man, it's energetic and has good vibes for me. Probably helped I saw it in theaters as a kid, so childhood memories and nostalgia kinda drive it, pun intended, but what do you guys think? Is it underrated? A cult classic? Rightfully rated? Let me know, I'm curious on differing opinions.",

        "title": "Kubo and the Two Strings \u2014 Beautiful Movie, But That Ending Didn\u2019t Sit Right With Me",
        "content": "I just finished watching Kubo and the Two Strings \u2014 and don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The animation, the music, the emotion, the mythology \u2014 it\u2019s one of the most visually and emotionally compelling animated films I\u2019ve seen.\n\nBut I need to be honest: the ending deeply bothered me.\n\nLet\u2019s be real here:\nThe Moon King is the root of all the tragedy in this story. He tried to steal Kubo\u2019s eyes, destroyed his own daughter for loving a mortal, manipulated his other daughters into becoming assassins, and was indirectly responsible for the death of Kubo\u2019s father and mother. He shattered his family. He burned everything.\n\nAnd in the end\u2026 he loses his memory. The villagers, unknowingly, lie to him \u2014 tell him he\u2019s always been kind, good, noble. They basically gaslight him into believing he\u2019s someone else entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, Kubo is alone. His parents are gone. His only family left is the man who ruined his entire life \u2014 and that man gets to live on, apparently innocent, surrounded by people who praise a version of him that never existed.\n\nForgiveness doesn\u2019t mean suppression.\nAnd kindness without justice is incomplete.\n\nI get what the film was trying to say \u2014 that violence didn\u2019t work, that maybe kindness could lead to healing. But kindness without memory? Without accountability? That\u2019s not healing \u2014 that\u2019s amnesia. That\u2019s ignorance.\n\nWhat bothered me most is that Kubo knows who the Moon King really was. He carries all that pain. But he\u2019s forced to just\u2026 let it go. There\u2019s no reckoning. No moment of justice. The very person who destroyed everything lives on with a clean slate, while those who were good and loving are gone forever.\n\nWhy is it that the only person who survives the story is the one who caused all the harm?\n\nAnd honestly, what if he starts to remember? What if, like Kubo\u2019s father, he begins to recall the past? There\u2019s no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t go back to being who he was. And even if he doesn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s not justice. That\u2019s a soft reset the story didn\u2019t earn.\n\nThis isn\u2019t me hating on the movie. I loved so much of it.\nBut the ending? It felt off. It felt like the wrong person got to live, and the right people didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not a satisfying ending. That\u2019s a morally confusing one.\n\nWould love to hear how others felt about this.\n",

        "content": "The actor was born 100 years ago \u2013 and his performances still induce hysteria today. Fans and collaborators like Michael Palin, Woody Allen and Lesley Anne-Down explain why\n\nAndrew Pulver\n\u2018He made me so happy I forgot about my spots\u2019\nMichael Palin\n\nAlong with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers lit up my teenage years. I knew that Connie Francis would never return my love, but Spike and Peter delivered something almost as good \u2013 and that was deep, satisfying and highly contagious laughter. Laughter that made me so happy I forgot about my spots.\n\nSpike was the imaginative genius who wrote The Goon Show but it was Sellers who brought me to tears with his gallery of unforgettable characters: Major Bloodnok, Bluebottle, Henry Crun, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne.\n\nHe was my hero long before I knew what he looked like. On my first day at Oxford university, I made a lifetime friendship founded on a mutual adoration of the album Songs for Swingin Sellers (with a pair of legs swinging from a branch on the cover). Sellers was not just a man of many voices, he was a gifted actor, and each voice came with a character. The more I heard him the more I wanted to be like him. He showed me there was something far more important than sport and girls and modern history class, and that was making people laugh.\n\n\u2018His funniness was just magically there\u2019\nWoody Allen\n\nAll I can say about Peter was that apart from all his character skills and voices and technical brilliance, he had a built-in funny quality and made you laugh the minute he appeared on screen. It\u2019s nothing you can learn and very few even successful comics have it. I\u2019m sure there was nothing he could do to produce it or understand it himself. It was just magically there, that funniness.\n\n\u2018I remember thinking: \u201cIs it\u00ad \u00adpossible to die from laughing?\u201d\u2019\nSanjeev Bhaskar\n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents and their friends would have these dinner parties, for want of a better term, where the children were all fed first and then shoved into a room with the telly. One night, a film called The Party came on the TV, the one where Sellers plays an Indian actor. I watched it and I remember thinking: \u201cIs it possible to die from laughing?\u201d Because I was laughing so much I was in pain.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial film now but I still love it, in the same way that I always defend It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum. We\u2019re living in a time where people strip things of context, and either celebrate or denigrate things. But for me his performance was so funny and it was so deftly done. Given its time, I don\u2019t find anything offensive about it. I think, crucially, he wasn\u2019t trying to be offensive. He had already played an Indian character in The Millionairess with Sophia Loren and that was why I suggested their song title, Goodness Gracious Me, for our sketch show, because it\u2019s reclaiming it. It sounds more grand than it really was, but we were trying to suggest a changing of the guard. But again, I wasn\u2019t offended as a child and I\u2019m not offended as an adult. I think it\u2019s of its time. You wouldn\u2019t do that now \u2013 you\u2019d find a good Asian actor to play the part \u2013 but I always had an affection for him.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s controversial now, but I still love it\u2019 \u2026 Peter Sellers in The Party.\n\u2018It\u2019s controversial now, but I still love it\u2019 \u2026 Peter Sellers in The Party. Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/Allstar\nI think of the 10 years after The Ladykillers (1955) as peak Sellers, until Dr Strangelove (1964) \u2013 a work of genius. That period includes the first two Pink Panther films, The Pink Panther (1963) and A Shot in the Dark (1964), which is, I think, my favourite Clouseau. His brilliance until then is to do with the precision of his performances in terms of character, of vocalising and comic timing. Maybe he was trying to prove himself \u2013 his Fred Kite in I\u2019m All Right Jack is a performance without ego. Then he suddenly became a global star, and I think that status meant he became less precise in his performances \u2013 until we get to Being There which was him back to his best: a really precise, detailed performance.\n\nThere is a lot that has been written and said about Sellers and what always stuck with me was that his big fear was if you stripped away his characters you wouldn\u2019t find anything there. Blake Edwards said he had the best working times ever with him \u2013 and the worst. So I think that he was obviously a complicated person but when you look at it in terms of sheer talent, he was blessed. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a better comic actor.\n\n\u2018I met him for dinner \u2013 it was like going to meet the queen\u2019\nLesley-Anne Down\n\nMy father, like the rest of the country, absolutely adored The Goon Show, and I grew up listening to it. When I did The Pink Panther Strikes Again in 1976, I was working with an icon \u2013 I mean, not even human, he was like a god. The first time I met him was in Munich. The publicist on the movie said Peter wants to have dinner with you, and I remember they were really tense about it. They said: don\u2019t do this, and don\u2019t say that, and, you know, just be a certain way. It was like going to meet the queen. It made me very tense as well, but within five minutes we just hit it off. Obviously I was a bit younger than he was, he was my dad\u2019s age, but we got on exceptionally well. And unlike any amount of men that I have worked with or come into contact with on both sides of the camera, he was a total gentleman for the entire shoot.\n\nAnd it was a very long shoot. Today it would have taken about three weeks, but because it was Peter it was 14 weeks. He\u2019d just be laughing and playing jokes and tricks all day long, sometimes we never actually got a shot completed. We hung out basically day and night for 14 weeks. The crew was huge. It must have cost a fortune but everyone was on board with it, it was like being at a comedy show. Everybody laughing, everybody having fun. I mean, it really was an amazing experience.\n\nSellers and Lesley-Anne Down in The Pink Panther Strikes Again.\nSellers and Lesley-Anne Down in The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Photograph: United Artists/Kobal/Shutterstock\nHe didn\u2019t sleep very much, he liked to stay up all night and end up in the clubs. He loved [vocal ensemble] The Manhattan Transfer, which at the time was a great sound. He smoked a bit of dope, too. I don\u2019t think Peter really liked himself particularly, but a lot of comedians are that way. They\u2019re depressed and they cover it up with laughter. He was always searching for happiness, and people didn\u2019t take tremendous care of themselves back then. Nobody said, I\u2019ve got to go to the gym or the treadmill; people just ate and drank what they wanted and did what they wanted.\n\nI knew there was a side of Peter that could be difficult or disruptive. I had been told about it, but I don\u2019t remember any of that. I think there was one day that Peter and Blake [Edwards] were sitting in their chairs on set, and they were a little bit tense and not talking to each other. I don\u2019t know what that was about, I wasn\u2019t privy to it. But that was the only time that I ever saw anything. I didn\u2019t see Peter being cross or upset or nasty or anything. I only saw his funny, jolly, kind side. We got on like a house on fire. He was a genius. Seriously, what a career.\n\n\u2018When he did films for directors that knew enough to give him freedom, the results were great\u2019\nChristopher Guest\n\nI met Peter Sellers once. The cast of Beyond the Fringe stayed with my family in New York, and I had the effrontery to ask Jonathan Miller if I could be his assistant. So I went to London and worked on his BBC film of Alice in Wonderland. We were doing some recording at Shepperton studios, and Sellers stopped by. It\u2019s hard to believe I did this, as I was 19, but I thought it was a good idea to start doing a voice that I thought he should hear. He didn\u2019t say anything: he just looked at me and nodded.\n\nI had seen everything he\u2019d done, heard most of what he\u2019d done; he was a very important person for me in the beginning of my career. I guess I fancied that I could do the same thing, like doing different voices. You see, I can do a voice, but Sellers was embedded in those characters, and that commitment made it very different. Obviously he was funny, but he did something that no one else was doing.\n\nSellers in Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick.\nSellers in Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick. Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy\nHis early films are fantastic, including the ones where he has smaller parts. Obviously the Kubrick stuff is surreal in many ways, he was given the freedom to do what he did. People just didn\u2019t work that way and when he did films for directors that knew enough to let him do that, the results were great. Blake Edwards is not a great comedy director but he was smart enough to let Sellers take off and do what he did.\n\nThis is a little embarrassing, but I remember when he had his first big heart attack in the 60s. I heard about it on the radio. I remember getting extremely upset and actually praying. I had never prayed in my life, and I haven\u2019t since. But I thought, please, to just whoever, I prayed that he would not die.\n\n\u2018If he was on, it would be like a raging bushfire\u2019\nGeoffrey Rush\n\nI remember seeing Tom Thumb when I was seven \u2013 a studio picture, but Sellers was still a Goon. At that stage, he hadn\u2019t decided to make a jump for film stardom. Because at the time, being a Goon was a privileged position. He had a 10-year contract, he and Spike were absurdists and were jazz guys. They put that into their comedy.\n\nWhen I played him [in 2004\u2019s The Life and Death of Peter Sellers], I researched the role for the picture, and I found a copy of almost every Sellers film that existed. You can see the sense of adventure that he had with the early films: Carlton-Browne of the FO, I\u2019m All Right Jack, The Mouse That Roared. I asked everyone if they\u2019d met him. My publicist in the US was a young man who once had to go around to his house and shift some furniture. He said Sellers was very brusque and had no truck with some nobody from some agency. I found that quite interesting. I also met Marty Baum at [talent agency] CAA who handled a lot of Sellers\u2019 contracts in the 70s. Marty said: a lot of people thought Sellers was complicated, a mess and whatever, but I only ever saw an erudite, very polite, very articulate, very intelligent gentleman opposite me at my desk. These are the some of the mosaic bits that we put together to make a biographical film.\n\nSellers, front centre, in I\u2019m All Right Jack.\nSellers, front centre, in I\u2019m All Right Jack. Photograph: Studiocanal Films Ltd/Alamy\nWe wanted to take on the complexity of egomania, super talent, genius. Sellers would have been around so many buzzy, brilliant actors in his career, but unlike him they all didn\u2019t know how to define themselves. People often asked me how I related to him; and I would say: I went in every day and every day in front of the mirror I played somebody else. I think there would be some psychic wear and tear from that. There was something in his personality that was very self-regarding but I would imagine he could have been absolutely hilarious to be with. If he was on, it would have been like a raging bushfire.\n\nAnd ultimately, when he gets to Being There (1979), that performance is as subtle as the greatest Chekhovian performance in a theatre. The thing I remember is his little round dark eyes being so childlike, his skin being so pink and papery from being hidden away from the world. I regard that as the work of a truly great performer.\n\n\u2018I heard The Goons and it was like a curtain had been drawn back\u2019\nMichael McKean\n\nWe had never heard of Peter Sellers in the US until a flurry in the early 60s. All of a sudden we had Tom Thumb, The Mouse That Roared, The Naked Truth, Two Way Stretch and I\u2019m All Right Jack, which I didn\u2019t quite understand because, at 12, I wasn\u2019t a union member. He was just a brilliant actor and, of course, in The Mouse That Roared he played three really distinct characters. I found the whole thing thrilling.\n\nAnd then I had a friend who said, \u201cHey, have you ever heard of The Goon Show?\u201d I think they were on WQXR and, my God, it was like a curtain had been drawn back. It was very well crafted anarchy and lunacy. And later he was so brilliant in Lolita and Dr Strangelove; there was a kind of an anarchic quality to what he was doing, but it was never out of control. It was being done by an artist, clearly, and not a clown. I was aware that a lot of the people who made me laugh or who thrilled me as actors were British; Alec Guinness, Stan Laurel and Boris Karloff. So anyway, I had my eyes wide open for good stuff, no matter who was purveying it.\n\nThe Goons \u2026 from left, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Sellers.\nThe Goons \u2026 from left, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Sellers. Photograph: Allstar\nI must have seen Dr Strangelove a dozen times and in one viewing I just concentrated on Sellers and watched the small work he was doing as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. What I love about his work is the little stuff. I didn\u2019t really hear about his private life until well afterwards. And still it is, to me, less interesting than his work. I remember reading Being There and then two years later seeing the film and I\u2019m thinking: he gets this character better than the writer Jerzy Kosinski did. Sellers took this character and made his simplicity so complicated. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about that performance. He was never a stick figure, and he was never just there for the comedy.\n\n\u2018I was knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent\u2019\nPaul Merton\n\nI was slightly too young for The Goons when they were being broadcast, so the biggest impact on me was the 50th anniversary Last Goon Show of All in 1972, which was released as an LP. I was so knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent, and I used to listen to the records and practice until I could do the same impressions. I just loved the sort of films Sellers was in, things like I\u2019m All Right Jack and The Wrong Arm of the Law, which is absolutely astonishing. So I became a bit of a Peter Sellers obsessive. My favourite film of his is one that\u2019s quite obscure, The Magic Christian, which is normally mentioned as \u201cother disappointments\u201d. But what other film has both Michael Aspel and Roman Polanski in it?\n\nThe thing about Sellers is that he made more bad films than any other major star. You can look at his career in simplistic terms as being before the heart attack and after. He had the good fortune to be living half an hour from the planet\u2019s best heart hospital in Los Angeles, otherwise we would have been talking about him in the same breath as someone like James Dean. Graham Stark, who knew Sellers longer than most people, said that after the heart attack, he became a completely different person.\n\nSellers, centre, with his son, Michael, left, and Ringo Starr, right, during filming of The Magic Christian in 1969.\nSellers, centre, with his son, Michael, left, and Ringo Starr, right, during filming of The Magic Christian in 1969. Photograph: AP\nThe string of films he made in Britain have all got merit, but things got awkward after he went to Hollywood. In the UK, he was a big fish in a small pond, and he could bend people to his will, but he couldn\u2019t do that in Hollywood. One of the reasons he never won an Oscar was that he just really upset people in the US. He was nominated for Dr Strangelove but he lost to Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady; what a kick in the teeth that must have been. He\u2019d made so many enemies in Hollywood at that point. He wasn\u2019t kissing anybody\u2019s arse.\n\nIn the past three years, I\u2019ve been watching his films in sequence, and Being There comes as like a great beacon of joy towards the end of a miserable run of movies. It shows that he hadn\u2019t lost his talent, he had just been in so many awful films. On Being There, he didn\u2019t have any arguments with anybody, he admired the director, Hal Ashby, there were no tantrums. It was clearly a film that he wanted to do and that one still stands up, particularly in the age of Trump, where somebody can be misunderstood as a potential presidential candidate.\n\n\u2018He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening\u2019\nDick Clement\n\nMy generation viewed listening to The Goon Show as a holy ritual. In school we imitated all the voices. Our parents could not understand our obsession, a generational thing. I worked only once with Peter on a forgettable movie: The Prisoner of Zenda. He played two parts, but I think he got bored. Blake Edwards, who directed him in The Pink Panther said that it was vital to capture him at the right moment, rather like the \u201cmagic hour\u201d that film crews call dawn or dusk.\n\nOn location in Vienna, Ian la Frenais and I quickly discovered that he was nostalgic about the old days. The Goons of course, but he liked to delve even further back to his time on the music hall circuit, long before fame. He thought ventriloquists, \u201cvents\u201d for short, were especially crazy. One called Jimmy Tattersall used several dummies in his act, and the climax involved a life-sized old lady operated by remote control, who appeared from the wings while he was singing My Old Dutch. On numerous occasions the old lady malfunctioned, took a savage left turn and ended in the orchestra pit. Peter loved that story.\n\nHe could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening, but there was never any doubt of his extraordinary talent.\n\n\u2018He was like a musician nailing every beat\u2019\nStephen Wight\n\nPeter Sellers was a chameleon, one I learned a lot about playing his role in the original stage production of The Ladykillers. These days we associate physical transformation with huge weight loss or gain. Getting ripped for a role so our performer can be an action hero. Sellers saw physical transformation beyond the \u201couter\u201d and embodied his choices with wondrous results. Some were subtle, some were extreme, but always believable and real. In The Pink Panther Strikes Again there is this wonderful taut and uptight nature to Clouseau which creates a tension and fragility that provides such a glorious platform from the comedy to spring from or break into.\n\nThe juxtaposition of his arrogant, savoir faire vocal performance paired with the chaotic and clownish physicality of character is amazing. His mastery of \u201cplaying it straight\u201d yet just on the edge of complete absurdism is nothing short of genius. The scene in which he arrives at the house to interrogate the staff is theatrical farce at its best captured on film. Sellers is like a dancer waltzing between characters and objects, like a musician nailing every beat and flowing with the rhythm of it all. The scene crackles with a sense of everyone on the verge of corpsing. He was funny as hell and made it look effortless. Sellers achieved something every actor strives for but thinks probably doesn\u2019t exist \u2026 perfection.\n\nA Peter Sellers season runs at the BFI Southbank, London, from 2-30 August, and Two Way Stretch and Heavens Above are released on 4 August on Blu-ray.",

        "title": "'Dark City' (1998) - The Matrix's weirder, more mysterious older brother",
        "content": "Dark City seems to have been somewhat forgotten in the wake of The Matrix's sheer cultural presence and overwhelming popularity. It's easy to see why they're compared so often - both feature a lost, directionless protagonist adrift in a seemingly mundane world that hides the \"real\" world, and deals with a narrative where said protagonist uncovers what lies behind the curtain. \n\nDark City really needs to be seen and experienced though, as aside from these superficial similarities, it's very much its own unique beast and not just a proto-Matrix. \n\nWhat really sets Dark City apart are two things - the visual design and narrative direction. This is an absolutely *incredible* looking movie. The set design, the use of lighting and shadows, and the general ambiance is almost tangible and creates a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere. There's an almost organic, gothic feel in its aesthetics. It really succeeds in making you feel as lost and directionless as John Murdoch. \n\nThe overall story is really compelling as well, and I love the way it goes from a mystery to a sci-fi thriller and damn near cosmic horror at the end when we realize the true nature of the City and the strangers. Alex Proyas wisely keeps the lore rather mysterious and hazy - we never really know who the Strangers truly are, and their objective of understanding human souls is rather nebulous. But it works, and it adds to the hazy, dream logic feel of the movie. \n\nI do have some issues with it though. The characters are fairly dull and one-dimensional - but I guess since they're literally a different person every night or so, it makes sense kind of lol. Still, it's hard to actually care what's happening to them. I also wasn't a big fan of either Rufus Sewell or Kiefer Sutherland's performances. Rufus Sewell felt very stiff and wooden, and Kiefer's performance was just really wacky. The action scenes also feel rather stilted and clumsy, with the final telekinetic battle being the worst culprit.\n\nWith that being said, this movie is worth watching simply because of the vibes, and acts as a moodier, stranger relative to The Matrix if you're into these kinds of narratives.",

Masahiro Matasuoko as Shinichi Ozaki is pretty cool, I guess. mma legend Don Frye also stars.\n\noverall, the blend of martial arts, ill tempered kaijus, and special effects couldn't save this film. \n\nthe story/premise was good. it just lacked the emotional content I expect from a Godzilla movie, especially one that's 50 yrs in the making.\n\nand I'm not alone. released in 2004, 12 yrs passed before the release of Shin Godzilla in 2016.\n\nGodzilla is more popular than James Bond. but for how much longer? did Godzilla: Final Wars predict it's own demise?\n\nby the numbers:\n\nacting: 8/10\nstory: 7/10\nkaijus featured: 10/10\naction sequences: -14/10\n\ntldr: I expect more from a Godzilla movie. more action. more suspense.  I want to see Godzilla get emotional. I want to cry with Godzilla. this movie fell short of that",

        "content": "Looking for fightscenes where a female protagonist fights hostiles in close quarter combat. \n\nTwo Rules:\n\n* Only real weapons (or weaponized objects)!\n* No defying Reality. At least not on the protagonist's side. That means: No Superpowers. No Mutations. No Magic. No reality defying Equipment and, I should really not have to point this out: Gravity is a law, not an option!\n\n\n\nMy personal hitlist that I hope to expand:\n\n* Kick Ass - Hitgirl versus a corridor full of henchmen.\n* Birds of Prey - Harley Quinn's brilliant Bat-Control while springing Cassandra. \n* Gunpowder Milkshake - Samantha versus the three Boneheads on the Bowling Alley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I HATE when the protagonist is pinned to the ground and being choked out and manages to grab a conveniently placed item like a rock, a knife, or a wine bottle opener and kill or knock out the assailant. It\u2019s my biggest movie pet peeve and instantly ruins the experience for me. Is there a name for this trope?\n\nEdit: I personally think this does not fall under deus ex machina because it\u2019s still somewhat realistic to use an improvised weapon in a fight but it\u2019s definitely similiar to deus ex machina and feels like lazy writing to me\n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s apparently called \u201dWithin arm\u2019s reach\u201d but I like the term \u201dconvenient cudgel\u201d invented by the comments better :)",

The only examples that I can remember are mentioned in the title, although there must be more. \n\nWhat was happening at the time in pop culture that led to so many movies of this type? I was a child at the time, so I just watched what I was given, but it was certainly a little weird.",

        "content": "I recently rewatched Casablanca, the 1942 classic, and I appreciated it even more this time around. It's a highly entertaining, humorous, and overtly anti-fascist film (so much so that, in today\u2019s political climate, it might even be labeled \u201cwoke\u201d). The characters go through compelling and complete arcs, and the ending is perfectly suited to the story. On a technical level, the lighting, sound, and cinematography are exceptional, especially for the time period. It\u2019s no coincidence that it is considered one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and rightfully so IMO. ",
