And from a strictly entertainment standpoint, you could write up a million different scripts that would put Private Ryan to shame.\n\nAlso, the few movies I have seen about Japanese in WW2 tend to portray them as noble warriors when in reality they were every bit as evil and diabolical as the Nazis, and committed some of the worst atrocities of the last hundred years.  \n\nTheir treatment of POWs was also probably the worst fates suffered during any US military war. They would literally mass execute captured soldiers and sailors, often by beheading....\n\nWhy is there no Inglorious Bastards Japanese version to date?",

        "content": "I was born way past the old days of action movies. I grew up on fast cuts and shaky cams before John Wick came to end them all. \n\nWhen I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger movies like Predator or Commando, where he is basically a machine dressed up to kill, I thought that is how every old action movie works. Explosions, cool one liners and fearless heroes. \n\nThis is why Die Hard and Lethal Weapon surprised me quite a bit. John McClane is not one of those indestructible heroes. He does not shoot with infinite ammunition. Yes, he does some pretty wild stuff, like jumping from rooftops, but there is also a side of him that makes him very interesting. A touch humanity that is caught when he talks to the police officer or his wife. I like that very much. \n\nThe same goes for Lethal Weapon. I thought this would be a buddy comedy series with more style than substance. But one of Mel Gibson's early scenes in the franchise revolves around him sticking a gun into his mouth during a night full of grief and suicidal thoughts. And the aging part of the team has a whole family to care for.\n\nNow yes, Lethal Weapon is a fun buddy cop comedy series. But the heroes have backgrounds, souls and feelings that are not left alone between explosions.\n\nThis is why those two movie franchises (I have only seen the first two Die Hards so far) surprised me with some unexpected depth.",

        "content": "The 90s especially liked using that storyline in kids sports movies, in no small part thanks to the success of \"The Mighty Ducks.\" But \"The Sandlot\" has none of that, as the whole point of the titular baseball field is that the gang of friends who use it have an endless game that they play themselves with no organization save their own. There is no championship to win, it's just kids having fun. And while there is the subplot with the snobby Little League team midway through the film, it's just one of several episodes in the film's storyline and the film gleefully subverts the \"championship game\" by having it be a completely one-sided affair where the gang crushes the Little Leaguers (in no small part due to Ham's trash talking behind the plate). It's another way \"The Sandlot\" is such an endearing classic. Championship games are not nearly as important as saving the Baby Ruth ball from the Beast.",

        "content": "Coming across many people commenting on Last Action Hero and even articles on the subject all agreeing that its \"failure\" was because it was \"ahead of its time\" and audiences just didn't get it at the time, I think I need to rant about this, without trying to antagonize anyone.\n\nFirst, a few examples of articles claiming it was \"ahead of its time\", usually because of its introduction of meta-humor and making fun at action movie tropes.\n\n[https://uproxx.com/movies/last-action-hero-2020-rewatch/](https://uproxx.com/movies/last-action-hero-2020-rewatch/)\n\n[https://gamerant.com/last-action-hero-arnold-schwarzenegger-meta-action-comedy-ahead-of-its-time/](https://gamerant.com/last-action-hero-arnold-schwarzenegger-meta-action-comedy-ahead-of-its-time/)\n\n[https://silverscreenanalysis.com/last-action-hero-1993-review/](https://silverscreenanalysis.com/last-action-hero-1993-review/)\n\n[https://filmstories.co.uk/features/last-action-hero-revisiting-arnold-schwarzeneggers-meta-action-thriller/](https://filmstories.co.uk/features/last-action-hero-revisiting-arnold-schwarzeneggers-meta-action-thriller/)\n\n[https://screenrant.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-last-action-hero-deserve-more-love/](https://screenrant.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-last-action-hero-deserve-more-love/)\n\nI think that suffices to prove I'm not just swinging at strawmen.\n\n# Meta humor and spoofs have been around since forever\n\nA lot of the arguments for the \"ahead of its time\" claim is that audiences weren't ready yet for meta-humor and mocking the tropes of existing genres. To echo Colonel Hunter Gathers from The Venture Bros: the day the first movie finished production in Hollywood, the first movie spoof started production to mock movie tropes established by the first movie. This even goes back further than movie-making, I've heard some Greek theater plays in Ancient Greece made fun of Greek theater tropes. Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream was built on meta-humor to make audiences laugh at the tropes of plays of the time.\n\nEven looking just at the 20 years prior to the Last Action Hero, we see a lot of comedies built on spoofing established genres:\n\n* Blazing Saddles, 1974, spoofed Westerns\n* Airplane, 1980, spoofed disaster movies\n* The Naked Gun, 1988, spoofed police drama/action movies\n* Hot Shots, 1991, spoofed military action movies\n\nI'm probably missing many here, this list is not exhaustive. So movie audiences were not unfamiliar with meta-humor or comedy at all, and many such movies had a lot of success.\n\n# The Action Movie genre LAH spoofed was not that old\n\nThere may not have been many movies that spoofed the specific action movie genre that Last Action Hero did before, but that's because it was really an 80s phenomenon that was really started and codified by the release of Commando and Rambo II, both in 1985, that set the tropes that became the genre. The unstoppable hero that shrugs off explosions and bullets, the focus on spectacle, fire fights and explosions, killing dozens of henchmen in every action scene, the one-liners, the paper-thin plot, the good guys always winning in the end, etc...\n\nSure there were elements of each in other movies (James Bond movies, for instance, which got their own spoofs way earlier), but the hyper-focus on mindless entertainment and spectacle was really established in the mid-80s. It then became a juggernaut of the late 80s, but by the early 90s, the juggernaut was tired and audiences were getting bored with it, with people craving something a bit more in addition to the action movie. The focus on action scenes remained, but to attract and keep people's attention, more needed to be done, whether it be drama, sci-fi... or comedy.\n\n# The Last Action Hero was perfectly on time\n\nFar from being ahead of its time, the Last Action Hero is accompanied by many movies released in the same time frame that all added meta-humor and poked fun at the same action movie genre. 1993, the year LAH was released, also saw the release of:\n\n* Hot Shots Part Deux, which was a direct spoof of Rambo II and like movies\n* Loaded Weapon 1, a direct spoof of Lethal Weapons\n* Demolition Man, another action movie by Stallone that tried to refresh the formula by being self-aware and poking fun at Action Movie tropes while offering its own take on it\n\nSo 1993 was actually a great year for any movie that tried to use meta-humor and poke fun at Action Movie tropes, and many movies actually did, some of them highly regarded today and viewed as major successes in their genre.\n\nIn fact, Schwarzenegger would hit big with True Lies in 1994, another action movie that included a bit of meta-humor and poked fun at its genre, though not as overtly as LAH.\n\nAnd yet, Last Action Hero flopped, didn't it? Why did it? Or rather...\n\n# Did Last Action Hero actually flop?\n\nPeople love denouncing blockbuster movies as flops, and when they do, they get tons of nomination for worst picture in events like the Razzies, because beating on the unpopular kid is a well-known pastime. But in many instances, these \"flops\" and \"bombs\" actually earn very respectable numbers. Take Waterworld, seen as a box office bomb even if it was the 10th highest grossing movie of 1995 and beat many movies that are seen as great successes.\n\nSo how did Last Action Hero actually do at the box office? Let's look only at the domestic American box office, it was the 23rd highest-grossing movie of the year and earned 50 million dollars. That's a respectable haul for 1993.\n\nIn comparison, the same year, Demolition Man did 58 million, Rookie of the Year did 52 million, Disney's the Three Musketeers did 48 million, The Nightmare Before Christmas did 50 million. All of these are considerate moderate to big box office successes, and certainly not flops.\n\nSo Last Action Hero actually did fine at the box office, what gave the impression it did worse than it did is that expectations were sky-high. Schwarzenegger was a huge star with Terminator 2 having done incredibly in 1991 and Arnold having no major release in 1992, people felt they were due for something big and special.\n\nThe budget for Last Action Hero was also massive. How massive? It was 20 million dollars higher than Jurassic Park's.\n\nThat massive.\n\nAnd worst of all, it was released one week after Jurassic Park hit and became a cultural phenomenon, every kid at the time only spoke of dinosaurs. I know, I lived through it. And then comes this movie that is marketed as an action movie when it's a movie that spends more time spoofing action movies than being one. Many good movies have suffered from not meeting expectations set by their marketing campaigns, see Drive for example, an excellent movie that suffered from being sold as nonstop action by its marketing team, which it certainly was not, attracting the wrong audience and repelling the correct one.\n\nStill, it did okay, not great, but okay, it did find its audience and a lot of people found it a fun movie. Sure, the critics gave it a mediocre reception, but that's not atypical for action movies of the kind spoofed by LAH. And quite frankly, as fun and entertaining as it is, did it really deserve to be one of the best movies of 1993? I think not, without giving anyone the background and the reputation of it, showing it to people and saying it was the 23rd highest grossing movie of 1993 would probably result in them saying \"eh, about right\", not \"THAT low?\" or \"THAT high?\".\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, did Last Action Hero flop because its mix of meta-humor and comedy with action was \"ahead of its time\" and misunderstood by 1993 audiences? Certainly not. 1993 audiences were just fine with meta-humor and got comedy just fine, thank you very much. People haven't gotten smarter since then, and though meta-humor has become more common, too common even, that's not because people didn't \"get it\". In fact, the movie didn't even do that badly and got decent interest from audiences that were getting a bit over the whole mindless action movie genre. It just didn't meet expectations set by its massive budget and its marketing campaign, and represented a huge step back for Arnold Schwarzenegger's career. But when you peak, you have only one way to go: down.\n\n  \nIt's not just Last Action Hero, there's a trend of people that tend to explain the relative underperformance of past movies as them simply having been \"ahead of their time\", as if past audiences were somehow less sophisticated or less able to understand or enjoy the movies made at the time. Though it may occasionally be the case, in most instances movies that are ACTUALLY ahead of their time do great. \n\nStar Wars was ahead of its time. \n\nJurassic Park was ahead of its time. \n\nThe Matrix was ahead of its time. \n\nTerminator 2 was ahead of its time. \n\nMovies that are ahead of their times usually do great. Movies that are and somehow fail or flop usually do so not because of an unsophisticated audience, but of poor marketing, unfortunate release timing or poor editing choices (looking at you, Blade Runner).",

I feel they nerfed her in this movie. I don't mind Bridgette Wilson, even if she was miscast (Sandra Hess looked more apt but Wilson was a better actress). And I hated that they rushed out her arc with Kano and then had her as a damsel in distress. \n\nTalisa Soto as Kitana was HORRIBLE and Christophe Lambert is just abysmal as Lord Raiden (but still miles better than whatever James Remar was doing in the sequel). \n\nI did enjoy Cary Hiroyuki Taka as Shang Tsung.

        "title": "Den of Thieves (2018) is basically Heat for meatheads - but a really fun movie nonetheless",
        "content": "Watched Den of Thieves, starring Gerard Butler, Pablo Schreiber and O'Shea Jackson Jr, recently on an international flight. This is basically Heat's baby brother, where Heat is the sophisticated, mature older brother and Den of Thieves is the loud, brash, and dumb younger sibling. For DoT ostensibly is almost a greatest hits cover of Heat - a group of bank robbers ripping off joints in LA, and a band of cops gunning for them. But whereas Heat was more concerned with the innate complexities of the process, method and consequence of playing cops and robbers, DoT harbours no such lofty pretensions - it's more visceral and in your face, and more concerned with slick, in-the-moment action. \n\nThat's really both the movie's strengths and weakness. Cause there really isn't much going on narratively speaking - there are some bank robber dudes, they are macho, tough and badass. There are some mildly corrupt cops, who are also macho, tough and badass. These two badass squads face off against each other a few times, and some people die. And that's about it. There's not much in the way of character development or thematic depth. The writing is very often corny and melodramatic. There's nothing particularly surprising about anything that happens.\n\nWith that being said - this is still a pretty damn entertaining movie. The action set pieces are well-directed and choreographed, with a good sense of space and geography. The climactic shootout is especially intense (even though parts of it stretches belief a bit too much). It's generally pretty well-paced too. \n\nThe performances are a big selling point as well. Gerard Butler is absolutely delightful as a greasy, douchey pillar of toxic masculinity. He really commits here (but when does he not?) and chews the scenery like no one's business. The guy may end up in a lot of stinkers, but you can never say he doesn't give it his all.\n\nPablo Schreiber is pretty damn good too, and really brings a lot of color to a character that could've been boring and one-note otherwise. The dude just has some insane screen presence. Both 50 Cent and Baby Ice Cube were solid as well. \n\nSo yeah all in all Den of Thieves is a solid heist thriller. Just know what to expect going in and you may be pleasantly surprised.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m sorry, this might be a bit of a strange question. Is Nicolas Cage a genius actor?! Over a decade ago, I remember watching one of his movies with some friends, a few mins in, we all laughed at how awful his acting was, and I think I\u2019ve skipped nearly every movie of his since. It certainly didn\u2019t help that everyone I know feels the same.  I just finished watching the unbearable weight of massive talent and it just felt\u2026 brilliant.  Was it supposed to be?? Is this a whole genre of acting or is this his thing? Are all his movies like this? Gonna be honest, I\u2019m a lil high right now, so don\u2019t laugh at me if I\u2019m reading too much into this. \n\n\nEdit 1:  I\u2019m watching another one ya\u2019ll. I\u2019m sorry maybe I really am higher than I thought, coz is this man MAKING A MOVIE OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE? why do I get this impression? It would be insanely genius, yet even in the real world, there is this theme of life inspiring art and art inspiring life. And this strangely powerful play on chaos and sanity? \n\nAm I going crazy or what \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\n\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s doing it on purpose now. There is so much depth here\u2026 why have people been lying about this man for so long? Why? \n\n\nEdit 3: Why do I feel like his entire life as we watch it unfold is the real movie, and the movies he plays are a part of the main plot. ",

        "title": "'Nightbitch' (2024) with Amy Adams got pretty terrible reviews and we almost skipped it but are very glad we didn't. I cannot recommend it highly enough for current and recent toddler-parents.",
        "content": "9:30pm, our three-year-old daughter is finally down, and my wife and I decide to crash on the couch and watch TV for \"20 minutes\" before switching off our consciousness for a few hours and doing it all over again.  I was an indie film nerd in my former life and am slowly getting back into it after the mind void of the first two years of parenthood.  As it turns out, that 20-or-30-minutes before lights-out every night is the perfect time to start up a weird new film and determine whether or not it's worth sticking with.  If it's intriguing, that is the film of the week and we'll watch it in three segments over the next few evenings.  If it's not, no big loss.\n\nSomething about *Nightbitch* appealed to me, probably Amy Adams and the unique premise, but I knew that it had pretty terrible reviews (and not just from casual film viewers but from indie film nerds too -- generally not a good sign).  But I suggested it to my wife, thinking that it would probably be a stinker and that we'd give it 20 minutes and then never think of it again.\n\nWrong.  We kept our eyes pried open for an hour-and-a-half to see it through to the end.  We had no choice --we were in a state of enraptured catharsis.  We have been discussing the film whenever we have a free moment for the past three days.  This ridiculous film somehow opened up a little hidden vault of empathy that my wife and I didn't know that we had for each other.  Watching it together on the couch after a day of battle did more good than ten couples counseling sessions.  That was **us** up on the screen in so many ways, and we were seeing each other and ourselves in this detached and absurd way that just melted away all of our built-up defenses.  It also made us take notice of the ways in which our individual personal strengths had averted at least some of the struggles that the on-scene couple was going through.\n\nI understand why *Nightbitch* was not popular.  As a *film*, it's no *Casablanca* or anything, just a pretty standard indie dark comedy, sometimes a little on-the-nose or messy.  For someone who has never been through the...  experience...  of toddler-parenting, I can see how it would feel like 100 minutes of nausea-inducing psychological torture with a healthy side-serving of cringe.  But, if you're going through this, or went through it recently enough that your brain hasn't smoothed over the rough edges of your memories -- this film was made for you, made for us.  And for those of you, I know that you might be thinking, \"Why would I want to see that on the screen?  That's my every day.\"  Well, that's where the artistic aspect of it all comes in.  The film presents the struggle that we all know too well in absurd, darkly humorous ways that just might give you a fresh perspective on parenting and on yourself.  And I think anyone would go a little bit easier on themselves (and their partner, should they have one) after viewing *Nightbitch*.",

This isn't just some movie night either, I elected to not mention that our anniversary was coming up, and for someone who does so much for me? A themed movie night is really the least I can do for someone who bends over backwards to make sure I'm happy and healthy. \nI get that not everyone will understand, but I'd like to show my appreciation for the man I intend to one day marry, one day start a family with. Granted, I may not understand fully his interests or hobbies, but I'm not going to put him down for liking things I don't. Life is short, and if I can make special memories with him, on top of the day to day ones? Then I'm going to do it.\n\nTo those giving sound advice and making me laugh, you're amazing. I truly appreciate all of your input and the jokes going along with your comments. Thank you.",

        "content": "Did you know that this film is connected to Tokyo Gore Police (2008) in concept? Privatized police and super criminals known as \"Engineers\" being the two main concepts the two films share. With that being said Anatomia Extinction (1995) being directed and written by Yoshihiro Nishimura is another connection it has to Tokyo Gore Police (2008) on top of the previously mentioned concepts that they share. \n\nAnatomia had drawn inspiration from Shinya Tsukamoto's iconic body-horror film Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989) which is apparent with the use of a salary man as a main character in this film rather than a hunter of these beings known as \"Engineers\".\n\n  \nWith the use of the concept of these bioengineers... super criminals that turn their injuries into grotesque weapons of grotesquery and mass murder, I've decided to dub this duo of films as the \"Engineer duology\".\n\nWith that being said however the films are largely different in terms of stylistics! however there is a scene in Anatomia Extinction (1995) that was remade in Tokyo Gore Police (2008)... with Tokyo Gore Police (2008) being largely based on Anatomia Extinction (1995) it could be considered the fully fleshed out version or more so vision of Anatomia! \n\n  \nI highly recommend this duology of films to horror fans! especially if you like David Cronenburg's The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986) and other films such as The Substance (2024). Especially if you've seen The Substance (2024) you should start watching things like Meatball Machine (2005) and the aforementioned \"Engineer Duology\"\n\n",
