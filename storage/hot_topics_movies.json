        "title": "Movies that were only made so that the studio could keep the rights to an IP",
        "content": "Licensed movies have been a thing for over a century, studios or producers make a contract with the owner of an IP to make a movie based on their property. As time went on, things got more complicated, especially since movies based on established IPs became more valuable. Sometimes, a studio would get the rights to a movie, but then not actually make the movie by the time the rights would revert back to the owner according to the contract. As such, sometimes a studio would make a rushed movie it otherwise wouldn't want to make just so that they can keep the rights, either so that they can make a better and more profitable movie later, so that they can then renegotiate or sell the rights to someone else, or just out of spite because they don't want another studio to get the rights.\n\nOne of the most infamous cases of this is with the Fantastic Four, it happened to it twice. In the 90s, Constantin Films made a rushed Fantastic Four movie just so that they could keep the rights, but never had any real intention of promoting it or even releasing it, because the contract only said the movie had to get made, not that that it had to be released. Over 20 years later, Fox would similarly make a bad Fantastic Four movie solely so that they could keep the rights and prevent Disney/Marvel Studios from using the property. Not that it mattered since a few years later Disney would simply buy Fox.\n\nA much older case is The Hobbit. A producer had the film rights to Tolkien's work, but couldn't get a proper movie made in time before the contract expired. As such, they made 12-minute \"animated\" film (actually just picture book drawings with minimal movement and narration) based on The Hobbit and showed it once in a small theatre in Manhattan, thus preserving the rights. Tolkien would have to pay him 100,000 dollars to get the rights back. It has to be [seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnVL1Y2src) to be believed.\n\nAnd then there's Dick Tracy. Ever since the 1990 film, Warren Beatty has kept the film rights to Dick Tracy. Every few years, he releases a short \"film\" or TV special that's basically just him dressed up as Dick Tracy talking in order to meet the minimum requirements to keeping the rights to the IP. He just doesn't want anyone else to have the rights as long as he lives it seems.\n\nSo what other movies were made solely so that someone could keep the rights to an IP longer?",

Those 3, three movies!, for weird corporate reasons apparently to due with Weinstein getting royalties from 2 movies but not 3 movies are an absolute mess. 2 movies would be ok if they're maybe under 2 hours each, the book has a clear break right in the middle with the dwarves getting captured by the elves and then Bilbo freeing them.\n\nBut still, I'd take a 3 hour and 20 minute actual adaptation of the book, and it's anti war message about greed and how what can sound like a grand adventure at the start can turn out to be sad. Give me the remake, not a damned Gollum movie!\n\nWhat movie remake would you take?",

She intends to stay in Arizona just long enough to make the money needed to head back out on the road, but her plans change when she begins to fall for a rancher named David (Kris Kristofferson). Really loved this movie wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese and it\u2019s one of his films that people don\u2019t talk about as much. Ellen Burstyn is wonderful in the role as Alice and it\u2019s one of lead her to winning an Oscar for Best Actress for the film. Kris Kristoffeson is good as David him and Ellen Burstyn had very likable chemistry. This film also lead to the series \u201cAlice\u201d. If you haven\u2019t seen the film definitely worth seeing.",
