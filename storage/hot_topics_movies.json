Spielberg's version of West Side Story.\nWell, I saw it and I liked it, despite having a 6.5 on Filmaffinity.\nThe pace is good, the script is quite acceptable, but the car chases are on another level. Lily James, by the way, looks gorgeous. I recommend it.\n\nHave you seen her? You like me? I would like to know your opinion.\nGreetings.",

Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.\n\n\"What's it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?\"\n\nThere\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties, that was rare.. anyways I just find it refreshing and think the movie has aged remarkably well!",

        "content": "Wow these movies are absolutely incredible, my biggest regret is not watching them earlier, 1 and part 2 are easily 10/10 masterpieces! Marlon Brando just wow \ud83d\udc4c the scene of him playing with his grandson before passing was pure magic. Al pacino is arguably top 3 of greatest actors of all time, the way he stays silent but completely shows the build of emotion/anger just purely through expressions and stares just had me hooked. I cant explain how incredible these movies are and also for being released in the early 70's they hold up very well. \n\nPart 1 10/10\n\nPart 2 10/10\n\nPart 3 8/10 (incredible and al pacino acting is masterclass) just some issues with pacing in my opinion. While being weaker than the OG 1,2 its still an amazing movie. \n\nDont be like me and please go watch ASAP!!!!",
