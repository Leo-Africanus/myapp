        "content": "#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K.

This was one of the few times I found myself just waiting for it to end\u2014not because it was bad, but because it was that bleak and overwhelming. The sheer hopelessness, the raw depiction of nuclear devastation, and the complete collapse of society make it one of the most unsettling films I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 I loved it. It\u2019s rare for a movie to hit that hard and leave me feeling awful for days afterward, but Threads absolutely nailed it. It\u2019s easily one of the most effective and terrifying pieces of media I\u2019ve ever sat through.\n\nAnyway, going to watch some uplifting movies this week, I need something positive to cleanse my palate. Feel free to suggest something.",

Which is why it's surprising when something completely unexpected happens in the movie, not because it's something actually unexpected, but because the trailers and marketing completely omitted it. Sometimes even entire characters will be mostly absent from the marketing but turn out to be more important than some celebrities in the film that got top billing. Often this isn't even intentional, the people in charge of marketing just prioritized other things.\n\nSo what plot points/characters were you surprised weren't spoiled by the trailers?",

        "content": "I'm 40 years old and checked it out this morning, the perfect movie for a lazy Sunday morning. I'm not sure why I avoided this one for so long. Right out of the gate, the opening hostage scene at the grocery store pulls you in with its serious 80's action movie vibes. Whereas a movie like Commando purposely hit you with funny one-liners, Stallone's sleepwalking expressions through this movie allows his one-liners to come across with a more serious intention. We learn absolutely nothing about Stallone's character other than the fact that he means business when taking out bad guys. And the main henchman in this flick, I swear was a bad guy in every other 80s and early 90s movie. At times, this movie reminded me of a horror version of Robocop. Looking it up, looks like it came out a year before Robo. There were some serious horror vibes in this movie, especially the hospital chase that reminded me of Halloween 2 with Michael Myers. Cherry on top is when Brigitte Nielsen's character asks Stallone's character what he will do next after getting through this ordeal, and he says something like, probably work on another case.",

Those crucial years she could have taken advantage of the fame and exposure didn't happen and when she did come back, she got a rhinoplasty which modified her face and made her unrecognizable. \n\nI watch \"Dirty Dancing\", a formulaic yet engrossing romantic dance drama, and as sexy and charismatic as Patrick Swayze is, it is Jennifer Grey who keeps it together. She's the main protagonist, she's playing the \"ugly duckling\" who blossoms as a dancer and sizzles with Swayze onscreen, their relationship going from tense and hostile into affection, admiration and love. Grey's Baby is easily identifiable, any girl (or boy) can connect with her character.\n\nThe more I watch Dirty Dancing, the more I like Jennifer Grey. You don't see many heroines like her on film today. Some of her lines are cheesy and corny but Grey commits to it. I couldn't dislike her. I kept wanting to know what she'd do next, her character's clumsiness made her endearing instead of unapproachable like Cynthia Rhodes' Penny.",

        "content": "Does anyone have any idea as to the current status of this project? Despite some social media activity from Vin Diesel back in August 2024 that indicated filming had begun, complete with a couple of set photos, there seems to be remarkably little information out there about this one.\n\nThere\u2019s very minimal crew information available out there across any area of the production, no cast has been announced beyond Diesel, and the general vibe I get is that it\u2019s either a very, very small independent production or that some sort of finance issue delayed the project after a short period of time.\n\nI\u2019d be curious to know if anyone has any thoughts?\n\n",

For me, Annie will always hold a special place in my heart. I watched it over and over again as a kid\u2014the songs, the characters, and the overall optimism still resonate with me today. It's one of those films that always brings back fond memories, no matter how many years pass.\n\nSo, I\u2019m curious: what movie from your childhood has stuck with you over the years? Maybe it\u2019s one that made you laugh, cry, or just gave you that warm feeling inside. I\u2019d love to hear about the movies that defined your childhood!",

I often watch The Raid and Dredd back to back as a double feature movie weekend.\n\nRambo (2008) - once Rambo enters action mode, the rest of the movie is just rip and tear.\n\nBorn to Fight (2004 - Thailand, by Panna Rittikrai of Ong Bak, and The Protector) - terrorists takes over a village, then the rest of the movie is the villagers fighting back, with one fantastic action scene after another.",

        "content": "I just watched Wrath of the Titans and remembered how damn generic a fantasy movie this was. Clash was a bit too, but Wrath took the piss with it. Nothing about this movie screams antiquity in the slightest. Bill Nighy was basically just Jetfire from Transformers 2. Villain is a big rock lava monster. The small monsters are **literally** the Chitauri? \n\nI finished the movie 20 minutes ago and I could not tell you what happens in the first third of it. \n\nIt\u2019s riddled with 2010s era action movie tropes. Hero saying \u201coh come on, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Dafuq. I don\u2019t need him to speak Ancient Greek but can Perseus please not sound like a Will Smith hero circa 2005? If Perseus had said \u201cI\u2019m putting together a crew for one last job\u201d it wouldn\u2019t have felt out of place for this movie. \n\nCan you guys think of some movies as generic as this? Like just one predictable trope or line after another, no soul to the story, interchangeable monsters, etc",

        "content": "Apparently I\u2019m like the only person who loved this movie. I watched it a few minutes ago, and I really enjoyed it. I know I really loved a movie, when it ends and I want to immediately watch more of it. I even loved the sort of trailer type thing they did at the end. The way they\u2019ve introduced us to all of these characters, is very compelling to me. \n\nI liked how they opened the movies and then jumped forward five years, and then told us through other ways that they were indeed in the same settlement as the surveyors at the start of the movie. \n\nI loved the caravan that was being led Luke Wilson\u2019s character, and dynamics that were covered there. \n\nI loved Kevin Costners character, the little we find out about him. Perhaps, if there was one aspect I\u2019d have liked to seen more of it wod have been more Kevin Costner. I can\u2019t think of one aspect that I didn\u2019t enjoy. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll say, is I kind of wish Kevin Costner made a series, instead of a movie, so we can be guaranteed to see all of it. I\u2019m worried we aren\u2019t going to be able to see the last two chapters, and I think he probably could have gotten a TV series done. \n\nAnyway, I am hoping to find some like minded people who also enjoyed the movie. The last thing I\u2019ll say is, I miss this style of movie. It kind of reminded me of the eighties and nineties style movies. I haven\u2019t seen a movie in a long time that I enjoyed so much. I did not expect that coming in, given what I had heard about the movie from critics. I was very pleasantly surprised. Here is hoping they are able to get the funding together for a third and fourth chapter. ",

Going through the whole filmography, rewatching films I'd seen many times, and some I'd never seen.\n\nI had never seen The King of Comedy before a few days ago. Now I've watched it like 5 times. I can't get enough!\n\nDeNiro and Jerry Lewis are pitch perfect. It's such an unsettling movie, and yet it really is hilarious throughout. Sandra Bernhard is transcendent!\n\nThe themes of obsession and the dark side of fame are so relevant today. Rupert's delusions, and often the inability to discern delusion from reality, make it such an eerie film, yet, like I said, I can't stop laughing.\n\nIt also defies all expectations. I really think he's going to kill Jerry, I'm convinced of it. I guess he might actually kill him, if what we see at the end is delusion, but we end without any confirmation, and it's perfect. If the end is reality, it's also bizarre, shocking, and yet plausible that someone could achieve fame and success in this way. I just love it.\n\nMy top five Scorsese pictures, with (1) being my favorite, are as follows:\n\n(5) Killers of the Flower Moon\n\n(4) The Wolf of Wall Street\n\n(3) Goodfellas\n\n(2) Taxi Driver\n\n(1) The King of Comedy\n\nMy favorites change almost daily, so keep that in mind before you come for me.",
