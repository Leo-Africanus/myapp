The fact that they were playing coy in who Cumberbatch was playing in the marketing didn\u2019t help, it just makes me feel like they picked someone the complete opposite of Montalban just so they could do an underwhelming \u201ctwist\u201d reveal.

This documentary is incredible. It weaves narrative threads that follow multiple characters, who are REAL teenage boys with their own ideas of how to play the game of politics, and it's fascinating seeing how they engage with one another on a human level but also as \"politicians\". In one scene they're joking around trying to pass a bill that relocates Prius drivers to another state, the next they're debating gun control and abortion. Running throughout this entire movie is this undercurrent of dread. You get an authentic, cringe-worthy, and sometimes unsettling close-up of the American youth Post-MAGA. The choice to set this in a red state like Texas really helps the movie investigate Gen Z's slow but steady shift to the far right. Highly recommend this gem. Really engrossing movie, frustrating at times but very insightful.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed something with a lot of people, especially friends. Right after a movie ends, they feel the need to immediately have an opinion. They\u2019ll say the acting was bad, or the pacing was off, or the script didn\u2019t make sense. Those can be valid points, but most of the time it just feels like they\u2019re grasping for something to say because not knowing what to think would make them feel dumb.\n\nBut that quick judgment cuts off something important. It makes it harder to engage with the movie from a subjective, open place. Some films take time. Some don\u2019t fully hit you until later. Some you don\u2019t understand until you\u2019ve changed a little. Rushing to define them too quickly flattens the whole experience.\n\nI try to give movies space, and honestly I end up enjoying a lot of them more because of that. But my friends tease me for it. They say I like everything or that I\u2019m trying too hard to find meaning. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. I just think if a bunch of people love a movie, even if I didn\u2019t connect with it right away, there\u2019s probably something there worth looking for.\n\nHas anyone else run into this?

It's a super-well done, well-shot, great soundtrack movie with history behind it from the 1900's. I was surprised in the direction it went in and it is by far my most favorite dog movie now, and the most depressing film I have seen as a dog owner.",

        "title": "A Very Deep Dive Into Asteroid City: Freud, Lacan, and a belated understanding of our grief",
        "content": "NOTE: I wrote this all in one go and it's so long I don't want to proofread it. Enjoy!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nInitially, upon first viewing, I (like most people) didn\u2019t fully understand *Asteroid City*, but *Asteroid City* doesn\u2019t really hide the fact that there\u2019s more than meets the eye. So I watched it again, and again, and again. I watched it approximately eight times, and probably 12 if you count the amount of times I went back to review certain scenes. I looked up some reviews, and discussions, and in my desperation I also did what I thought I would never do\u2026 I looked up an YouTube explanations. Ew.\n\nI did this but none of the insights I came across really sat well with me. So I read some academic journals involving Wes Anderson and came across one that talked about Freud, Lacan, Language, and The Royal Tenenbaums. As I read it I started connecting some dots and found a lot of it was very fitting to Asteroid City. So then I became obsessed with dot connecting.\n\nTo start, what struck me the most about *Asteroid City* is how my feelings of *Asteroid City* echoed Jason Schwartzman\u2019s character(s) in the film. Throughout, the actor playing Augie (both of whom are played by Jason Schwartzman) is always caught up with meaning.\n\n\u201cWhy does he burn his hand on the quickie-griddle?\u201d\n\n\u201cA metaphor for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand the play.\u201d\n\n**AFTERWARDSNESS**\n\nFreud wrote about a psychoanalytical concept called Afterwardsness in 1895 where he essentially states \u201ca memory is repressed which has only become a trauma after the event.\u201d *The event* here refers to a separate subsequent event after one\u2019s initial trauma. In simple terms, it is a mode of belated understanding of traumatic meaning to earlier events (kudos to Wikipedia.)\n\nLet\u2019s apply this to Augie. Early in the film we learn Augie loses his wife. We learn he\u2019s grieving, it took him 3-weeks after his wife\u2019s passing for him to tell his children. He\u2019s also pragmatic with his grief and doesn\u2019t move through it emotionally which can be seen as a coping mechanism. When Augie explains to his kids a time his mother tried to console him after his father passed away by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s in the stars now,\u201d Augie replies, \u201cHe\u2019s not in the stars, he\u2019s in the ground.\u201d\n\nFor Augie, things just are, and there\u2019s no point in dwelling. This is in stark contrast to the actor playing Augie. When the actor meets the writer of the play Conrad Earp (played by Edward Norton), he immediately asks, \u201cWhy does Augie burn his hand on the quickie-griddle?\u201d Conrad responds by saying he doesn\u2019t know and that\u2019s just how it came out when he wrote it. The actor then provides an explanation for himself to Conrad explaining that maybe \u201che wanted an explanation for why his heart was beating so fast.\u201d\n\nLacan explains that the unconscious mind is our true desires. Things that our conscious selves don\u2019t necessarily speak on. To put it simply, when you say, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d but you\u2019re hurting deep down, the unconscious is your hurt.\u00a0 Augie, not having told his children about the passing of their mother, is an example of his unconscious leaking through his conscious self. When asked why he has yet to inform his children of their mother\u2019s passing Augie tells his father-in-law Stanley Zak (played by Tom Hanks), \u201cThe time is never right.\u201d But as Stanley explains in his response, \u201cthe time is ALWAYS wrong.\u201d It\u2019s not that the time isn\u2019t right, its that the unconscious Augie is really displaying his inability to speak the truth, because speaking on it would anchor his loss into reality. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t tell his kids.\n\nThe actor playing Augie is symbolization for Augie\u2019s unconscious; Augie himself is a portrayal of the conscious Augie.\n\nSo back to Afterwardsness. Lacan says the belated understanding of traumatic meaning comes through a later experience or a signifier. So let\u2019s start putting pieces together. Augie\u2019s trauma leads his unconscious self to search for meaning within the play. The actor\u2019s search for meaning is the unconscious Augie asking, \u201cWhat is the meaning of life itself?\u201d Through his grief, he\u2019s left asking, \u201cWhat now? What is the purpose now?\u201d So then what is the triggering event for Augie that allows him to come to his belated understanding of his questions?\n\nThe alien encounter.\n\nBut how?\n\nFreud and Lacan don\u2019t say that the triggering event has to be related in any way to the initial trauma. An alien encounter is enough to make most people look inward and start questioning life itself, something Augie had already started doing. At this point I think Augie just hits his boiling point. The alien counter triggers a dream sequence for Augie (as later told by Augie\u2019s wife in a scene toward the end of the film where the actress originally cast to play Augie\u2019s wife recites a scene cut from the play to the actor playing Augie.) It\u2019s through Augie\u2019s dream, where he reaches his belated understanding.\n\nBut let\u2019s talk about the dream itself, because Freud and Lacan talked a lot about dreams.\n\nFreud said dreams are constructed from real experiences. He called these real life experiences in dreams \u201cday\u2019s residues.\u201d Essentially these are just fragments of real experiences. Freud also says:\n\n\u201cDreams very rarely reproduce memories in their true form; they merely take fragments from them and weave them into a new structure.\u201d\n\nI found this interesting because the dream sequence that Augie experiences is laden with previous moments mentioned in the film. Go back to the black and white sequence where the actor playing Augie is reciting a seemingly cut scene from the play to Conrad Earp where Augie is speaking to his son after the alien encounter. He says the lines:\n\n\u201cYour mother would have gotten it (the alien) to laugh or to tell us the secrets of the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remind me of her more than ever, she wasn\u2019t shy, you\u2019ll grow out of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it comes out.\u201d \u201cAll my pictures come out.\u201d\n\nAll of these lines are echoed in the dream sequence.\n\nThe Alien encounter triggers the actual event that causes Augie\u2019s belated understanding of \u201cWhat the play means.\u201d The signifier in this case is Augie\u2019s dream sequence after the alien encounter.\n\nAugie\u2019s wife tells him in his dream, \u201cI think you\u2019ll need to replace me.\u201d Augie, now finally confronting his grief, responds, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Then his wife tells him, \u201cMaybe, I think, you\u2019ll need to try. I\u2019m not coming back Augie.\u201d\n\nNow, the dream sequence, if we\u2019re looking at the chronology of the play, comes before the actor playing Augie\u2019s conversation with Schubert Green, (played by Adrien Brody) the director of the play. This scene is where Augie achieves his belated understanding.\n\nNow I know I didn\u2019t get too into much into Lacan\u2019s psychoanalytical framework (and trust me you\u2019ll be glad that I didn\u2019t), but in it there is something called the Big Other. Trying to explain it is incredibly difficult. But basically it\u2019s the invisible authority you believe you have to answer to. For example it\u2019s why you say sorry even when you don\u2019t feel sorry. You say it because you feel like you\u2019re supposed to. Another example is the roles we play in life like playing the role of the father when we have children.\n\nThe Big Other is what I believe Schubert Green represents. Let\u2019s look at the dialogue again between the two (cutting some parts out for clarity.):\n\nACTOR: Am I doing him right?\n\nSCHUBERT: You\u2019re doing him just right.\n\nACTOR: I feel lost.\n\nSCHUBERT: Good.\n\nACTOR: I still don\u2019t understand the play. He\u2019s such a wounded guy. I feel like my heart is getting broken. My own, personal heart. Every night.\n\nSCHUBERT: Good.\n\nACTOR: Do I just keep\u00a0 doing it?\n\nSCHUBERT: Yes.\n\nACTOR: Without knowing anything?\n\nSCHUBERT: Yes.\n\nACTOR: Isn\u2019t there supposed to be some kind of answer out there in the cosmic wilderness? Woodrow\u2019s line about the meaning of life?\n\nSCHUBERT: Maybe there is one.\n\nACTOR: I still don\u2019t understand the play.\n\nSCHUBERT: Doesn\u2019t matter. Just keep telling the story. You\u2019re doing him right.\n\nI don\u2019t need to spell this one out for you. But this is the final step to Augie\u2019s awakening. Are we connecting the dots yet? AWAKENING.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the scene where Saltzburg Keitel (played by Willem Defoe) and Conrad Earp are talking to a prospective group of actors to be selected for the play of Asteroid City about the play itself. After Saltzburg asks the group if anyone has ever fallen asleep during a live performance and Schubert Green describes his moment, Saltzburg says this:\n\n\u201cSleep: is not death. The body keeps busy, breathing air, pumping blood, thinking. Maybe you pay a visit to your dead mother. Maybe you go to bed with your ex-wife. Maybe you climb the Matterhorn. Connie: you wake up with a new scene three-quarters written in the head already. Schubert: you wake up with a hangover. Important things happen. Is there something to play? I thinks so. Let\u2019s work on scene from the outside in: be innert \u2013 then dream.\u201d\n\nAfter the prospective cast acts out dreaming, Saltzburg cues Conrad Earp.\n\n\u201cWhere are we, Connie? And when? Talk to us!\u201d\n\nConrad Earp then starts setting the stage for the third act of the play.\n\n\u201cOne week later our cast of characters already tenuous grasp of reality has further slipped in quarantine and the group begins to occupy\u00a0 a space of the most peculiar emotional dimensions\u2026\u201d\n\nThis scene explains that Asteroid City is the place between initial trauma, and their belated understanding of that trauma.\n\nIn a later scene of the same setting Conrad Earp tells the prospective cast:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to make a scene where all my characters are each gently seduced into the deepest, dreamiest slumber of their lives as a result of their shared experience of a bewildering and bedazzling celestial mystery.\u201d\n\nThis prompts the infamous \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T WAKE UP IF YOU DON\u2019T FALL ASLEEP\u201d scene. \u201cWaking up\u201d refers to belated understanding. Your enlightenment. Falling asleep is the triggering event after your initial trauma. Despite what you think you may understand of your grief and trauma, you will not come to the true belated understanding if you never experience that triggering event, the re-experiencing of trauma.\n\nI could go on but I think we get the jist of it here.\n\nThere are personal reasons why this film is my favorite in Wes Anderson\u2019s catalogue, but the depth and complexity is a also a big reason why this is my favorite Wes Anderson film.",
