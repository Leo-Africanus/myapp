There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we\u2019re hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",

        "content": "Seriously, these are the first seven films Reiner directed:\n\n1984: \"This is Spinal Tap\"\n\n1985: \"The Sure Thing\"\n\n1986: \"Stand By Me\n\n1987: \"The Princess Bride\"\n\n1989: \"When Harry Met Sally\"\n\n1990: \"Misery\"\n\n1992: \"A Few Good Men\"\n\nThat is an INSANE streak of excellent films, several of which are classics. The least of them is probably \"The Sure Thing\" and that's a charming, funny 80s teen spin on \"It Happened One Night\" that made John Cusack a leading man. And especially impressive is how diverse they are, ranging from the best music mockumentary ever to one of the greatest coming of age films ever to a gold standard romantic coming of age film to one of the most beloved fantasy/family films of all time. Reiner really seemed like he could do no wrong...\n\n...and then he made \"North\" and that streak ended in a crashing halt that promptly exploded. \"North\" was the kind of disaster made by a director on an insane hot streak who thought he could not miss and thus had a blank check to make his pet project which he clearly thought was going to be a modern \"Wizard of Oz.\" Instead, it became a massive bomb that is now best known for being the subject of one of Siskel and Ebert's greatest reviews. And regrettably, Reiner's never been the same as a director since. (He did rebound with \"The American President\" as his next film, but Aaron Sorkin was much more the driving creative force on that one and his directing career since has been scattershot at best.) But at least he'll always have that awesome directoral decade to look back on with well-deserved pride.",

I think that could cause some interesting dialogues with kids, right?\n\nRegarding the remake: even with the relatively decent trailer released some time ago, I have problems seeing that work out.

        "content": "Finally got around to watching *Ghostbusters: Afterlife* recently, and one of the main plot points isn't making sense to me: Egon's estrangement and self-imposed exile from the rest of the team. \n\nRay tells Phoebe that Egon called him and told him everything he'd discovered in the mine, but gives no reasons at all why he didn't believe him. Maybe Winston and Venkman had moved on to other things and thought Egon was just trying to relive the glory days, but Ray's the most enthusiastic of all of them about the paranormal. Egon's quirky but we never see him being anything other than levelheaded and methodical. When Egon tells him he discovered a Gozer-worship temple in an old mine Ivo Shandor used to mine the materials for the NYC building (not like it's a secret who owned it, his name's on the thing as well as half the buildings in the town), and *Ivo Shandor himself* is in a sarcophagus there, and it appears it's being used as another attempt to bring Gozer back into our world, why wouldn't Ray at least go have a look? \n\nThe reasoning that he was sore at Egon for taking off abruptly with most of their equipment seems weak. At most that might explain why Ray *initially* hung up on him, but Egon was out in Oklahoma for years. In all that time someone as intensely curious about the paranormal as Ray wouldn't have second thoughts and decide to go out and see if his old friend and long-standing academic and business partner who he know extremely well might be telling the truth? At the very least, since Janine obviously knows exactly where Egon is and is in direct contact with him, Ray couldn't have reached out to her and asked what's going on with him?\n\nI know the 'real' reason is that the plot required it to happen, obviously. I liked the movie quite a lot overall and thought it was a very worthy sequel to the original (I did find it funny they pretended *Ghostbusters 2* never happened). Just seemed like an oddly weak spot in an otherwise good movie. ",

        "content": "The original Bad Santa is one of my favorite Christmas movies, it just hits that raunchy rated R Christmas movie itch perfectly for me, rewatching it again this year I saw that the sequel they made years ago that I never saw was also available, since I had never seen it and to be completely honest had totally forgotten that it existed I figured I\u2019d finally give it a try and wow I was honestly pleasantly surprised! Of course it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the original but I thought it was cool to see these characters interact again after all these years and I love the addition of Kathy Bates who I thought was hilarious in this one. I still love the interactions between Willie and Thurman although of course it\u2019s not gonna hit quite the same notes as the first time around due to the actor who plays Thurman is much older this time around. I feel that with all the comedy movies that got sequel\u2019s a significant time after the original was released that have fallen flat (Zoolander being the perfect example of this). I found Bad Santa 2 to be quite enjoyable and fun, although I know this opinion might be more in the minority given its ratings and reviews online, it seemed not to do very well, perhaps my expectations were just quite low. What do you guys think of it? ",

Eg the original British 'Death at a Funeral' is great and 'Withnail and I' is one of my favourite comedies of all time!\n\nThanks in advance.",

Am I overreacting?XD but it really has been a while since i watched such an amazing film ",
