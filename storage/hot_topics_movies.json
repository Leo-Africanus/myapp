The stereoscopic 3D does wonders for it.\n\nSecondly, Phil Lord and Chris Miller's script/ direction strikes that perfect balance between chaos, silliness, biting commentary and human pathos; the kind of stuff that directly mocks the Hollywood system while still honoring it in its own strange way. Some of the themes feel especially (and unfortunately) relevant in 2026.\n\nAnd as overexposed/controversial as he is today, Chris Pratt puts in a wonderful performance as Emmet, the everyman who doesn't really know how to do anything but also has the biggest heart in the world. Heck, pretty much everyone in the cast puts in a great performance, even the ones doing a brief cameo.\n\nWhat a film man\u2026",

I buy that. But I realized the Groundhog Day myth itself lines up almost too perfectly:\n\nThe groundhog \u201cseeing its shadow\u201d is literally seeing itself \u2014 and when that happens, winter continues. Spring only comes when it doesn\u2019t see itself.\n\nThat feels like exactly Phil\u2019s problem. As long as he only sees Phil \u2014 his ego, his desires, his boredom, even his despair \u2014 the loop keeps going. Time only moves forward when he stops being self-referential and actually looks outward.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just \u201cbe nice and you\u2019re free,\u201d but \u201cstop seeing yourself as the center of meaning.\u201d The holiday myth ends up mirroring the character arc.\n\nCurious if anyone\u2019s seen this connection made explicitly before, or if I\u2019m just late to the party.",

        "content": "Randomly threw on Manchester by the Sea tonight and\u2026 wow. I honestly did not expect this.\n\nI remember being so salty back in the day that Casey Affleck won the Oscar over Ryan Gosling for La La Land. La La Land was my favorite movie that year and I was fully in the \u201chow did Gosling lose??\u201d camp. I was shocked then, and I stayed convinced I was right.\n\nTen years later, watching Manchester by the Sea for the first time\u2026 yeah. I was wrong. Completely.\n\nCasey Affleck gives one of the most devastating, restrained, soul-crushing performances I\u2019ve ever seen. No big speeches, no flashy moments, just grief sitting quietly in every look, every pause, every line. It sneaks up on you and refuses to let go.\n\nAnd that scene with Michelle Williams, the one where she asks if they can get lunch sometime absolutely destroyed me. It\u2019s unbearably sad, painfully real, and acted with such raw honesty that it feels almost intrusive to watch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.\n\nThis movie lingers. It sits with you. It hurts in a way that feels earned. I genuinely can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nWhat a film. What a performance. This is one of those movies that stays with you forever.",

I bring up the movie Tall Tale and nobody has ever heard of it? THAT WAS A GREAT MOVIE!\n\nShe played Calamity Jane, whom is presumably a crossed lover of Pecos Bill (played by Patrick Swayze)\n\n* [Calamity Jane](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001573/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Well, paint my toenails and curl my hair!\n* [Pecos Bill](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Calamity? My cactus flower!\n* [Calamity Jane](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001573/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Don't cactus flower me, you double-crossing dog!\n* [Pecos Bill](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/?ref_=ttqu_qu): I missed you, darlin'. If only you knew how much!\n* [Calamity Jane](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001573/?ref_=ttqu_qu): I know too well, you flea-infested little weasel!\n* [Pecos Bill](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Calamity, you look mighty pretty tonight.\n* [Calamity Jane](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001573/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Sweet talking me? You overgrown, mealy-mouthed, two-faced snivellin' snake! You gutless, brainless, heartless sidewinder!\n\nShe then outlines his body against the wall in bullet holes. That was a great scene! I am going to see if I can find it on one of the streaming services and watch it today. I must have watched this movie a hundred times as a child. \n\n  \nHave you see this movie?

        "content": "This movie is such a masterpiece. I saw and loved it in theatres, but I didn\u2019t revisit it until years later, but I\u2019ve seen it many times since. There\u2019s so much I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate in my first viewings. Every frame is so carefully curated and layered, the attention to detail in this movie is astounding. Every shot is so meticulously crafted, and expertly captured, there isn\u2019t a single shot in this movie that doesn\u2019t look like a painting. The cinematography and directing are absolutely top notch. As far as directing goes, it doesn\u2019t get better than this. George Miller is a master of the craft and such a brilliant artist. He really created such a monumental film. Watching the action sequences I have no idea how he did most of that, especially knowing the vast majority of the action in the film was done with practical effects. I love everything about this movie, every time I watch it I appreciate new things about it. George Miller really caught lightning in a bottle with this. So grateful for this movie.",
