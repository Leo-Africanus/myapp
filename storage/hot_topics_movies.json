The mystery being solved is not the ending either, which I kind of generally appreciate in a movie. The ending is kind of a 'be careful what you wish for' type closing.\n\nI can't believe that at age 56, I had never seen it. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but the story moves along well and is not complicated to follow. The mystery unfolds at a satisfying pace.\n\nFictional tale based on the historically factual tragedy of Nazi war criminals from WW2 escaping prosecution by fleeing Europe to South America. The movie imagines how these evil people would spend their time under the radar of modern civilization. \n\nPlus, Gregory Peck in what I would call an unusual role for him as an actor. Watch it. It's not a waste of time.",

However before the movie could start production, Idol got into a very bad car accident, and was heavily injured, hence why Idol didn't end up playing the role of T-1000. That was a weird choice at the time but looking at it now, it's crazy that Idol almost ended up getting the role in the first place since he's a singer and wasn't an actor in terms of film &amp; television in the first place to begin with.\n\nAs of a result, Robert Patrick ended up replacing Idol to play the T-1000 and the rest is history.",

        "title": "Watched The Wolf of Wall Street again yesterday and something clicked about how Scorsese tells the story",
        "content": "It feels like the entire movie is shot from inside Jordan Belfort\u2019s head. All the excess, the money, drugs, parties, sex is exaggerted to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile the truly dark consequencs never feel as brutal as they realistically were. Scorsese easily could\u2019ve shown the damage in a far more disturbing, grounded way, but he doesn\u2019t. And I think that choice is deliberate.\n\nThe \u201cI drove home safely\u201d scene is the clearest example. In Belfort\u2019s mind, he\u2019s a genius who kept it together. Then we see the actual reality total destruction. That one scene tells you everything, the movie isn\u2019t showing the world as it is, but as belfort believes it to be.\n\nThat\u2019s why the film feels like its \u201cglorifying\u201d the lifestyle. It\u2019s not Scorsese glorifyng it its belfort. We\u2019re stuck inside his delusion the whole time. The highs look incredible because he thinks they were. The lows feel softened because he never processed the harm he caused.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the final scene, which I honestly think is a masterpiece. Belfort is reduced to giving sales seminars, but Scorsese frames it like he\u2019s still the king he imagines himself to be. What hit me the most was the audiences faces all staring at him with this mix of hope, desperation, and admiration. It\u2019s Scorseses final punchline that belfort may have fallen, but the world is still eager to be sold the same dream.\n\nThe cycle continues, and people still want what he represents even after seeing how hollow and destructive it is.\n\nTo me, that ending recontextualizes the whole movie. It\u2019s not just a story about Belfort. Its about the audience both in the film and in real life who are still drawn to the fantasy he built.\n\nEdit: A few people pointed out that this idea is already established in the very first shot where jordan corrects the color of the car. And yeah, that absolutely sets the rule for the whole movie.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what I meant. im talking about how Scorsese goes beyond that one meta moment. He builds an entire visual language around Belfort\u2019s warped perception. It\u2019s not just that Jordan changes tiny details, the whole world is filmed the way he wants to remember it, almost like reality is bending itself around his fantasy.\n\nAnd the irony is that the truth only breaks through in brief, jarring bursts like the real version of the driving scene, Naomi throwing water on him, the yacht sinking moments where Scorsese essentially grabs the camera back from Jordan and shows the objective version of events.\n\nso yes, that first shot establishes the rule.  \nbut what im pointing at is the way Scorsese keeps that rule alive throughout the entire film, basically letting us watch a movie that feels codirected by jordans own delusions. Thats why the excess feels so shiny, why the darkness feels blunted, and why the whole thing plays like one long, unreliable flashback.",

        "content": "I think Timothy Dalton is very underrated as James Bond. He plays it raw and very believable. Both serious but also with confidence and a tad of humor.\n\nThe intro / pre-theme scene is one of the coolest (betrayal right away). I also think the setting and story of the movie is classic and well played. There are also multiple tense moments. \n\nMaybe the action scenes are a bit lacking, especially with the later Brosnan and Craig installments. But personally it didn\u2019t put me off.\n\nWas wondering how others feel, do you agree, am I wrong? Am I missing something? \n\nReally curious about your opinions on this! ",

        "content": "I recently just watched brokeback mountain for the first time and I think for the first time ever, a movie has truly left me speechless. obviously I have liked other movies and connected with other characters in movies, but for some reason I cannot stop thinking about how the movie ended. I have never in my life cried as much as I did for a movie until I watched BBM. whenever I think of how Ennis and Jack never truely had each other I get teary eyed and think of possible other universes where they are happy together and accepted. Jake Gyhlenhall's performance in the movie is fantastic but Heath Ledger was truly the best part of the movie for me. the way he portrayed his emotions felt so real to me. \nI have never felt so empty and broken after watching a movie. \nfor years, I always dismissed this movie as just a movie about gay cowboys because growing up, thats all I was really told about the movie. \nI was not prepared for how this movie would make me feel afterwards. \nfor the people who dismiss this movie or hate this movie because the characters are gay, please I beg you watch this movie with an open mind. I promise you will find something about it you love. \n",

They made a part 2, but part 1 is much better...\n\nLet the Right One In was good too for the great story. Both the USA and European version.\n\n  \nRingo, Ring, Ju-On: The Grudge all are scary as hell.  There are some USA versions as well. with the Buffy the Vampire star playing a lead role in a USA remake of one of them.\n\nThe girls crawling out of the TV stills scares me to death. We watch the movies 10 feet awasy on a 83 inch screen, no lights, so it looks freaky as can be.",

One aspect of the movie that's really... different, so to speak, is that literally all but one of the kidnappers are a-okay with killing the kid from the get-go.\n\nThe woman in particular seemed to have a serious personal grudge / vendetta against the kid from their very first interaction (\"I'm scared to shit of this kid\" - why?), and then further on &gt;! she seemed like the most eager one to kill the kid, even after it becomes clear they aren't getting any money !&lt;. This really made me think if there was a deleted sideplot of hers or something or if the movie was just making her out to be a total sociopath. \n\nAny movies made you feel like you're missing something about a character's motivation and/or intentions?",
