I dont think anyone, except Walton Goggins, could have pulled off bringing the character to life so unbelievably well from a bunch of words on paper. The guy just has so much range. He managed to be super raciest, extremely tolerant, dumber than a bag of rocks, smart as shit, really mysterious, [funny as hell](https://youtu.be/b2_OqofTZns), [even funnier (\"What's in the chair???\")](https://youtu.be/krxjTwujmFk?t=172), and above all else, [loyal to the very end](https://youtu.be/cwX5syZfWyU). \n\nI just recently read that at the start of filming, Goggins \"only had one question for Quentin: 'Is Mannix really the sheriff of Red Rock? Is that a bluff?' And QT's reply was: 'I need you to figure out the answer and never tell me what it is.' That was all I needed to know. And he never asked. He may be the only person to date who hasn't asked me that.\" Goggins said.\u00a0[Here is the article.](https://www.slashfilm.com/1190522/quentin-tarantino-left-the-answer-to-a-hateful-eight-mystery-up-to-walton-goggins/)\u00a0He 100% should have been nominated for best supporting actor (and won something) for his portrayal of Sheriff (????) Chris Mannix. 10/10, in my opinion, with one of the best ever character arcs as well.",

Showing the regret and consequences from both her infidelity and his womanizing is honestly very nice to see in a more modern movie, at least modern enough to be apart of the \"cheating and divorce is good\" culture as seen far to often.\n\nAnd the B plot of a playboy who seems to have it all together who sleeps around constantly cause it brings \"happiness\", only to see how once he truly falls in love he realizes and admits he's been lying to himself and everyone around him too... that was a good touch too. \n\n  \nOverall its just nice to see that divorce and sleeping around isnt the answer to happiness. 10/10 movie, would recommend ",

But at the emd of the movie, one small detail just made me really appreciate the effort put into the film so much more.\n\nAs the truck is driving away, we can see a few street lights with christmas wreaths and garland hanging on them. This brought me back to the beginning of the film which clearly happened around the holidays. Some nine months later, when the end of the movie takes place about 9 months later, of course no one took the time to take down the holiday decorations in this post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nA completely inconsequential detail that could easily have been overlooked. Instead, it called back to the beginning of the movie and really added to the atmosphere of the film as a whole. A small detail that just shone brightly and made a huge impact on my perception of the film as a whole.\n\nAre there any other examples like this that spring to mind?",

I\u2019m thinking starting with my top 10 movies such as  The Godfather, Scarface, Heat, l\u00e9on\u2026etc movies have strong visuals, memorable scenes, something that adds personality to the room. \n\nIf anyone has recommendations for high\u2011quality prints, unique artists, or underrated films that translate well into wall art, I\u2019d really appreciate it. \n\nThanks a lot",
