        "content": "Hey reddit. We\u2019re Colin Minihan (writer, director, and editor of What Keeps You Alive, plus Grave Encounters, It Stains the Sands Red, Extraterrestrial, and Coyotes) and Brittany Allen (actress and composer, starring in What Keeps You Alive, It Stains the Sands Red, and Coyotes opposite Justin Long and Kate Bosworth, most recently seen as Dexter\u2019s mom in Dexter: Original Sin, played Popclaw on The Boys Season 1, got murdered horribly in Jigsaw, The Prodigy and several others).\n\nHere's the trailer for our new film, Coyotes:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmMfrJ3Gw44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmMfrJ3Gw44)\n\nWe\u2019re married and have a 2 year old, which makes this career absurd, and love making films that walk the line between horror, thriller, and survival \u2014 sometimes with coyotes involved. \ud83d\udc3a Colin writes, directs, and edits, while Brittany brings her acting and musical magic.\n\nAsk us anything \u2014 filmmaking, acting, composing, horror stories, or the chaos of indie production. We shot Coyotes in 21 days in Bogota. It just premiered at Fantastic Fest and comes out in theaters Oct 3rd.  \n\nWe\u2019ll be back here attempting to answer questions today (Thursday 9/25) at 6 PM ET. Can\u2019t wait to howl with you all!\n\n\u2014 Colin &amp; Brittany",

The shots of the buildings are beautiful, Erik\u2019s costume getting progressively more fucked as the movie goes on is sick, the start after Erik is revived being super like disorienting is also really cool. This movie is just so goth it makes me happy and I can really see how it influenced a lot of early 2000s movies. Gonna watch Over The Hedge now",

        "content": "Who could've thought that a story about a rather small incident in a rather small town and community would have such an impact?\n\nWith the recent rise of AI and LLMs, we have become used to thinking that very soon there will be a moment when generated music and videos will be completely indistinguishable from reality. And so what? Just trust no one, right?\n\nWell, The Hunt specifically shows what's wrong about this approach. It works only until the moment people want to blame or judge someone. It's only a matter of time until some crime is committed by someone, and 100% AI-generated video or audio will be presented in court as authentic evidence, and no matter the amount of checks and different checking AI tools, no one will be able to truly tell if it's true or false. Cases will be solved entirely up to the judge's intuition and prejudice.\n\nAnd the worst part is that even if someone is able to distinguish truth from a lie with some tools/genuine evidence, it won't make any difference, as the damage is already done.\n\n  \n&gt;!Theo's realization that Lucas wasn't lying, and the fact that Lucas was acquitted in court - all that doesn't matter anymore. Because people have already labeled Lucas as a bad guy, they already hate him and want to kill him. And no actual justifiable evidence will ever change that. People don't trust the government, the court... People don't trust each other. This movie is not just a fictional tragedy, it's a real-life horror.!&lt;",
