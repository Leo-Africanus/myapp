        "content": "*A mysterious portal pulls four misfits into the Overworld, a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master the terrain while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected crafter named Steve.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [51%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie)\n\n**Metacritic:** [48/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The National - William Mullaly](https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2025/04/02/a-minecraft-movie-review/) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;While many bad films are made with love, sequels, spinoffs and big-budget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by AI. But here's the thing: I actually liked *A Minecraft Movie*. I'm as surprised as you are. This is not a disaster. Not by a mile. In fact, for most of its duration, it's downright charming and, in parts, had me laughing out loud.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236352502/)\n\n&gt;Watching \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d we\u2019re always aware that the story is something that\u2019s been grafted onto the world, and that we don\u2019t have much of a dramatic stake in it \u2014 that it\u2019s just the film\u2019s way of cobbling together something that \u201cworks.\u201d (Which, in its way, is very Minecraft.) Some of this is amusing, but like the rest of \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d it never feels like it matters. Yet it\u2019s no insult to say that, in this case, that\u2019s actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyrakye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/)\n\n&gt;The most disappointing aspect of *A Minecraft Movie*, directed by the husband-wife duo who go by Jared Hess (*Napoleon Dynamite*, *Nacho Libre*), isn\u2019t that it\u2019s born out of an existing IP. We live in a world of low-effort reboots, unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands. Another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising. What makes *A Minecraft Movie* so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination, betraying a core tenet of the game on which it\u2019s based.\u00a0\n\n[The Wrap - Michael Ordona](https://www.thewrap.com/minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black/)\n\n&gt;The most accurate summation of \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d is probably \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d It\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be. It probably won\u2019t dig up many new converts to the game, but should strike box-office silver, at least. (And fans, be sure to stick around for two credits scenes \u2013 especially the second one.)\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/) \\- C\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a real credit to Black\u2019s irrepressibly unique comic energy that \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d never feels quite as hypocritical as it should. Either disastrously ill-suited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy, or immaculately *well*\\-suited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them, Hess\u2019 film can\u2019t help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed \u201cMinecraft\u201d to become such a vital form of self-exploration for kids around the world (even Warner Bros.\u2019 choice to call it \u201cA Minecraft Movie\\*\u201d\\* as opposed to \u201cThe Minecraft Movie\u201d implies a spectrum of different concepts, despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one). But Black \u2014\u00a0whatever his charms, and regardless of how well they\u2019re deployed here \u2014\u00a0is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression. If not in this world, then perhaps in one of their own design.\u00a0\n\n[IGN - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter) \\- 6/10\n\n&gt;For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director\u2019s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite\u2019s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/a-minecraft-movie-review)\n\n&gt;One could rightfully question pretty much all of *A Minecraft Movie*, a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism. Some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions. These are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a four-quadrant IP extravaganza\u2014and even the by-the-numbers sequences seem jumbled, out of order, or repeated. Yet, there\u2019s something fitting about this film\u2019s contradictions. *Minecraft* is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation. It\u2019s adaptable, limited mostly by those playing it. One can build something personal, copy something mass produced, or attempt to tweak one with the other. Those behind *A Minecraft Movie* saw infinite possibilities laid out before them and\u2014unlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime, *The Lego Movie*\u2014opted for the one that\u2019s been made a thousand times before.\n\n[New York Post - Johnny Oleksinski](https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost) \\- 1/4\n\n&gt;Your noggin will certainly be done in by Steve and Garrett (Momoa) flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act. Really, \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d a 101-minute lobotomy. Put that on the poster. For the uninitiated, the Overworld \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure \u2014 is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings, create tools and design weapons out of blocks. The rules are unclear, as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling.\u00a0Stacking cubes would not, at first glance, seem like a strong plot to hang an action-adventure film on, however \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d did so with cleverness, heart and humor.\u00a0Trust me: \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d next to \u201cMinecraft.\u201d\n\n[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \\- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \\- 3/10\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a world where \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d actually backs the idealism of creativity, which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story. Maybe if the film were animated, it could\u2019ve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle. Inherently, maybe it would never even be possible, as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when it\u2019s given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this. There used to be a time when a majority of children\u2019s films were made with such care and intention. Now it seems all you need is buzzwords, celebrities, and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d clap-inducing moments, all of which \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d has, unlike a soul, which at least the game feels like it possesses.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;So sloppy is *A Minecraft Movie* that it can\u2019t keep track of its various concerns, highlighted by a mirthless subplot\u2014in which Jennifer Coolidge\u2019s vice principal picks up and woos an Overworld resident who\u2019s traveled to our universe\u2014that it basically drops around the midway point. Buried deep within Hess\u2019 wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and, thus, so too are outcasts. Yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together. *Minecraft* enthusiasts will be pleased by the film\u2019s various nods to its multiplatform predecessor. Nonetheless, shouting out isn\u2019t the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating, and those with no experience assembling towers, villages, and weapons in Mojang Studios\u2019 sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome. It\u2019s proof that you can build it, but that doesn\u2019t mean anyone\u2014much less newbies\u2014will come.",

There's no need to see this movie on an epic scale; it's not Lawrence of Arabia. \n\nThere are weird politics about what gets into IMAX and what doesn't, and how many weeks each release stays. Ignoring all that, sometimes you watch DUNE and get your money's worth of audio and image...and sometimes you watch ANNABELLE COMES HOME.\n\nThis doesn't have to do with a film's quality, or even budget. I watched FREE SOLO on IMAX and I think one day's catering budget for a Marvel movie cost more than that. But my hands have never sweated more.\n\nSo what's the least epic-scale, $900-million-budget, Hansy Zimmery, blockbuster film you've watched on the IMAX screen?",

Each part of the anthology has something else going on it, and carries the energy through, which is hard to do in a collection type work like this.\n\n\n\nAnthology pieces invite comparison, and I think the short pieces collected here work well together.\n\n\n\nStandout moments for me:\n\n\n1. Steven Root chasing James Franco down in a homemade suit of armor as Franco tries to shoot him. \"PAN SHOT.\"\n\n\n2. Everything in Meal Ticket. Neeson plays such a convincing sleazebag. This one packs a punch.\n\n\n\n3. Tom Waits in the one about the prospector hunting for gold. The land itself is a character here. I could watch him work in the wilderness all day.\n\n\n\n4. Every. Dang. Second. of the Oregon Trail love tragedy. The stuff about her brother's dog, named President Pierce, holds a special spot in my heart. \"President Pierce is a nervous creature, and excited by animals larger than himself.\" \"Almost all animals are larger than President Pierce.\"\n\n\n\n5. The last sketch is the only one that doesn't pack quite a punch, and whose ending is telegraphed early on, but watching Tyne Daly and Brendan Gleeson play off one another in the coach is pretty great.\n\n\n\n\nI think this movie deserved more notice than it got, celebrated in some circles though it was.",

        "content": "I was recently reminded that Highlander, one of my favourite films, was a flop. I was not very surprised as not everything I love is popular but one that did surprise me was Battle of Britain. Battle of Britain is superb, the budget is clearly on show, it has a stellar cast, it covers all aspects of the war and has the same attitude as other films of the same era. \n\nHowever it came out when anti-war sentiment was at an all time high and it flopped hard, I have seen figures stating it took no more than \u00a3100,000 when it was released at the cinema. It is also historically important as some of the budget was spent on restoring WW2 aircraft that had been left to rot. \n\n  \nWhat films have you seen and loved that ended up not making much money, if at all?

        "content": "Who here has seen this movie? I've watched it about 5 times, and I never get tired of it. I think it's an excellent and thought-provoking film with a big warning regarding some potential dangers of cloning and genetic engineering. When the movie came out in 1978, as far as we know, no living thing had yet been cloned, although the necessary science and technology was nearly in place, as the movie also dramatically shows. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal, and supposedly a few years ago, a couple of kids were cloned or at least genetically engineered in China, though this isn't definitely known. In any case, I'd say the technology already exists for human cloning and genetic engineering, so what should we do about it, and how do we avoid a madman like Dr. Mengele, who in The Boys from Brazil was able to clone 94 copies of Adolf Hitler?\n\nBesides the obvious ethical concerns this movie presents, I'd say the story and acting were quite excellent, especially Gregory Peck, who played the horribly evil and frightening Doctor of Death, Dr. Mengele, as well as Lawrence Olivier, who did an excellent job as Lieberman, an old Jewish spy who uncovers Dr. Mengele's evil plot and is able to stop him before he has a chance to create the Fourth Reich!",

All these films I\u2019ve never seen but have always heard about and seen referenced but I never knew how much I was missing out. The 90s had so many amazing and influential movies it\u2019s not even funny. My favorite is hard to pick but it either has to be The crow or silence of the lambs that are my favorites. I\u2019ve seen those two, se7en, fight club, the usual suspects, the sixth sense, blade runner, pulp fiction and I can go on but the rest are 2000s or later movies like Warrior or Blade runner 2049 and inglorious basterds. \n\nSome films even when you know the twist can\u2019t take away from just how great they are. Some films I definitely enjoyed more than others but when people say some of these films are the best or just the best in their genre I can see why. I think as someone who likes any genre other than romance no offense to the romance lovers of course I\u2019ve never been more satisfied in the films I\u2019ve watched. Maybe I\u2019m blowing it out of proportion but I just wanted to make like a 90s movie appreciation post and can\u2019t imagine what it was like seeing these twists in theaters like the usual suspects. I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk movies with so this sub is amazing to be apart of. \n\nEdit: just remembered blade runner came out in the 80s still great movie though and Donny darko as well",
