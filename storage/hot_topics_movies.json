        "title": "December 27-29 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' fight for the top spot at the box office. 'Nosferatu' opens with a fantastic $40.3 million in its first five days, already becoming Robert Eggers' highest grossing film. 'A Complete Unknown' settles for sixth place with $23.1 million.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/k21dn07d40ae1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2edf912cefe80f8f6936c9ec0814e5006ae794\n\n#**Normally you'd wait till the Weekend Actuals are out. But the numbers are delayed due to the holidays, so you'll only have estimates for now. The same could happen next week.**\n\nIt was a fierce battle at the box office.\n\n***Sonic 3*** and ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** fought for the top spot, with the hedgehog currently leaning on the top spot for now. On Christmas, we got 4 newcomers, with mixed results. ***Nosferatu*** delivered a fantastic debut and became Robert Eggers' highest grossing film in just 5 days, while ***A Complete Unknown*** had a very solid start. On the other hand, ***Babygirl*** had a soft start, while ***The Fire Inside*** failed to attract interest.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $159.2 million this weekend. That's up a huge 58% from last year, when ***Wonka*** returned to the top spot.\n\nStaying on top, ***Sonic 3*** earned $38 million this weekend ($59.9 million five-day). That represents a 37% drop, which is better than the previous films. There were concerns over the weekdays, as it appeared that it was front-loaded and would show weak legs, but it looks like it recovered for now.\n\nThrough ten days, the film has amassed $136.8 million. It should have another great hold this weekend, which will allow it to hit $200 million very soon. It can go as high as $250 million at this pace.\n\nSettling for second place, ***Mufasa*** made $37.1 million this weekend ($63.7 million five-day). That's a very nice 5% increase from last weekend. It had a soft debut but it's showing some strength. Through 10 days, it has made $113.4 million. Despite this increase, the film is still off a massive 68% from the 2019 film through the same point. We'll see how much it can earn through the holidays.\n\nExceeding expectations, Robert Eggers' ***Nosferatu*** debuted with a fantastic $21.1 million this weekend ($40.3 million five-day). This is not just Eggers' biggest debut by a wide margin, but it's already his highest grossing film domestically, passing ***The Northman*** ($34.2 million). It's also the fourth biggest debut for Focus Features.\n\nThis is an amazing result in any sense of the word, and showed that Eggers could finally hit the mainstream audience (***The Northman*** was supposed to be that film, but it didn't quite land at the box office). But that still raises the question: how was this film able to debut this high and far above Eggers' films? Credit must go to a fantastic marketing campaign, which offered enough intrigue and darkness to attract audiences. The decision to hide Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd's appearance as the iconic Count Orlok from the trailers panned out very well; if you want to watch him, you have to pay a ticket.\n\nIt can be said that Eggers' brand has also increased in past years. While ***The Northman*** wasn't a box office hit, Focus Features confirmed that the film eventually became profitable after a few months thanks to strong VOD numbers and other post-theatrical markets, and this was a big reason why they were confident in greenlighting ***Nosferatu***. Also, while remaking a 1922 silent German Expressionist film feels like it would struggle to get recognition, ***Nosferatu*** actually had some exposure to the audience. A lot of kids were introduced to this character in that iconic ***SpongeBob SquarePants*** episode. That helped the film build awareness. \n\nAccording to Focus Features, 55% of the audience was male and 56% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. While critics raved about the film, audiences wasn't as much; they gave it a weak \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore. That's not actually a bad score for a horror film, given they often fall in the C range. Nevertheless, without horror competition till ***Wolf Man*** in mid January, ***Nosferatu*** should hold well through the holidays. While it's unclear how much it can earn, one thing is clear: this is hitting $100 million domestically, which is an amazing result.\n\n***Wicked*** rose 37%, adding $19.4 million this weekend ($31.7 million five-day). On Christmas day, it added a sing-along version, which boosted the numbers. The film has earned a fantastic $424 million so far.\n\nAfter its weak legs, ***Moana 2*** had its best drop so far. It jumped 38%, adding $18.2 million this weekend. A much needed recovery, given it wasn't holding well after its gigantic opening. The film has earned $394.6 million so far, and will hit the $400 million milestone in a few days.\n\nDebuting in sixth place, Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** earned $11.6 million ($23.1 million five-day). This is one of the best debuts for Searchlight, and its opening day ($7.2 million) was a record for the studio. If we want to compare it to James Mangold's films, the five-day debut is slightly above of what ***Walk the Line*** made in 3 days ($22.3 million). \n\nThis is a solid start, and the only reason why it's not fantastic is that it's carrying an extensive $60-$70 million budget, putting a lot of pressure in the film. Bob Dylan is one of the most iconic singers and songwriters of the past century, although he is still not as popular as other musicians in other biopics. For example, Queen, Elton John and Bob Marley are more popular with current audiences than Dylan. So the film had only one selling point: its star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\nLike him or not, Chalamet is one of the most popular young stars of our times. He already had huge hits in the past year with ***Wonka*** and ***Dune: Part Two***, and he's already set for another film, ***Marty Supreme***, which also opens on Christmas Day next year. Deadline reported that 36% of the audience watched the film for Chalamet, cementing a status as a box office draw. Reviews were also solid enough to win over audiences, and some Oscar buzz is on the horizon.\n\nAccording to Searchlight, the audience was equally split between men and women. Unsurprisingly, the big demo was adults; 62% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which bodes very well for its legs. And you have to remember that this is targeting an old audience, which doesn't rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. We'll keep an eye on this one, but the incoming Oscar buzz should help it stay in theaters for quite  a long time.\n\nIn a distant seventh place, A24's ***Babygirl*** earned $4.3 million ($7.2 million five-day). That's quite a soft start, especially considering that the film was playing in 2,115 theaters, and the fact that A24 pushed it as its main attraction for the holidays.\n\nThe film is sold as an erotic thriller, but that can be a mixed bag at the box office. Outside the ***Fifty Shades of Grey***, erotic thrillers haven't performed very well at the box office. And despite having a big name in Nicole Kidman, she hasn't had a good run as of late; she hasn't had a single box office hit since ***The Upside*** back in 2019. Her recent success has been on streaming and on TV, leaving questions over her star power at the box office (even though she's the face of AMC).\n\nAccording to A24, 53% of the audience was female and 44% of the audience was 35 and over. While critics were positive of the film, the audience wasn't forgiving; they gave it a very weak \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which might be due to the nature of the film itself. While Kidman has some Oscar buzz, it would be a surprise if the film made anything above $20 million domestically.\n\n***Gladiator II*** continues showing some great late legs. The film eased just 9% and earned $4.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $163 million. It's gonna head to around $175 million.\n\nAngel Studios' ***Homestead*** had the worst drop in the Top 10. It dropped 47%, adding $3.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $12.8 million, and it suggests that it will fall off when the holidays are over.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was the last newcomer of the week, Amazon MGM's ***The Fire Inside***. Despite setting it at 2,006 theaters, the film bombed with just $2 million ($4.3 million five-day). That's the 28th worst debut for any film playing at 2,000+ theaters.\n\nThis isn't a surprising result. Amazon didn't appear to focus on properly marketing the film, choosing to simply dump it on Christmas and hoping that it would find an audience. After all, ***The Boys in the Boat*** over-performed last year, showing there was a market for sports dramas. But the film simply lacked a hook; people simply weren't interested in Claressa Shields' story. Even with the talent involved, it simply wasn't enough.\n\nAccording to MGM, 51% of the audience was female and 51% was 35 and over. On the bright side, the audience gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which fits nicely with its great reviews. But even with that, it's unlikely it can turn things around.\n\n***Kraven the Hunter*** slightly recovered after its awful second weekend drop, even if it fell on the bad side of the drops. It dropped 44%, adding $1.7 million this weekend. Sadly, with an anemic $21.3 million domestic total so far, there's nothing to celebrate here. It might hit $25 million, but it won't get much higher than that.\n\nBut while ***Kraven*** kept showing weak legs, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** does not appear to have any legs. The film collapsed 63%, earning just $455,000 this weekend. Absolutely horrible considering the rest of the films had fantastic holds. The film has made just $8.5 million domestically, and it's now guaranteed to finish below $10 million.\n\nParamount chose to open the Robbie Williams biopic ***Better Man*** in 6 theaters, ahead of its wide release on January 10. But the film flopped with just $18,000 ($35,000 five-day), which translates to a very poor $3,000 per-theater average. Not a surprise, considering Williams failed to find an audience in America. This is a bad sign for its wide release.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mufasa*** was still on top in the rest of the world, albeit only slightly. It added $77 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $327 million. The best markets currently are France ($20.9M), UK ($15.8M), Mexico ($15.5M), Italy ($14.4M) and Germany ($13.6M).\n\n***Sonic 3*** made its debut in the rest of the world, debuting with a dazzling $74 million in 52 markets, taking its worldwide total to $210 million. That's a huge 83% of the second film's debut. The best debuts were the UK ($15.1M), Mexico ($10.3M), France ($7.3M), Australia ($5.5M), Germany ($5.5M), Spain ($3.3M), Panama ($2.3M); Peru ($1.6M), Colombia ($1.3M) and Malaysia ($1.3M), all of which were records for the franchise. It should have no problem hitting $500 million, and it still has some markets left.\n\n***Moana 2*** added $36 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $882 million. The best markets are France ($53.9M), UK ($42.6M), Germany ($34.8M), Mexico ($28.2M) and Brazil ($25.7M).\n\nIn a major milestone, ***Wicked*** has now passed ***Mamma Mia!*** to become the highest grossing Broadway adaptation, with a current worldwide total of $634 million. The best markets are the UK ($67M), Australia ($24.8M), Korea ($14.2M), Germany ($11.8M) and Mexico ($9.9M).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Heretic* | Nov/8 | A24 | $10,829,810 | $27,716,205 | $42,703,807 | $10M\n\n- A24's ***Heretic*** has closed with $42 million worldwide. That's a very solid start, even if the film didn't have a lot of staying power after its good debut. If Hugh Grant making a Jar-Jar impression is not enough to get you to buy a ticket, nothing will.",

        "content": "I watched Die Hard with my family the other night. It's been ten years since I last saw it. Of course there's a famous scene early in the film where McClane kills one of Gruber's goons, then writes on his shirt, \"Now I have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho!\" I could have SWORN there was an iconic callback to this scene later in the movie, when Gruber steals McClane's gun and disappears into a nearby elevator. Just as the doors close, Gruber says, \"Now \\*I\\* have a machine gun! Ho, ho, ho!\" with a delivery that brought down the house at my last theatrical screening in 2014.   \n  \nI spent the whole film waiting for this moment, my favorite moment in the film. And it never happened. Thinking maybe I had somehow zoned out and missed it, I googled the scene after the movie and ... I seem to have made it up? Imagined the entire sequence? It's a very surreal feeling, like learning that Robert Mitchum never sings \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" in The Night of the Hunter. Thinking back on it, I suppose if Gruber had stolen a machine gun, he would have simply shot McClane and the film would've been over. ",

        "content": "There are so few great films nowadays, this was probably the last one I can remember and it\u2019s a decade old.\n\nPart of me wonders if I\u2019m just getting old and therefore new projects don\u2019t impress me much, but that\u2019s not true - Interstellar was a truly transcendent experience in the theatre, and you know you\u2019ve found a classic when it haunts you until you feel a deep urge to revisit it every few years.\n\nI consider it Nolan\u2019s best film. It actually had an emotional thoughline - something all too many of his films lack, impressive though they may be in other ways. He\u2018s obviously somewhat autistic, and would do well to collaborate with people in future who can make sure his stories hook the audience emotionally. Tenet looked great but I can\u2019t say I cared much for the characters.\n\nAnother aspect of Interstellar is the look and sound of it. It combines a very realistic treatment of outer space with a truly inspired score by Hans Zimmer. Who would have thought that blasting church organs would make a perfect fit for hard sci-fi, yet they do, as does the higher pitched \u2018glassy\u2019 sound. It all adds up to make outer space feel profoundly spiritual. The planets they land on feel like bizarre heavens and hells.\n\nThe casting is superb and McConnaughey nails it, and having a surprise Matt Damon appearance over half way into the film was a stroke of genius. Michael Caine owns as usual. Having the latter two turn out to be \u2018evil\u2019 made for two very black twists that really juiced the story and made the long runtime breeze past.\n\nI\u2019m not Nolan's biggest fan, I generally find him very good but overrated, but he really hit it out of the park with Interstellar. I doubt he\u2019ll top it, but I know he\u2019ll keep shooting for the stars \ud83c\udf7b",

The part in the scene that truly got to me is where Skylar starts crying after will reveals his dad put cigarettes out on him when he was younger. It all goes down hill from there as will says he doesn\u2019t love her and she breaks down. Something about the scene makes it stick out like a sore thumb. It\u2019s incredible, acting is crazy good. \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e4hXrrc8fA8?si=WqNx3YCfEwLuNiJH\n",

Now those kinds of movies are so far in between and mostly become Netflix filler even if the film is good it's buried by a cluttered algorithm. \n\n\n\n",

The choices in the dialogue and plot are epically dumb in the best possible way, and it's all dead serious. There's not a single attempt at comedy or comic relief. All purely unintentional. It's up there with stuff like Anaconda or Ewe Boll\nmovies, but somehow even better. The whole movie, you're just like: Wait.. noooo, they're not seriously. Yep! Wow. How could they have decided to go with that line?! We were blown away with entertainment from start to finish, but it IS a bad movie at the end of the day. The only downside is it leaves you wishing you could watch it for the first time again. Not much re-watching value. \n\nIt made us think a lot about what constitutes a so-bad-it's-good movie. I think the only rule is: You can't try to make one on purpose, like these corporate, faux-meta wink-wink, fake it's-so-bad-it's-good movies of today. The 80's and 90's are peppered with great ones, but I think the early 2000's were the apex. It's so embarrassing and hilarious what audiences thought was cool back then ",

The flim takes place after a deadly virus has wiped out most of the population worldwide. 4 young Adults, one of them being played by Chris Pine are looking for a safe haven to wait for the vrius to burn out. The post apocalyptic road trip proves to be more dangerous then expected. The movie was flimed in 2006, but got released following Pine's role in Star Trek 2009. It had a limited theater release, i saw the movie on DVD in late 2009. And watched it again following the 2020 pandemic.  My friend said he saw the movie in theaters back in 2009, and remembers the following scene. Chris Pines character talks about people dying on a mass scale in the first couple weeks of the pandemic. My friend says the movie had a flashback of bodies being dumped into a football stadium. The stadium was already full, but more body bags were being Dropped into this mass grave. Chris Pines character is seen in a Hasmazt suit, Pulling body bags off the truck. We apparently see more trucks bringing more bodies to the stadium in the background. Chris Pine says, he did this until the people paying him succumbed to the vrius as well. And there was simply not enough living people left to keep picking up bodies. I looked online and did find a few alternate scenes not in the normal movie. But I cannot find this scene, or any proof it exists anywhere. But my friend went into extraordinary detail about the scene. Is it possible the theater played a longer version, then the DVD cut? ",
