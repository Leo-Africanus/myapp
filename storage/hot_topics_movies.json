Jack Black had to make a video begging them for the rights to use Immigrant Song in School of Rock.\n\nTo expand the topic, another filmmaking aspect that is well known in the industry, but underappreciated by the general public is filming during golden hour and how incredibly difficult it is to pull off. Setting up all the equipment for such a short period of time means you have to be extremely well prepared beforehand.",

If you don't know, AMC shows off a new movie, that hasn't realesed yet, early and the audience won't know what it is. It's kept a secret and all you know about it going in is the rating and runtime. \n\nI say all this because Kelly Reichardt is not a general audience director. Her movies are very slow and methodical. Alot of scenes of nobody talking and just jazz music playing, which alot of people like. This is not a director who pleases the general audience. The day after the screenings, people have posted (on other socials) how boring the movie was. Rimming the director's usual style. \n\nNow, you could say \"Why hate on the director's style that she is know for?\" Thats the thing. No normal person knows Kelly Reichardt. To make an audience of regular joes go raw into one of her movies was not a good idea. I don\u2019t know why AMC chose this of all upcoming realeses.",

        "content": "I think most people recognize the deeper meanings and mature life lessons of stuff like Zootopia, Up, Toy Story 3, etc. What are some of the kids movies you think fly under the radar as being deeper than they\u2019re often given credit for?\n\nI put A Goofy Movie in this category. I think it\u2019s a simple enough father and son movie, but its main message is a really important one for life in general and particularly parent-child relationships: if you love someone and want to be closer to them you don\u2019t make it all about trying to make them do things you want to do, you go and do stuff with them that they enjoy to do. And while it goes both ways, it\u2019s especially true for a parent to take the lead on this with their child. You\u2019re the adult. Your kid needs to know that the things they like are ok and a source of bonding, not separation or judgment from their parents whose approval they desperately seek.\n\nDon\u2019t know many other movies that convey the point as well as A Goofy Movie does.",

        "content": "Hi all! Looking for some cozy autumn films to snuggle up with some tea to. I\u2019m not looking for anything horror, scary or Halloween themed.\n\nMy current list:\n\n-Fantastic Mr. Fox\n-The Lake House\n-Practical Magic (I guess this one is Halloween related, but it feels more romcom than anything else to me)\n-Fly Away Home\n-Runaway Bride\n-When Harry Met Sally\n-Autumn in NY \n-Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\n-It\u2019s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (again, while Halloween related, even the most sensitive souls like myself aren\u2019t going to get scared watching Snoopy)\n-Little Women \n\nThese all have some great fall foliage scenes. I live in a place without seasons and am craving the autumn colors. Any recommendations would be highly appreciated! ",
