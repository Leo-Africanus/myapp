In his early career, that often resulted in roles that made little impression, but over the years it has become one of his unique strengths. For all his clearly enormous talent, Edgerton has only in the past decade or so gained the gravitas that allows him to truly embrace these haunted characters \u2014 not just to play them but to become them.\u201d",

And of course there are times where if the source material has multiple installments anyway, that makes sense (Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc). However, some films are just lightning in a bottle, and expansion just seems... off. Straight away, two examples spring to my mind: \n\n\n\n**Die Hard**. Sure, Die Harder, Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard are good, but there's no topping the first one. \n\n\n\n**Home Alone**. I might get some flak for this, but Home Alone as a franchise just goes off the rails. A second one that is a beat-for-beat clone of the first, the third one introduces a kid with NO connection to the MacCalisters, and the fourth just repeats the first again by pretending an entirely different kid is Kevin? Very strange.",

He\u2019s described as a burly hermit of a man with a big beard, and he\u2019s greasy and overweight, but I\u2019m reading the words and I\u2019m like, No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he is. This guy is beige wallpaper. He\u2019s somebody that blends in wherever he needs to because he\u2019s so scared, and he needs to step back wherever he is so no one pays attention to him. I put on beige pants and a little sweater vest, and I combed my hair. I\u2019m so nervous. It\u2019s one of the handful of times I\u2019ve been able to audition for a Hollywood movie, and at this point, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in it. I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d",

        "content": "I wonder if Anniversary might have performed better had it been marketed for what it really was. \n\nI went to the movie expecting a Lifetime-styled thriller where mommy Diane Lane tries to save her naive son from the claws of his psychotic bitch of a wife. Turns out the movie wasn't really about this, well a tiny bit of it is, but the movie is very much a political thriller of extremes and how America becomes enraptured by a Far-Right movement called the Change, initiated by a widely successful book written by the Phoebe Dynevor book. \n\nWhile the film does start as a family thriller where Lane's matriarch clearly resents Dynevor's character for being a fascist loon, the movie then grows from that as the world becomes a Handmaid's Tale kind of place. The son turns into a sadistic dick, the gay daughter is nearly killed by goons and goes on the run, the middle daughter becomes depressed and has an abortion without her husband knowing and the youngest daughter does a lot of sad faces until the shocking finale. And Kyle Chandler has a massive meltdown over a dog's name and Diane Lane rips a flag to shreds, \n\nIt's a big ass jumble of threads but I found it daring and watchable and it pulls no tricks. I was shocked by how it ended. \n\nI thought everybody was great but I thought Kyle Chandler, Dylan O'Brien, Madeline Brewer and Phoebe Dynevor were the standouts. I like Diane Lane but she was a tad too one-note for me.",

Jingle All The Way is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies and I always thought Jake Lloyd was excellent in it. My family has watched that movie every Christmas season since it released. Of course the pairing of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad is amazing, and there absolutely should have been more movies with them paired together. And Phil Hartman as the slimy Ted was inspired casting. \n\nLet\u2019s show some love to Jake Lloyd! ",

Goodfellas and the scene in which actor Ray Loita escorts his girlfriend from getting out of a car to being front row inside an intimate musical show is an example. \n\nRecently I watched Small Axe directed by Steve McQueen. Their is a scene in the second epsisode in which their is a house party and the song Silly Games is playing and the song ends and all dancers are grinding and start singing and moving their feet in the same rhythm. \n\nThat scene is so sensual and cool. Small Axe is a great film. It shows a slice of Caribbean culture immigrating into England. Small Axe is a very cool film",
