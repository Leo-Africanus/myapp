Sadly gone is the charm of Sonic 2 which was a little more nuanced, and a lot more engaging. However, the audience at the press screening seemed to be eating this all up despite its excesses, so there\u2019s that.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-1236250284/):\n\n&gt;\u201cSonic 3\u201d gives hyperactivity a good name. Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first \u201cSonic\u201d in 2020.\n\n[io9.com](https://gizmodo.com/sonic-3-movie-review-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-paramount-sega-2000540156):\n\n\n&gt;Full of electric spectacle and action-packed adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 completes the best video game movie trilogy yet.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.\n\n[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)\n\n&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (8/10):\n\n\n&gt;Clever jokes, a noticeable reverence for the source material, and some fantastic antagonists make the Blue Blur's latest race an entertaining ride from start to finish.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;The outcome is a \"Sonic\" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\n[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Carrey\u2019s antic madness \u2013 elsewhere often too much to digest \u2013 is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.\n\n[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):\n\n&gt;Whether it\u2019s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):\n\n&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.\n\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):\n\n&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project \u2026 well, it\u2019s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The MVP of the first two films, Carrey dials down the physical comedy in both his roles, amping up punning (\u201cDorkupine!\u201d) to hit-and-miss effect. For all the actor\u2019s gurning and the film\u2019s visual busyness, few images pop or lodge in the memory.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):\n\n&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn\u2019t as fast as its blue protagonist.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before. With their abilities outmatched in every way, Team Sonic must seek out an unlikely alliance in hopes of stopping Shadow and protecting the planet.\n\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog\nColleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower\n* Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna\n* Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog\n\n**Live-action cast**\n\n* Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik\n* James Marsden as Tom Wachowski\n* Tika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski\n* Krysten Ritter as Director Rockwell\n* Natasha Rothwell as Rachel\n* Shemar Moore as Randall Handel\n* Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone\n* Tom Butler as Commander Walters\n* Adam Pally as Wade Whipple\n* Alyla Browne as Maria Robotnik\n\nDirected by: Jeff Fowler\n\nScreenplay by: Pat Casey, Josh Miller, John Whittington\n\nStory by: Pat Casey and Josh Miller\n\nProduced by: Neal H.

        "content": "I grew up knowing Tom hanks from Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Toy Story, You\u2019ve got mail, saving private Ryan. He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn\u2019t come to accept his early films. \n\nI saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren\u2019t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren\u2019t made for me at that age and I wouldn\u2019t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I\u2019m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. \n\nYou are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas. There is a rare blend of grounded humanism and over the top performances in these two films that I feel was lightning in a bottle. \n\nAs a Joe Dante fan I have to say other than gremlins 2 and perhaps beyond it felt like the movie most representing the distillation of his spirit as a filmmaker. The cast is top to bottom perfect. It felt like both a love letter to late 50s early 60s tv like Ozzie and Harriett, leave it to beaver, the munsters and 80s hijinks comedies while altogether becoming its own thing. \n\n Tom Hanks masters over the top comedy in this movie. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, his outbursts, monologues, and physical comedy are unmatched in their ability to play to the levels of gonzo Joe Dante asks of him while simultaneously feeling endearing and believable. Which leads to the reason the ending was changed from a twilight zone like twist to a double twist where he HAS to win in the end. But albeit in the wrong way. \n\nAlso props to Bruce Dern, I don\u2019t know how he ended up in this movie but I\u2019m damn glad he did. What a driving force and \u201cstraight man\u201d if this movie could even have one. \n\n",

But that charm from the early scenes is lost with the addition of each new plot point.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-turns-origin-story-into-rousing-action-adventure-buddy-movie-1236205310/):\n\n&gt;Though James Earl Jones is impossible to follow, these voice actors give it all a game try.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-1236250945/):\n\n&gt;Jenkins has not sold out; rather, the studio bought into his vision, which respects the 1994 film and recognizes the significance that its role models and life lessons have served for young audiences.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-disney-prequel-xfksllzbq) (5/5) :\n\n&gt;Disney has gone back to the drawing board with this dazzling animated musical, a film that matches photorealistic spectacle with hummable earworms and, mostly, a genuinely mythic sense of story.\n\n[RogerEbert.com] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa\u201d never quite bursts free of the constraints placed upon it, but those constraints never stop it from moving, or from being moving.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins) (8/10):\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins\u2019 Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight directors involvement in a CGI-heavey Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s in little danger of becoming a classic but it\u2019s gratifying to know that Barry Jenkins made this film his own, telling a fine story with genuine emotion and visual aplomb.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/17/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/77020873007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;Thanks to Jenkins\u2019 inimitable grace and Miranda\u2019s tuneful swagger, it continues to feel vibrant.\n\n[Chicago Sun-Times] (https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/12/17/mufasa-review-lion-king-disney) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The voice work from the outstanding cast is rich and warm and vibrant, and while the songs from the great Lin-Manuel Miranda (with Lebo M. making valuable contributions) might not make for a generational catalog, they\u2019re still infectious and clever.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Even with a few flaws, Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King has enough heart and depth to stand on its own feet and surpass its 2019 predecessor.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235194304/):\n\n&gt;We tell ourselves stories in order to live.

And it's far from Jenkins' best work, but in any other hands, a lot of Mufasa's intentions would have completely misfired. Thankfully there are some stellar vocal performances and VFX \u2013 but it could have been so much better.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1740391/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5.5/10):\n\n&gt;\"Mufasa\" will satisfy, but it also feels ultimately useless. Like Disney is once again spinning its wheels, trying to wring billions of dollars out of old ideas while they brainstorm new ones. Fans of \"The Lion King\" may be slightly moved. At the very least, you'll finally know how Rafiki got his stick.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Fans of the franchise and younger generations will find a lot to like about Mufasa: The Lion King, but it's hard to imagine it will have a legacy comparable to the original animated classic that started it all.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241217-mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (2/5):\n\n&gt;This series of unfortunate events raises more questions than it answers.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;While Mufasa is never as actively depressing as 2019\u2019s Dumbo or 2022\u2019s Pinocchio, the exercise has perhaps never felt as craven or pointless as it does here.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lion-king-2-barry-jenkins-review-b2665329.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, finding the Jenkins in Mufasa is like putting a blindfold on in the Louvre and trying to feel your way to the Mona Lisa.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka\u2014the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny\u2014their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Aaron Pierre as Mufasa\n* Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka\n* Tiffany Boone as Sarabi\n* Kagiso Lediga as Young Rafiki\n* Preston Nyman as Zazu\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros\n* Thandiwe Newton as Eshe\n* Lennie James as Obasi\n* Anika Noni Rose as Afia\n* Keith David as Masego\n* John Kani as Rafiki\n* Seth Rogen as Pumbaa\n* Billy Eichner as Timon\n* Donald Glover as Simba\n* Blue Ivy-Carter as Kiara\n* Braelyn Rankins as Young Mufasa\n* Theo Somolu as Young Taka\n* Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala\n\nDirected by: Barry Jenkins\n\nScreenplay by: Jeff Nathanson\n\nProduced by: Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak\n\nCinematography: James Laxton\n\nEdited by: Joi McMillon\n\nMusic by: Dave Metzger, Nicholas Britell (score), Lin-Manuel Miranda (songs)\n\nRunning time: 118 minutes\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2024",

        "title": "The Greatness of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",
        "content": "In my opinion Sergio Leone has made several all-time great movies especially Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America but to me The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is his masterpiece. Most people recognize it as a really fun and cool classic western which I certainly is but I want to write about what it makes it transcend into a truly artistic masterpiece that most people probably miss. I think it is a lot more complex, creative and emotional than it seems at first glance.\n\nFirst thing is the film has a strong message and theme about morality. On the surface it is a deconstruction of a classic western with the clear cut hero and villain. The hero of a standard Hollywood western is morally upright and does the right thing for the benefit of others. Of course in Leone's westerns every character is greedy and at best morally grey. However, I think this message is already clear in the first two films of the dollars trilogy and Leone next a next step in TGTBATU.\n\nThere is definitely a reason that the characters become involved in the civil war beyond being able to include a cool battle scene. If there is a message to the film I think it is: How a person acts in war is a true test of how good or bad a person they are. In this version of the west every character is greedy and has shady motives but war highlights their true level of morality. Because of that I think TGTBATU is a war movie as much as it is a western or adventure movie.\n\nFor instance, why is Blondie called The Good if he kills people for money and screws over people that trust him? His real morality is reflected in how he reacts to the war. Throughout the film he seems truly affected by all the death and suffering he sees. He comments on the devastating nature of war and offers a dying soldier his coat and a few pulls on his cigar instead or racing towards the money like Tuco. One of the most interesting scenes is the Bridge sequence, as it shows Blondie and Tuco for what they really are. Blondie comes up with the idea of destroying the bridge (when there is probably an easier way to get to the other side) and Tuco goes along with it but they have different motives which are subtle but definitely there. Blondie really wants to destroy the bridge because he knows that doing so could save thousands of lives and stop a lot of unnecessary killing. He also feels for the army captain and wants to bring him some joy before he dies. Tuco only cares about getting closer to the money and will do anything for the $200,000. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie just like the Man with no Name from the first two as he is quick witted and always has a scheme but here he gets a lot more character development.\n\nSo what makes Angel Eyes the bad if all three characters are morally ambiguous. Again, it is how he reacts to the war that shows his true nature. Angel Eyes becomes an officer for the Union (what people would consider to be the \"good\" side) and completely uses it to his advantage. According to the general, under Angel Eyes' command at the camp, the prisoners are being robbed, tortured, cheated and murdered. He clearly has some kind of system with his gang where they are stealing from the prisoners and making a lot of money from it. He also uses his position to torture Tuco into telling him the location of the gold. Lee van Cleef does an excellent job playing a truly evil and clever villain but also one that is somewhat respectable as he has a sense of honor.\n\nFinally Tuco is considered the ugly because he really doesn't give a shit about the war. He doesn't use it for his advantage he just sees it as an obstacle between him and the $200,000 and does not seem the least bit affected by all the death and suffering around him. Despite this Tuco is also by far the most fleshed out character and really seems to be a product of his environment. Obviously, life is hard in the world that he's living in, and in his mind, greed is the only way to survive. So he is basically the ugly reality of someone trying to get by in a crazy world. The scene with his brother illustrates this as he talks about the only way to survive in that place and time was to become a priest or a bandit. Tuco is clearly affected by his brother's judgement of him and we see that Tuco is a really lonely person who wants connection and a better life for himself but only knows how to survive through crime. Most people agree (as I do) that Eli Wallach is the star of the film as he plays a character who is greedy, ruthless and pathetic but also likable, tough, cunning and a great gunslinger in his own right.\n\nStylistically the film is fascinating in how it changes throughout it's run time. The first half of the movie is very similar to the first two dollars films. It's dirty, grimy, features a lot of shootouts and the characters are at their most duplicitous. But again once the characters start interacting more with the war and we learn more about their motives and viewpoints the film itself starts to take on a different tone. The style becomes more similar to what we will see in Once Upon a Time in the West. The film becomes much more operatic with more epic pieces of music and scenery. Instead of focusing only on these greedy bounty hunters and their scams/schemes the film starts paying more attention the atrocities of war and becomes more sad, elegiac and emotional. People really discount how emotionally powerful the film is and that has a lot to do with the war element but also how much we start to care about the characters. At the same time the film becomes a lot more experimental with the scene of Tuco running around the graveyard and of course how the final duel is filmed and edited. Here it becomes far more artistic than American westerns. Also, need to point out the fantastic screenplay which does an excellent job bringing back important symbols in different ways such as the rope and the \"two kinds of people in the world\" line.\n\nLastly, one more thing that makes TGTBATU transcend an average western or even a Sergio Leone western is the fact that it is just as much an adventure movie and a war movie. I would say it is also one of the greatest war movies ever made even as the war stays mainly in the background. It shows war in a very real way with no sappiness or rousing heroics. There may be good and bad in the title but when it comes to the war the film doesn't judge, it just shows the suffering and needless death on both sides. We get several powerful and personal stories about the war through characters like the commandant at the POW camp, the injured soldiers in the mission, the senseless loss of life at the bridge and the union captain there and the dying soldier that Blondie comforts near the end. There is a ton of humanity in the film if you look closely and as mentioned this actually changes the morally corrupt Blondie and turns him into at least an anti-hero rather than an outright villain. I believe his experiences in the war is ultimately the reason he decides to spare Tuco at the end and even let him keep his half of the money. The war highlights the value of human life In this fucked up place and time in the world and blondie learning this lesson is what makes him \u201cthe good\u201d.",
