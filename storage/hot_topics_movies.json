        "content": "Lately I have been rewatching older movies and realizing how much they cared about things that feel rare now. Not just story, but patience, atmosphere, and effort in the small details. Real locations. Practical sets. Letting scenes breathe. Silence that actually means something.\n\nFor me, a perfect example is Alien. \n\nThe movie takes its time. The ship feels real and lived in. The darkness hides things instead of showing everything. The tension comes from waiting, not from constant noise or fast cuts. It feels like the filmmakers trusted the audience to be uncomfortable and pay attention.\n\nI am not saying modern movies are bad, but it feels like something shifted. Faster pacing, cleaner visuals, and less willingness to sit in a moment. \n\nWhat is something older movies did really well that you feel is mostly lost now?",

        "content": "As a tradition on Christmas in my family we watch 2 of the movies someone was gifted. This year it was Minority Report and the 2nd latest Mission Impossible. Both on 4K UHD. It was a coincidence both happened to star Tom Cruise. \n\nMinority Report blew everyone away. The 4K upgrade is a revelation in my opinion. The blacks? The blues? Oh my. It was jaw dropping. The movie has like 2 shots that don\u2019t hold up CGi wise. One is when we see the drug dealers eye sockets, that always looked bad. I\u2019m struggling to even remember the other. \n\nBut everything else? The ships the cops use to fly to crime scenes? They look so real. The jet packs? Incredible. The futuristic weaponry and designs? Wow\n\nAnd then we watched Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning. Now obviously these are two very different films but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. \n\nWhat\u2019s important is that one movie is stylized taking place in a far off future which oddly felt more tactile and real than a contemporary spy  action film. \n\nThere\u2019s this odd fauxness to the Mission Impossible movie that is sooo hard to put your finger on. Something just felt off like many of the action scenes. Things they tell you were done for real do not look real. Tom riding that motorcycle off a cliff doesn\u2019t look real! Why? They did it, right? What\u2019s going on? \n\nAnyways my main point was to highlight how truly amazing Minority Report looks in 4K Dolby Vision. This 23 year old movie(oh my god! How is that even possible!?!) looks better than any movie I\u2019ve seen this year.",

        "title": "How to Get Into Test Screenings",
        "content": "I go to test screenings a lot. You're not supposed to talk about the individual movies on Reddit because they make you sign a non-disclosure agreement promising not to to discuss the movie on social media.\n\nEven if I had seen a movie that, for example, the studio decided to shelve for tax reasons, the NDA would prevent me from saying anything. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be allowed to tell you this hypothetical film was hilarious and the whole audience loved it, nor that the (again, strictly theoretical) movie was closer in spirit to Who Framed Roger Rabbit than Space Jam: A New Legacy.\n\nStill, it comes up in conversation sometimes, and people have asked me how to get into test screenings. The simplest answer is to sign up at one or all of these websites:\n\n* [Preview Free Movies](https://www.previewfreemovies.com/)\n* [Gofobo](https://gofobo.com/)\n* [ERM Research](https://www.ermresearch.com/screenings)\n* [Screening Squad](https://www.screeningsquad.com/)\n* [Warner Bros. Screenings](https://wbtickets.com/)\n* [Before the Premiere](https://www.beforethepremiere.com/)\n* [Advance Screenings](https://www.advancescreenings.com/)\n* [Everyone Sez](https://app.everyonesez.com/)\n* [1iota](https://1iota.com/)\n* [Lionsgate](https://lionsgatescreenings.com/signup)\n* [Universal](https://www.universalpictures.com/)\n\nAdvance Screenings is more of an aggregator of promotional screenings rather than test screenings as such. Plus, it requires a Facebook login; the rest are just email a signups. Fair warning on Gofobo\u2014they also send you contests and stuff, which are usually movie related but also clog up the ol\u2019 inbox. I just learned about Everyone Sez. It appears to primarily be about consumer surveys, but I\u2019m told they sometimes get early movies screenings or testing for trailers.\n\nIf you know of others, let me know in the replies and I\u2019ll update the list. **ETA: Thanks, u/Area51_Spurs**\n\n**Edit 2:** As u/CourtClarkMusic pointed out, many of these services also hook you up with promotional screenings, which are not the same thing. If you get a screening within a week or two of the movie's release, they're not trying to test it out; they do *want* you to spread the word. If you see it months in advance (or years, as I've seen sometimes), with incomplete effects, sound, color, etc, they don't want you to talk about it publicly before it's released.\n\n#Would You Like to Know More?\n\nKevin Goetz is the CEO and founder of the entertainment research firm Screen Engine, which does a lot of his screenings. He wrote a great book about test screenings called *Audience-ology: How Moviegoers Shape the Films We Love*. He also has a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7JWbUrfecxHxymlK46BvFf?si=d0419296a2814ad0) and a [Substack](https://kevingoetz360.substack.com/) where he discusses test screenings with high-profile industry people.\n\nAnd you should check out David F. Sandberg's (*Lights Out*, *Shazam*) [video about the test screening process](https://youtu.be/Fnvk9MNokPw). (He's also just got a great YouTube channel in general.\n\nI also [wrote a little bit](https://toomuchfilmschool.substack.com/p/how-to-get-into-test-screenings) about what it's like to go to a test screening, if you're interested. Or you can just sign up at the links above and find out for yourself.",

I\u2019m curious which horror movie genuinely scared you without cheap shocks, and what specific elements\u2014storytelling, visuals, silence, or themes\u2014made it feel so effective and unsettling.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve grown to dislike fan casting and pre release theorizing. Not because imagination is bad but cause people\u2019s imagination keeps getting mistaken for obligation.\n\nOn its own, fancasting stays harmless, obviously. The issue starts when those ideas stop being treated as speculation and start being treated as promises. Headcanon hardens into expectation, expectation turns into outrage, and it\u2019s disgusting and disappointing to see.\n\nThe troubling part is not enthusiasm but the certainty of it, the belief that wanting two characters together means the story owes you that outcome. The belief that an actor fitting your mental image of a character, now means the creators are wrong for choosing someone else. Once fans move from interpretation to demand, especially when those demands target writers, directors, or actors, engagement turns corrosive.\n\nThe overanalysis also feels exhausting, every goddamn teaser, trailer, and soundtrack cue gets dissected like a legal document. People mine frames for proof to support a narrative already written in their heads. Entire theories get built before the story exists! Most films do not get treated this way, we usually let them unfold. Why certain fandoms get demanding is beyond me.\n\nCertain fandoms grow so large they become insular. Assumptions reinforce each other, disappointment escalates when reality fails to comply with their ships or fancasts. At that point, reactions feel less about the story and more about unmet personal validation.\n\nSo where is the line? Are we interested in stories, or only in seeing our own expectations confirmed on screen. Where does passionate engagement end and creative interference begin? And how do fandom spaces bring back curiosity and patience without killing the fun?",

        "content": "My dad is admittedly not into what he calls 'cartoon' movies. And adding subtitles on top of that was almost enough to make him turn tail and put in 'Grumpy Old Men' to watch for the umpteenth time. But I held fast. And maybe because I had only just recovered from a bad bout of work drama, he simply sighed and resigned himself to the other side of my sofa.\n\n10 minutes in, and I turn to him and noticing him fidgeting a bit or closing his eyes momentarily. Then the railway chase kicked in and suddenly he was alert and watching so intently that I almost forgot to watch the movie and not him. He laughed at our lovable band of pirates. 'Whoa'd everytime the airships came on screen. And held his breath everytime Pazu and Sheeta were in danger. By the end of the movie, he was left in this loop of \"Wow\" and \"That was amazing!\" \n\nI had seen this movie twice before, in high school and then college. Both by myself and with a friend. And yet somehow seeing it with my dad, and being able to see his reaction to his very first viewing, it was such a different atmosphere. It reminded me of all those years growing up and watching movies on Saturday nights as a family. The only night when all of us could be together.\n\nAnd just remembering these memories, especially right after Christmas, was truly such a great gift. We haven't been having the greatest year all around, and sometimes it gets so hard just to keep going. But seeing this movie has just rekindled that childhood magic for me. And in all honesty, that is better than any Christmas gift I could ask for.\n\nAn absolutely beautiful film and one deserving of every praise and award! If you haven't seen it, please let this be your invitation to go and see it. And if you have seen it, isn't it about time for a rewatch?",

My daughter absolutely loves the Christmas aesthetic, and the train but once the elves  and Santa show up in the movie it was like being a little kid again hearing and seeing her so excited I could not help but cry a bit. Which the soundtrack, and hints of Christmas music in the back I genuinely felt such a connection to my childhood and having that wonderful Christmas feeling again of like being at my parents and grandparents house where everything felt so alive and happy. I feel like as a young teen this movie doesn\u2019t hit, and it\u2019s really just another film, but as an adult with children I really feel like it\u2019s worth the time with your little ones. I know it\u2019s old prolly not worth the read but I just wanted to have my thoughts out there. ",

When Joanna returns to claim custody of Billy, the ensuing court battle takes a toll on everyone concerned. I love this film, good performances from Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Justin Henry. It\u2019s a very realistic film which at points some parents separate and one has to become a single parent to their little child. The film was very well deserving at winning the Oscar for Best Picture that year and Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep winning the Oscar for both Best Actor and Best Actress. If you haven\u2019t seen the film it\u2019s a must watch.",

        "content": "General Hummel (Ed Harris) was portrayed as the main antagonist, obviously along with the other 17 marines that went rouge with him. But he wasn't a normal \"bad guy\". We dont find out until way later that his true intentions were to bluff the Pentagon (with the threat of those 15 VX-gas warheads aimed at the heart of San Fransisco + the tourists they were holding hostage) into paying out $100 million dollars (from a shady slush fund full of proceeds from illegal arms sales that the pentagon makes) so he could distribute $1 million dollars to each one of the 83 marines families that had died under his command over the years, and then pay the other rogue marines a mil each. Pretty noble agenda, but at the same time, not so much.\n\nOur first inkling of who the REAL bad guys are was revealed when the Navy Seals entered the shower room, got surrounded, and then slaughtered.\u00a0[Captains Frye and Darrow](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCHteEFvEum8Xu7sQZGIP8Waow1OLitqJfweF-Pq3Ods3oCPKD2bNjsRZGtW2gWr1rlTMu9Q_S94br0FqDhH8Fa40gaT-nsI_YmE0MjWqzMcQ2meV8m6HpYNqfQV8ZQPLmKPuEo3DtQO0/s1600/vlcsnap-2014-03-10-16h04m01s12.png)\u00a0(Gregory Sporleder and Tony Todd) both have a moment during\u00a0[that scene](https://youtu.be/-PNJ5e8Qq3g)\u00a0where they are both shown, how do I put this, to be enjoying slaughtering those navy seals a little too much???\n\nAs the movie progresses, it still kind of feels like Hummel is the bad guy. But then after he gives the ok to launch the first VX-gas rocket bc the pentagon missed the deadline, and then changes the landing coordinates of the rockets mid-flight, shifting it from heading right for the football stadium full of people out to the open ocean, his true intentions are finally revealed. He was just trying to bluff the pentagon.\n\n[And then we get one of the most intense scenes from all 90's action movies.](https://youtu.be/hiJUZjv7xP4)\u00a0(In my opinion). \"This mission was based on the threat of force. I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I am out of my fucking mind? We bluffed. They called it. The mission is over.\" And then Captain Frye busts out such a creepy reply, revealing that HE is the true antagonist of the movie (Captain Darrow as well); \"Who ever said anything about bluffing General?\" That was such an eerie scene. He also was the last rouge marine to go down (I think??), suffering\u00a0[probably the most gruesome death](https://clip.cafe/the-rock-1996/im-gonna-choke-million-bucks-out-of-youre-gonna-die/)\u00a0of them all. (Well,\u00a0[Captain Darrow becoming \"The Rocket Man\"](https://youtu.be/DNg8OCIMZgI?t=31)\u00a0was pretty freaking brutal too, fitting for the movie's 2nd leading antagonist.) I love this movie, and the very well-written switch up of the main antagonists.",
