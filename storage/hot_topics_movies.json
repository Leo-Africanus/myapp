When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

        "content": "I never write on reddit but I felt the Need to talk about this movie because It became my favorite movie of all time. First of all, the characters: the characters are great, between the three, the villian is who is the most lackluster, but even then, it's like and 8,5 out of ten simply because of the lack of plot relevance that I felt, since the movie Is centered around the other two characters, which are the best thing about this movie. Oh my God I have Watch some other movies with Clint Eastwood but in this one he really shined the most, even if he is not the most interesting character he is still my favorite. The Ugly Is the One that as I said Is the most interesting but also the most espressive character of the movie, I don't have much to say about him but he simply got me invested so much in the story that he had to be mentioned. Now, the story Is interesting, the movie Is also funny sometimes and the ending Is an actual master piece. The movie went on for 3 hours but I loved the characters so much that I think It should have been longer, especially focusing on the Bad. What I think is the biggest problem is the war stuff which was still good, but the lowest part of the movie. I thought that the music was also really good, It was perfect for the ending. Now, to get to the best thing about this and all of Sergio Leone's movies: how unpredictable they are. I thought from the start that the Good would have died, but he didn't. I also thought that the Ugly would have shared the Good's same fate, but he didn't either. The final scene was really great and I honestly couldn't even think of how Sergio Leone could have made It better. One final thing that I loved were the shots. They are so creative, and I also loved how there wasn't much blood, not that I care but he always found a way to hide It: the First scene, the pillow and many others. Overall this movie was great and watching It dubbed in my language really improved my experience, since the dubbers were absolutely phenomenal. I really can't wait to watch the others when I have time. Edit: I Say tons of negative things but this my favorite movie of all time. I Simply thought that people didn't want to see me ranting about how cool and perfect that movie is, even if it is.",

        "content": "There's lots of examples of actors displaying complicated emotions spectacularly, like Toni Collette in Hereditary showing all the various ways someone would express their grief, but I honestly can't think of any scenes in any movie where someone just falls completely flat. The closest I can think of is Anne Hathaway in Interstellar explaining how love is the one thing the universe can't measure, but honestly I think thats more of a problem with the writing than her acting. I think it'd be very interesting to see what actors get wrong sometimes in these difficult situations.",
