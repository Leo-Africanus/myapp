I noticed that in the pre- and mid-credit scenes they teased more adventures for the characters, but as far as I know a sequel is not in the works for this movie based on a video game.\n\nThe same thing happened with The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) with Henry Cavill.  Further adventures were teased in the credits, but no sequel happened.\n\nI know there are multiple reasons why this happens.  The movie is a flop, or its stars movie on to bigger and better projects.  I'm just wondering what other movies teased sequels that just never happened.\n\nNOTE:  As many have mentioned, there is a sequel for Uncharted in the works that I somehow missed.  It sparked the initial question, which is still valid.",

        "content": "Audiences have come to know the original American Pie series as an example of teen comedy revivalism that relies on crude humor to do most of the heavy lifting. I don\u2019t really want to get into whether the humor or the manner of tackling certain subjects still holds up to this day. Personally I want to take this moment to highlight an ingredient which, in my humble opinion, is essential to the charm of the original series \u2013 I\u2019m going to ignore the spin-offs here \u2013 and that is its subtle, but effective wholesomeness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Deep down American Pie 1 &amp; 2 in particular are movies about growing up, overcoming, learning and moving forward. The common thread throughout all of this is the search for and the preserving of a human connection, whether it\u2019s a lifelong friendship or a family relationship. The characters, as immature as they may be, all stumble along the way but in the end find out that the world has other and better things in store for them than what they thought they were looking for in the beginning. It\u2019s almost as if these movies when all is said and done do want to convey a message: you\u2019re an ignorant kid who\u2019s going to mess up and growing up you will continue to mess up, but you\u2019ll learn and you\u2019ll always have your friends and your family to learn from and they will always learn along with you.\n\n\u00a0Adding to this is the fact that there seems to be a genuine chemistry between the cast members, which includes both the main as well as the side characters. To top it off the original movies serve up a nostalgic soundtrack that reminds me \u2013 and I do realize that I am showing my age here \u2013 of a time where the world at least seemed to be a much more hopeful and optimistic place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Maybe the jokes didn\u2019t age well. Maybe the way these movies go about certain specific subjects didn\u2019t age well. Be that as it may, there\u2019s one thing to me that definitely does hold up. A quality that is missing from the vast majority of movies of that ilk which came out at the time: a nostalgic comforting heart.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0To the next step!\u00a0",

So I decided to post a (nonexhaustive) list of famous movies that share a name with another major release that is not as well known. This is actually a phenomenom I've thought about alot over the years. \n\n1. Running Scared- Classic 80's comedy starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines vs. 2006 Paul Walker action movie.\n\n2. Gladiator- Early 90s boxing movie starring a young Cuba Gooding Jr vs. Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning sword and sandal epic.\n\n3.

        "content": "Way back in the early to mid 90s as a teenager, when I started expanding my film viewing to include non-English language films.  \nI watched a film on the telly, probably Channel 4.  \nI think it was from North Africa(Morocco, Algeria,  possibly Tunisia). It was a sort of coming of age film, about a boy.    \nThe two key scenes that have stuck with me. The first one, is where he tells his older friends/cousins that he can still convince his mother to take him to the communal bathhouse, (instead of having to go with his father to the mens side) where he can spy on the women.  \nThe second one involves the main boy being given the used chewing gum, of a pretty girl, he then gives the wad of gum to a local pensioner who is slightly obsessed by said girl and saves it in a small tin.     \nThe details are a little fuzzy, but it is some 30yrs since I happened upon it late one night. Hopefully someone can recognise the film from my ramblings.",

        "title": "Movies that make you feel sorry for terrible people",
        "content": "I\u2019m referring to films that push the limits on what you would call a bad guy getting their comeuppance. We all like seeing it happen, but at what point are you just as bad as they are? The first movie in this category I want to talk about is Bully. It\u2019s based on a True story, in the late 90s some kids came to hate a friend of theirs so they brutally murdered him. The most bizarre aspect of the story is that 2 of the boys that participated had never met him before in their entire lives.    \n   In the movie, the murder victim is definitely a rapist and an abusive bully towards his only friend. In real life, he was possibly a rapist, certainly an abusive bully to his friend but the movie omits the fact that they both were (they would often mock a man with Down syndrome in their neighborhood and throw things at him). Feeling sorry for him is a challenge, but if you read his autopsy you just might. He was bludgeoned in the head with a baseball bat hard enough to fracture 2 vertebrae, received multiple stab wounds in the neck, abdomen, and chest, before they finally slit his throat. All of that plays out on screen pretty faithfully. The director of the film is a known creep I believe, but it\u2019s a solid crime flick imo. \n\nOne more movie I\u2019ll name is Hard Candy. It\u2019s a vigilante story. A teenage girl meets up with a grown man she spoke with in a chatroom and goes home with him, where she proceeds to drug and torture him. There\u2019s a \u201ccastration\u201d scene that had me thinking \u201cthis is probably what everyone wants, but\u2026it\u2019s just wrong\u201d The movies ending fell flat for me, but I\u2019d say give it a watch. Feel free to add movies that fit into this category.",

About Time is about the FEELING of it. \n\nMost time travel movies are about fixing mistakes or saving the world. This is about a guy trying to live a better life. be a better son, husband, dad. No crazy paradoxes or multiverse headaches. That alone makes it hit way harder than any other time travel movie.\n\nMost time travel movies make you wish you could go back and fix stuff. About Time makes you wanna enjoy what you\u2019ve got right now. \n\nHIGHLY recommend. ",

        "content": "I just watched the Nicolas Cage film 'Time to Kill' from 1989. Google said that it was on Roku and that's where I watched it. Roku said the runtime was 1 hour and 43 minutes. The movie cut right when the credits would have started. It was so jarring of a cut, I looked to see if I could find another version of the ending to see if I missed something. There is apparently a version of the film on YouTube.This version has a runtime of 1 hour and 40 minutes and plays through the whole credits. If you search Google (which pulls from IMDb I believe), IMDb, and the Wikipedia article; it says the runtime is 1 hour 50 minutes.\n\n  \nI have noticed this happening a lot. I've had a DVD box in hand and it'll give one time on the back, that will match Wiki but not match IMDb. I'll find movies on YouTube with opening and closing credits that match  Wiki but not the IMDb runtime. 5-7 minutes seems to be the usual difference.\n\n  \nAnd this says nothing about streaming services that add in the ad lengths to the run time.\n\n  \nSo the question is: what is the best source for a film's actual runtime? Is there one? I would personally use the time on a DVD box over anything I'm currently aware of but I don't always have a box (such as my above example). Would the fact that I see a fairly standard 5-7 minute difference just be one source is factoring in credits? What are your thoughts?",

        "content": "With brutal and blood films it is often a race to the bottom. If you make a low budget crappy movie, just put some controversial and grusom scenes in the movie, and a bit of nudity, and it will sell. It has worked for movies like \"A Serbian Film\", \"The Human Centipede\" and many more, but which movie are grusom and brutal, yet actually good movies?\n\nI absolutely love:\n\n* Eden Lake (2008)  \n  * A hard and bloody watch, but it is so good and feels real! This sadistic teen feels like a kid you have met in your own life!\n* Rambo 4 (2008)  \n  * Sylvester Stallones and my favorite Rambo movie! Bloody and brutal when naive missionaries attempt to bring Jesus to brutal warlords. A hard watch, beautiful cinematography, and satisfying ending!  \n* No Escape (2015)  \n  * Uncomfortably intense as a normal family attempts to escape a civil war. The movie features tons of merciless killing, and even a scene where an adult man attempts to physically force a young child to shoot her own father. It is uncomfortable, but it is just so tense and well executed.",
