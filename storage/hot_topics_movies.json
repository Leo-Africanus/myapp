        "content": "*A man tries to befriend his charismatic new neighbour, but it soon threatens to ruin both of their lives.*  \n  \nDirector: Andrew DeYoung\n\nCast: Tim Robinson, Paul Rudd, Kate Mara, Jack Dylan Grazer\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [91%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friendship_2024)\n\n**Metacritic:** [78/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/friendship/critic-reviews/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Chase Hutchinson - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson)[TheWrap](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2205) \n\n&gt;Never could the story be described as a series of sketches haphazardly stitched together as many comedies can fall into being. It looks and feels like a drama that is coming apart at the seams as Robinson careens his way through it.\n\n[Fred Topel - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/fred-topel)[United Press International](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2795)\n\n&gt;In Friendship, the world around Craig reacts appropriately to his inappropriate behavior. So whereas an Adam Sandler character, or Bill Murray before him, would endear himself to the audience, Craig just digs himself deeper and deeper.\n\n[Marshall Shaffer ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/marshall-shaffer)\\- [Slant Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/821) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;But even for those in the audience whose mileage only goes so far with Robinson\u2019s schtick, *Friendship* has more to offer than cringe-inducing, often bawdy humor. He and DeYoung expertly skewer the rituals that trap men in prisons of consumption and estrange them from their emotions. The film is deeply attuned to male malaise, though it steers away from offering anything resembling an overly academic thesis about its roots. More than anything, *Friendship* makes the conditions of modern masculinity feel as weird to watch as they are to understand\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;Robinson\u2019s brand of middle-class psycho surrealism works perfectly in bite-size sketch-comedy doses. Stretched out to feature length, a character like Craig simply stops making sense.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Jacob Oller](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jacob-oller) \\- B-\n\n&gt;But it all relies on the chemistry between the abrasive Robinson and the too-cool Rudd. Their dynamic, either playing off each other or playing with the idea of each other when they\u2019re not sharing the screen, is strong, and DeYoung keeps them both contained to the right frequencies throughout the film. I certainly wish Kate Mara had more to do, or even to react to, as Craig\u2019s wife, but she makes her moments count. And, for better or for (much, much) worse, *Friendship* is one for the boys.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "A few days ago I watched Nocturnal Animals after seeing JG and Michael Shannon in the cast and I'll watch anything with those two in it. My god I never expected to be rattled this much. Not by the actual events that take place but the fictional ones. \nThe initial scene where Tony's (Edward's book character/self) family gets run off the road by a couple cars full of seemingly drunk losers and the events of that whole portion have stuck in my mind more than any movie scene has in a while. Aaron Taylor Johnson absolutely stole the show and managed to make me despise his character more than any villain I've seen in the past year or two. Just the pure evil behind his eyes and the way he toys with Tony and his family is absolutely terrifying. He haunts this entire movie. \nI'm struggling to describe the way it makes me feel but God damn if this movie wasn't great. I enjoyed the irl portion as well but the book scenes blew me away. ",
