McQueen says, \u201cJay loves Sharon. That's what's up. And he knows, as sure as God made little green apples, that one of these days that Polish prick's [Roman Polanski] gonna fuck things up and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.\u201d \n\nI may be reading into this a little much (or maybe this was obvious) but I just realized that this quote may have more importance than I had initially thought. At the end of the movie, we know that Sharon Tate ultimately survives the Manson murders in contrast to what actually happened. Is it possible that this quote from Steve McQueen may have been Tarantino\u2019s thoughts for how Polanski and Tate\u2019s marriage would have worked out if she had survived? Especially since Polanski has turned out to be an extremely awful person, this may have been the thing that McQueen was pointing to when he said that Polanski\u2019s going to fuck things up one day. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

And from a strictly entertainment standpoint, you could write up a million different scripts that would put Private Ryan to shame.\n\nAlso, the few movies I have seen about Japanese in WW2 tend to portray them as noble warriors when in reality they were every bit as evil and diabolical as the Nazis, and committed some of the worst atrocities of the last hundred years.  \n\nTheir treatment of POWs was also probably the worst fates suffered during any US military war. They would literally mass execute captured soldiers and sailors, often by beheading....\n\nWhy is there no Inglorious Bastards Japanese version to date?",

There is no championship to win, it's just kids having fun. And while there is the subplot with the snobby Little League team midway through the film, it's just one of several episodes in the film's storyline and the film gleefully subverts the \"championship game\" by having it be a completely one-sided affair where the gang crushes the Little Leaguers (in no small part due to Ham's trash talking behind the plate). It's another way \"The Sandlot\" is such an endearing classic. Championship games are not nearly as important as saving the Baby Ruth ball from the Beast.",

        "title": "The humanity in Die Hard and Lethal Weapon surprised me.",
        "content": "I was born way past the old days of action movies. I grew up on fast cuts and shaky cams before John Wick came to end them all. \n\nWhen I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger movies like Predator or Commando, where he is basically a machine dressed up to kill, I thought that is how every old action movie works. Explosions, cool one liners and fearless heroes. \n\nThis is why Die Hard and Lethal Weapon surprised me quite a bit. John McClane is not one of those indestructible heroes. He does not shoot with infinite ammunition. Yes, he does some pretty wild stuff, like jumping from rooftops, but there is also a side of him that makes him very interesting. A touch humanity that is caught when he talks to the police officer or his wife. I like that very much. \n\nThe same goes for Lethal Weapon. I thought this would be a buddy comedy series with more style than substance. But one of Mel Gibson's early scenes in the franchise revolves around him sticking a gun into his mouth during a night full of grief and suicidal thoughts. And the aging part of the team has a whole family to care for.\n\nNow yes, Lethal Weapon is a fun buddy cop comedy series. But the heroes have backgrounds, souls and feelings that are not left alone between explosions.\n\nThis is why those two movie franchises (I have only seen the first two Die Hards so far) surprised me with some unexpected depth.\n\n\nEdit: It's cool to see all the discussions, conversations and dialogues my post spawned. I am also very thankful for all your recommendations, such as First Blood, The Last Boy Scout and Total Recall.",

        "content": "I'll be brutally honest and say it: I didn't understand shit. And I'd love to, so if someone could open my eyes, I'd appreciate it.\n\nThis movie is so abstract in its narrative and story telling that I'd dare to say it would be hard for anyone to even grasp half of it on their first watch. I was doing okay at the start, until the end of summer. By that point the movie lost me completely, I was so confused and overwhelmed. And it's a shame, because I would've loved to understand everything in this first watch and consider It a masterpiece like a lot of people do. Hell, I still want to. Is it a masterpiece and I just couldn't grasp its greatness because of its non-conventional, messy and abstract narrative? Maybe. Probably.\n\nInitially, my thoughts are that the film revolves about the complexities of life and the steps one go through in the proccess of living (adolescence, adulthood...) with its ups and downs (the happy moments we saw in Okinawa and the sad, cruel moments we saw from then on). I'm missing many things like what the Ether represents, why Yuichi did that at the end, the end of the movie itself, the demise of that one girl in that scene with the comets, but I guess it's a start.",

        "content": "So I had made a post a few weeks ago looking for films that fit into a weird sub genre that I wasn't exactly sure how to identify, but basically films about apocalyptic events that take place away from the core of the action; as in, a traditional apocalypse movie would be something like *The Day After Tomorrow*, whereas I was more interested in things like *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*. *Knock at the Cabin* would also be a more recent example of this.\n\nSomeone mentioned *The Noah* from 1975, and I have no idea how they knew about it, because even with no view count, the Vimeo post has exactly three likes and one comment. It has just over 400 ratings on IMDb, and was reportedly made for just $200,000. Word to the wise, if you find a weird 70s movie and the budget is less than half a million, chances are you're gonna get some good shit. \n\nBasically the entire film is Robert Strauss, a soldier who survived a war we know nothing about, other than that everyone outside this island is dead. The whole film is just about him inventing these imaginary people in his head, represented by voices he responds to but are never visually shown. He eventually grows his imaginary world, which we hear but never see, creating a really interesting experience that wasn't quite like anything I've seen before.\n\nI won't give away the entire thing, because it really was a pretty memorable experience, but it was just nice to see something so different and out of the box. Curious if anyone's ever come across this one.",
