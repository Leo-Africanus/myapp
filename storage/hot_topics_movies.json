Ive had days where I feel amazing but just this undercurrent. Ive seen \u201cher\u201d a few times, once when I was 15, when I was 21 and now. I really appreciate it now. I do use Ai for advice here and there and can\u2019t believe how ahead of its time it is. What I love is such an odd story has such a real connection with me, it shows how amazing love and connection can be, but also just how heartbreaking it can all be, how your Identity is attached to someone else. The colour, imagery music is perfect. This movie breaks my heart but also makes me realise how normal my fucking problems are. Long live the movies!! ",

        "title": "Luca Guadagnino's 'After the Hunt' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/after_the_hunt): 50% (20 reviews) with 6.10 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/after-the-hunt/): 56/100 (11 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Sure, it\u2019s exciting to watch Roberts sprout horns and turn spiky with defensiveness in another great scene when a student questions whether she \u201ccondones othering someone rather than advocating against it.\u201d But we deserve more substantial compensation after spending more than two hours with these people.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-1236356837/)\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ultimately isn\u2019t against-the-grain enough. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie \u2014 he is one of the best filmmakers working \u2014 but \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d isn\u2019t enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/after-the-hunt-review-1235148028/): C\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has been made with a fair amount of craft and intrigue, but it\u2019s also a weirdly muddled experience \u2014 a tale that\u2019s tense and compelling at times, but dotted with contrivances and too many vague unanswered questions. That\u2019s why, in the end, it\u2019s a less than satisfying movie. Do not expect box-office fireworks.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-1236501798/)\n\n&gt; Like most of Guadagnino\u2019s movies, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is very stylish and a lot of fun in a serious kind of way; it\u2019s also a little arch and very self-aware, which the director admits with the last line of the film. The end credits may go back to looking like Woody, but the feel you\u2019re left with is definitely Luca.\n\n-[Steve Pond, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-ayo-edebiri-luca-guadagnino/)\n\n&gt; Naturally, everyone including Alma gets sucked into the scandal, where lofty philosophical principles play less of a role than their proponents might have liked to think. It\u2019s a film that prowls around with blood in its nostrils, watching us as intently as we watch it, and waiting for just the right moment to strike.\n\n-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/julia-roberts-after-the-hunt-review/): 5/5\n\n&gt; Luca Guadagnino misfires with this bafflingly overlong, overwrought #MeToo campus accusation drama from screenwriter Nora Garrett, broadly in the tradition of David Mamet\u2019s Oleanna or Neil LaBute\u2019s The Shape of Things. It is worryingly muddled and contrived, perhaps in need of further script drafts to excavate a clearer and more satisfying drama inside.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/29/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-ayo-edebiri-andrew-garfield-yale): 2/5\n\n&gt; While the picture could have used more drive, perhaps one virtue of its bagginess is the space it creates to provoke. There will be some who dismiss After the Hunt right out of the gate, because they\u2019ll see any attempt to address such issues as playing into the hands of cynical opportunists who reject progress precisely because it is progress. Then there will be those who adore it simply for daring to bring up such seemingly taboo matters. In truth, the movie seems engineered to let each viewer see what they want in it, both the good and the bad. After the Hunt might be confused, and it might even be unsatisfying \u2014 but it also refuses to coddle anyone, and that feels like some sort of victory.\n\n-[Bilge Ebiri, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-after-the-hunt-doesnt-have-that-much-to-say.html)\n\n&gt; It won\u2019t be a watercooler movie in that respect, and it may be a shock to unwary audiences lured in by Roberts\u2019s star wattage. But it could mark another milestone for the actress, being her strongest role since 2000\u2019s Erin Brockovich and an astonishing performance in its very own right. Lars Von Trier, eat your heart out.\n\n-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/08/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-andrew-garfield-1236501325/)\n\n&gt; There are some interesting ideas in After The Hunt, Luca Guadagnino\u2019s star-studded #MeToo treatise; the corrupting nature of privilege, the pandemic of entitlement, toxic feminism and the ideological gulf between generations. And the Italian filmmaker knows how to make a handsome film, the lofty Ivy League spires of Yale University providing a lavish background for this tale of elitism gone sour. Ultimately, however, the film\u2019s inflated self-importance serves to not only overwhelm but also undermine its finer points.\n\n-[Nikki Baughan, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-heads-luca-guadagninos-problematic-metoo-drama/5208358.article)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nA college professor is forced to grapple with her own secretive past after one of her colleagues is faced with a serious accusation.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\n**WRITER**\n\nNora Garrett\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nTrent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nMalik Hassan Sayeed\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nMarco Costa\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- August 29, 2025 (Venice Film Festival)\n\n- October 10, 2025 (worldwide)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n139 minutes\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Julia Roberts as Alma Imhoff\n\n- Ayo Edebiri as Margaret \"Maggie\" Resnick\n\n- Andrew Garfield as Henrik \"Hank\" Gibson\n\n- Michael Stuhlbarg as Frederik Imhoff\n\n- Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as Dr. Kim Sayers",

        "title": "Prior to \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" what was considered the greatest special effects spectacular?",
        "content": "We all know that *2001* was a game-changer, paving the way for sci-fi movies like *Silent Running*, *Star Wars* and *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* in the 70s. \n\nBut if you wanted to show someone (e.g., my kids) the state of the art prior to that, what would you use as an example? What was considered the best special effects movie before *2001*?\n\nI'm mostly familiar with *Star Trek*, but that was a TV show, obviously, and didn't have the budget of a feature film. Would it be something like *Forbidden Planet*? A Ray Harryhausen film? *The Ten Commandments*? \n\nWhat was the movie whose special effects made everyone say \"WOW!\"? \n\nEDIT: Yes, *King Kong* was the OG special effects spectacular and has been one of my favorite films since I was a kid. It was the first movie I intentionally sought out to watch multiple times, but I don't think you can say that there was no progression of special effects between 1933 and 1968! There's a direct line from *King Kong* to Ray Harryhausen and you can't deny that Harryhausen's movies have more technically advanced effects than *Kong*. \n\nEDIT 2: People are suggesting *Metropolis* and other movies from the 20s and 30s. Yes, they're great movies, and yes they were spectacular **in their time**, but I'm looking for the movie that would have had the most spectacular special effects as of the beginning of 1968. If you owned a repertory cinema on March 1, 1968, and you wanted to show your customers the most spectacular special effects movie possible, I don't think you were going to pick *Things to Come* or *The Thief of Baghdad* (or *Citizen Kane*, for that matter). \n\nIt seems like the top candidates are:\n- *Forbidden Planet*\n- *Jason &amp; the Argonauts*\n- *Fantastic Voyage*",

Is there a franchise where watching it in chronological order is as good of an experience (or better!) than watching it in release order? I may get roasted for this but I was thinking star wars would be a decent watch in chronological order. I still think release order would be best but I could see the argument for it.",

For me, it\u2019s Pacino in Heat suddenly exploding with \u201cShe\u2019s got a GREAT ASS!\u201d in the middle of an otherwise stone-cold serious film. Another one that always cracks me up is Daniel Day Lewis screaming \u201cI drink your milkshake!\u201d in There Will Be Blood. What\u2019s the one scene that completely broke the tone for you?",

While peering through the beautiful home's telescope one night, he spies a gorgeous blonde (Deborah Shelton) dancing in her window. But when he witnesses the girl's murder, it leads Scully through the netherworld of the adult entertainment industry on a search for answers -- with porn actress Holly Body (Melanie Griffith) as his guide. I really enjoyed this film one of my favorite DePalma films. The film screams 80s from it\u2019s erotic tone. DePalma homages the film to Hitchcock\u2019s films of Rear Window, Vertigo and Dial M for Murder that deals with the main character Jake being obsessed with the woman next door and also him being claustrophobic. The character of Jake is a guy who has his problems with being a struggling actor but also being a peeping tom. Craig Wasson did a good job in the role. Gregg Henry as Sam Bouchard was good in the role. Melanie Griffith was very likable as Holly. If you haven\u2019t seen the film check it out.",
