I've already put a reserve for 100 tickets (first come first serve) to redditors everywhere.\n\nIf you're in NYC and want to come watch this very special IMAX release + Q&amp;A,\n\njust RSVP: by sending \u201cr/movies + Yourname\u201d to\u00a0[ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com](mailto:ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com)",

        "content": "*Disowned at birth by his wealthy family, Becket Redfellow will stop at nothing to reclaim his inheritance, no matter how many relatives stand in his way.*\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Glen Powell, Margaret Qualley, Jessica Henwick, Topher Grace, Ed Harris, Zach Woods\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [51%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_make_a_killing_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [54 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-make-a-killing/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/how-to-make-a-killing-glen-powell-a24-review/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;How to Make a Killing has the acuity to know that even if you are willing to play such a rigged game in ruthless fashion, you\u2019ll still lose. The film\u2019s magic trick is taking this bleak idea and knowing how to find the fun in such brutal sport.\n\n[Slash Film - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/2104095/how-to-make-a-killing-review/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Powell's Becket recalls similar upwardly mobile antiheroes like Saul Goodman or Michael Corleone, characters who seem to be living a wish fulfillment of righteousness, only to find themselves trapped by the persona they've built up. It's this aspect which Ford addresses most subtly, ultimately making \"How to Make a Killing\" a cleverly scathing indictment of the American dream as it stands. It's also an impressively multi-layered indictment, too, for while it'd be easy (and rather popular) for Ford to point out how the haves and the have-nots aren't all that different from each other if they were able to switch places, the filmmaker instead leans into the complexity and systemic issues surrounding wealth and success. \"How to Make a Killing\" is a movie that sneaks up on you, and like Becket himself, doesn't simply stab you in the chest or punch you in the gut. Instead, it slowly poisons you, leaving you bewildered by the end as to how sick you and the country you live in has become.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/how-to-make-a-killing-review) \\- 'C'\n\n&gt;At the center of it all is Powell, making the same face for an hour and 45 minutes, too unflappable to root for, too smug to magnetize as an inhuman American Psycho. And *How To Make A Killing* needed to pick a side, either of clownish class comedy or of bitter sociopathic satire. Its split-difference approach certainly racks up a sizable body count, but its most battered and bruised victim is the truism it keeps hitting: In America, there are no consequences for the rich, unless other rich people desire it. That\u2019s almost funny, in an empty and respectable way, like how a *New Yorker* cartoon is almost funny, or how Glen Powell is almost a leading man.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/how-to-make-a-killing/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;As someone who absolutely loves any kind of a crime film, \u201cHow To Make A Killing\u201d can be entertaining at times as a morality play wrapped in designer suits and generational spite. It\u2019s juggling a lot more than it needs to, and it never fully synthesizes its most perceptive ideas, but it\u2019s powered by another star performance from Powell, keeping it barely afloat.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Alexander Mooney](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-john-patton-ford/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;The brittle humanity of Ford\u2019s characters is the key ingredient to his film\u2019s grim sense of irony. In a media landscape replete with hot-button satires and airless farces, *How to Make a Killing*\u2019s rejection of formal frippery and easy caricature is refreshing. Ford cultivates an old-school flair while keeping one finger on the pulse of the current moment, shrewdly retooling the canonical story of a rotten family patronage to comment on a quintessential American birthright: the compulsive desire for individual gain.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-margaret-qualley-1236666029/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s likely that 95 percent of the people who go to see \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d will never have seen, or even heard of, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets,\u201d the 1949 British black comedy it\u2019s a remake of \u2014 or, I should say, a reimagining, since for once that marketing-spin term applies. In its day, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d was wickedly outrageous. But in the age of \u201cDexter\u201d and \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cBeef,\u201d \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d just plays as a patchy amusement. Yet I was held by it; the film\u2019s acrid riffs on the hidden depravity of the new greed culture keep it aloft. And each time Margaret Qualley shows up, she gives the movie a charge, because of how her Julia incarnates money hunger cut off from everything else. Qualley somehow makes that fun, maybe because it\u2019s the one thing in the movie that everyone can agree on.",

What are your favorite movie scores or composers?\n\nA great soundtrack can make a movie *so* much more memorable. Even when I\u2019m not watching anything, I\u2019ll sometimes throw on a score in the background because it just sets a mood in a way regular music doesn\u2019t.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ve always really loved John Williams. Any composer would be happy to compose one or two iconic themes, but Williams has \"Star Wars,\" \"Jaws,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Indiana Jones,\" and \"Superman\" under his belt. John Powell has some of the most exciting and emotional music out there. Love his \"How to Train Your Dragon\" scores and he elevates other animated films. And then there\u2019s Joe Hisaishi, whose work on Studio Ghibli films is just beautiful and calming.\n\nI know there are so many incredible scores out there that I probably haven\u2019t even discovered yet, and I\u2019d love some recommendations. What are some soundtracks you keep coming back to? Could be big epic orchestral stuff or quieter emotional scores. What\u2019s a score that stuck with you long after you finished the movie?",
