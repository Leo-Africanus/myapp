        "content": "Hi r/movies! Ben and Indy here. I'm the director/co-writer of GOOD BOY. Indy here is the star of the film. It played lots of festivals, was released in theaters nationwide via IFC earlier this year, and will be streaming on Shudder starting Nov 21st. We're here to answer your questions.\n\n**Our trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4-CRkd\\_74g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4-CRkd_74g)\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA loyal dog moves to a rural family home with his owner, only to discover supernatural forces lurking in the shadows. As dark entities threaten his human companion, the brave pup must fight to protect the one he loves most.\n\nThe film was shot with only myself (Ben) and Kari Fischer (co-producer) on set with Indy, over three years, with more than 400 production days, for a budget of only $70,000.\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back this afternoon, Thursday 11/13, at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "title": "I\u2019m honestly just depressed at the lack of comedy in modern movies",
        "content": "I\u2019m very sure that this has been discussed a million times already because I know the decline in comedy movies over the past decade has been insanely noticeable, but I really just need to vent right now about this whole phenomenon. As someone who was born in the 2000s (literally in 2000) I grew up watching all of these now iconic comedy movies, like Superbad and White Chicks and The Hangover and a billion others. A lot of my really happy moments from when I was a kid is watching a comedy movie with my dad, and interestingly enough, that\u2019s the part that I remember most looking back at my childhood, not the other things in my life like all the arguments my parents were having and stuff like that. And that\u2019s because comedy movies are essentially a form of escapism, that\u2019s why so many plots and subplots in these iconic comedy movies and TV shows are just absurd, we obviously know the chances of them happening in real life are next to nothing, but it\u2019s still funny and allows us to get away from our actually depressing lives for a couple hours. Two male black FBI detectives going undercover as obnoxious rich white girls in order to solve some crime is ridiculous, but it works because it\u2019s so hilarious and unrealistic.\n\nWell the really sad thing now is life has honestly just gotten really depressing overall in the past decade. First we had Covid and all the depressing aspects that came with that, and just in the last 5 years, we\u2019ve had multiple wars that have revealed really terrible social issues and divided pretty much everyone in society. I know the world has never really been peaceful, but I really just feel like the spark in humans has been flushed out in recent years. And I\u2019m not even just talking about major social issues like war and Covid, but just day to day life is depressing for most people I know my age. Hours of doom scrolling on TikTok or Instagram to get that daily release of dopamine and as someone who is addicted to all those social outlets, not only is it insanely unhealthy to mindlessly scroll on your phone for hours all day but it also just really destroys creativity. And this might just be a me thing, but I really don\u2019t enjoy most movies that come out today, not to mention comedy movies that are all just boring and unfunny. There\u2019s a lot of reasons for it, I personally think it\u2019s a combination of comedians turning to podcasts as a source of comedic release instead of movies and the influence of cancel culture. It\u2019s just really sad what\u2019s happening in society right now and it kind of depresses me. Not to mention how AI has literally taken over everything, and I genuinely believe that in 10 years or so, humans creating movies and TV shows might start to become a thing of the past, which is also a terribly scary thought.",

I remembered most of what happened in the movie in a basic sense, so when I watched this and refreshed my memory to the fullest, it came off to me as REALLY twisted, pretty much from everything that happens, and even more so looking back on the context when you realize what's actually going on. It's quite a bit more of a horror film than the actual horror genre in my opinion.  \nSo what are some films you found that genuinely put you off or sincerely unnerved you?",
