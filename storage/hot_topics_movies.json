That\u2019s fine, apart from\u2026 what will happen to her the moment he dies?\n\nWill everything immediately reset, effectively meaning instant \u2018death\u2019 for that version of her, given that she won\u2019t remember any of this? In which case it\u2019s the same as if she had put the gun to her own head and pulled the trigger. Or will her universe carry on, in which case presumably she is arrested and locked up for shooting a man in the head (unless she can get out of it somehow) and then she has to wait for death when the Mimics overcome everyone?\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, then fact that they\u2019re going to \u2018try again\u2019 means absolutely nothing to her, in a way! If someone told me that I was about to die, but not to worry, a version of me would wake up tomorrow, not remembering any of this, and win the lottery, then I wouldn\u2019t be happy, I\u2019d be terrified! The only thing that makes me \u2018me\u2019, is the string of consciousness and memories that I\u2019ve had since I was a child.\n\nSo yeah, every time he was resetting, he\u2019s effectively killing (or condemning to certain death) the Rita who he\u2019s brought that far with him, and she really should have been more alarmed/scared about that prospect.",

        "content": "Question, What are your thoughts on Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula.\n\nI actually quite enjoy this film and I am very impressed with how Coppola made the film. In my opinion, it is a flawed masterpiece and I am amazed with the Costume Designs, Set Designs, and The Special Effects. With the Special Effects, apparently, Coppola hired a visual effects teams, but when they told him what they wanted for practical effects was impossible, Coppola disagreed and fired them and replaced them with his son Roman Coppola, As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer-generated effects, instead using con-set and in-camera methods. I kind have respect Coppola for that, given how the special effects played out\n\nWith the performances, Gary Oldman is great as Dracula, a power monster, but a tragic figure who longs to reunite with his lost love. I know Keanu Reeves get a lot of flack for his accent, and yes its terrible, but I also feel Winona Ryder wasn\u2019t good with her accent either. I also think what doesn\u2019t help him is the fact that Cary Elwes is right in front of you and actually would have made a better Jonathan Harker. But I do think Keanu was good as Jon Harker, but Gary Oldman really outclasses him. Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins are good in their roles as Mina Harker and Van Helsing and Tom Watts is a scene stealer as Reinfeld.\n\nIn my opinion, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula has great visuals, and set designs and good performances, but also there are a few mid performances, and the screenplay was a bit lackluster, but it was an enjoyable experience and regardless, I do like the film.",

Throughout most of the movie, I was struggling to understand the purpose; it felt like it was just some family vacation. As the movie progressed, I started to understand the plot and what was actually happening. \n\n&gt;!Calum (Paul Mescal)'s clear depression and despair was so artfully captured through Sophie's childlike eyes. As an adult, she is in a haze, a blurry haze of partying, etc. but the truth of what happened still weighs on her. The implication of his suicide really hit me hard. !&lt;\n\nAs someone who has gone through what Sophie had gone through, I relate so hard. \n\n&gt;!My father too took his own life when I was 13. It feels exactly like that; life feels like a blurry haze sometimes, and I yearn and seek, and beg for understanding...I don't know what I could have done to prevent this, and I miss him badly. It's just all so confusing!&lt;\n\n  \nThis movie is one of those that you cannot appreciate until you watch the whole thing. I was left reeling, and I think Paul Mescal gave his best, most nuanced performance ever.\n\n  \nThoughts?",

        "content": "I've probably seen this movie four or five times over the years, as a teenager, in my twenties, in my thirties, but I never was fully immersed in it because of various circumstances, whether it was watching it with a friend, watching it on low volume, distractions, etc.  However, I watched it yesterday in the dark on my laptop with my ear buds in, and it was tremendous.  What a perfect slasher.  First of all, there is no fat in this movie.  It jumps right into the darkness, with Loomis driving with the psychiatric hospital nurse, stumbling upon the patients walking around outside in the dark.  The atmosphere is eerie and unsettling.  I never realized how much heavy mask breathing from Myers stalking perspective there was.  It was super creepy.  You've got Laurie just trying to go about her day babysitting on Halloween night and the movie has a nice slow burn to it building up to a boil as Myers inches closer.  The cinematography is great.  There are countless iconic scenes.  Now I need to re-watch part two and see how it holds up.  Is the original Halloween still your favorite in the franchise?",

He's in a ton of movies and television shows, and I think most of them are enjoyable/watchable.\n\n  \nSo, who would you pick?  Would you go with someone like John Cazale, who's movies are all bangers but there's only like five, or Eric Roberts, who's been in a bajillion movies but most kinda suck, or somewhere in between?",
