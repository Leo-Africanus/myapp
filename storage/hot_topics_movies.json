        "content": "I subscribe to Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and a few smaller services like Dropout and Nebula.\n\nAnd yet every time I think of an older movie I want to watch, it's not on any of them. Sometimes it's on one of the services I don't subscribe to, like Peacock, but a lot of the time it doesn't seem to be available for streaming anywhere without \"renting\" it. \n\nAre we really back in the 90s where I've got to rent movies and make sure i finish them within 48 hours before my rental is up? \n\nI certainly prefer to watch movies straight through in one sitting, but I'm busy. I have a life, a toddler, and things that demand my attention. I'm lucky if I get an hour of uninterrupted time in an evening to watch stuff. I already pay for too many services; I shouldn't have to pay-per-view and still worry about finishing a movie before it expires. \n\nThis sucks. \n\nAs for buying physical media, that's a great solution... sometimes. But like a lot of people these days, I don't want to be tethered to my couch. I watch across a series of devices, from my TV in my house, to the TV in my shop, to my phone.\n\nAnd yes, I know about the high seas, but that's not for me. I *want* to stream content legitimately, but damn if they're not making it difficult. ",

The ending of the workprint version which was rejected by the studio is the same aside from a few shots. The original script has the same ending with a very melodramatic scene between Derek and Sweeney (Avery Brooks) added on at the end.\n\n\u201cThe machines used humans as processors in the first draft of The Matrix but the studios made them change it to batteries\u201d \n\nEvery version of The Matrix script has dialogue comparing humans to batteries. A comic by Neil Gaiman published as a tie-in with the first movie portrays the matrix this way, which was an artistic liberty on his end.\n\n\u201cDarren Aronofsky purchased the remake rights to Perfect Blue to steal a shot for Requiem for a Dream.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t even plausible. He could barely afford to make his previous movie (which cost less than 100k) and wouldn\u2019t have conceivably been able to purchase remake rights to a coveted film out of pocket so he could copy two shots which he could do for free anyways.",

        "content": "It\u2019s weird how sometimes I can find out supposed \u201ctrue stories\u201d play a little fast and loose with the facts and it just doesn\u2019t bother me. The film is so good and entertaining I don\u2019t care. Catch Me if You Can? It\u2019s not one of those films. \n\nMan, is a damn good film. Great music, script, acting, directing. It\u2019s incredible. It fires on all cylinders. Except one. The \u201ctruth\u201d cylinder(I can\u2019t believe i just wrote that. It\u2019s late. Give me a break). And this one gets to me. A lot. \n\nMany of you know by now Frank Abagnale is/was full of it. Most of the crap he claimed to do he never did. But the real story is how he was conning people all the while he was a supposed \u201cstraight arrow\u201d. He was never a cheque expert. Never worked for or with the FBI. He holds no patents. All his company does is peddle a shady cyber security subscription program that got caught selling its users data. \n\nThe real story is how this huge blockbuster movie came out, nominated for Academy Awards, made by the biggest names you could ever get for a movie at the time. Spielberg, Hanks, DiCaprio? Frank himself even did press for the movie!\n\nAnd not a single MAJOR newspaper, TV network or magazine looked into the shit Frank spew. How is that possible? Oh a few small papers did here and there. They went nowhere. Frank was still making insane speaking fees as of a few years ago. Telling the same lies. If this happened today? That shit would be everywhere. Spielberg conned by a small time crook? Hanks? Leo? JOHN WILLIAMS???\n\nThankfully his BS is a lot more well known, but all most people know is that most of the movie didn\u2019t happen as they say it happened. Most people can forgive that. They don\u2019t know about the real victims. The ones he was conning even after the books came out. Or the women he assaulted. \n\nI suggest everyone give this link a watch to find out the real truth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVe-NF75-2s\n\nSo I say a sequel deserves to get made. \u201cCatch Me If You Can, Again\u201d. If Zuckerberg &amp; Social Network are getting one, why not Frank &amp; Catch Me if You Can?\n\nIt should be about the failure of the mass media to do the thing they should be doing. Looking into and verifying unbelievable claims. That this guy was able to go as long as he did, as publicly as he did? It\u2019s a real indictment on the western media. Yet another one.",

        "content": "*A man returns to dismantle his family's house, where they were murdered in war, to rebuild it elsewhere. When the killer, a Red Army commander, tracks him down, a brutal cross-country pursuit begins.*\n\nDirector: Jalmari Helander\n\nCast: Jorma Tommila, Stephen Lang, Richard Brake, Jaakko Hutchings\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [95%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sisu_road_to_revenge)\n\n**Metacritic:** [82 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sisu-road-to-revenge/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sisu-2-road-to-revenge-movie-review-2025) \\- 3.5/4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s an absolute blast of an action movie, another showcase for Jalmari Helander\u2019s increasing skill with action choreography and inventive set pieces. As the wounds and scars become such a part of Tommila\u2019s performance that we can barely see the human underneath, the film leans into the mythology of this figure, someone who can overcome the impossible to achieve his goal. It\u2019s tempting to end by noting how welcome it would be to watch him take down fascists for a third time, but this one will be hard to top.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Rocco T. Thompson](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/sisu-road-to-revenge-review/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;Fans of the first film will know that the title is taken from an \u201cuntranslatable\u201d Finnish word that speaks to a particularly obstinate type of bravery, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a more resonant metaphor for the spirit of the country\u2019s people than what Helander simply, elegantly gives us here with a pile of wood and one very determined old man.\n\n[BloodyDisgusting - Meagan Navarro](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3902803/sisu-road-to-revenge-review-bigger-bloodier-splatstick-sequel-brings-crowd-pleasing-fun-fantastic-fest/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Helander continues to have a blast with inventing wildly silly ways to dispatch bad men during World War II. *Road to Revenge* kicks off another high-octane road actioner, but this time, the personal stakes ramp up the energy and violence to a breathless degree. It\u2019s the type of movie designed to be seen with a rowdy crowd, primed for the kinetically paced stunt showcase. A no frills, straightforward plot yields a bounty of splatstick action fun in a sequel that dials up the chaos with triumphant style.\n\n[IGN - Matt Donato](https://www.ign.com/articles/sisu-2-road-to-revenge-review) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Sisu: Road to Revenge offers a ludicrous and punishing take on the same fantastic action-forward indulgence as the original, resulting in a sublime outcome. Writer-director Jalmari Helander's brand of excitement is loud, resilient, and pushes breakneck intensity to the maximum.",

        "content": "Same question asked some years ago [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l9asnk/oldest_movie_with_actoractress_still_alive/), related question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicfilms/comments/y2m15j/oldest_movie_with_a_living_actress_in_a_leading/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwghrd/oldest_movie_with_actoractress_still_alive/)\n\nWith the recent passing of child actress [Marilyn Knowlden ](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461490/)(last semptember at 99), and child actress [Cora Sue Collins](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172237/) (last april at 98), the best I could find is [Journey for Margaret (1942) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034923/)from the previous record of 1931 of Ms Knowlden and 1932 of Ms Collins, that is, I couldn't find any movie with a living cast member in the entire 1930's, that is a big thing in my opinion, the end of an era...\n\nIn an uncredited role the record was from the daughter of Marlene Dietrich, Maria Riba, who had roles as a baby as far back as 1934, but [she died](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728958/) a week ago at 100.\n\nThe best I could find in an uncredited role is for[ Caren Marsh](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550514/) who at 106 years old had an uncredited role in [Rosalie (1937) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029499/)\n\nIn a leading role, the record was from June Lockhart in the[ Son of Lassie (1946) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038097/), but she [died](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478/) two weeks ago, so the record for the oldest movie with a living cast member in a leading role is to Ann Blyth (the best I could find) she was the lead actress in [Swell Guy (1946)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039878/).\n\nPlease if someone could find oldest movies for my 3 related questions.\n\n1. Oldest movie with a living cast member, uncredited or credited\n2. Oldest movie with a living cast member in a credited role\n3. Oldest movie witha a living cast member in a leading role,\n\nTo summarize, the best I could find is\n\n1. Rosalie 1937, Caren Marsh is alive at 106\n\n~~2 Journey for Margaret 1942, Margaret O'Brian is alive at 88~~\n\nI edit, I could find child actor Terry Killburn (in 20 days he will be 99) who had a credited role in [Lord Jeff (1938) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030384/), so all hope is not lost, we still have living actors from the 1930s!\n\n3 Swell Guy 1946, Ann Blyth is alive at 97,\n\nsome replies mention Bambi 1942 as the oldest movie with a cast member in a leading role alive, I personally do not consider that a leading role in the traditional way, but I mentioned it because in a sense it is a leading role, [Donnie Dunagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Dunagan) (who is returning to acting in 2025 after a 83 year hiatus) is the actor with more dialogue in the film.",
