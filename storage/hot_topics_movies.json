But usually Matt Damon is one of those actors who doesn\u2019t entirely disappear into his roles. He is a great actor, but I\u2019m always like \u201coh yeah that\u2019s Matt Damon - that\u2019s his charm, his cadence, his vibe\u201d. It is rare that I ever not think of him as Matt Damon in a movie.\n\nBut in this movie, it was the first time I was utterly shaken by a character he played and fully understood him as a separate entity from the usual Matt we see in movies. The way he mixes an insecure, queer vulnerability with almost desperate, yet ice cold cunning and violence - I\u2019ve never seen him like this. It is truly a performance that stands out from his other roles. And it was probably the only time I both reviled and feared him in a movie. Just great all around.",

The one time they didn't argue was when they were kids and they were just pen pals. When they do reunite, Hillary (Hershey) ends up sleeping with the guy CC (Midler) is crushing on. \n\nCC's nasrcissism and Hillary's low self esteem makes it almost impossible for them to get along. Yet the movie insists they're the best of friends. I don't get it. \n\nFriends do argue but I thought Beaches didn't show much of CC and Hillary's bond and what makes them so close.",

I think it\u2019s better because despite it being very gory, that\u2019s not the main aspect of the film, I genuinely feel it\u2019s more of how do these characters survive this insane situation that they are in. And the cast was really good as well. I don\u2019t understand why it seems more people didn\u2019t like it. ",

One good thing I'll say about A Mighty Wind is that it spoofs folk music tastefully, unlike how Spinal Tap really tears down heavy metal!",
