AMA!\n\n**Official Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw)\n\n**More Information**: [https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it](https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it)\n\n**ABOUT PAYING FOR IT**\n\nSet in the late 90\u2019s, PAYING FOR IT follows the trials and travails of Chester (Dan Beirne), a cartoonist and Sonny (Emily L\u00ea), a TV host, who are in a long-term, committed, romantic relationship. When Sonny introduces the idea of opening up their relationship, Chester begins sleeping with sex workers, forcing him to face his issues with intimacy and romance in the process. Based on the best-selling graphic novel by acclaimed alternative-cartoonist Chester Brown, PAYING FOR IT is a \u201cprovocative, hilarious and heartfelt\u201d (The Globe and Mail) personal take on romance and relationships. From writer/director Sook-Yin Lee, the film \u201cdisplays a maturity and thoughtfulness (...) in the messy contradictions we may hold about love\u201d (RogerEbert.com).  Celebrating the vibrant underground comic and zine era through the experiences of cartoonist Brown, PAYING FOR IT connects the past with the present by bringing together emerging comic actors, performance artists, authors, activists and multimedia creators in front of and behind the camera, and it has resonated for festival audiences and critics alike.\n\n**ABOUT SOOK-YIN LEE**\n\nSook-Yin Lee (Writer, Director, Co-Producer) is a Toronto-based filmmaker, musician, actor and broadcaster (CBC, BBC, MuchMusic). She starred in Shortbus, the ground-breaking 2SLGBTQ movie directed by John Cameron Mitchell that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.

        "content": "I just haven't seen this mentioned in discussions.   \n  \nIn this film, humans are killer bees.\n\nMichelle says that modified humans were created in a lab, and they were stronger but also more violent. These modified humans escaped the lab and interbred with other humans, spreading their violent genes.   \n  \nThis is what happened in real life with killer bees. Killer bees were created in a lab by hybridizing african and european bees, hoping to make a more productive, heat tolerant bee. Instead they created an extremely aggressive bee that escaped the lab and interbred with other bees (and replaced other bees).   \n  \nKiller bees sting easily and aggressively, but they still lose their stinger and die when they do. So they are more aggressive, but they kill themselves with their aggression. Their aggression also leads people to euthanize whole hives if they think hybridization is occurring, and it leads people in general to be more afraid of bees. \n\nTeddy is a killer bee. He is unusually aggressive and violent, and through his violence he has doomed himself and his whole hive (earth).   \nTeddy is a literal beekeeper as well as being a bee. He cares for his real bees and maintains their living space, but he is also their master.   \nMichelle is a metaphorical bee (queen bee) and a metaphorical beekeeper as well, and humans are her bees.   \nTeddy stung his beekeeper (Michelle) and was harming other bees, so she euthanized the hive. \n\nObviously, Teddy is depicted as a worker bee in the film. Michelle's company is vast, and she is the queen. Meanwhile, Teddy just works in packaging / shipping and has never even seen her in person before.   \nMichelle said that she admires that bees that do their duty and fulfill their roles no matter the adversity facing them. Teddy has suffered great adversity, but he is not fulfilling his duty / role in society.  \n  \nTeddy is relatively respectful to Michelle when he learns she is royalty, showing that he values this kind of hive hierarchy, maybe the way a bee would. However, he never recognizes her as *the* queen. The film mentions that in colony collapse disorder, bees reject or abandon the queen, and it leads to the colony collapsing. He abandoned his duties and attacked the queen, leading to the colony to collapse. \n\nIn this film, earth is also a literal colony, since andromedans came from elsewhere and created humans to populate the earth. They are not native, and are colonizing it. ",

        "content": "I\u2019m a massive Coen brothers fan so even I\u2019m surprised how long it took me to actually watch Burn After Reading. Unfortunately sandwiched between the cynically incredible No Country for Old Men and the Job like epic of A Serious Man, BAR is even by the Coens standards a bit odd. \n\nIt\u2019s also fucking hilarious \n\nThe story of a volatile low level CIA analyst who after being faced with a demotion due to a (not at all well hidden) drinking problem decides to quit and start writing his memoirs only to find his wife is divorcing him whilst she\u2019s having an affair with a paranoid Treasury department officer, only to THEN have his memoirs unintentionally stolen by two dimwitted gym employees who believe the disc it\u2019s on contains government secrets after sed wife decided to copy his financial records and the disc was accidentally left at sed gym, it\u2019s definitely a twisting narrative with a lot of important characters that play a role. \n\nBut what makes it hilarious is that, though in a conventional espionage this would make for a taut, tense, even dark thriller of multiple secretive players trying to double cross each other (not saying that doesn\u2019t happen here but still), in Burn After Reading it ultimately doesn\u2019t mean anything, literally. \n\nWhilst the macguffin of the CD containing the information is important to several of the characters for varying reasons, the key is that it actually isn\u2019t important to pretty much everyone else. Osborne (the analyst) is in fact so so low down the totem pole of the CIA that even the director of the organisation barely cares that the supposed \u201cclassified information\u201d is attempting to be sold to the Russian embassy (an extra joke is that Osborne was an analyst for the Balkan region so the Russians additionally wouldn\u2019t care even if it was meaningful).\n\nHowever because, with the possible exception of Osbornes wife who was only using it for divorce leverage, everyone else is placing high importance on the disk, namely, THEY think it\u2019s so valuable, it shows just how badly their own egos play against them. It leads to several somewhat unexpected deaths, multiple profanity laden tirades and a very curious chair. \n\nThe added elements of a tradition spy thriller score at points (pointedly when they\u2019re doing something insanely stupid) also helps to really sell the joke, because they\u2019re so much trying to fill the importance of this thing when really none exists. \n\nI think Burn After Reading is a great example of deflating humour really nailing it. Whilst the setups and the situations are themselves hilarious, what makes it funny is how high stakes and important the situation seemingly are to the central players, only to realise that no one else actually cares. It\u2019s the style of humour that the Coens have perfected and is well worth a watch.\n\nAlso Brad Pitt steals the show ",

Spoliers if you haven't seen it yet.\n\n\n\nThe ending to Cars showed Lightning McQueen giving up The Piston Cup to help out The King to finish his last race. As a kid, I never understood why he couldn't just finish and then go out to help The King. However, now as a teenager, I realise the reason was because he learned that trophies are just empty cups. In other words, Lightning is a good sport for giving up the piston cup to make sure The King finished his last race. And Chick got exactly what he deserved.",

Top notch acting and there really just isn't a single boring moment for me. But i had forgotten about Baptiste's last one, as in how weak that was.\n\nThe scene showed that Laura's father made sure that nobody could easily just enter the building they were staying at. There were guards, there was even a dog but somehow Baptiste managed to be so silent that nobody woke up. How could he so easily have entered there? And then the scene in the cell, did they really not check his pockets beforehand? Because somehow he managed to get a small perfume bottle in there. And again, the part before that, I get the lack of any odor from him, but surely it's not like the guards or dog were deaf.\n\nStill though, really enjoyed it regardless.",
