        "content": "This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. \n\nMy theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn\u2019t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching. A film being cheap doesn\u2019t always make the film bad.",

This moment is visible at the 3:31 mark in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0dAqhxfvlg).\n\nWhy does LaPadite ask for the window to be closed? \n\nI had thought that having the window closed &gt;!might make it easier for those hiding below the floorboards to hear the conversation, to alert them of any danger. It's also possible that he doesn't want the German soldiers outside to hear any conversation, but they are standing very far away.!&lt; I really don't know. The whole scene is so carefully designed that I know there must have been some thought behind including this moment.",

        "content": "Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.\n\n\nI mean, I've seen lots of violent movies (including all the Saw films) but somehow there's scenes like this that really hit hard and I'm not sure why. Wondering if anyone else has anything similar.",
