        "content": "**'Wicked' - Review Thread**\n\n[**Rotten Tomatoes**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wicked_2024)**: 91% (117 Reviews) - 8.1/10 Average Rating -** ***Certified Fresh***\n\n* **Critics Consensus**:  *Defying gravity with its magical pairing of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, Wicked's sheer bravura and charm make for an irresistible invitation to Oz.*\n* **PopcornMeter**: 99% (2500+ Verified Rating)\n\n[**Metacritic**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wicked/)**: 73 (44 Reviews)**\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety (90)](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-1236214272/)\n\n&gt;Chu clearly designed \u201cWicked\u201d to be experienced the old-fashioned way: on the biggest screen you can find, among a crowd of giddy theatergoers (inevitably singing along in some screenings). Unlike several recent tuners, which tried to hide their musical dimension from audiences, \u201cWicked\u201d embraces its identity the way Elphaba does her emerald skin. Turns out such confidence makes all the difference in how they\u2019re perceived.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (90)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-1236062372/)\n\n&gt;Grande and Erivo give Stephen Schwartz\u2019s songs \u2014 comedy numbers, introspective ballads, power anthems \u2014 effortless spontaneity. They help us buy into the intrinsic musical conceit that these characters are bursting into song to express feelings too large for spoken words, not just mouthing lyrics and trilling melodies that someone spent weeks cleaning up in a studio.\n\n[Deadline:](https://deadline.com/2024/11/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-movie-musical-adaptation-1236181476/)\n\n&gt;Chu has made a movie musical (the best since *Chicago)*, even if it ends with its own \u201cintermission\u201d , that manages to stand on its own as a fully satisfying screen entertainment, and also serves as a delicious invitation to an upcoming second half I quite frankly can\u2019t wait to see.\n\n[IndieWire (67)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wicked-review-jon-m-chu-adaptation-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-1235065351/)\n\n&gt;Jon M. Chu\u2019s Massive Musical Adaptation Defies Gravity (and Logic) to Spin a Tale Mostly for Established Fans. Ariana Grande is an absolute scream and Cynthia Erivo's voice is unparalleled, but expanding out the Broadway musical into two (very long) parts doesn't offer the opportunity for depth we were promised.\n\n[TheWrap (80)](https://www.thewrap.com/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-universal/)\n\n&gt;The story\u2019s playful, subversive reinterpretation of 'The Wizard of Oz' as a work of propaganda, designed to obfuscate the true story of how political dissidents and minority groups are demonized by fascist con artists who trade in theatricality instead of competence, is fully developed and still (to our collective dismay) incredibly salient.\n\n[IGN (90)](https://www.ign.com/articles/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-jon-m-chu)\n\n&gt;Wicked is a well-oiled machine in the hands of Jon M. Chu. This film adaptation epitomizes what modern movie musicals can and should be, embracing its source material while cleverly translating it to screen. Tear-jerking performances by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo make the movie, playing to their individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba, who\u2019ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame. If as many people love this film as much as I did, Wicked will undoubtedly immortalize the Grande and Erivo in movie musical history.\n\n[The Guardian (80)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/19/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-wizard-of-oz-stephen-schwartz)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s arguable if Wicked could ever be a meaningfully persuasive prequel for the characters in The Wizard of Oz as we actually see them in the 1939 film, as this would involve cancelling their powerfully timeless, mythological aura, and instead substituting the more banal idea of human development. But this is the joke, and this is the story, and what an enjoyable spectacle it is.\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241119-wicked-review)\n\n&gt;It might have been lighter on its feet if the editors had cut a subplot about magical talking animals, which doesn't add anything except several minutes of running time. And they could have cut Elphaba's sister, who is given perplexingly little to do. That way, the film could have been packed the whole musical into one fast-moving, satisfying entertainment. As it is, I have a strong suspicion that Wicked will work much better as the first part of a double bill, with Wicked Part 2 being shown after an interval. But we'll have to wait another year to know for sure.\n\n[Independent - UK (3/5)](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wicked-movie-review-ariana-grande-b2649890.html)\n\n&gt;Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande showcase phenomenal vocal ability in this adaptation of the blockbuster musical, but they\u2019re let down by a film that is aggressively overlit and shot like a TV advert.\n\n[Telegraph - UK (2/5)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n&gt;Utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo don\u2019t come close to defying gravity in this bloated, beige screen adaptation of the Wizard of Oz prequel.\n\n[Total Film (100)](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/musicals/wicked-part-one-review/)\n\n&gt;A great deal of expectation and pressure had been placed on Wicked, with fans waiting decades for it to reach the screen. This makes what Chu has achieved an even greater feat, turning one of the world's most popular musicals into a cinematic phenomenon. And while Wicked is only one half of this story, it never feels incomplete. As part two will take this story to some weird, wonderful, and heartbreaking places, I cannot wait to see what he and his team accomplish. But at this rate? I don't think anything can bring them down.\n\n[Empire Magazine (80):](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wicked/)\n\n&gt;Chu amps up the colour and spectacle to extraordinary, almost overwhelming heights, but the real magic comes from Erivo and Grande as the frenemies at the story\u2019s heart.\u202f\n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2024/11/wicked-part-1-review-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n&gt;The film is effective at capturing what made the original musical so beloved, and in turn, will belong to a new generation of kids \u2014 those kids who might then envision themselves cathartically singing \u201cPopular\u201d or \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d on stage, just as Ariana Grande had as a child.\n\n[Collider (90)](https://collider.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;The film works on an emotional level, and yet there are also well-delivered lessons about growing fascism that are tragically poignant in our American era. The set pieces are big and bold, and the dance numbers are creative and colorful. Grande is continually hilarious as the charmingly vapid Galinda, while Erivo is breathtakingly powerful as the so-called Wicked Witch. **Both Grande and Erivo sound glorious** through beautiful interpretations of modern musical classics like \"Defying Gravity.\" It all coheres into **one of the best silver screen adaptations of a musical in ages**, and easily one of the year's best pictures.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (75)](https://ew.com/wicked-review-musical-adaptation-hits-right-notes-lacks-visual-variety-8747457)\n\n&gt;For now, like Denis Villeneuve\u2019s first Dune, this Wicked manages to end on a note of \u201cto be continued\u201d while still feeling like a complete story. If only its imagery had a little more magic!\n\n[Screenrant (90)](https://screenrant.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Save for the tiniest of things, Wicked is a worthy screen adaptation of the musical, guaranteed to make viewers feel like they could defy gravity too.\n\n[The Times - UK (80)](https://www.thetimes.com/article/d6c0c3b5-efcc-4d7e-bca6-6c98ec4e997b)\n\n&gt;Hollywood finally delivers a worthy successor to The Wizard of Oz with this musical adaptation, starring the superb Erivo as Elphaba and a startlingly good Ariana Grande as Glinda.\n\n[Vanity Fair (80)](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-movie-review)\n\n&gt;Wicked succeeds because of some unreproducible, lightning in a bottle convergences\u2014of director, stars, craftspeople, and high-status material. But Wicked also makes a broader case for patience and careful thought, for grand ambition honed over the course of many years. In order to defy gravity, gravity must first be understood.\n\n[iNews - UK (100)](https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/ariana-grande-wicked-review-3388833)\n\n&gt;It joyfully expands on the source material with extended musical numbers and astute childhood flashbacks in a combination that will delight committed Ozians and newcomers alike.\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle (100)](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/wicked-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-19901874)\n\n&gt;Fueled by exquisite performances from Tony winner Erivo (\u201cThe Color Purple\u201d), as Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and Grammy winner Grande as Glinda the Good Witch, \u201cWicked\u201d is the best movie musical in years, representing a rare instance when performances, visuals and songs are of equally high quality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n&gt;Elphaba, a misunderstood young woman because of her green skin, and Glinda, a popular girl, become friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz. After an encounter with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads.\n\n**CAST:**\n\n* Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba Thropp\n* Ariana Grande as Galinda Upland\n* Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible\n* Jeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n* Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar\n* Ethan Slater as Boq Woodsman\n* Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp\n* Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond\n\n**DIRECTOR:** Jon M.

Is Miles Teller off tempo? Is that trombone guy out of tune in the beginning? Or am I as the average viewer with no musical background, just fooled into believing I'm not capable of hearing the subtle mistakes and thereby tricked into believing JK is correct when he actually isn't? Because that changes his character. Is he just yelling and intimidating because he thinks it'll make them better even though they're already flawless? Or does he hear imperfections?",

Until, bam.. it's a silly monster creature!&lt; , of all the fucked-up realistic scenarios that I was anticipating given the context lol.\n\nOr with topics like aliens, I liked 'The Invasion' or 'The Astronauts Wife' &gt;!prolly cause you don't see them in their alien form!&lt;and even ghost/haunted/occult stuff can be well done too!\n\n'Smile' was one horror-exception I liked a lot surprisingly. &gt;!Maybe cause it all seemed more like it's just her hallucinating/not being well mentally (until the finale fight with monster-mum).!&lt;",

        "content": "So, I just rewatched Broken Arrow for the first time in probably 20 years or so and I realized I never see this one mentioned or talked about anywhere. I remember really enjoying it around the time it came out, and while it isn't perfect/the best action movie from the 90's I think there's plenty to enjoy here.\n\nTravolta is chewing the scenery as the villain and doing a great job in my opinion. Lots of quotables and just a good screen presence. The plot is interesting with some memorable action scenes and deaths and upon rewatching I was pleasantly surprised by the lead actress role. She isn't a damsel in distress but heroic and capable from the start and throughout the movie. She is on par with the protagonist almost which is a nice deviation from the norm at the time.\n\nAll in all for the type of movie that it is I'd give it a 8-.\n\nSo, is there any love for this movie here or am I alone in this one?\n\nedit: For people unfamiliar with the movie, I'd compare it to something like Under Siege. That category.\n\nedit 2: I'm glad to see there is love for this movie :) If you haven't seen it and enjoy 90s action. Go watch it.",

However, one of my favorite parts of all the Mad Max movies is the crazy supporting characters, and Furiosa might have the best cast of weirdos.\n\nEach actor in Dementus\u2019s gang would come up with an elaborate backstory to help stand out, even if it\u2019s not shown in the movie. There\u2019s the Octoboss, a great Boba Fett type right hand man, Rizzdale Pell, a creepy one eyed bastard, Smeg (who I\u2019m not even sure how to describe, he\u2019s just fantastically weird), then Mr Norton, Fang, Big Jilly, Mr Harley (the one compassionate guy if you look closely), Mr Davidson, and others, all who have very little screentime but give unique performances. Also the History Man with his narration\n\nBack in the Citadel, we get Scrotus, one of the most entertaining additions (played by the guy who played Slit in Fury Road), along with getting to see Immortan Joe, the Organic Mechanic, Rictus, and the People Eater again",

        "content": "I rewatched Dark City and almost forgot how amazing it is. I don't know what happened to the '90s version of Alex Proyas, but he was great for a while back then. How did he go from making movies like this and The Crow to CGI-laden nonsense like Gods of Egypt? No offense if you like that movie, but it doesn't feel like the same filmmaker. He was a master of gothic-influenced genre movies for a while.\n\nThe visual effects and production design are really impressionistic and awesome. You really get the impression that every piece of architecture in this world is steeped in history, even though it's all just an illusion at the end of the day. Speaking of illusions, I also love the idea of aliens that can alter reality. The Strangers are great villains - terrifying, actually. The kid is especially eerie.\n\nI also love the film's nods to Last Thursdayism, a theory that the universe might have been created very recently (last Thursday, for instance), but with the appearance of being much older. I think that's quite a cool idea, and the movie incorporates it into the narrative in a very interesting way. I've also read that it's supposed to represent Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" idea, which is also fascinating. The philosophical elements don't come across as pretentious, though - it's very accessible.\n\nThis is as good as cinema gets for me. How do you guys feel about it?",
