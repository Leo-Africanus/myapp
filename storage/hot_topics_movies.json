        "content": "Happy (early) Thanksgiving, Reddit! I'm Barry Hertz, a Toronto-based film critic and author of WELCOME TO THE FAMILY: THE EXPLOSIVE STORY BEHIND FAST &amp; FURIOUS: THE BLOCKBUSTERS THAT SUPERCHARGED THE WORLD, which just came out this week. The book is the first-ever deeply reported look inside the surprising history and contentious future of Hollywood's most unlikely success story -- a series that anticipated the shifting currents of pop culture while changing the business of global entertainment at the same time. I spent the past two years talking with as many cast and crew involved in the Fast-verse as possible, all in the hope of shining a light on what I feel is one of the most underrated series of movies to ever come out of Hollywood. \n\nMy bio: \n\nI'm the award-winning film editor and chief film critic for The Globe and Mail, Canada's leading national newspaper, based in Toronto. Over the past two decades, I've reviewed thousands of movies, interviewed hundreds of actors and filmmakers, and covered every angle of the industry from festivals, sets, and markets around the world. Welcome to the Family: The Explosive Story Behind Fast &amp; Furious, the Blockbusters that Supercharged the World, is my first book. \n\nBuy the book:\n\n[https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/barry-hertz/welcome-to-the-family/9781538771037/?lens=grand-central-publishing](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/barry-hertz/welcome-to-the-family/9781538771037/?lens=grand-central-publishing) \n\nAsk my anything! I'll be back tomorrow Thursday 11/27 at 3 pm ET to answer any questions. ",

        "content": "I randomly started thinking about Memento recently, hadn't seen it since it came out in the early 2000s.  Back then I was so focused on the backwards narrative structure /gimmick, but in 2025 after everything society has gone through, especially culturally in the US, in the past 10-15 years I realized Memento is like a premonition of our entire polarizing cultural climate today.\n\nSome examples:\n\nLeonard can\u2019t form new memories, so he literally builds his reality out of:\n\n* Polaroids\n* Sharpie notes\n* Tattoos of \u201cfacts\u201d he chooses to trust after each \"reset\" and not question later\n\nThis feels similar to how people build their political identities now. We don\u2019t sit with nuance anymore or deep, probing critical thinking. We grab a screenshot, a headline, a tweet, a TikTok clip, and treat it like it\u2019s the whole truth. Just little ideological Polaroids we carry around like proof. You hear people reference these \"tattoos\" in debate. (e.g. have you seen the clip of Don Lemon on CNN trying to explain how women reach their prime in their 20s, 30s, and sometimes 40s citing Google as his evidence?)\n\nLeonard, the movie's protagonist, says:\n\n\u201cWe all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.\u201d\n\nModern culture takes that literally. Instead of mirrors, we have algorithms and influencers constantly reflecting back the version of ourselves we already want to believe in. And if something contradicts that? We just forget it. On purpose.\n\nWhat's really prescient is realizing Leonard is basically choosing his own reality. He keeps the \u201cfacts\u201d that keep him emotionally stable and discards anything that threatens the story he needs to survive. That\u2019s the real twist: he doesn\u2019t actually want the truth because he wants certainty.\n\nThis feels like american politics now.\n\nStructurally, the movie even mirrors how discourse works. You don\u2019t move from facts --&gt; conclusion. You start with the conclusion (my side = good) and work backwards to grab whatever fragments support it. Same inverted logic as the film itself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the line that feels like it was written in 2025:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the truth. You make up your own truth.\u201d\n\nLeonard and an entire culture built on curated memory, selective evidence, and outsourced thinking.\n\nBy the end of the movie, Leonard isn\u2019t free - he\u2019s the easiest person in the world to manipulate. And the scariest part is that he thinks he\u2019s thinking for himself the entire time.\n\nFeels like Nolan made a movie about humans and social media before social media even gained momentum. This could have a current film about current times.",

        "content": "I understand why many had a hostile reaction towards Eternals. The film is slow and does drag in parts, a stronger edit might have helped in dealing with its deficiencies, and while I like Gemma Chan as an actress, Sersi is a fairly bland protagonist. I couldn't be invested on her or her romance with Richard Madden's Ikaris. \n\nStill, I liked Eternals. The cinematography is splendorous and epic, especially in the last act. I liked the score. Some of the performances stand out like Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo, Angelina Jolie's Thena, Barry Keoghan's Druid. Say what you will, the director picked a superb cast for the film. \n\nThe action scenes aren't frequent yet they are highly effective. I've never seen someone truly convey the abilities of a speedster in a live-action film like Chloe Zhao did with Makkari, her fight scene with Ikaris being the highlight of the film, in my opinion. \n\nI also enjoyed the tone of the film, it's more existential and thought-provoking. The director's personal aesthetic is present in the film, instead of it just being a paycheck film lacking any identity from the filmmaker. \n\nI wouldn't mind Chloe Zhao getting a 2nd chance at Eternals 2, though it will never happen.",

My s******* tendencies are flaring up a bit, (not gonna do anything about that ofc) so I need something really human, something dealing with the pain and joy of being a human, something that'll make me cry, but not *just* make me cry, something existential and definitely something amazing. Films that I've seen that come to mind are;\n\n\u25cfThe Darjeeling Limited\n\n\u25cfLittle Miss Sunshine\n\n\u25cfThe Royal Tenenbaums\n\n\u25cfThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty (even though I personally didn't like it too much)\n\n\u25cfA Real Pain.....and also Good Will Hunting might fit the bill (love that movie, but I love all of these except Walter Mitty)\n\n\nSo that's it. Something similar to those. Sorry for the long caption, thanks in advance.",
