        "content": "I\u2019m looking for a film that really messes with your mind or hits you emotionally\u2014something that stays with you long after it ends. It can be a psychological drama, a powerful character study, or even a thought-provoking sci-fi. I just want something with real impact, where I\u2019m still unpacking the message or meaning days later.",

        "content": "One of the best zombie movies ever made IMO.  The original Night of the Living Dead is a classic and I get the social commentary aspect, which is what makes that movie great.  But as far as exciting zombie action and actual character development, I'd argue 2004 Dawn of the Dead is hard to top.  Also introduced me to Michael Kelly as CJ, who I really enjoy.",

The cinematography, brutal action and awesome characters make it such an enjoyable watch. It really did feel like a graphic comic coming to life on the big screen in the best way possible.  \n\nWhat movie immediately comes to mind when you think of the word \u201ccool\u201d? ",
