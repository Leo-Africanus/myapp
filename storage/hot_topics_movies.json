Ive been hospitalized *countless* times so ive had an incredible amount of free time on my hands. I started this post because I couldn't think of *anymore* movies to watch that fit this bill.   \n  \nEdit 2: People don't really appreciate the amount of time being sick gives. Im asking this question in this post because ive already watched *every* popular movie or TV show from the past 30+ years. Most people can only carve out enough time to watch one or two movies a week, i have enough time to watch 5-7 movies a *day.* Being hospitalized as often as me, plus being sick outside of the hospital leaves you with *to much* free time. Honestly, it sucks. Again, im not asking htis because im lost and i need my next movie or show, im asking this because ive literally *run out* of movies and shows.  \n  \nTo be honest, this post is a bit depressing, i appreciate the immense amount of help, but its really putting into perspective all the time lost to this illness.  \n  \nI try googling this sort of thing but looking up \"competence porn\" just gets you... well.. porn.

However there is the scene where he escapes the mall with the woman in her convertible, and he rips out the passenger seat so he can sit in it and be low enough to not be seen. It is the most ridiculous part of the movie for me since he looks so silly trying to not stand out in this little car, when he could have probably hotwired another vehicle that would have been less obvious.",

One that you still get goosebumps when you watch on subsequent viewings, cause it's so good?\n\nMy top 3, in order:\n\n3.  The Sixth Sense\n\n2.  The Usual Suspects\n\n1. Primal Fear\n\nInteresting that The Usual Suspects and Primal Fear both had the deceiver acting with a disability to throw everyone off, including the audience.    They also had a little more of a diabolical nature to them compared to Sixth Sense.\n\nWhat are yours?\n\n  \nEdit:  apologies for weird formatting of this post; tried to correct.  Didn't work.

They can be mundane but sometimes they reveal a gem of insight.\n\nI recall listening to the commentary for \"As Good As it Gets\" and the cast pointing out that Melvin has artwork that celebrates black culture in his apartment.\n\nIt demonstrated that he is not racist, despite some of the comments he made to Cuba Gooding Jr's character.  He was simply trying to repel him and get him to leave him alone.",

I think Mother! happens to be brilliant but I know of other people that hated that movie. I know this opinion is truly hated but I think that The Last Jedi also happens to be really interesting features in the Star Wars movie universe and I kind of think it's a really remarkable movie (as well as the other ones in the last trilogy).",
