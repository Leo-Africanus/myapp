        "title": "February 6-8 Box Office Recap \u2013 For Super Bowl weekend, 'Send Help' stays at #1, crossing $50M worldwide. 'Solo Mio', 'Stray Kids' and 'Dracula' over-perform projections, while 'The Strangers: Chapter 3' flops with just $3.4M. 'Zootopia 2' crosses $1.8 billion worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/4yvcbealzjig1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d25ee74fc4519f704c3e2c507dd33a48f84d00\n\nThe Super Bowl weekend is always quiet at the box office, as studios avoid releasing big stuff here. As such, ***Send Help*** got to repeat at #1 for the second week in a row. Despite that, some films got to over-perform projections, including ***Solo Mio***, ***Stray Kids***, and ***Dracula***. The only big loser was ***The Strangers: Chapter 3***, which flopped to the surprise of absolutely no one.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $49 million this weekend. That's up 5.9% from last year, when ***Dog Man*** repeated at #1, and ***Heart Eyes*** and ***Love Hurts*** opened.\n\n20th Century Studios' ***Send Help*** remained at #1 with $9 million. That's a 53% drop, which isn't quite terrible considering Super Bowl deflated the weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $34.8 million, and it seems like it should hit over $50 million domestically by the end of its run.\n\nFrom time to time, Angel Studios has a film that over-performs projections. It rarely happens, but this was that occassion, as the Kevin James-led ***Solo Mio*** managed to hit second place with $7 million in 3,052 theaters. Quite impressive, to be honest. Given strong reception, this could hit $20 million, assuming it's not consumed by the incoming releases.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Markiplier's ***Iron Lung*** saw a steep drop in its second weekend. It collapsed 63%, earning $6.7 million this weekend. Nevertheless, that's not actually a bad drop, considering other titles could drop as high as 70%. Through 10 days, the film has earned $31.5 million so far.\n\nBleecker Street's ***Stray Kids: The DominATE experience*** managed to hit fourth place with a great $5.6 million in 1,724 theaters. That's one of the studio's biggest ever debuts. Nevertheless, it's not gonna last long, given how front-loaded it was: 54% of the weekend's gross came from Friday.\n\nIn fifth place, Vertical's release of Luc Besson's ***Dracula*** debuted with $4 million in 2,050 theaters. That's not a lot of money, but it's Vertical's biggest ever debut. In fact, with just this weekend, ***Dracula*** is already Vertical's biggest film domestically, finally overtaking ***Gotti*** ($4.2 million). Although with some competition, it'd be a surprise if it lasted long in theaters.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** had the best drop in the Top 10, despite the Super Bowl's presence. It eased just 32% this weekend, adding $4 million. The film has earned a crazy $414.5 million domestically, and it's definitely gonna pass ***A Minecraft Movie*** ($424 million) to become 2025's highest grossing film.\n\nIn seventh place, Lionsgate's ***The Strangers: Chapter 3*** flopped with just $3.4 million in 2,565 theaters. That's a rough 41% drop from ***Chapter 2*** ($5.8 million), which was already 51% below ***Chapter 1*** ($11.8 million). \n\nAnother unsurprising result. For some reason, Lionsgate really believed that a ***Strangers*** trilogy would be an easy profit. And to be fair, they were correct; they're ultra-cheap films (a combined $20 million for the whole trilogy), so they'll probably make some slight profit. But what's clear is that there's absolutely zero good will left on this franchise. Each passing film has been worse received than the prior film, and it looks like they saved the absolutely worst for last.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 53% of the audience was male, and 32% was in the 25-34 demographic. Critics destroyed the film with a brutal 16% on RT, and the audience pretty much agreed. The audience gave the film a horrible \"D\" on CinemaScore, the worst in the franchise. Even for horror, that's a terrible grade. Given its low debut and the fact that it will be facing severe competition, it'd be a surprise if it made it past $8 million domestically. But at least this left a mark, for it'll be named in the \"worst trilogies of all time\" lists.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** dropped 39%, adding $3.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $391.5 million.\n\nIn ninth place, Black Bear's ***Shelter*** dropped 55%, adding $2.4 million. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $10 million, and it doesn't have much left in the gas tank.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was Amazon MGM's ***Melania***, falling all the way from the third spot. After its poor debut last week, the film also had the worst drop in the Top 10. It collapsed a poor 67%, earning just $2.3 million this weekend. Seems that despite the \"glowing\" word of mouth from its niche fans, the rest of the world was just fine ignoring it. Through 10 days, the film has earned a poor $13.3 million, and it will miss $20 million.\n\nJust outside the Top 10, another Amazon MGM title. ***Mercy*** continues fizzling out, dropping 59% and earning just $1.8 million. The film has earned a meager $22.6 million so far.\n\n***The Housemaid*** dropped 51% for a $1.7 million weekend. That takes its domestic total to $123.5 million.\n\nA24 expanded the Charli XCX mockumentary ***The Moment*** to 581 theaters, and it earned $1.6 million. That takes its domestic total to $2.2 million. \n\nA24's ***Marty Supreme*** dropped 51%, adding $1.3 million. The film has amassed $93.2 million, and it looks like it might fall short of hitting $100 million domestically.\n\nA24 released ***Pillion*** in 4 theaters, where it earned $241,769. That translates to a very strong $60,442 per-theater average. The film has already earned $1.5 million in the UK back in November, and it will continue expanding over the next few weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience*** debuted with $14.2 million overseas, for a $19.9 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in Mexico ($2.1M), Germany ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Italy ($800K), Spain ($600K), Brazil ($600K), France ($500K), Peru ($400K), Chile ($400K), Australia ($400K), Argentina ($300K), and Poland ($300K). These are very impressive debuts, considering it didn't have a lot of screenings in some markets. If there's one place where it surprisingly flopped was Korea, with just $227K. \n\nWith $14.7 million overseas, ***The Housemaid*** has crossed $350 million worldwide. It's nearing $40 million in the UK, and $35.8 million in France.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** has hit another milestone. With $12.8 million overseas, it has crossed the $1.8 billion milestone worldwide. It's already the ninth highest grossing film worldwide, and the fifth biggest overseas.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added $12.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $1.439 billion.\n\n***Hamnet*** has added $6.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to a dazzling $70.6 million. Unsurprisingly, the UK has been its biggest market with $22.7 million, overtaking the domestic market. Given that it still has some markets left and with great holds, it definitely looks like the film has a chance to cross $100 million worldwide. A huge win for adult dramas.\n\n***Send Help*** has added $6.3 million overseas, crossing $50 million worldwide in the process. It debuted in the UK with a pretty good $2.2 million. Best markets are Mexico ($2.3M), the UK ($2.2M), Australia ($1.6M), Germany ($900K), Japan ($800K), Italy ($800k), Saudia Arabia ($700K), Spain ($700k), Netherlands ($600K) and Korea ($500K).\n\nWith $147 million worldwide, ***Marty Supreme*** has surpassed ***Everything Everywhere All At Once*** to become A24's highest grossing film. Let's see how high it can go.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Greenland 2: Migration* | Jan/9 | Lionsgate | $8,401,148 | $17,770,308 | $25,841,231 | $90M\n\n- Did you know there was a ***Greenland*** sequel in theaters? Or that there was a first ***Greenland*** movie in the first place? Cause ***Greenland 2: Migration*** has closed after just 4 weeks with an abysmal $25 million worldwide, failing to come anywhere close to its $90 million budget. Gerard Butler may be a recognizable name, but he sure has a lot of big flops to his name.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nIt's a very busy weekend, with FOUR films opening in wide release.\n\nThe buzziest title is WB's ***Wuthering Heights***, the new film from Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. An adaptation of the novel by Emily Bront\u00eb, although this will clearly take a lot of liberties with the story (after all, the title is in quotation marks). So far, everything has looked pretty good, and it's the kind of film that could strike a chord with audiences over St. Valentine's Day. Whatever happens after the weekend, however, it's up to word of mouth.\n\nSony is releasing their new animated film ***Goat***, following an anthropomorphic goat named Will Harris who aspires to become the greatest of all time at a basketball-like sport known as roarball. It marks Sony Pictures Animation's first theatrical release since ***Across the Spider-Verse***, and it should benefit from a 2-month absence of notable animated films. \n\nAmazon MGM is releasing crime thriller ***Crime 101***, starring Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Nolte, and Halle Berry. The movie looks like slick fun, but it remains to be seen if Hemsworth will turn his luck around, given that he has starred in a lot of failures outside the MCU.\n\nAnd finally, Gore Verbinski is returning after almost a decade with a new film, ***Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die***. The film stars Sam Rockwell, Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Zazie Beetz, Asim Chaudhry, Tom Taylor, and Juno Temple, and follows a man from the future who travels to the past and recruits the patrons of a Los Angeles diner he arrives in to help combat a rogue artificial intelligence. The film has great reviews on its side (93% on RT), but Briarcliff is not a great distributor for films.\n\n#**STREAMING DATA**\n\nHow did Netflix do last week?\n\nFigures for the week of January 26 to February 1:\n\nNo. | Movie | Year | Studio | Weeks in Top 10 | Views | Runtime | Hours Viewed\n----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n1 | *The Rip* | 2026 | Netflix | 3 | 14,600,000 | 1:53 | 27,500,000\n2 | *Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart* | 2026 | Netflix | 2 | 9,600,000 | 1:31 | 14,500,000\n3 | *Dhurandhar* | 2025 | Jio Studios | 1 | 7,600,000 | 3:26 | 26,100,000\n4 | *KPop Demon Hunters* | 2025 | Netflix | 33 | 6,800,000 | 1:40 | 11,400,000\n5 | *The Big Fake* | 2026 | Netflix | 1 | 6,600,000 | 1:56 | 12,800,000\n6 | *Max* | 2015 | Warner Bros. | 2 | 6,200,000 | 1:51 | 11,400,000\n7 | *Trap* | 2025 | Warner Bros. | 1 | 5,400,000 | 1:45 | 9,400,000\n8 | *M3GAN 2.0* | 2025 | Universal | 1 | 5,000,000 | 2:00 | 10,000,000\n9 | *People We Meet on Vacation* | 2026 | Netflix | 4 | 4,500,000 | 1:58 | 8,900,000\n10 | *Tere Ishk Mein* | 2025 | AA Films | 2 | 4,400,000 | 2:45 | 12,100,000\n\nFor the third week in a row, ***The Rip*** has stayed at #1, with 14.6 million views. That takes its 17-day total to 96.6 million views. It's nearing 100 million views, although it seems cracking the all-time Top 10 will be a bit complicated.\n\nThe documentary ***Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart*** kept the second spot with 9.6 million views, for a running total of 25.5 million views.\n\nIndeed, ***KPop Demon Hunters*** is not showing any signs of stopping. On its 33rd week, the film is still in the Top 10, barely even dropping from last week. Last Sunday, the film won the Grammy for Best Song Written for Visual Media, becoming the first K-pop song to win a Grammy. Next sight: the Oscar.\n\nIn ninth place, rom-com ***People We Meet on Vacation*** added 4.5 million views, taking its 24-day total to 54.3 million views.",

        "content": "*Tragedy strikes when Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine Earnshaw, a woman from a wealthy family in 18th-century England.*\n\nDirector: Emerald Fennell\n\nAdapted from: 'Wuthering Heights' by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847)\n\nCast: Jacob Elordi, Margot Robbie, Owen Cooper, Alison Oliver\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [71%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wuthering_heights_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [60 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wuthering-heights-2026/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/wuthering-heights-review-1236651546/) \\- Peter Debruge\n\n&gt;While not as salacious as \u2018Saltburn,\u2019 the director\u2019s operatic Emily Bront\u00eb adaptation allows its tragic couple \u2014 played by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi \u2014 to consummate their passions, to a degree.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/feb/09/wuthering-heights-review-emerald-fennell-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi) \\- Peter Bradshaw - 2 / 5\n\n&gt;Wuthering Heights doesn\u2019t have the live-ammo impact of Fennell\u2019s earlier films, or indeed Andrea Arnold's primitivist take on Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel from 2011, which really did believe in the passionate truth of Cathy and Heathcliff\u2019s love. For Fennell, it looks like a luxurious pose of unserious abandon. It\u2019s quasi-erotic, pseudo-romantic and then ersatz-sad, a club night of mock emotion.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/02/09/wuthering-heights-2026-movie-review/88556199007/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Emerald Fennell\u2019s take on the literary classic\u00a0isn\u2019t exactly a Valentine\u2019s Day pick-me-up. Yet it\u2019s awfully stunning to look at with all sorts of toxic obsession, forbidden lust and gothic sauciness.\n\n[RogerEbert](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wuthering-heights-film-review-2026) \\- Tomris Laffy - 2 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to feel freely when you are constantly and loudly reminded by every aspect of the movie that you are supposed to feel things.\n\n[AVClub - Natalia Keoghan](https://www.avclub.com/wuthering-heights-review) \\- 'C-'\n\n&gt;Overlong and undersexed, Fennell\u2019s version of Wuthering Heights betrays her audience of edgelords and perverts. Even stranger, those who have fostered a distaste for the filmmaker\u2019s sensibility will similarly find themselves disappointed. It\u2019s one thing to make art that can be read as indulgent, ill-conceived, and tasteless\u2014it\u2019s another to turn around and make something that\u2019s just boring in comparison.\n\n[Slash Film - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/2097045/wuthering-heights-2026-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 10\n\n&gt;This is not an adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights,\" but the result of what happens when you're playing an approximation \"Wuthering Heights\" without a full grasp on the material but all the money in the world to bring your questionable imagination to life.\n\n[Consequence - Liz Shannon Miller](https://consequence.net/2026/02/wuthering-heights-review-margot-robbie/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;As soon as this project was announced, it was easy to assume that Fennell would show as much reverence for the classic text as she showed for the sanctity of a man\u2019s grave in *Saltburn*. Except she defies that assumption by making sure that although *\u201cWuthering Heights\u201d* remains a deliciously horny film, it does summon a certain degree of pure romance, especially in the few moments when its leads are able to see past their misunderstandings and actually connect. It\u2019s a movie about how ugly people can be to each other, but also about the beauty they\u2019re capable of \u2014 a message that, like the original text itself, remains timeless.\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2026/02/09/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Style over substance? Not at all \u2013 it\u2019s more that Fennell understands that style can be substance when you do it right. Cathy and Heathcliff\u2019s passions vibrate through their dress, their surroundings, and everything else within reach, and you leave the cinema quivering on their own private frequency.\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20260209-wuthering-heights-review) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights is *not* very faithful to Emily Bronte's novel, but we knew that. The trailer alone evoked so much hand-wringing from Bront\u00eb purists that the film became divisive sight unseen. This Wuthering Heights *is* very true to Fennell, the director of the scathing revenge drama Promising Young Woman and the lush, bitter story of class and obsession, Saltburn.\n\n[Collider - Therese Lacson](https://collider.com/wuthering-heights-review-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-emerald-fennell-emily-bronte/) \\- 2 / 10\n\n&gt;What makes the original Wuthering Heights so powerful is the dizzying story at its core. The Earnshaws and Lintons have a complicated family tree, and Heathcliff comes in like a wrecking ball to blow everything up. On one hand, we want to believe that Heathcliff can change from his wicked ways with enough love from Cathy, but on the other hand, his actions are so cruel that it feels like Bront\u00eb is pushing us to the very brink of what is acceptable before ultimately redeeming him in his final moments. Emily Bront\u00eb's novel is about characters who are hateful and pitiable but still full of enough charm and complexity that we are desperate to learn their full, messy tale. Emerald Fennell's film is merely telling a shallow story about two people overcoming all obstacles to fall in love \u2014 not necessarily awful on paper, but it's an adaptation that feels like a 14-year-old skimmed the book and jumped to her own conclusions without any true understanding of the novel.",

        "content": "What do we all think? There\u2019s definitely a spectrum of schemes in the Bond series, from the sensible to the absurd. \n\nI think \\*From Russia with Love\\*\u2019s Kronsteen has a fairly reasonable plan: Spectre wants a Soviet code-breaking machine and James Bond dead, they play British and Soviet intelligence against each other, have Bond steal the machine and stage his and his Russian accomplice\u2019s deaths. Classic spy stuff.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of silly schemes to choose from, like Drax\u2019s plan in \\*Moonraker\\* to create a genetically perfect human race on a space station\u2026 from a few dozen men and women \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut I think \\*License to Kill\\* takes the silly cake. The plan basically revolves around a cocaine smuggling operation. While giving a tour of his facilities to potential investors, he demonstrates his method for transporting thousands of kilos of cocaine completely undetectably: dissolve it in gasoline, truck it to the destination, and recover the cocaine by running the gas through a coffee filter. This is the plan. Just\u2026 wow.\n\nBut what do you think? Is there another movie with an even sillier plan?",

Recasting Bob turns the character into either a cartoon or a clich\u00e9. \n\nThe other obvious choice is \u2018Being John Malkovich\u2019. This one barely works because it\u2019s Malkovich.

That would have effectively scaled the shark up and added another, you know, nine feet to the overall length of the shark.  \n  \n&gt;**Valerie Taylor:** And Hollywood sent us this little man, he couldn't dive, he had spent most of his life riding horses, doubling for children in films like National Velvet, he'd doubled for Elizabeth Taylor. And, we had to take him out and stuff him into a cage and dangle him into the cold southern ocean. And have sharks - big, huge, monstrous sharks - swimming around him. And he was very much afraid and we had a lot of difficulty getting him into the cage which is probably quite understandable. We did have two little dummies because we were supposed to have somebody in the cage when the shark broke it up. But we had Carl, and he was much better, he looked better in the cage, he moved around a bit.\n\n[https://year11media2010.blogspot.com/2010/07/jaws-making-of-transcript.html](https://year11media2010.blogspot.com/2010/07/jaws-making-of-transcript.html)\n\nLittle part about the little person starts around 17:50 (until 25:00) of the Making of Jaws video.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZj5EHGrQII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZj5EHGrQII)",

I\u2019ve watched it over a thousand times. I\u2019m known as the 127 Hours girl on Letterboxd and the Letterboxd subreddit.\n\nDanny did an ama for 28 Years Later. I knew if I had an opportunity to tell him about 127 Hours, this would be it.\n\nWhen I saw that Danny responded to my comment, I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d see it, let alone respond to it. He also said that he knew about me. That alone blew my mind.\n\nI was waiting months and months to receive the card, but it never arrived. A few weeks ago, a Reddit employee noticed that I never got it, so they messaged me and said that they contacted Danny\u2019s team, and they wanted me to get the card. I felt hopeful that I\u2019ll receive it this time.\n\nOn Friday, a package arrived from Danny. I had a huge smile on my face the second I realized what it was. I was so excited to open it!\n\nWhat he sent me was absolutely amazing. He sent me a very sweet handwritten note, and an amazing bonus. This is what Danny wrote me.\n\n\u201cJess,\n\nIn making a film the director watches it hundreds of times. I was so delighted-and continue to be so-that you have done the same!\n\nWe\u2019d had a big success with Slumdog Millionaire, and it was only that success that brought the finance to 127-no one wants to watch a film about a man cutting his own arm off-they said.\n\nThe film holds a very special place for me and I\u2019m honoured it does for you too.\n\nAll best always\n\nDanny Boyle\u201d\n\nI never thought I\u2019d one day receive a handwritten note from Danny himself. I\u2019m still in shock!\n\nAs for the bonus, he also sent me a 127 Hours film crew t-shirt. It\u2019s exactly like the shirt James Franco wears in the film.\n\nDanny truly has made my life! 127 Hours is my favorite thing in the world and it brings me so much joy. And to be recognized for that by the film\u2019s director is beyond amazing. I never thought something like this would ever happen to me. I\u2019ve been so emotional and my happiness levels have been through the roof! I\u2019m over the moon.\n\nI wanted to share this with you guys because some of the members of this sub wanted an update. None of this would\u2019ve happened if not for this sub and the ama. Thank you,  r/movies ! \u2764\ufe0f",
