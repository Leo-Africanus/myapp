        "title": "My story with 127 Hours",
        "content": "I\u2019m autistic and 127 Hours is not only my favorite movie, but it\u2019s also my main special interest/fixation. My special interest with this film has lasted over fourteen years. I thought I would share my story.\n\nThe first time I watched 127 Hours was on April 25th, 2011. It was on a Monday night. I was 16. I checked out the dvd from the library. I didn\u2019t think it would make a big impact on me. But after that first watch, something clicked for me and I felt like a changed person. It was life affirming. I was totally blown away. I knew I had to watch it again very soon. I ended up renting it the next weekend. I fell in love with this movie. I eventually bought the dvd. It was being played so much that I was worried it\u2019d break, so I ended up buying a second dvd copy, which is actually still sealed! At some point later, I bought the Blu Ray copy, even though I didn\u2019t have a Blu Ray player at the time.\n\nI came across this film during my sophomore year of high school. I started showing it to my friends. There was a time in my theater class in which I had to make a movie set with a box set. I ended up creating Blue John Canyon. I also bought a book of the script and I brought it with me to school every day. 127 Hours was becoming my favorite thing in the world.\n\nNot only was 127 Hours my main source for joy and comfort, but it left a positive impact on my life. Before I watched it for the first time, I was taking my life and loved ones for granted. I learned to appreciate them so much more. But it also helped me physically. I used to refuse to drink water. I\u2019d be forced to drink it, and I\u2019d take the tiniest sips. Thanks to the film focusing on how important water is, it became my go-to drink. It made me a hydro homie, if you will. One thing autistic people struggle with are how their bodies lack signals, like hunger, thirst, using the bathroom, etc. The movie made me become more aware of my body\u2019s needs.\n\nThere was also a time in my life when I was very depressed. I turned to self harm and had suicidal thoughts. My breaking point was when I posted a goodbye post on Facebook. I thankfully got help. 127 Hours was one of the things that helped me get better. And I\u2019m forever grateful for that.\n\nI also did some pretty cool things because of 127 Hours. I was never much of an outdoor person before, but it made me fall in love with it. Whenever I\u2019m anywhere near the mountains, I feel most at peace. Utah has become my favorite state to visit. I love to hike out there. I also met James Franco in 2014. I told him how many times I watched it at the time (around 300), and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of times.\u201d I had my Blu Ray copy for him to sign. He drew a heart on it. I never met Aron Ralston or Danny Boyle, but I\u2019d love to meet them both one day, especially Aron! I have a semi-tribute tattoo for 127 Hours on my right arm. It\u2019s a mountain outline. Every time I look at it, I think about the movie and being by the mountains. It makes me happy.\n\nThe last year really took a turn for me, both in good and bad ways. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness late last year, but I dealt with the nearly unbearable symptoms all year. I was in so much pain. Whenever I was at my worst, I turned to 127 Hours for comfort it would almost always make me feel better. And then at some point, I started to share my love for it on Reddit, particularly on r/letterboxd. I\u2019d talk about how many times I\u2019ve seen it. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get many responses to whenever I\u2019d post or comment, but they ended up getting a lot of attention. I would become known as the 127 Hours girl.\n\nThe best thing about being the 127 Hours girl is that I\u2019ve made a positive impact on people. I like to post because I like to share my love for the film. I\u2019ve gotten so many responses from other users that sharing my love makes them happy. I feel like making people happy is one of my life\u2019s purposes. And I definitely feel like I\u2019m accomplishing that.\n\nBut the most exciting thing happened last month. I made a Tik Tok about my story with the film in April. I decided to tag Searchlight Pictures to see if they\u2019d watch it. I didn\u2019t think much of it. A few weeks go by and I open Tik Tok. I got a few notifications. I didn\u2019t think it was anything out of the ordinary. But then I saw that Searchlight Pictures liked, commented and sent me a dm! They wanted to send me some things. I was so excited and happy that I screamed and cried!  I was so anxious to see what they were going to send me! And then it finally arrived. They sent me some merch. They got me a dvd copy (probably because I mentioned in the Tik Tok how I got a second copy in case if the first one broke), a poster, a 127 Hours Nalgene water bottle, a carabiner with a couple keychains, a t shirt they had when the film was released that says \u201cI kept my eyes open for 127 Hours\u201d, and a very nice handwritten note. Getting them to notice how much I love 127 Hours was always something I had on my bucket list, but I always thought it would be unrealistic to accomplish. It was a dream come true. They went above and beyond.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve watched 127 Hours, but my guess is at least a thousand times. I\u2019ve watched it over 100 times this year alone. I don\u2019t watch the whole film every day, but the biggest part of my fixation is my favorite scene, which I watch several times a day every day. It\u2019s one of the video message scenes. I can never exactly pinpoint why it\u2019s my favorite part of the film, but it\u2019s been that way since the beginning. I have sessions where I\u2019d watch it. They\u2019d usually last between 15 minutes-to a half hour each, but there have been times where I\u2019d watch it for an hour straight. I love it so much.\n\nI think I covered all the bases. I\u2019m very open to answering questions. So if you have any, feel free to let me know!\n\nXOXO, 127 Hours girl",

        "content": "Some movies just hit differently the second time around. Maybe you weren\u2019t in the right mood the first time, maybe you missed the deeper stuff, or maybe it just needed time to grow on you. For me, it was Blade Runner 2049. The first watch felt slow, but on a rewatch, the atmosphere, pacing, and emotional weight really landed now it\u2019s one of my all-time favorites.",
