The whole thing feels like a paranoid fever dream set in downtown NYC, and that\u2019s exactly why it works.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen it (or haven\u2019t revisited it in a while), this might be the nudge you need. It\u2019s a strange little gem that deserves way more love than it gets. Give it a watch, you might be surprised!",

        "content": "Sally Field's \"The whole time? *The whole time?* **The whole time?**\" line from Mrs. Doubtfire came up in a thread earlier today. And it also reminded me of the \"Will you go to lunch? Go to lunch. Will You Go To Lunch?\" line in Glengarry Glen Ross. Something about repeating lines gives the actors such a bone to chew on, giving multiple takes all for an audience to see.\n\nWhat other repeated lines (triple or otherwise) are remarkable in film history? Also I noticed those two examples are questions. I suppose questions lend themselves to repetition?\n\nETA: Not talking about catch phrases or motifs that come back later (though those can both be fun) but lines that repeat immediately in the script.",

        "title": "Primitive war review - dinosaur movies are hard to make.",
        "content": "\n\nAlright, I just finished Primitive War and figured I\u2019d throw down my quick review.\n\nPositives first:\n\t\u2022\tIt was kind of entertaining at times. The combat scenes were pretty well done, especially considering the budget was only $7 million \u2014 honestly looked better than I expected for that price.\n\t\u2022\tThe buildup before they got deployed had promise. I actually liked the chemistry between the squad early on, felt like they were setting up some interesting dynamics.\n\nNow for the negatives (and there\u2019s a lot):\n\t\u2022\tThe movie went downhill almost as soon as they touched down.\n\t\u2022\tThem finding a dinosaur footprint and wondering if it was \u201csome kind of bird\u201d \u2026 come on. I\u2019ve seen that exact beat in Jurassic movies about 27 times.\n\t\u2022\tThe T. rex, especially the female, looked like a copy-paste job of the Jurassic Park design.\n\t\u2022\tPredictable, clich\u00e9 scenes ripped straight out of both classic war films and Jurassic Park movies.\n\t\u2022\tAfter the opening, there was basically no character development at all. Even the rookie, who was introduced like he\u2019d be a main focus, ended up barely having lines once they deployed.\n\t\u2022\tThe whole \u201cclich\u00e9 Russians with an experimental program\u201d plus the rogue scientist who was undecided at first but ultimately helps them \u2014 straight out of the most generic playbook possible.\n\t\u2022\tThey used the exact same trick twice: small dinosaur spares the guy, he celebrates, then a bigger dinosaur sneaks up and kills him. Lazy.\n\t\u2022\tThe untrustworthy leader who \u201cknows more than he\u2019s letting on\u201d \u2026 seen that clich\u00e9 a hundred times.\n\nNot sure where all these glowing reviews for Primitive War are coming from\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve seen a bunch of people hyping this up like it\u2019s some hidden gem, and honestly I don\u2019t get it. Yeah, it has some entertaining firefights and a cool premise on paper \u2014 Vietnam War + dinosaurs is a wild combo \u2014 but let\u2019s be real, this movie isn\u2019t anywhere near what people are making it out to be.\n\nI keep seeing comments like \u201cfinally, a movie that dethrones Jurassic World.\u201d Nah. For all of Jurassic World\u2019s flaws (and it has plenty), it still had scope, production value, and some memorable set pieces. Primitive War doesn\u2019t even come close to touching that.\n\nIf anything, Primitive War shows how hard it actually is to pull off a dinosaur movie. You can\u2019t just throw some combat tropes, a few dino roars, and recycled character archetypes together and expect it to stand toe-to-toe with a billion-dollar franchise.\n\nAt best, it\u2019s a curiosity watch with a couple of fun scenes. At worst, it\u2019s a reminder that the dino-movie crown is still sitting firmly with Jurassic Park/World, flaws and all.\n\n\nVerdict:\nCool idea, some decent combat action, but overall a wasted opportunity. Could\u2019ve been something unique if it leaned into survival horror or did something fresh with the setting. Instead it just recycled tropes and felt like a mash-up of other movies. ",
