She has a change of heart, it seems like the final act will be a team up between the sisters to take down the bad guys. Instead, the sister gets killed almost immediately and we get a shoehorned team up between the main character and John Wick. In which, except for the initial fight, it seems the actors weren't even on set together. To the point that some shots of John have significantly different lighting despite taking place in the same scene. \u200bIt seems pretty clear that someone thought that they should somehow include John Wick in the spinoff for marketing reasons and trashed the sister storyline for that, replacing it with what we got.

It could\u2019ve been a powerful story about perspective and identity as a man literally learns to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes. However, there is one pretty big detail about this movie I have neglected to mention:\n\n\nIt\u2019s an Adam Sandler comedy.\n\n\n I\u2019m not saying Sandler is a bad actor or unable of delivering an amazing lead performance in a drama (*Uncut Gems* debunks that entirely*) but I can\u2019t help but feel like this movie would\u2019ve been way better off if it had a lead actor behind it way more focused on taking the story seriously and making some richer out of the key conflict.",

There\u2019s never a point where you feel it has the seriousness of Lord of the Rings or Indiana Jones (insofar as how seriously it takes the stakes within its own story), and it\u2019s full of campy moments and dialogue that feels like it was destined to become a meme. \n\nThe heroes are tough but never feel \\*threatening\\* in the way that say Aragorn does in Fellowship. They all seem like characters who\u2019d much rather settle every fight over drinks and jokes rather than a sword (well except Inigo hunting the six fingered man)\n\nI can\u2019t even fathom just how the movie pokes fun at its own genre at every turn yet feels like a sincere take on the genre at the same time? It\u2019s the Scream of fantasy-adventure insofar as both pretty much made fun of yet are sort of the modern template for their respective genres. \n\nAnd yet it\u2019s actually a legit timeless classic that really does get better every time you watch it.

I watched Anaconda when I was younger maybe once or twice but I decided to rematch it today after I saw the new Jack Black version this past weekend. I am genuinely confused by Jon Voight's character. I understand that he's a big snake hunter amd that he thinks catching the giant anaconda will make him rich, but surely there were other ways to go about it instead of sabotaging a film crew and deliberately getting some of them killed? And what the hell is that accent? It sounds Spanish at times, Italian, Australian, and it's just all over the place. And who's bright idea was it to have him be swallowed whole by the snake, spit out, and then proceed to wink at Jennifer Lopez's character as his limp body falls to the floor? I'm just utterly confused by the thought process both in front of the camera and behind it. ",

        "content": "This is a specific kind of movie, not stuff like *The Sixth Sense* or *The Others* where the whole story gets reframed by a twist. I\u2019m looking for films that specifically hint at something much deeper going on but never explicitly explain it.\n\nA common (and controversial) example is *Eyes Wide Shut*. On the surface it is about a nosey doctor who stumbles upon an elite sex cult. However, many viewers believe it may be pointing toward child sex abuse, based on cryptic dialogue and visual cues allegedly left by Kubrick. I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist, but given Kubrick\u2019s meticulous deliberation I find this interpretation at least plausible. Regardless, the film leaves you with the strong sense that something far darker is going on.\n\nAnother example would be David Lynch\u2019s *Twin Peaks: The Return*, where numerous blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it visual glitches are scattered throughout the entire season, suggesting cosmic disarray and an increasingly fragmented reality.\n\nLastly, in a very different vein the film *Local Hero* appears to be a very straightforward story about an oil man traveling to a remote Scottish village to build a refinery. Yet there are small, almost imperceptible hints throughout that the village may exist in a magical or mythological reality inspired by Scottish folklore. One might interpret these hints as throwaway references if not for a bizarre reveal that one character has webbed feet. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for films like this. Something feels deeply \u201coff\u201d or hidden, but the movie never confirms or explains it outright. ",

He plays a mysterious guy from Jason Bateman character's past (who has just bought a house with his wife Rebecca Hall) who they meet by accident but then who keeps showing up again and makes their life complicated. It's a very nice psychological thriller.\n\nI won't bore you with the various roles he has played and various films he has been (Zero Dark Thirty, The Green Knight, It Comes at Night, etc.) except to say his most recent, Train Dreams, where he plays Robert Grainier, a railroad worker and a logger, is a phenomenal movie ((95% on Rotten Tomatoes, 88% on Metacritic) that really shows how good of an actor he is. That is not the kind of movie I usually enjoy (period dramas) but he carries that whole movie on his back and brings to life Grainier and make him so interesting.",

I was struck by how quietly and realistically it pulls you into the family\u2019s everyday life, the small routines, shared meals, and unspoken bonds made it feel less like watching a film and more like being inside their home, almost as if you were part of the family yourself.\n\nWhat moved me most was the sadness beneath it all: the reminder that we don\u2019t get to choose the circumstances we\u2019re born into, yet we still carry such a deep need to belong, to be held by a family or a community. The film captures how love and care can exist in fragile, imperfect places, and how painful it is that you can\u2019t always choose \u2014 or protect \u2014 the family that feels like home.\n\nAny thoughts?",
