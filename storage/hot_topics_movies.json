Similarly, there\u2019s a bunch of dudes with white leathery skin and feathers near the rhino, that disappear before it can even be questioned\n\nI love all the random shit in this movie, it just throws so much craziness at you tjat you kind of have to accept the fact that the Persians have an Army of Elephants, crab clawed men, \u201cwizards\u201d, and random beast men that growl instead of yell\n\nI think it adds to the idea that it\u2019s the Spartans telling the story and exaggerating all the details to eachother to make it more crazy.",

Bong Joon-ho's best English movie to date and arguably Robert Pattinson's best movie ever.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-b2698489.html) (5/5):\n\n&gt;This is Pattinson at his best, holding his movie star charisma hostage in order to pursue loveable weirdos in all kinds of shades. He\u2019s fully liberated here, consistently finding the most unexpected and delightful ways to deliver a line.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-bong-joon-ho-1235095954/) (A-):\n\n&gt;I\u2019d argue that \u201cMickey 17,\u201d the best and most cohesive of Bong\u2019s English-language films, offers such exciting proof of Bong\u2019s genius precisely because it feels like such a clear amalgamation of his previous two, [Snowpiercer and Okja].\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1790524/mickey-17-review/) (9/10):\n\n&gt;\"Mickey 17\" is a deeply heartfelt and uncomfortably funny musing on capitalism, colonization, and corruption. It's a perfect film for our time, and Bong Joon-ho's best English-language film yet.\n\n[Vulture] (https://www.vulture.com/article/mickey-17-review-bong-joon-hos-bitter-take-on-america.html):\n\n&gt;By showing that even the most resigned of sci-fi doormats can decide to stand up for himself, Mickey 17 ends on a more hopeful note than the rest of Bong\u2019s films. It\u2019s more hopeful than we currently deserve.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Who is this mad confection for? The answer should be as obvious as the question is tedious: anyone longing for the sort of sui generis romp a cinematic \u201cuniverse\u201d could never allow itself to get away with, given a 17- or even 170-film run-up.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mickey-17/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Like Mickey himself, it\u2019s goofy and a little inconsistent, but it\u2019s also funny, thoughtful and more plausible than we might like. A charming space oddity for these unusual times.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson/):\n\n&gt;A teen-idol turned auteur-darling turned action-lead, Pattinson could easily call comedy his true calling, here delivering an elastic physical performance as dexterous as Jim Carrey in his prime.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/15/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-proves-expendable-in-bong-joon-hos-eerily-cheery-cloning-drama) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Mickey 17 is visually spectacular with some very sharp, angular moments of pathos and horror... But at two hours and 17 minutes, this is a baggy and sometimes loose film whose narrative tendons are a bit slack sometimes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250215-mickey-17-oscar-winning-director-bong-joon-hos-confused-sci-fi-blockbuster-is-a-serious-disappointment) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The bad news -- and possibly an explanation for its delays in release -- is that it doesn't really know what approach it wants to take instead. All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;The unlikely hero, Mickey Barnes has found himself in the extraordinary circumstance of working for an employer who demands the ultimate commitment to the job\u2026 to die, for a living.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes\n* Naomi Ackie as Nasha Adjaya\n* Steven Yeun as Timo\n* Toni Collette as Ylfa\n* Mark Ruffalo as Kenneth Marshall\n* Holliday Grainger as Gemma\n* Anamaria Vartolomei as Kai Katz\n* Thomas Turgoose\n* Angus Imrie as Shrimp Eyes\n* Cameron Britton as Arkady\n* Patsy Ferran\n* Daniel Henshall\n* Steve Park as Agent Zeke\n* Tim Key\n\nDirected by: Bong Joon-ho\n\nScreenplay by: Bong Joon-ho\n\nBased on: \t*Mickey7* by Edward Ashton\n\nProduced by: Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Bong Joon-ho, Dooho Choi\n\nCinematography: Darius Khondji\n\nEdited by: Yang Jin-mo\n\nMusic by: Jung Jae-il\n\nRunning time: 137 minutes\n\nRelease dates: February 28, 2025 (South Korea), March 7, 2025 (United States)",

        "content": "Been watching all the terminator movies recently, and t3 is not what I would call a strong entry. It's a very safe and corporate version of T2, that is until the very last 5 minutes. Judgement day happens as it's revealed that skynet has become an omnipresent piece of software incapable of being simply turned off. The characters pretty much lose everything except their lives, though there is the promise of eventual victory based on this alone. It's such a tragic yet hopeful ending, shot well, scored well, even the monologue from the film's lackluster John Connor is pretty decent. It's sad that the franchise really never got better than these 5 minutes in over 20 years and 3 movies (I like salvation but man is it kind of a fucking dumb movie lol).",

My opinion at the start wasn't all that good as I wasn't convinced that this movie was worth buying as in the UK and Ireland not a single Bond movie is on any streaming service, but wow, by the time we reached the archive shootout I no longer cared, it was money well spent. \nNow I am going to start off with the negatives.\n\nNegatives -first of all, the henchman (or woman) isn't one of my favourites as her methods of killing feel like something out of a James Bond parody not the acthual thing. \nSecond, i don't like how James Bond ended up sleeping with the Bond girl, felt unnecessary. \nThird and last negative very personal but due to the movie being 12/PG13 and the action being shot in a die hard style, there is no blood which in most movies that use that brutal, over the top style use a lot of blood (all R/18s movies), this movie can't use blood to that level which can make the violence less deadly looking, e.g. the general getting killed. Very personal and doesn't really effect my overall opinion but due to that scene I still have to mention it, sorry.\n\nPositvies\nBoris is a pretty good villain, the general is alright and 006 is good too. I liked the bond girl and her story arc but not how she eventually became a love intrest if that didn't happen I'd like this even more. Brosnan is pretty good at making Bond more modern, pretty much everything else in this movie i liked, cinematography, music, acting, etc. \n\nI am going to give Goldeneye a 9.45/10",

I want to hear your crazy 'How could they have possibly misunderstood this' stories!\n\nFor me it was that post a few years ago where someone badly reviewed Crazy Rich Asians because \"nothing happens\" and the main character doesn't go through any growth and isn't involved in any conflict. It made zero sense until you realize OP watched the whole thing thinking Nick, the LOVE INTEREST, was somehow the main character instead of Rachel.\n\nWhat are some examples you've witnessed?",

Alert.\n\n\nHis son is deaf, then he started to feel frustrated, since they couldn\u2019t bond. Then he basically kinda not bond with his kid for almost 15 years???? His sign language wasn\u2019t even good when his kid was in high school. Eventually they had a big fight, he realized he\u2019s been an absent dad, he sang to his son (with sign language) and everything is good again! \n\n\nI know it\u2019s a movie, I guess it\u2019s because I have kids now, the whole \u201cfather and son quickly bond again\u201d storyline just seems so fake to me. \n\n\nThen there\u2019s the most disturbing part. A student had a huge crush on him, he also seems to have feelings for her too???? The part they almost kiss just made me feel gross. \n\n\n\nEdit: apparently I am wrong about the symphony part so I am gonna delete it.\n\n\nHusband said, I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s so weird when I first saw it, I only remember it was pretty touching. \n\n\nFamily still had a great time.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q78w1ea5rcje1.jpg?width=255&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be71fd928b47d30d6a5cbe4b425a7d5835b3aa3\n\nI had already watched and adored the adaptation of\u00a0*Little Women*\u00a0with June Allyson as Jo, Margaret O'Brien as Beth, Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, and Janet Leigh as Meg. This classic 1949 version holds a special place in my heart.\n\n\"Little Women\" (1994) directed by Gillian Armstrong is a visually stunning adaptation that captures the essence of Louisa May Alcott's novel. However, upon revisiting the film, some flaws become apparent. The choice of title, \"Little Women,\" might seem quaint, but it aptly reflects the story's focus on the growth and struggles of the March sisters, emphasizing their independence and resilience rather than their father's minor role. Yet, the film doesn't entirely escape the era's stereotypes, offering a somewhat softened version of Jo's rebellious spirit. Winona Ryder's portrayal of Jo March is commendable, capturing the character's complexity, but she doesn't quite reach the raw, spirited essence of Jo as seen in earlier adaptations.\n\nDespite these critiques, the relationship between Jo and Bhaer in this adaptation is not without merit. Their connection feels genuine, with a chemistry that adds depth to Jo's character beyond her initial rejections of traditional romance. The scene with the umbrella, symbolizing their union, is beautifully executed, showcasing a love that Jo chooses, not out of necessity but from a place of mutual respect and affection. \n\nIn the 1994 adaptation of\u00a0*Little Women*, Susan Sarandon delivers a remarkable performance as Marmee, portraying her as both a strong, independent woman and a nurturing mother figure. Young Kirsten Dunst shines as Amy, capturing the character\u2019s vivacity and growth with charm and precision. However, Beth\u2019s character, despite a heartfelt performance by Claire Danes, feels somewhat underdeveloped\u2014a reflection of the source material, where Beth often takes a backseat to her sisters. The book\u2019s expansive narrative, spanning years and focusing heavily on Jo, Amy, and Meg, makes it challenging to give equal attention to all characters in a film adaptation. ",

        "content": "I was just rewatching gone girl and was reminded of my experience reading the book versus watching the Fincher masterpiece. The book was readable and entertaining but imo didn\u2019t hold a candle to the film. Rosamund pike\u2019s performance turned Amy into an anti hero (or not based on your definition) and completely devoured every scene she was in. The book spent so much time with Nick who was essentially a stock character and Ben Affleck played it perfectly while giving plenty of room for the actual substance of the story. I think film was a better medium for the nuance of emotions and picked up the slack where the book lagged.\n\nSo my question for Reddit is what film did you think was better than the book and why? Was it a particular performance? Or did the medium suit the narrative better? ",
