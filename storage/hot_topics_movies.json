You could see all the time in the facial expressions and body language of Ripley how she felt under pressure and in the technical effects with light and vapour and sound. At the final scene where the heroine goes in cryosleep we can witness a powerful image of coming to peace. Even though I knew very well how it ends i still got the goosebumps during all the scenes from the final act. ",

I love that movie and it\u2019s become a holiday classic, and while it does a great job of being a holiday movie I realized it\u2019s also such a New Yorker movie, as well. I love all the different scenes in the famous landmarks like Central Park, Lincoln Center and so on, and the characters and writing have a real New York feeling, at least to someone like me that hasn\u2019t lived in the city. \n\nWhat other movies do something like this? Where the themes or genre don\u2019t need to rely on the setting but the movie still does a great job of capturing the setting. Would love to hear some suggestions, one of the things I look for in movies is making the cities feel alive and beautiful in their own way.",

        "content": "Last night I rewatched Blade Runner 2049, and it clicked in a way it didn\u2019t when I first saw it years ago. \n\nPart of that is probably me, but part of it feels like the presentation. Watching it on a large projected screen in 4K made the quieter moments easier to settle into. Scenes of K moving through fog, rain, and empty spaces didn\u2019t feel slow this time. I found myself noticing layers of mist, dust, neon light, and scale that I barely registered before. Some of those wide shots stopped feeling like background and started feeling like spaces you could actually sit inside. \n\nI\u2019m watching on a jmgo n1s 4k and I\u2019m not sure whether this comes more from the setup or simply from how well this film translates to 4K. Either way, it really made me feel that some movies genuinely benefit from a bigger screen and higher detail. Curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. Are there movies you didn\u2019t fully connect with until you watched them again in a better format or on a bigger screen?",

I get that it was up against *Mad Max: Fury Road*, but still, how does a film this accomplished walk away with literally nothing?\n\nI honestly haven\u2019t watched the Academy Awards in years, and just now having seen *Carol* and learning that it went home empty-handed isn\u2019t exactly motivating me to start again.\n\nWhat are some films that surprised you by getting shut out completely?",

So I sat down to watch a supposedly good movie about a family in the heyday of 80s wrestling.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a drama but I had no idea it was going to be so utterly devastating! Why didn't anyone warn me?!\n\nI thought the first half of the movie was solid, if a little slow. I was even finding my attention drifting a little bit at around the 50 minute mark.\n\nBut then the second hour of this movie is somehow 3 hours long and just a mesmerising tragedy that doesn't relent or shield you from the events that steadily punch you in the heart. Not many cheap thrills or twisty turbines, just a morbid sense of neverending 'Ah, fuck...' moments.\n\nI wouldn't say it was a perfect movie, but it was stoically devastating in a way that few stories are, and beautifully executed, if sometimes a little heavy-handed. I'd absolutely recommend it to any who haven't seen it.",

        "title": "Poor Things: two stark contrasts between the novel and the film.",
        "content": "Context: I watched the film before I read the book, and I enjoyed both a great deal. There were many small differences, but I want to discuss two major ones.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms people have for the film is its graphic, irreverent, and reductive portrayal of sex work. Interestingly enough, the portion during which Bella works at the brothel is much shorter and less explicit in the novel. Her main takeaway from the experience isn\u2019t necessarily one of empowerment (e.g. an idea intimated in the film by lines such as \u201cWe are our own means of production\u201d - Bella). If memory serves me correctly, Bella is still naive and doesn\u2019t fully grasp her situation\u2014but she is horrified by the dreadful conditions that she and the other girls work under. She is upset by the invasive and dehumanizing gynecological exams that the on-call doctor subjects the girls to in order to check for STDs and pregnancy. This directly ties in to her goal of wanting to be a doctor so that she can help women and children and treat them with dignity and respect (a goal that is also amplified by her discovery of her former identity, of course).\n\nThe second difference is due to the absence of unreliable narration in the film. The novel has a largely epistolary format. At the beginning, (IIRC) author Alasdair Gray sets up a fictional introduction in which a museum-worker seeks out his aid after discovering McCandles\u2019 account, which seems to have been lost to time. Though they have conflicting perspectives on what to make of the rather fantastical narrative McCandles weaves, Gray proceeds to edit and reprint the book. The story is told from McCandles\u2019 perspective, and includes correspondence he receives from Bella detailing her experiences and thoughts during her travels. However, at the end of the novel, a letter from Bella \u201cto posterity\u201d is included. In her version of events, McCandles was delusional and none of the supernatural events he claimed to have occurred were true. She was actually in love with Godwin, but because he only loved her in a familial sense, she settled for McCandles (and his mental state caused her anguish and a great deal of embarrassment). Being that many of the happenings that McCandles claimed were deeply personal to/outright humiliating for Bella (and since he felt inclined to share it with the world), it does give her an incentive to pretend as though it was all a lie\u2014but she could also be telling the truth that McCandles wasn\u2019t in his right mind. This results in there being ambiguity in the veracity of the story. It\u2019s an interesting angle that the film lacks.\n\nThe first major aforementioned difference leads to the film and novel not being thematically aligned on sex work, its (oftentimes) exploitative nature, and its implications; the second difference between the film and novel costs the former a bit of nuance, imo. Still, as I said before, I enjoyed both adaptations immensely, but I think I prefer the book a bit more.\n\nTo those of you who read the book, please keep me honest about my outline of events (I\u2019m going off of memory here, lol). If you guys have any thoughts you\u2019d like to share about the film or novel in general, please do! Thanks for reading!",

        "content": "Been in a bit of an Indy mood as of late and particularly for this one, which I'm unashamed to say is my favorite of the saga. If Temple Of Doom is your favorite Indiana Jones movie or at least in your top two, this is the topic for you. Thought it'd be fun to have a topic devoted to TOD and those who love the film and rank it in the upper two of the series. I ask no haters or dislikers of the film please, if you don't care for it that's fine, but this isn't the topic for that.\n\nTOD has always been my favorite Indy film. It was my very first one I ever saw (and fitting too, it being a prequel to Raiders and all), and what an introduction to Indy's world at the age I saw it at. The film that most epitomizes Indy as a character and the one most alike the classic adventure serials and pulp adventure novels that influenced the character in the first place. It even evokes the 1950s-era EC Horror comics with it's use of colors. I always enjoyed how TOD is equal parts dark but still very fun, having some good humor that never undermines the tension and it isn't afraid to go into some very Horror-esque territory. I can totally see it being something of a gateway film for Horror fans at a young age. Some dislike the lack of Nazis and a biblical-oriented relic, but that's part of why I like it because it isn't trying to be Raiders all over again and goes for something different and it works all the better for it. Mola Ram is hands down the most terrifying and evil Indy villain ever, and I never minded Willie Scott or Short Round (still upset he didn't return for DOD). Some of the greatest, most thrilling and iconic moments in Indy history alone are from TOD with the likes of the Club Obi-Wan escape, the spike chamber, the sacrifice, the mine cart chase and the bridge climax. TOD has arguably the best music score as well, especially the Slave Children's Crusade theme, which is always gets me energized. It's usage during the scene when Indy emerges from the shadows right before he punches the Thuggee guard gives me chills every time. I always liked how in this film Indy is actually relevant to the plot and outcome, and directly defeats the main villain; in the other four, the villains kill themselves with their arrogance and greed, but here Indy actually plays a pivotal role in the plot.\n\nTOD being my favorite Indy film is a hill I'll die on. It's right alongside Raiders as the best for me. Both movies are Indy at his purest and edgiest, and TOD feels like it was truly the last intense all-out installment before the remainder of the series became more family-friendly. Wonder who else here feels similarly to me and cites TOD either as their favorite or at the very least in their top two of the saga. It's a peak adventure film and peak vintage Spielberg.",
