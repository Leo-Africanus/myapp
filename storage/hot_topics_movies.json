        "content": "We will be back today Wednesday 4/17 at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\nWe are Andrew Ahn (co-writer/director) and James Schamus (co-writer/producer) of THE WEDDING BANQUET\u2014 a deeply personal, sharply funny, and emotionally rich reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s beloved 1993 classic.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nTogether, we bring decades of filmmaking experience to the table! James is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and producer behind films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, and the original version of The Wedding Banquet. Andrew is a Sundance-winning director whose work like Spa Night, Driveways, and Fire Island explores identity, intimacy, and family, both those we\u2019re born with and those we choose for ourselves, with heart and nuance.\n\nThis new version of The Wedding Banquet reflects the world we live in now \u2014 from universal, evolving ideas of family and tradition, to the complexities of queer Asian American identity. We\u2019ve poured our hearts into this project, and we\u2019re thrilled to share it with you!\n\nWant to know about the making of this film, what it means to update a classic, or how two storytellers came together to collaborate? Ask us anything.\n\nOur credits:\n\nAndrew Ahn \u2013 Director/Co-Writer -\u00a0[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3821224/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3821224/)\n\nJames Schamus \u2013 Producer/Co-Writer -\u00a0[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770005/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770005/)",

        "title": "Grandma's Boy was way ahead of its time and doesn't get the credit it deserves",
        "content": "It's a good solid comedy about a group of friends who work at a video game company in the mid 2000s. Waaay before nerd culture became popular and mainstream. It shows the lives of actual nerds before being a nerd became cool. Is it a cinematic masterpiece and the most well written comedy film ever? Of course not. Is it also a stoner movie? Yes. But it isn't a stoner movie in the way Half Baked or Harold and Kumar are stoner movies. And I think that aspect has always overshadowed the fact that it's just an overall good buddy comedy set in a time that is very nostalgic for a lot of people who were in the same age range as the characters at the time the movie was released. The reason I say it was ahead of its time is because you can swap out the video game company in Grandma's Boy with any creative media/internet/journalistic venture that groups of nerd friends have launched over the past 20 years, and it could serve as the exact same kind of backdrop for a similar story. And seeing how having such a venture is the norm these days in nerd culture, you can't deny seeing the makings of that kind of thing in the modern era of pop culture as early on as Grandma's Boy. Like I said, overall it's just a good comedy. But too often it gets dismissed as just being a typical stoner movie.\n\nEdit: Nice to see all the love for Grandma's Boy. ",

Additionally, certain children\u2019s films contain messages or overall story arcs that as an adult you need to explain to your child conceptually for them to fully understand and embrace. Not even sure if I\u2019m speaking to the proper audience, but if you haven\u2019t seen Sing 2 please do yourself a favor.",

He is an amazing character actor who embodies his roles so well. I think what he does best is micro-expressions and the way he acts is just so natural in a given situation.\n\nI love him in Game Night. That role can just be a run of the mill nosy and annoying neighbor but he made it quite charming and so funny. \n\nAnyway, what is your favorite role of his? Some choices to pick from:\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nUSS Callister\n\nPower of the Dog\n\nKinda of Kindness\n\nThe Irishman\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nFargo\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nCivil War \n\nGame Night\n\nZero Day\n\n",

Because he didn\u2019t try to make things grander than they were, or add a lot of bigger more epic things for dramatic purposes. He stayed completely true to real life even though the case in real life went nowhere. Telling the story through the eyes of Jake Gyllenhaal playing the real life cartoonist was the perfect way to tell the story for the film, because that\u2019s where the letters were being sent, so we slowly learn the case at the same time as everyone else is learning about it reading the sent letters. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always, and this is by far my favorite performance from Mark Ruffalo! I love how the 3 main characters get roughly the same amount of screen time and all 3 have their own story arcs that we follow, great film!",

The film does a good job of balancing the dark subject matter with humour. By the third act, the light tone disarms you and you're hit with this unpredictable really dark reveal. It's been a while since a film caught me off guard like this. \n\nAdam Brody is fantastic as the lead as well. If you like neo-noirs and dark comedies please give this a watch.",

And it's not only the romantic scenes that work but also the comedic lines or them just talking casually. They feel real.\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on other unexpected but fantastic pairings. What else am I missing out on?\n\nEdit: Another one that just sprang to mind is Elle Fanning and Peter Dinklage in I Think We're Alone Now. This surprises me not because of the height difference but the age and experience difference. Their relationship seems natural  and I honestly can't imagine another pairing in those roles.",

        "content": "Jack O'Connell is an English actor who hasn't risen to huge fame (yet) but is tremendous in most things that he has been in.\n\n  \nI saw him a long time ago on Skins and he stole every scene he was in. Skins is a breeding ground for talented British actors like Daniel Kaluuya, Nicholas Hoult, Dev Patel and many more.  When he was on screen with the likes of these guys, he really stood out.\n\nI think his biggest US movie was Unbroken, directed by Angelina Jolie, where he was the main character.  Physical role and he carried it well.\n\nI just think this dude should get more visibility because hes a great actor with a lot of promise.,",

If you've seen it, I don't need to tell you. But if you haven\u2019t, watch it when you're in the mood for fun. Or outright need fun. It\u2019s just joyful.

        "content": "As the title says. This question came upon me as I'm re-watching Kill Bill and admiring the development put into all the main targets of the movie. Whether or not they're actually /villains/ in the full context of the word is up for debate I guess, but you guys know what I mean. They're the enemies, at the very least.\n\nThey didn't feel /just/ like targets to be defeated, but like their own individual person- which you'd figure would be granted in movies, but I feel many villains end up just being, well, villains just for the story, if that makes sense. It's definitely something that really draws me into the story being told in the movie, gives me a bit more of a reason to care about what's happening. I'm not sure how to express my thoughts properly, but I believe my general point has gotten across.",
