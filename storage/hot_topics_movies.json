He has even killed children in cold blood, and he's about to put a gun to her head in order to achieve what he wants. So, after everything is over, and the last nail has been put to the coffin with Kate signing the papers, it is time for judgement. He breaks the gun down to pieces instead of taking it, and gives time to Kate to put it back together. Kate takes the gun and goes to the balcony.\n\nEverything has been planned by Alejandro until this point. Remember what is the first thing he says at the beginning of the scene \"you shouldn't go outside to the balcony Kate\" you can see the father daughter relationship between them. Father says something then the child does the opposite. And then all of a sudden Alejandro stops for no reason and turns around. He knows that Kate will be there and turns to listen the verdict of his dead daughter.\n\nAnd the daughter although she is angry with her father she forgives him because she understands.",

It doesn't scare me, it thrills me and I want more of it.\n\nIt's hard to really put into words what I'm specifically looking for, what's gonna scratch that itch. I just know it when I see it.\n\nLike at the end of Cabin in the Woods, when the Ancient One's hand juts out from the ground and it's enormous. Like that, but MORE! I wish there was more than just a had there.\n\nUgh. I wish I knew a better way to describe what I want here. Hopefully I'm making enough sense that some of y'all can recommend some stuff like that.\n\nAlso I know this is the movies subreddit, and that's mostly what I'm looking for, but if anybody has any video games or comics that do this thing well too, or even really detailed prose in a novel, I'd love that as well. (The God of War games do this kinda thing REALLY well. Particularly GOW3)\n\nThanks in advance to anybody that's able to decipher what I specifically am looking for lmao",

        "content": "my wife suggested this and honestly it was rad. worth the 3.99 rental on apple hands down.\n\n I cant believe I hadn't seen it before. shot all on practical locations (think HEAT) and one of the best hero\u2018s journey I\u2019ve seen. I was surprised it was written and directed by men considering the heroine and themes. \n\ni hadn\u2019t seen the TriStar logo for a while either so that was nostalgic. highly recommend this movie. this has to be a cult classic no?",

I can honestly say it is one of the best movies, I have ever watched. It captivates the working class of 1960s England so well. I genuinely couldn\u2019t get my eyes off of the screen, especially at the end. From the moment he befriends Kes to all way to the end. \n\nSorry, I don\u2019t know how to describe the film without spoiling too much.  ",

        "content": "I saw Sentimental Value last night and came away impressed by the acting, film making etc but largely unmoved by the overall experience.\n\nThere is a kind of sub-genre of films like this that treat the ennui of successful, upper-middle class creative types as the most fascinating topic for exploration. The work of Sofia Coppola particularly focuses on this troup (Lost in Translation, On the Rocks, Somewhere) but she's far from the only one making these films.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I somewhat role my eyes when I read a synopsis and see one of the main characters has some role in the creative arts (novellist, script writer, film maker etc etc) because it feels so played out.\n\nIs it just the fact that creative types can be naval-gazey? Is it that once you're involved in this kind of world you just write what you know? Or am I imaginging something that isn't there?",

A film crew comes to their town to reenact the battle against the Nazis. Because they're all senile, the old gangsters think the fascists have returned, dig up their arsenal and proceed to murder all the film extras who are dressed as Nazis. \n\nPlease help! I remember it was amazing. ",
