        "content": "More than 20 years and dozens and dozens of feature-length superhero movies later, I still think that **The Incredibles** sits at the top of the list by a fairly wide margin. \n\nThis movie has so much to say about personal and familial growth. Every member the family is well-written in their struggle with finding their place in the family and in the greater world. On top of that each one of their superpowers perfectly reflects their character\u2019s *personal* strengths and weaknesses without being hamfisted about it! You get to see how both suppression and expression of their powers affects each family member differently. \n\n\nIt\u2019s really a masterclass in movie writing and I only scratched the surface: the retro-futuristic setting, the surprisingly emotional and intense story beats, the villain\u2026 all of it is so thoughtful and well-executed.\n\nThen there\u2019s the music, the voice acting, and the creative *action*! \n\nBrad Bird\u2019s fingerprints are all over the action set pieces. From the kids discovering the broader range of their superpower abilities while under extreme pressure, to Bob\u2019s strength paired with his brute force tactics, to Helen\u2019s ingenuity and quick-thinking skills in both the plane and hallway sequences, all of it is so clever and entertaining. \n\nThe absolute worst thing I can say about this movie is that the animation looks 20 years old, because it is. But otherwise this movie has been both a blessing and a curse all these years for me because I hold every other superhero movie to this standard. Unfortunately 95% of them have not been even close to this level of excellence. \n\n\n\n",

How did John Rambo go from being a traumatized Veteran, tormented by his past and turned into a social avenger after being mistreated by bullying cops, to a loyal war mercenary, serving orders from army officials and fighting the Russians? \n\nI watched First Blood Part II in disbelief. Apparently, Ronald Reagan liked the Rambo sequels which doesn't put these films in a positive light. \n\nPart II wasn't even good. The point of the first film was a critique of fascism, of how veterans are not taken care off and become social outsiders bcause the Government refused to do its part. Part II almost completely forgot what the first film said, didn't get John Rambo is not G.I. Joe and basically turned the sequels into the antithesis of the crux of the original. Part II is generic, formulaic and violent. Some scenes are as cringy as any Chuck Norris' war film. Julia Nickson as Cao exists solely as the foreigner who yearns to be saved by an American.

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a neat little trick Steven Spielberg uses in his movies, starting with\u00a0*Jurassic Park*. There's a scene where Alan Grant is having raptors explained to him, while in the background, John Hammond is having a separate conversation. Both conversations are audible, but as the audience, you naturally focus on Grant\u2019s, which is more relevant to the plot. This layering of dialogue makes the world feel more lived-in, like we\u2019re overhearing real people rather than just following a scripted exchange.\n\nIn\u00a0*Saving Private Ryan*, that moment with the translator, Upham, works similarly. His nervous, clumsy energy contrasts with Captain Miller\u2019s (Hanks) composed discussion, reinforcing their dynamic. The overlapping dialogue makes it feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping rather than being spoon-fed exposition, adding a level of realism that pulls you deeper into the scene.\n\nSpielberg does this in\u00a0*Jaws*, too\u2014think about Brody, Hooper, and Quint talking over each other on the boat. The chaotic energy makes their interactions feel natural and unfiltered, pulling us deeper into their world.\n\nIt\u2019s such a clever way to enhance immersion without drawing attention to itself. Has anyone else noticed this in his other films? Would love to hear more examples!",

        "content": "I enjoy when films pull this off. Rather than focusing on what you're hearing or what characters are saying, the scene uses silence to make things feel more uncomfortable. Long pauses in dialogue where there's more to read from what isn't being said and the stretch of silence rather than what is being said. What are some movie scenes that pull this off really well? \n\nThe Shining stands out as a really strong example. There's a scene with Jack and Grady that has plenty of silent moments in between conversation.  Just long awkward pauses within the conversation that really made the scene feel more eerie. Sometimes it isn't about what's being said but what isn't that can add a lot to a scene.",

I'm thinking of movies like Hell or High Water, No Country for Old Men, Way of the Gun, Drive, Heat. I don't there is this certain sense of doom that I kind of feel from these movies and I want more, I really enjoy the types of endings these movies have and I'm looking for more.

        "title": "The Empty Man - The Horror of Existence",
        "content": "A month ago I decided to check out The Empty Man (2020).  It was an overlooked movie and honestly fron the description it sounded like another run of the mill horror movie overlooked during COVID.  I was surprised to be wrong about that assumption.\n\nThe movie starts off in the mountains of Bhutan where a group of hikers encounter an entity on the mountain that possesses one of the group, and leads to the destruction of all involved.  Its a 20 minute cold open that raises many questions and answers none, giving us a purposeful set up to the rest of the movie, one that isn't understood for most of the runtime.  But it allows for an almost shocking setting change from a mountain range in Asia to the suburbs of a major US city.\n\nWhat plays out next feels, at first, like a run of the mill urban legend, mythological killer type movie. Our main character is an ex-cop who is investigating the disappearance of the daughter of a woman he had an affair with right before his wife and son died. She and her friends learned of the legend of the empty man: it you find an empty bottle on a bridge and blow into it while focusing on the Empty Man, he will appear. Over the course of 3 days you will see him more and more until he takes you.  As he slowly follows the clues to this mystery he begins to discover a connection to a cult who is invested in creating tulpas in order to harness the power of The Empty Man.\n\nWhat entails is an existential Lovecraftian nightmare, something that forces are main character to question the reality we live in and what evil entities exist just behind the veil.  It examines the ideas of identity, truth, free will and sacrifice over the back drop of those entities that wish to control those very ideas in order to use us.\n\nThe end is quite the revelation and takes a stunning turn that throws everything into question that we know about this world we've been introduced to. Unlike many plot twists that ruin the previous portions of a movie when rewatched (Im looking at you LongLegs), this sudden realization actually seems to work on rewatch, and makes it all the more interesting to dissect the movie on future viewings.\n\nAdd to that the direction, cinematography and shot composition are beautiful. The slow pace over the course of 2 hours and 20 minutes allows the the movie to take its time introducing its ideas and slowly unraveling a mystery that you become more invested in with each revelation.\n\nThis is definitely an overlooked movie. I can't find much information on it in general, nor many opinions on it.  I have to recommend it and also hope to hear some thoughts from those of you who may also have enjoyed this movie.\n",

        "title": "February 21-23 Box Office Recap: Despite repeating at #1, 'Captain America: Brave New World' collapses 68.3%, the third worst second weeekend drop in the MCU. Meanwhile, 'The Monkey' opens with $14 million, the second best debut in Neon's history.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xec8micb16le1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9aaf2ff9ae07e359ef5b9d59ed8b9fd2eb6025\n\nWell, the inevitable happened. ***Captain America: Brave New World*** was still on the top spot, but it had one of the worst MCU second weekend drops. Neon decided to release ***The Monkey***, and it deliver their second biggest debut ever. The other newcomer was Zachary Levi's ***The Unbreakable Boy***, which unsurprisingly bombed.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $71.1 million this weekend. That's up 38.6% from last year, when ***Bob Marley: One Love*** repeated atop.\n\nRepeating in the top spot, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $28.1 million this weekend. That represents a brutal 68.3% drop from its opening weekend. That's the third worst drop in the MCU, behind ***Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania*** (69.9%) and ***The Marvels*** (78.1%). This drop is insane, considering there wasn't much competition this weekend. But it's a sign that its weak word of mouth is already spreading.\n\nThrough ten days, the film has made $141.1 million. Its opening weekend was $18 million behind ***Quantumania***, and now its numbers are $26 million behind. That gap is only gonna get wider. $200 million is dead for this film, and it could also miss $190 million at this point. That's gotta hurt.\n\nDebuting in second place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** earned $14 million in 3,200 theaters. This is Neon's second biggest debut ever, just behind ***Longlegs*** ($22.4 million). Kinda crazy to think Osgood Perkins now has the top 2 debuts for Neon. It's also the best horror debut of 2025 so far.\n\nAll in all, this is a great start. Neon mounted a very successful marketing campaign, which was reportedly relying on digital ads. While horror titles often cost $40+ million to market, Neon kept things simple: they spent just $10 million in prints and advertising. A sign that a film doesn't need to spend a lot on marketing to open this high. Neon also emphasized the connections to ***Longlegs***, which was a smart call, and also highlighting Stephen King's involvement. Reviews were also good enough (78%) to convince others in giving this a chance.\n\nAccording to Neon, 58% of the audience was male, and 65% was 25 and over. They gave it a very middling \"C+\" on CinemaScore, which is also the same score for ***Longlegs***. That's not a death sentence for a horror tho; generally, these titles land in the C range. There's a lack of horror till ***The Woman in the Yard*** in late March. It won't hit ***Longlegs***' domestic total, but it should still hit $40 million, which is a big win for Neon.\n\nSony's ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.5 million this weekend. That's a 49% drop, which is steeper than both prior films. Through ten days, the film has amassed $25.2 million and it's probably gonna miss $40 million if it continues dropping like this.\n\nDreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 40%, adding $5.8 million this weekend. That's still quite rough for an animated title. The film's domestic total stands at $78.7 million, and it looks like $100 million might be out of reach.\n\nIn fifth place, ***Ne Zha 2*** fell 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has earned $14.8 million, but again, this market is not truly important for the film.\n\n***Heart Eyes*** had a boost last week thanks to Valentine's Day, but that's pretty much over. The film collapsed 73% this weekend, earning $2.7 million. The film has made $26.6 million, and it won't make it much further than $30 million.\n\n***Mufasa: The Lion King*** dropped 40%, adding $2.5 million this weekend. The film has made $245.4 million so far.\n\nIn eighth place, Lionsgate's ***The Unbreakable Boy*** debuted in 1,687 theaters, where it flopped with just $2.3 million this weekend. That's not a surprise, given how long it took the film to escape development hell; this was filmed back in 2020. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely it lasts long in theaters. Another L for Zachary Levi.\n\nThe Indian film ***Chhaava*** added $1.5 million this weekend, which was just a 21% drop. The film has made $4.8 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which dropped 53%, grossing $1.3 million this weekend. With a $45.9 million domestic total, the film has now amassed a 4x multiplier. Truly impressive.\n\n***Love Hurts*** indeed. The film collapsed 74%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. The film has earned a meager $14.5 million, and it doesn't have much gas left in the tank.\n\nQuiver Distribution released Martin Campbell's action thriller ***Cleaner*** in 378 theaters, and unsurprisingly, it flopped with $403,560. It will disappear quickly.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $35.3 million this weekend, for a $289.5 million worldwide total. That's a steep 60%, and its numbers are $75 million behind ***Quantumania*** through the same point. The best markets are the UK ($16.7M), China ($13.5M), Mexico ($10.7M), Korea ($9.1M) and France ($8.9M). Without any other markets left, it looks like the film will struggle to hit $400 million worldwide. That's flop territory.\n\n***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** has now hit $72 million overseas. The best markets are the UK ($34.5M), Australia ($6M), Poland ($4.2M), Netherlands ($3.3M) and Spain ($1.9M). And it still has some big markets left.\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.7 million this weekend, and the film has crossed $150 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Nosferatu* | Dec/25 | Focus Features | $21,652,560 | $95,608,235 | $178,719,280 | $50M\n*Wolf Man* | Jan/17 | Universal | $10,897,495 | $20,707,280 | $34,383,593 | $25M\n\n- It was time for ***Nosferatu*** to turn off the lights in the Krusty Krab. The film has closed with a fantastic $95 million domestically and $178 million worldwide, easily becoming Robert Eggers' highest film. Just wonderful. Wonderful all around. Focus wants to stay in business with him, which is why they greenlit ***Werwulf*** for Christmas Day 2026.\n\n- Hey, we were just talking werewolves, what a coincidence. Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** has closed with a terrible $20.7 million domestically and just $34.3 million worldwide. That's a pathetic 1.90x multiplier, and it's crazy to believe it only made it to just four weeks in theaters. Blumhouse is known for printing money, but this was the rare theatrical flop. Leigh Whannell was unable to replicate the success of ***The Invisible Man*** here. The final nail in the coffin: ***The Invisible Man*** made more in its opening weekend ($28.2 million) than what ***Wolf Man*** did in its domestic lifetime. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWith the Oscars on Sunday, there's just one single wide release this weekend. And it may struggle to hit $10 million.\n\nIt's Focus Features' ***Last Breath***, which stars Woody Harrelson, Simu Liu, Finn Cole, and Cliff Curtis. The film is a remake of the 2019 documentary and tells the story of seasoned deep-sea divers who battle the raging elements to rescue a crewmate who's trapped hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
