        "content": "Hello\nI'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny\u2014but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.\n\nMost movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts\u2014and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)\nIf you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!\nI hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything \ud83d\ude05. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!",

Hs death causes her to lose her baby and after she finds out who outed her husband to the cops, she poses as a babysitter to the woman who's given birth and needs a nanny. DeMornay's Icy Blonde look and cold expressions switching from a sunshine smile to a menacing foul-mouthed threat, she's just perfect in this movie. \n\nI am disappointed she never got a part as good as this one. I saw her in Feds, unrecognizable in Runaway Train, moving in Testament, a brief but warm presence in The Trip to Bountiful, she was my favorite version of Milady De Winter in \"The Three Musketeers\" (I haven't seen Eva Green's take, though). \n\nShe was also the original choice for Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook and I can't help but think she probably would have been a more faithful and intriguing choice than Julia Roberts' boyish turn. Girlfriend looked more like one of the Lost Boys than an actual fairy.",

        "content": "I do feel like the obvious answer has to be Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition DVD special features, but when I think back I can't remember a time I wouldn't bring up the Shrek DVD special features either. Clerks special edition had a lot of cool extra content and feature too, pretty much any Kevin Smith project had great feautres. I would say anything with Kevin Smith, PTA, Wes Anderson, Tarantino, and Cohen Brothers I was always super into.\n\nGrowing up I would take an 8th of shrooms and bring 3 DVDs up to my room and just have a marathon while I couldn't sleep. \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was always a go-to for me, \"Life Aquatic with Steve Zisou\" was an amazing film that I liked a lot more on rewatch (definitely recommend an 8th to get very detail oriented for themes and even fun easter eggs), and usually a fight between \"Kung Pow:Enter the Fist\" if I wanted to just laugh my ass off, or \"O' Brother Where Art Thou\" if I really wanted to take my brain away and enjoy a masterpiece. \n\nIs there one in particular that comes to mind? It doesn't need to be pigeon-holed to just a movie I guess, DVDs for shows have great special features as well. \n\nThank you for commenting and keeping things respectful! ",

If you ever watched the Mad TV parodies, they only exaggerated a tiny bit. \n\nThank god for Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in Under Sieger who were so crazy they managed to make Seagal seem subtle by comparison.

I think super neat dental veneers and plastic surgeries play a role here (for example, Nicole Kidman in The Northman looked distinctly modern), but I don't think that's the full answer.

        "content": "I just want to put this out there, because I haven\u2019t seen it discussed anywhere and want to see what people think. Benji represents David\u2019s repressed pain in this movie. Literally, his pain made real. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen it, so I can\u2019t remember every detail but I\u2019m going to do my best to make my case.  \n\n\nWhen they were younger, David was a boy would cry at everything, and the two characters were constantly together, but as David grew older, he left his pain (Benji) behind in order to create a life for himself. David never goes to visit his cousin, and although he\u2019s open to short visits from Benji in NYC, it is one thing to allow yourself to feel bits and pieces of your trauma as though it\u2019s a visitor in your home, it isnt the same as fully engaging with it on its own terms. When their grandmother dies, David arrives at the airport and finds his cousin waiting for him. They go to Poland and, as David sees the horrors that his people went through, he reconnects with his repressed pain (Benji). Benji, literally an emotion in human form, is difficult to deal with for the tour group, embarrassing to David, who constantly tries to tamp him down, but ultimately binds the group together through their shared experience of him. David becomes a fuller version of himself for having embraced that part of his identity, and when they return home, he offers to come see Benji, who refuses the offer. The lesson is that once you open yourself up to your trauma, it loses much of its power and urgency. Benji sits back down in the airport where he started, waiting for the next time David needs him.\n\nAlso significant, but couldn\u2019t find a place for it here: Benji lived with their grandmother until her death, a woman who, as a Holocaust survivor, could never have lived without the pain of that experience.\n\n",

Of course the original movie required going through the entire gameplay sequence but it's still possible that dying wouldn't have killed you in real life.",

It\u2019s all there, and all are strong. Plus the mood that Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci put together, it\u2019s just a great work of filmmaking.  One of the few movies without a happy ending that is better off.  The other half of the double feature was Tampopo, another fab film itself.  All in all, a great night at the theater.",

And that sets the conflict between the rebellious Murphy and Nurse Ratched, the former aiming to brighten the otherwise depressing atmosphere of the asylum, while the latter tries everything to establish her authority.\n\nInto this conflict, are thrown a motley bunch of characters\n\n**Chief Bromden, aka Broom( Will Sampson**)- Deaf and dumb, with an imposing physique.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76q6z15nyyfe1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee71b376e68568687758f675a836fec5bdfa0cf\n\n**Billy\u00a0 Bibbit( Brad Dourif)**\u2013 a shy, stuttering individual, affected by his mother's domineering nature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmjuby8syyfe1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99dcdd38da3f66d1aa9da34fbc72e3b7a1b1d00f\n\n**Dale Harding( William Redfield)**\\- Soft spoken intellectual, who has been affected by his wife's adultery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qo6aekyyyfe1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0cb88be465efd6e499b50dabcea87762ae48cde\n\n**Charlie Cheswick( Sydney Lassik)**\u2013 a\u00a0 neurotic\u00a0 with no self\u00a0 confidence\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90ui7nk2zyfe1.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7722cd74d0105c5a9b4c673cf36ed4f46835d3d\n\n**Martini( Danny De Vito**) -Utterly immature\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ckfk7y6zyfe1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3208cf72baf86e8ceb2def41e3be411fe136eef3\n\nAnd **Taber( Christopher Lloyd)**, the trouble maker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3aphbmczyfe1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de796e2c13c64862aaf7689ce72403d8a70ff0e1\n\nThe movie delves into the age old conflict of a rebellious individual vs an oppresive system, as both Murphy and Ratched try to establish their authority.  Murphy prides in his rebellious nature, in his own words.\n\n*I\u2019m a god-damn marvel of modern science*\n\nOne of my favorite scenes is when Murphy requests Ratched for a small change in the schedule, so that the inmates can watch opener\u00a0 of\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 1963 World\u00a0 Series, saying a little change never hurts. To which she retorts.\n\n\u00a0*Some men on the ward take a long, long time to get used to the schedule. Change it now and they might find it very disturbing*.\n\nAnd that is when she calls for a poll, however when Murphy gets 9 members to support him, she immediately changes rules saying he needs support\u00a0 of\u00a0 at least\u00a0 18 members.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0063iwjq0zfe1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f509f0b4edb31dff56423b09359e91936272fcb5\n\nBut then Murphy recreates the entire World Series game, play by play, using inventive techniques, in one memorable scene. Another superb scene is when he sneaks out the inmates on a fishing trip, and then introduces them as doctors.\n\n*This is Dr. Cheswick, Dr. Taber, Dr. Frederickson, Dr. Scanlon, the famous Dr. Scanlon, Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit, Dr. Martini, and Dr. Sefelt (William Duell)\u2026Oh, I\u2019m Dr. McMurphy, R. P. McMurphy.*\n\nThe movie is kind of a bitter sweet experience, with some delightfully comic scenes like these, and the really disturbing ones later on. Forman balances the pathos with the comic superbly, and when you see the ending, it just hits you so hard.\n\nThis is the kind of role that is right up Jack's alley, and he just digs into it with relish, that scene where he recreates the World Series with his expression is pure gold, and he deserved the Oscar.\n\nAs did Louis Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, conveying cold menace with her expressions, you just end up detesting her, no wonder she was among the top villians in movie history.\n\nApart from these two the supporting cast is equally brilliant too, especially Brad Dourif as Billy in his debut movie, who is brutally exploited by Ratched.  All the other inmates do a faboulous job especially Will Sampson, Danny De Vito and Christopher Lloyd.\n\nThis was one of the few movies that won all the Big 5 Oscars- Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay, and it deserved all.\n\n",
