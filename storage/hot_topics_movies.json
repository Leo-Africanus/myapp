        "content": "My dad always does something I've only ever heard of people occasionally doing. No matter what movie or TV show he's watching at home, he will get up in the middle of it and with zero urgency, go to the bathroom, grab food, look out the window, or do any number of random things, all without pausing.  He'll then sit back down having missed 5-20 minutes without saying a word and never asks questions after the movie. \n\nIt used to drive me nuts when I lived at home over a decade ago and recently I stayed over one night and watched him do the same thing.  My mom doesn't even bother asking if she should pause. \n\nQuality doesn't matter either. It could be the greatest movie he's ever seen, but he'll still miss 10 minutes of it doing whatever. I've seen him take out the garbage, cook popcorn on the stovetop, and even fold laundry in another room all while a movie he wanted to watch was playing. \n\nThis is insane right? I understand not being in to a movie and getting bored, but in my 30+ years I've never seen or heard of him sitting through an entire movie.  This is the same guy who can sit on the porch for an hour or two doing nothing. I don't understand. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to change him or anything. I just truly don't understand and want to see if anyone else knows someone like this.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n****EDIT**** People keep saying it's about spending time with others or not wanting to interrupt. It's just my mom and dad at home, and if they disagree on what to watch she'll go upstairs to watch something while he watches what he wants alone....but still gets up without pausing.",

I think she stood a slight chance of getting a nomination for Amelia but that didn't pull through. \n\nThe last I heard of her was in that Christian film she did with Alan Ritchson and there was that. \n\nI've always liked Hillary Swank. I was rooting for her when she got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, a major FU for 90210 after they fired her. \n\nIt's unfortunate Hollywood didn't know how to use her properly.

        "content": "I rewatched this not that long ago, and even though I know it's pretty standard to watch comedies from this era and see a lot of things that are like 'wow that didn't age well' (even if it's still an otherwise funny movie), but rewatching this, I was surprised at how the overall messaging and way it depicts these characters felt a lot more fair and interesting than a lot of other films from that era.\n\nParticularly, the scene where Jack Black takes the principal out to get drinks and we see a totally different side of her, as well as when we see the barrage of parents harassing her and suddenly we totally get a sense of how this kind of pressure could lead to someone becoming like this. I feel like the trope of 'the stuffy old mean teacher lady' has been a comedy thing for about as long as there have been movies set in schools, but this one just flips it on its head in a way that really stood out to me.\n\nIt also does a really good job at avoiding the overly cartoony cliche ending of \"oh, but look what they learned! it's totally fine!\" I mean, yes, it does that somewhat with the very ending over the credits, but the parents are still very rightfully furious that this random stranger has been with their kids, and the movie treats it more like how I expect people would react to it in real life. It's a tiny thing, but just giving these elements (such as the principal or the parents reactions) a little more believability and less cartoonish one dimensionality really adds to it.\n\nI'm also glad they never did a sequel, because there's absolutely no reason to, although now that I've said that I'm assuming we'll see a headline that it's been greenlit within the next two days.",

Amazing acting, especially from Annette Benning and Greta Gerwig.  I loved that it was about everything and nothing, showing a slice of life nostalgia trip encapsulating a portion of the late 1970s US.  It sets the tone and feel very well.  Any other movies that hit those same notes and \\*feel\\* like 20th Century Women?",

        "title": "Juno is totally different as an adult",
        "content": "I recently watched Juno for the first time since I was about 13 or 14. I was in junior high I believe when the movie first released, and seeing it as an adult really blew my mind. The creators somehow perfectly captured the awkward and intense feelings of not being a kid, but not quite an adult yet either. \n\nFirst note, Mark was a massive creep and weirdo. Kissing a teenage girl when you\u2019re an adult is creepy and gross all on its own. Then you throw in that SHE WAS CARRYING THEIR ADOPTIVE CHILD. What the actual fuck! What a disgusting pathetic man. Watching the scene when he took Juno to the basement to show her the comic of a pregnant super hero was so disgusting. Their relationship in general was coming off very grooming, then he was seducing a pregnant 16 year old girl who was extremely vulnerable. In my young teenage mind, I thought Vanessa was such a wet blanket, suppressing his creative side and making him and Juno both feel like losers. In reality, she was a saint who should have kicked him to the curb way sooner. He deserved no grace. I cannot imagine my partner not only cheating on me, but cheating with a teenager. And not just a teenager, a pregnant teenager who is carrying my adoptive son. Vanessa was such a great person and didn\u2019t deserve anything that pathetic excuse of a man put her through. \n\nSecond note, Juno(and company) is extremely immature and the creators did a great job of showcasing it. I love her quirkiness, but the way she did not understand why it was inappropriate to be popping up at Mark and Vanessa\u2019s house was very telling. There are two sides to that coin, because she may have known it was inappropriate but was too young and naive to see the long term outcome of the situation. She definitely didn\u2019t understand why a man of his age shouldn\u2019t be chumming it up with her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy the fact that he was even giving her attention at all. It helped that he liked the same things, so in her mind it was confirming she was cool. It just shows exactly how immature she was, unable to look past your own bubble to see the rest of your life. \n\nOn another note, it was implied that she and Bleaker were way better friends than what we saw in the movie. It seemed that they were hanging out everyday, had all the same interests and hobbies. But, when Juno came up pregnant Bleaker fell off the map. He never seemed pressed when she would stop and say hey, but he did absolutely nothing to try and help her in the situation. He also didn\u2019t understand why it hurt her so much he was taking someone else to a dance. At that point in the plot, we really got to see how the normally confident and abrasive Juno was becoming self conscious and confused by the weight of her feelings. Highlighting how juvenile everyone was, while dealing with such a serious situation was just top tier writing. The whole movie did such a great job of capturing exactly how it feels to be 16. Too old for childhood, but nowhere near an adult yet. Even though every single 16 year old in the world thinks they\u2019re an adult. It takes growing up to realize exactly how childish you still are at that age. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worth mentioning how great of parents her dad and Bren were. Bren was her step mom and they didn\u2019t seem particularly close, but she didn\u2019t hesitate when it came to Juno. Of the jump, she was getting her to a doctor, coming to her defense when needed, and making sure she had everything she needed. And her father, who was obviously uncomfortable with emotional bridges with his teenaged daughter, made sure she knew she was loved. The scene of her in hospital after giving birth brought tears to my eyes. \n\nAs a whole, the movie is great. I\u2019m not sure what category you could out this movie in, but they somehow captured a vibe of nostalgia I didn\u2019t know I was missing. And just to bring it in again, we should all beat Marks ass if we ever happened to see his character out in the real world. \n\n*Edit Note: \n\npeople are being gross about Elliot Page being in the movie. Elliot is an amazing actor and their gender at any point in their life has absolutely NOTHING to do with the character of Juno. I\u2019m referring to Juno as she/her, not Elliot. You\u2019re weird if you care about someone else\u2019s gender enough to be a dick about it. No one cares what you think. Elliot is happy and that\u2019s all that\u2019s important. Keep your weird ass comments to yourself if you\u2019ve got something nasty to say. You\u2019re the weird one if you can\u2019t just simply respect what a person wants for their own autonomy.
