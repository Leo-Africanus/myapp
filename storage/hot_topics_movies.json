        "content": "i went into Bone Tomahawk expecting a normal western, maybe even a slightly funny or laid-back one, but it ended up completely catching me off guard. Instead of the usual cowboy banter and simple shootouts, the movie slowly turns really dark and brutal, especially as it goes on. The tone is serious and uncomfortable, and the violence feels way more realistic and disturbing than I expected, which made it hard to watch at times. What shocked me most was how it tricks you into thinking it\u2019s a standard western before revealing that it\u2019s basically a horror movie hiding under that surface, and once it gets there, it doesn\u2019t hold back at all.",

        "content": "I love how much attention to detail was put into the fights in this movie.  Too many \"1 vs. numerous assailants\" fights fall into the trap of having the opponents wait their turn to fight the hero.  Here, while Neo is maneuvering to only have to fight one or two people at a time, the others are continually seeking to reengage him.  During the Smiths fight, you can see all the other Smiths reacting in real time to Neo's every move.  \n\nAnother challenge in movie fights is straddling the line between realism and aesthetic appeal.  While I wouldn't call any of the fights realistic, they are believable within the rules of the Matrix where they take place.  There are few moments when an action does not produce an expected reaction, which I think is the key to not taking the viewer out of immersion when watching a fight.  \n\nFinally, there is a fluidity and rhythm to the fighting that makes them transcend action into art (particularly the chateau scene).  The movements are synced perfectly with the music, and the progression of the action tells a complete story over the course of the fight.  The detailed planning and precise execution of everyone involved in these scenes shines though and has kept me coming back to rewatch them.",

        "title": "Ford vs Ferrari reshaped my perspective on watching films",
        "content": "As a diecast car collector, my love for cars recently took a new turn, straight into car movies. While exploring, I stumbled upon Ford v Ferrari. The title alone sets the tone, and what follows is more than just a race it\u2019s a cinematic masterpiece for car enthusiasts.\n\nThis film can easily become a favorite if you\u2019re into machines, motorsport, or the soul behind the wheel. It doesn\u2019t just entertain ! it teaches. It shows what racing means, to the driver, to the family, to the company, and to history.\n\nThe movie begins with Carroll Shelby walking into the darkness\u2026 and ends with Ken Miles dying in broad daylight. That contrast felt poetic and symbolic. The foreshadowing in this movie is brilliant, Shelby asking if he was ever on fire during a pit stop, and later, silently witnessing Ken in flames. That moment shattered me.\n\nKen\u2019s son Peter\u2019s joy begins when Ken throws a wrench at Shelby a turning point that leads to triumph. Fittingly, the film ends with Shelby passing that same wrench to Peter. A quiet but meaningful gesture.\n\nTechnically, the film reminds us that any car can be the fastest when the engineers start thinking like drivers. That blend of emotion and engineering is what makes the story roar.\n\nOne final thought ! there's a Tamil proverb: \"\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0b8e\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0bc1\"\n\u201cThe one who picks up the sword will die by it.\u201d\nKen Miles lived and died in a car. His victories were great, but his race, his spirit, is what will be remembered forever.\n\nHave you watched the Movie ???, pls try if you didn't. Am I missed any details ?.",

        "title": "Today is the birthday of the late, great David Lynch",
        "content": "Lynch was one of the most unique and strange voices cinema has ever had. From Eraserhead to Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks, he pushed film and television into places that were unsettling, dreamlike and deeply personal. He did not explain his work. He trusted mood, intuition and subconscious logic more than plot. Love him or hate him, no one else ever made movies that felt like his.\n\nHe showed that film could be abstract, frightening, funny and emotional all at once. And he proved you could stay uncompromisingly weird and still leave a permanent mark on the culture.\n\nWhat is your favorite David Lynch film or moment? And how do you think his work will be remembered long term?",

Can still find Band of Brothers and Pacific (often bundled together which is nice). But Generation War being a German series is far less ubiquitous. \n\nIt took almost a month to arrive and I'm in Ireland, they must have sent it by row boat and the moment I put it in the Xbox One to watch this evening... \"Sorry this DVD is for Region 1 only, not compatible with region 2\" something along those lines. \n\nJust why? First of all one would expect that an order from the UK would be a European compatible product not an American compatible product.... Second of all what is the point of region locking DVD's, it results in situations like this where people end up buying a product they can't even use which is no fault of their own.\n\nRant over, what a waste of money! Even if this gets deleted by the mods I'll feel a little better ranting a little bit... I better get my refund.",

I was ugly crying half the time, and hours later I\u2019m still thinking about it. Every scene I\u2019m like, this is absolutely terrifying. Kept waiting for someone to fall into a crevasse early on but it was just a nightmare in slow motion.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing but also so sad that it\u2019s based on true events. And apparently survivors say the movie \u2018toned it down\u2019\u2026 like, hold up, the chaos was worse?? My brain cannot even.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious\u2014what are your favorite natural disaster movies?\n\nI\u2019ve probably watched Deep Impact, The Impossible, Twister, 2012, and Dante\u2019s Peak a million times. The Happening was surprisingly fun too, but I\u2019m looking for something with a little more \u201crun for your life\u201d action.\n\nI\u2019ve passed on the new \u2018Twisters\u2019 a ton, not sure if that\u2019s work watching.",
