So, what movie has the best opening scene(s)\u2014loosely defined (by me) as the first 15 minutes or so. For my part, and having thought about it for bit, it is Apocalypse Now. The montage of the napalmed jumble, helicopters, ceiling fan and Willard\u2019s haggard presence and hallowed soul, combined with The Doors\u2019 haunting song The End just sucks you in. The transition to the general\u2019s trailer park HQ and strerile explanation of the operation establish precisely the point of the file: the absolute hypocrisy of it all. Not that I\u2019m just into military films, but second for me might be Saving Private Ryan, for the sheer visceral brutality and reality of its depiction of combat\u2014but it falls short for me in only in its its single dimension; the movie itself has far more to offer.

        "content": "So i come from a country where we hardly get to see these films until they get a digital release, I had this on my watchlist ever since i read it somewhere that PCW is making a new film and it's an adaptation of a novel that is probably more then a year. \n\nFirstly i would say as of now my favourite film of the year is PTA's One Battle After Another ( haven't watched hemnet, marty supreme and the secret agent yet ). And i think No Other Choice is up there with PTA's film only bad part is i didn't watch it in a theater. \n\nThe film basically tells a story of a married man who lost his job and how and what he does to get the job he wants back and how it effects his family and morals. \n\nI was literally giggling and laughing so hard throughout the film and it's not just the funny scenes but also the camera angles and transitions i was thinking in my mind like holy shit this man always comes up with something new and ambitious. I remember watching decision to leave the first time and instantly falling in love with the poetic nature of the film but more then that the technicalities of that film and here i feel like No Other Choice is even better than that. As a overall film i think i still put decision to leave above because i love the poetry and romance of that film. \n\nApart from being a dark comical satire i think this film is very tragic and romantic too. Seeing our protagonist becoming a psycho murderer and then his wife keeping it down even after knowing what he did was deeply romantic to me. I need a wifey like her. The first murder sequence chefs kiss, every frame\nBeautiful to look at, the jazzy soundtrack was orgasmic.\n\nCapitalism, Al or robots replacing manual skilled workers, insecurity web you're not providing as man and you feel like your wife might cheat (but she's wifey for life she is loyal ) everything was perfect, this film is perfect.\n\nIt's frustrating to see how this film and PCW got ignored throughout the awards season, not even nominating the master is crazy they did the same with decision to leave which was one of the best film of that year just like No Other Choice for 2025. I feel like they don't wanna see another parasite if it's not coming from the west, i also think it's because of NEON this is what happens when you buy the rights of every good film then you filter them looks like they are focusing more on Sentimental value which is a really good film but i don't think I'll say it's best of the year.\n\n",

        "content": "So I saw sentimental value and loved it. It\u2019s a yearly tradition of mine to go watch all the best original screenplay nominee when they release the list (the ones I haven\u2019t already seen) And SV was on it of course  \n\nI was so blown away by it I looked up that director and was keen to watch more of his films. And wouldn\u2019t ya know it he had another critically acclaimed arthouse movie that got nominated for best original screenplay in 21 that I had somehow missed. So I watched it aaaaaaand\n\nJesus fucking Christ I feel like I just had a breakthrough therapy session. I feel so forlorn and morose. It was beautiful cinema and now one of my favorite movies but goddamn. I need a minute to process. This is that rare art that goes beyond just base entertainment to something more. Something inexplicable. Profound. Those Europeans don\u2019t play cause there was zero sugar coating, sanitizing, dumbing down, compromising nothing \n\nI feel like it had a lot of layers of relation to me from both of the leads. The woman, \u201cJulie\u201d? I think, the whole thing with her being late 20s almost 30 and more directionless than a broken compass. Bouncing from career path to career path. Working a modest job as a bookstore associate and getting judged for it here and there. I\u2019m 27 almost 28 and I bounced careers around a lot in my 20s and dont have a lot of clarity on what to do next. Currently an uber driver (I like it) but get judged up and down for it all the time for having so little social eminence\n\nThe man \u201cAxel\u201d? I relate to cause I had a relationship years ago with someone younger than me and thus far it was the best one of my life easily. Lines like \u201cnobody talks like we talk nobody laughs like we laugh\u201d and how despondent he was at the end citing it as the love of his life and he never captured that again just made me want to cry. Major lump in the throat. Could easily see that being me as I\u2019m older with how dating is going. Hopefully I don\u2019t get terminal cancer in my 40s though. Also the line about how he tried to bury himself in art to distract from the existential dread but ended up thinking he just wasted his time on stupid and trivial things nobody cares about. I\u2019m a big movie, gaming, comic book, novel guy and that kinda hit me in a big existential way too. That on my death bed all this art and shit will just be a joke to me. A regret. Just a dumb pass time \n\nFuck. Well, TLDR, great film, made me super despondent. Very emotionally and intellectually stimulating but man it felt heavy in a personal way things seldom do ",

The absolute despair and apathy alongside panic, the score, the approach of Melancholia, the final moment and resounding sound\u2026. Everything. It\u2019s the movie that never fails to leave me feeling totally gut punched at the end. \n\nI feel like I never see this movie talked about. Does anyone else here love it? ",

        "content": "One of the forgotten about science fiction movies of all time, Outland with Sean Connery, just came up on the YouTube movies for free. \n\nA lot of people describe this as high noon in space, however, I just disagree completely that it has nothing else to offer.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of science fiction that puts you in the belief mode. Films like Blade Runner, the original Alien, or Ad Astra where you can truly believe it\u2019s a story that\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s also a science fiction futuristic type movie.\n\nThis film takes the place as my favorite. It\u2019s made by much of the same crew as the original Alien, so the sets are amazing. The acting is amazing although Connery\u2019s child in the film apparently was criticized for not being a great actor. To me those scenes are not significant enough to the film for that to be said, especially to a child. \n\nThen you have Peter Boyle, who does an amazing job as the evil boss. And not only that, Peter Hyams went on to make 2010 afterwards. One of the great moments in film where someone created two extremely beautiful Science Fiction films in a row.  ",

        "content": "I know there are plenty of easy answers to this question, like blackface/yellowface, casual racial stereotypes, and sexual assault played as a joke or a hero move. But I'm hoping to dig a little deeper.\n\nI'm thinking more about the language of cinema, and the conventions of storytelling that have changed.\n\nFor example, I was recently watching Cecil B. de Mille's *The Greatest Show on Earth* (1952) and I was surprised at how much of the runtime was just showing the circus. There would be a storyline going on while the circus was happening, but there were multiple extended scenes that featured none of the major characters or that moved the plot forward in any real way. It was just circus performers doing circus acts while the audience reacted. That wouldn't get past editors today, and if it did, it would get skewered by critics as fluff and filler that doesn't add anything to the movie. Yet, back in 1952, people did not have such complaints.",
