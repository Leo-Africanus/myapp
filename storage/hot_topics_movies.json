What makes it even chilling is that in every single conversation before this, Sean Parker and Mark always dominate and Saverin is just a pretty face like a side character even tho his contribution is massive. His support meant nothing to Mark and he\u2019s tired of being walked over by his own supposed friend, showing what Mark\u2019s gf in the beginning said true that he\u2019s an asshole. ",

But I\u2019m really interested in films that actually show society falling apart in real time, not just the ruins left behind.\n\nFor example, not a movie but a TV show, I recently watched the first season of Fear the Walking Dead and thought it did a great job showing how quickly things can spiral from normal life into total chaos. Same with the opening of Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake)\u2014those parts that actually capture the process of collapse before the world fully tips over. Also thought Deep Impact was pretty good doing this.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for movies that really focus on that transitional moment when society is crumbling?",

The whole parent-child theme, the idea of sacrificing everything for a slim chance to save humanity\u2014it\u2019s way more emotional.\n\nAlso, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score still gives me chills, especially during the docking scene. Christopher Nolan might get flak sometimes for being \u201ctoo ambitious,\u201d but for me, this movie is one of his masterpieces.\n\nCurious\u2014where do you rank Interstellar among Nolan\u2019s films? Do you think it\u2019s underrated compared to Inception and The Dark Knight?\n",

Somehow, My dad's late grandfather wanted to see Age of Ultron, because I was big into Marvel at the time, also he wanted to go too despite not being a huge fan of fake stuff, especially sci-fi besides for the occasional thing.\n\nWe go to Target to get some candy. Turns out that he wasn't picking his feet up. I knew something was happening to him, then we get to the theater with our popcorn and candy and get to the auditorium which was in IMAX (back when IMAX was slowly growing). He seemed to enjoy being with us considering how he was starting to struggle by then. And sure enough a few days later, he got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It was sad but at the same time, it was fun going to see a movie with Grandpa which he never went to the theaters that often, It was definitely an once in a lifetime experience with him. He then died a couple years back and while he wasn't doing the greatest in the end, at least we did some nice stuff for him though not as much as we expected for him to do.\n\nThe movie itself (Age of Ultron) was quite mediocre but I still remember that experience to this day. It makes me miss my grandfather even more now because of it.",

The scene where they talk about leaving for the theater would\u2019ve been such an ominous ending. However, we go to the theater, we see the funeral train, more speeches, etc. Quit while you\u2019re ahead. \n\nAn unpopular opinion is that I don\u2019t really care for \u201cParasite\u201d because it has so many ending scenes - the dad running away, the son reading the letter that turns out to not be real.

        "content": "This is one of those movies that I somehow missed during my childhood. I just ended up seeing it and my god, this movie is excellent. Like all great family friendly movies, it manages to be a very wholesome and accessible movie to children while also being a movie with surprisingly sophisticated themes and character work when you look at it with adult eyes.\n\nI was so impressed that this cutesy little animal movie managed to deliver some very salient points about biases and class injustice. I loved the part where the dogs go \"We have to speak slowly because all sheep are obviously stupid.\" And then it goes \"the sheep spoke slowly because all dogs are *obviously ignorant*.\"\n\nAnd even though the movie doesn't come right out and say it in the text, I couldn't help but feel that the movie was HEAVILY implying some kind of vegetarian message in it. Or maybe a better way to phrase that it is the movie implicitly asks questions about our treatment and eating of animals that even adults find hard to answer.\n\nNot trying to sound preachy. I eat and love BBQ. But watching this movie it is **very** hard to avoid asking myself \"Why is it okay to eat pigs, but it's not okay to eat the dogs or the cat?\" Which I was suprised to see in a movie where the target audience is children. \n\nAnd also HUGO FUCKING WEAVING is in this! I had no idea! I know it sounds stupid, but I'd easily put this right next to Matrix and LoTR for how much I enjoyed it and I will fight anyone over this. ",

If a movie is \u201crotten\u201d then less people will see it. A fresh tomato doesn\u2019t mean a movie is \u201cgood\u201d and vice versa. I really hate that the success of a films box office rides on a a stupid RT score. There are tons of movies that are considered \u201crotten\u201d that I really enjoy and if I was someone who solely went off this stupid score I would be missing out. Anyways end of rant.",
