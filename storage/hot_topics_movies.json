        "content": "**Mufasa: The Lion King**\n\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mufasa) 58% (58 Reviews)\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins' deft hand and Lin-Manuel Miranda's music go some way towards squaring the Circle of Life in Mufasa, but this fitfully soulful story is ill-served by its impersonal, photorealistic animation style.\n\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mufasa-the-lion-king/):  58 (33 Reviews)\n\n\n**Reviews**\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1236087876/):\n\n&gt;With a solid gang, Mufasa conforms to a typical journey of misfits. But that charm from the early scenes is lost with the addition of each new plot point.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-turns-origin-story-into-rousing-action-adventure-buddy-movie-1236205310/):\n\n&gt;Though James Earl Jones is impossible to follow, these voice actors give it all a game try.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-1236250945/):\n\n&gt;Jenkins has not sold out; rather, the studio bought into his vision, which respects the 1994 film and recognizes the significance that its role models and life lessons have served for young audiences.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-disney-prequel-xfksllzbq) (5/5) :\n\n&gt;Here the Oscar-winning director Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) dives truly deep for a tale of orphanhood, family conflict and the reluctant fight for a throne. It\u2019s often thrilling to watch a film featuring only anthropomorphic animals where the central characters are more rounded than most of their human counterparts at the mainstream multiplex (yes, that means you, Gladiator II).\n\n[RogerEbert.com] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa\u201d never quite bursts free of the constraints placed upon it, but those constraints never stop it from moving, or from being moving.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins) (8/10):\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins\u2019 Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight directors involvement in a CGI-heavey Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s in little danger of becoming a classic but it\u2019s gratifying to know that Barry Jenkins made this film his own, telling a fine story with genuine emotion and visual aplomb.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/17/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/77020873007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;Thanks to Jenkins\u2019 inimitable grace and Miranda\u2019s tuneful swagger, it continues to feel vibrant.\n\n[Chicago Sun-Times] (https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/12/17/mufasa-review-lion-king-disney) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The voice work from the outstanding cast is rich and warm and vibrant, and while the songs from the great Lin-Manuel Miranda (with Lebo M. making valuable contributions) might not make for a generational catalog, they\u2019re still infectious and clever.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-movie-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Even with a few flaws, Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King has enough heart and depth to stand on its own feet and surpass its 2019 predecessor.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235194304/):\n\n&gt;We tell ourselves stories in order to live. Corporate movie studios tell you stories in order to keep their board happy and make their bottom line. Find the Venn diagram center between the two, and that\u2019s where this Hakuna Matata 2.0 lies.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-barry-jenkins-1235077385/) (C+):\n\n&gt;Mufasa has hidden charms that are arguably best described as Jenkins released straight to VHS.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mufasa-the-lion-king/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Barry Jenkins\u2019 verve only faintly shines through in an origin story that is mildly, not wildly, entertaining.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It's no Hakuna Matata, that's for sure. And it's far from Jenkins' best work, but in any other hands, a lot of Mufasa's intentions would have completely misfired. Thankfully there are some stellar vocal performances and VFX \u2013 but it could have been so much better.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1740391/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5.5/10):\n\n&gt;\"Mufasa\" will satisfy, but it also feels ultimately useless. Like Disney is once again spinning its wheels, trying to wring billions of dollars out of old ideas while they brainstorm new ones. Fans of \"The Lion King\" may be slightly moved. At the very least, you'll finally know how Rafiki got his stick.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-review/) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Fans of the franchise and younger generations will find a lot to like about Mufasa: The Lion King, but it's hard to imagine it will have a legacy comparable to the original animated classic that started it all.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lion-king-2-barry-jenkins-review-b2665329.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, finding the Jenkins in Mufasa is like putting a blindfold on in the Louvre and trying to feel your way to the Mona Lisa.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka\u2014the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny\u2014their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Aaron Pierre as Mufasa\n* Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka\n* Tiffany Boone as Sarabi\n* Kagiso Lediga as Young Rafiki\n* Preston Nyman as Zazu\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros\n* Thandiwe Newton as Eshe\n* Lennie James as Obasi\n* Anika Noni Rose as Afia\n* Keith David as Masego\n* John Kani as Rafiki\n* Seth Rogen as Pumbaa\n* Billy Eichner as Timon\n* Donald Glover as Simba\n* Blue Ivy-Carter as Kiara\n* Braelyn Rankins as Young Mufasa\n* Theo Somolu as Young Taka\n* Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala\n\nDirected by: Barry Jenkins\n\nScreenplay by: Jeff Nathanson\n\nProduced by: Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak\n\nCinematography: James Laxton\n\nEdited by: Joi McMillon\n\nMusic by: Dave Metzger, Nicholas Britell (score), Lin-Manuel Miranda (songs)\n\nRunning time: 118 minutes\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2024",

But you leave your DOG with them too? Did the Cameron Diaz character know the dog was part of the deal? Is the dog just accepting of complete strangers arriving at its house unaccompanied? Also, when the brother shows up there's no hint that he knows the dog, that it's happy to see him or anything, and he doesn't inquire about  how it's doing. (Does the dog even have a name?)\n\nIf that's not enough, Cameron Diaz decides just to bail after the first day and makes it as far as airport security before changing her mind. She was abandoning the dog?? I mean, come on, this is just lazy writing.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f\n\nThe man finally came around.\n\n***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.\n\n***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.\n\n***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.\n\nDebuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.\n\nThis is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?\n\nThe SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...\n\nBut how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.\n\nFor some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.\n\nThere was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. \n\nAccording to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible \"C\" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.\n\nAfter its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.\n\nBarely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.\n\nWhile ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.\n\nIt has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm \"B\" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.\n\nDespite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.\n\nIt took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.\n\n***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.\n\n***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.\n\n***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).\n\nA24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.\n\nParamount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.\n\nAmazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.\n\nGia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.\n\n***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.\n\n***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.\n\nAfter missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M\n\n- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\n***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.\n\nDisney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.\n\nThe other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.\n\nIn limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

(This is my first movie review, plus I'm pretty tired, so I apologize in advance for how disjointed it may feel)\n\nI'll start with what I disliked, which honestly wasn't much:\nThere were issues with the pacing and the dialogue, I found some performances a little stilted, and some twists were more expected than others (the Tet being evil was obvious from the get go).\n\nAs for the positives:\nTom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, and Morgan Freeman delivered great performances I thought. I found myself actually being super absorbed in the plot, and it wasn't too difficult to follow (like a lot of sci-fi can be), which I liked. I think what everyone can agree on when it comes to this movie is that both the score and the visuals were absolutely top notch. The fact that the movie came out in 2013 blows my mind a little. \n\nOverall, I thought the movie was a solid 8/10. I can't say I'm totally sure why the movie gets as much hate as it does. Who knows? Maybe I just enjoyed it because I'm a huge Tron fan, and this feels similar. ",

I put it on later at night, after watching a show for some background noise and ended up being pulled in with its funny but comforting atmosphere.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Alexander Payne his movies tend to be enjoyable but nothing that really stands out, but the chemistry here in The Holdovers works really well.  I'm in-between the ages of the younger student Angus and the older mentor Paul, so I could see it from both sides.  People coming to terms with their lives and the people they may or may not want in them.  Even the cook Mary gives us a great perspective on the outside looking in on these characters lives and why everyone is important and has a story.\n\nAnyways its a good holiday movie and if you haven't watched it yet its free on Amazon Prime and perfect for this time of year.",
