I assumed some tech malfunction or maybe some silent fire alarm, but then the cinema manager came up front and made an announcement.\n\nHe basically laid down expectations for behaviour (!) during the film, e.g. not too much applause, respect that other people are here to enjoy the film and so on.  He also pointed out that cameras were watching and that security would be keeping an eye.\n\nThe security part wasn't a bluff: I spotted a security guard sat in the back row later on.\n\nHas behaviour in general (or for the Minecraft film?!) really been so poor as to require this sort of announcement?\n\n(This could be linked to an incident at another local cinema within the last few days, where some youths egged the screen, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage).",

        "title": "The Secret Of NIMH is probably the single greatest American work of animation",
        "content": "It's America's answer to Hayao Miyazaki, and I personally prefer it to Miyazaki. I grew up as an anime kid with a strong bias against anything Disney, and it was partially because of movies like this that surpass anything they've ever made tenfold. It blows my mind that Don, (in my opinion) would never again create a work of cinema anywhere near as compelling as The  Secret Of NIMH. I can't think of an other animated movie like it. I consider it to be the greatest children's movie ever made.\n\nThe sheer depth of the characters and their relationships, colors, situations, the densely layered and imagined environments the characters live in. The theme music. Back plot and narrative of events we never see that unfolded just before the start of the movie, and connect with the events during the course of the movie. The dark and violent scenes meant to show children the ugliness of blind greed. The mystery element of the necklace, and especially the animation. There's no doubt these are the most expressive and human feeling animal characters ever in a film. I have no idea how they were able to animate them that way. Amazing to see these mice and rats move, speak and behave exactly like human beings. All of the characters are deeply thought out, and balance perfectly against one another. The movie, among many other things, is an allegory of how corrupted, powerhungry people hold down the struggling and the poor. Sure, familiar tale, especially in animation, but it's done so flawlessly in this movie. I feel terrible for any fan of animation who has never seen this. You MUST watch it. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and I feel so lucky that I got to experience it as a child. I remember it moved me to tears even then. I can't believe this is the same guy who made stinkers like Titan AE and A Troll In Central Park. Very sad",

        "content": "I saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn't prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.\n\nI watch horror movies and usually don't feel disturbed so it's been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.\n\nYou just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.\n\nIt disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outliers but simply because they were limited by the era and conditions they were born into. I don't like thinking of this powerlessness.\n\nWhile watching I felt like I was grieving for my ancestors for what their \"normal\" was, how harsh those times were, and frankly amazed my ancestors survived things like that. It made me feel grateful to be living in modern times, especially with technology. \n\nWhat's a non horror movie that you found perhaps unexpectedly disturbing?",

What gives!!!! What is the reason?? Is there some clause or universal rule that this sound has to be used in fictional portrayals of babies?? I will try to find the sound and link it but I just heard it on a recent episode of criminal minds and it caught my ear and bothered me at the same time.

        "title": "Man I miss New Line Cinema when it was its own separate studio.",
        "content": "Back in the 90\u2019s to mid 2000\u2019s  they were one of the most balliest studios in Hollywood that took chances on quirkier movies like Austin Powers, The Mask, or Elf that even back then the other majors would\u2019ve never done. And give up and coming directors like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson their breakouts. Heck they manage to greenlight all three Lord of the Rings in one go. \n\nThey were like the equivalent to a punk rebel teenager  doing movies their way \n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s what killed the studio after Return of the King putting whatever out there and most of them were box office failures or absolutely terrible like Son of the Mask or Hoot and  then spending $180 million on The Golden Compass which bombed so hard that Time Warner decided to it was enough  to absorb it into Warner Bros. \n\nAnd now it\u2019s just a small label under WB  that makes some horror movies and 2 or 3  movies in other genres  that\u2019s kind of forgotten about within a couple of months. \n\nBut at least WB still keeps that legacy going but I do have the feeling in 5 years they'll eventually retire the name.\n\nI feel like New Line's spiritual successor is Lionsgate where they still make smaller budgeted quirkier movies that other studios wouldn't dare to do.

        "content": "The, whatever they are in the film that is behind all of the impossible events, the film never explains any of it,  no theories, no ideas, the film just tells us they exist and we can never understand  them.  The most the film does is speculate on there intentions , that's as far as the film goes. I know Roger Ebert was upset at the film  film for not giving  us anything  anything, no answers at all on what these things are, most films give  a crum of info but not here and I love that. we only learn they can do things that defy logic and even their intentions are ultimately   left  unexplained. It's ballsy for a film to do this to this extent and I wish more films would go this far. \n",

With a truly stellar cast, great story (if compressed into just 24 hours), nicely interwoven storylines, funny, empathic and just captures so many of the facets that make NY a pretty unique city.  \n\nI saw it in NY, on my own as it was during the day when everyone else was working, when it first came out.  I knew naff all about it before going in and came out loving it.",

Regardless of what you may feel about the movie, you have to admit that seeing Academy Award winner, Kathy Bates, playing a crazy squirrel lady who sends Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s character and daughter careening off a cliff is a hilarious and completely unexpected cameo and a serious pull for the production.\n\nWhat are your favorite surprising cameos in that same vein?",

Crawford seemed unwilling to do so.",

It goes to show how cruel some prisoners get treated around the world. They have to choose between gangs and do as the ring leader commands or else they\u2019re re in huge danger. The ending was so wholesome.\n\nHas anyone got any movie recommendations that are similar to Lock Up? Thank you",
