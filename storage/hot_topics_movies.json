Where it really enhances what's happening on screen without feeling like the movie is saying \"You're supposed to feel this right now so the music is gonna make you feel this now.\"\n\nInterstellar - \"Mountains\" does a great job of matching the pace of the scene. The curiosity as they're trying to figure out the nature of the planet, and the way the music hits for \"those aren't mountains\" is great sauce for your \"oh shit\" feeling.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy - Defeating the bad guy with the power of friendship is an old one but \"Black Tears\" is great as it ramps up with each member joining hands and the way it crescendos right before \"We're the Guardians of the Galaxy\" really adds to how triumphant the scene feels.\n\nWhat are yours?",

For me, it was Toy Story, and I still remember how magical it felt to see animated characters come to life on screen. I\u2019m curious, what was the first movie you remember watching as a child? Did it leave a lasting impression on you or shape your movie taste today?",

Something I\u2019ve always wondered when I watch these types of films however, is how realistic it is to be able to buy such firepower from an arms dealer? In Way of the Gun one of the characters uses a Galil, and I\u2019ve always wondered how does a weapon like that get cycled into the black market (assuming that\u2019s how they got them, I don\u2019t know a lot about guns but I assume you wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a fully automatic .308 firearm at just any gun store). \n\nI think of movies like Taxi Driver, or The Boondocks Saints that have scenes where they meet with a black market arms dealer and the main characters choose their guns. I\u2019m curious as to what other movies have similar scenes. \n\nTo be clear I\u2019m not exactly looking for movies that are ABOUT black market arms dealing like White Boy Rick or War Dogs. ",
