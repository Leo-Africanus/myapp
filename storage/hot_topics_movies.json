That performance is such a unique one. The laugh, the immaturity, the arrogance, it could\u2019ve been unbearable if he was even slightly off, but instead it made me want to keep watching. And then the Requiem scene is just unreal. Abraham anchors the film, but Hulce had to make chaotic genius believable, which feels harder as an acting challenge. I get why Abraham won, but part of me thinks Hulce pulled off something risky as fuck and doesn\u2019t get enough credit.",

In the boxing scene, Austin kept hitting him in the face, even when he asked him not too specifically. And in the sewer scene when Tami got lost, people blamed him. Even tho Tami walked off while Craig was getting up. How could Craig have known where she went. I don\u2019t know, it just feels like I should feel bad for Tami. ",

        "content": "At the 2020 Golden Globes, Bong Joon-ho said something that has stayed with me ever since:\n\n\u201cOnce you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\u201d\n\nThat line feels truer every year. For many viewers, subtitles seem like a small inconvenience  something that takes effort or breaks immersion. But in reality, they open doors. Some of the most powerful stories in cinema are told outside Hollywood, shaped by cultures, histories, and perspectives we might otherwise never encounter.\n\nA perfect example for me is the performance delivered by Jackson Yee. His acting carries such emotional weight that you don\u2019t need to speak the language to understand the pain, resilience, and humanity he portrays. There are moments where the emotion is so raw and grounded that it genuinely moves you to tears. That\u2019s the power of cinema at its best it transcends language.\n\nSubtitles don\u2019t distance us from a story; they invite us closer. They make us active participants. You lean in, you focus, you listen more carefully. And in return, you discover films that challenge, surprise, and stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nWorld cinema isn\u2019t \u201cniche\u201d it\u2019s essential. Whether it\u2019s Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Iranian, Spanish, or any other language, every film culture has masterpieces waiting to be experienced.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever hesitated because of subtitles, take that leap. That one-inch barrier might just lead you to your next favorite film.",
