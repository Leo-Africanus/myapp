What movie(s) did you all see in theaters that had the most alive audience?\n\nMy answer is probably Avengers: Endgame. I remember that I was called out of school early by my parents to watch the movie the day it came out in theaters, and we didn\u2019t want to get held up by crowds and get good seats. It was insane how reactive the audience was in my theater, it was fun. A good chunk of them simultaneously cried too.\n\nA close second is Deadpool and Wolverine; some simultaneous laughter and gasps, but mainly cheering and clapping at the surprise character entrances. The theater erupted with excited yelling and clapping when Blade and Gambit entered, my friend (who doesn\u2019t really watch Marvel movies) was so lost it was kinda funny lol.",

        "content": "*Now demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba lives in exile in the Ozian forest, while Glinda resides at the palace in Emerald City, reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, she'll need to reunite with Glinda to transform herself, and all of Oz, for good.*\n\nDirector: John M. Chu\n\nCast: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, , Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Colman Domingo, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [72%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wicked_for_good)\n\n**Metacritic:** [61 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wicked-for-good/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Next Best Picture - Lauren LaMagna](https://nextbestpicture.com/wicked-for-good/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues.\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251118-wicked-for-good-review) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Let's be clear: the Wicked films are the definition of preaching to the choir. They aren't likely to win over anyone sceptical of candy-coloured spectacle and overt sentimentality presented in Broadway show-stopping fashion. Wicked is what it is. But if you're fine with that, this latest instalment is more captivating than the last and enjoyable to watch throughout.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/11/wicked-for-good-review-jon-chus-part-2-musical-adaptation-1236620980/)\n\n&gt;What can we say about the performances that hasn\u2019t already been said? Both Erivo and Grande could not be better, and in fact Grande really gets a chance to shine here and runs away with the picture whenever she is on screen. Erivo\u2019s Elphaba remains the juiciest role and she defines it with the mortality only movies can bring. Bailey is terrific again, and Goldblum\u2019s Wizard really comes into deep focus now and he\u2019s got it going on. Marissa Bode\u2019s wheelchair-bound Nessarose is given some key screen time and delivers in a piece of casting that is as inspiring as the character she plays. Nathan Crowley outdoes his Oscar winning production design this time around, as does Paul Tazewell\u2019s Oscared Costumes. The visual effects are first rate. So is this whole splendidly realized and cinematic musical adaptation which if you add up the running times of both films comes in just two minutes shy of 5(!) hours. To be honest I wanted *more.*\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/11/18/wicked-for-good-review-second-part-fails-to-take-flight/) \\- 1 / 5\n\n&gt;Ariana Grande is painfully wooden in Wicked\u2019s irritating sequel. What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch-it-out-and-wring-it-dry approach here has been deadening. Even the staunchest defenders of Wicked, the stage musical about the tragic origins of The Wizard of Oz\u2019s Witch of the West, would have to concede that it peaks just before the interval...\n\n[Slant Magazine - Dan Rubins](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jonathan-bailey/) \\- 2.5 / 5\n\n&gt;But for as sharp as it may sometimes be, *For Good* is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. (However bloated, the first film, to quote one of Glinda\u2019s malapropisms, is thrillifying.) It may transport audiences, especially younger ones, to the colorful Oz for the bulk of an afternoon, but it also serves as a reminder that only in its tauter, wrenching stage form can *Wicked*, like a handprint on your heart, really leave you changed for good.\n\n[Loud and Clear - Joseph Tomastik](https://loudandclearreviews.com/wicked-for-good-film-review/)\n\n&gt;*Wicked: For Good* takes many huge swings but misses in baffling fashion, making for a technically impressive but disappointing conclusion to the *Wicked* story. By all accounts, this is the much more difficult half of the story to pull off, as it\u2019s where the musical in particular gets much denser and incorporates many more direct elements from *The Wizard of Oz*. Unfortunately, that difficulty rears its ugly head in *Wicked: For Good*. As ambitious as this movie is for tackling already-unwieldy source material, those ambitions ultimately don\u2019t pay off.\n\n[RogerEbert - Christy Lemire](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wicked-2-for-good-film-review-2025) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;If it sounds like this second half is darker than the first,\u00a0it is,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0also\u00a0more effective\u00a0in its consistency of tone.\u00a0\u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0was all fun and games until it\u00a0wasn\u2019t, and that sudden shift was jarring. In \u201cFor Good,\u201d\u00a0we know from the start that\u00a0we\u2019re\u00a0in more serious territory with the deep strings\u00a0of\u00a0John Powell\u2019s score as Ozian\u00a0workers build\u00a0the Yellow Brick Road.\u00a0Erivo and Grande find just the right amount of\u00a0tenderness and\u00a0sadness with \u201cFor Good,\u201d\u00a0and that bond between them shines bright once more.\u00a0Poignant and intimate,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a legitimate tearjerker.\u00a0Bring tissues.\u00a0\n\n[AwardsWatch - Sophia Ciminello](https://awardswatch.com/wicked-for-good-review-jon-m-chu-fails-to-cast-a-spell-with-bloated-fan-service-filled-finale-c/) \\- 'C-'\n\n&gt;Despite stellar work from Erivo and Grande, *Wicked: For Good* can\u2019t justify its existence as its own separate outing. Even with a pair of new songs and a deeper exploration of some of the musical\u2019s beloved characters, the runtime feels bloated and bogged down by Chu\u2019s constant attempts to make this a movie of the moment and to remind audiences of the connection they had to the first film. Simply put, Chu does not add enough new material to make this film feel like much more than a studio cash grab. There\u2019s certainly still magic to be found in the movie for those who are seeking it, but when the credits finally roll, it\u2019s difficult to say that Chu\u2019s additions to this film have changed the world of *Wicked* for the better.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/18/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jeff-goldblum) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard\u2019s final benediction. But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful.\n\n[FilmHounds - Paul Klein](https://filmhounds.co.uk/2025/11/wicked-for-good-film-review/)\n\n&gt;Erivo, Grande and Bailey are all fantastic once again, and allowed to deepen the characters more and show the complexities of them, while also remaining true to why people love them so much. It's a shame that the rest of the cast are given short shrift. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode have the rumblings of a more interesting subplot that doesn't really go anywhere as much as it should. Even so, and despite its more frantic nature, *Wicked: For Good* continues to lovingly taking a look at what it means to be a rebel against dictatorships, how people will lie to you to get what they want, and how you must remain true to yourself at all times.\u00a0It's not so much that the film is disappointing, that would be too harsh a criticism. It's that the film is merely as good as it could be, given what the stage show offers. It wraps things up, but there's no feeling of cohesion \u2013 something that was never going to be in Chu's hands, and for what he has, he excels at.\n\n[Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wicked-for-good-review-sequel-b2866672.html) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally \u2013 no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that\u2019s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they\u2019ve learned.",

You can click on cities, regions, or countries, then use a time slider to browse across centuries, decades, or individual years.\n\nOnce you set a time, the entire map shifts to that era, so you can freely travel the world and see what stories, and real history, were happening everywhere during that time.\n\nYou can also create and share your own lists of stories!\n\nIt's a new way to discovering how fiction and real history intersect.\n\nWould love to have some feedback, I\u2019m always looking to improve it!",

        "content": "Some of you may or may not be familiar with this movie, but I am. The few reviews I see/read about it tend to dog on it to no end, but it really holds a special place in my heart. Some of the humor might be crude and childish (as Sandler films can be) but this one in particular is really underrated IMO. There\u2019s really a heart driven story and development with all characters and how they grow through the film. As a 24 year old Jewish guy in south Louisiana, it\u2019s hard to fit in, and there\u2019s not many Jewish films relating to Hannukah. I love the animation, the story, and genuinely reminds me of a good time. I love this movie and don\u2019t care what anyone thinks. Am I just crazy or am I the only person that actually likes this film? lol",

I've known about the Hays code which was enforced from the early thirties to the late sixties and I know that media was a lot more risqu\u00e9 before the Code.\n\nHowever I'm just finding out that the hays code was self imposed and not government imposed. Breaking the code wasn't illegal but the movie would basically be blacklisted. I also just learned there were a few popular movies that ignored the code like Some Like It Hot and Psycho.\n\nWhat are some successful movies from the time period that ignored the code?\n\n(Also, I'm kind of fascinated by how the hays code affected not just Hollywood movies but the general zeitgeist.)",

        "content": "Pretty much the title, my dad is losing his battle with cancer and we're trying to find movies that might help with his agitation and anxiety. We got most of the way through the first LotR movie, but I think the battle scenes were too much. We've got the OG Muppet movie on right now, any other suggestions? \n\nEdit:\n\nYou all are simply amazing. I can't tell you how overwhelmingly wonderful it's been to come back to this post and read the suggestions and stories. I'm going to try and nap a little while he's calm (we're taking shifts) and just want you all to know how much these replies of love have meant to my family. We all had a really good cry about a bunch of random strangers taking the time out of their days to share these moments with us. It's really something else. \n\nEdit#2:\nSleeping isn't working (y'all I was crazy for even thinking it) but TNG is. He just told me \"I think they should be allowed to intermarry\". God only knows who he was referencing, but it gave my mom and me a good giggle\n\nEdit: it's 8.15 am here and I think we can call it successfully getting through the night on his part. TNG has been his pick of choice but thank you all for keeping me and my family company through the dark hours. We know he's definitely not going to get better, and it's going to probably still be rough, but these stories are all so seriously beautiful, please keep sharing. It's been a rough year in general for a whole lot of us, it sounds like, but somehow it seems like there's enough love to go around (and I know that's STUPID cheesy but it seems very true to me right now). Love you all, thank you all. \n\nEdit: tonight. My dad passed really peacefully around 7pm, literally surrounded by family. It was too soon, it's always too soon. Thank you so much for everything. Hold your loved ones close. ",
