        "title": "Transformers One is a perfect Kid-Friendly Transformers Animation movie for younger fans of Transformers. ",
        "content": "This is mainly a fun post that I thought of making here.\n\nSo to start off:\nAs a huge Transformers fan since I was a kid(specifically a kid under the age of 13 during my elementary school years), I got really excited to watch the new animated Transformers movie ever since I first saw the trailers, promos and TV spots. I really like the song they used in the 1st trailer, I thought it was catching. I really love how very cool, fun, action-packed, funny, lighthearted, interesting, dramatic and thrilling the movie is going to be like from watching the Transformers One trailers and other clips. And the thing that I really liked the most is besides it being a Transformers movie in animation form, but it is also the fact that it's a Transformers movie that is truly kid-friendly for kids. As in like it's design primarily for a younger audience of kids(while still also for the whole family, parents who were fans of Transformers since they were kids and want to bring their own kids to watch a Transformers movie) than the live action Transformers movies. While the Michael Bay TF films were marketed towards kids, they were mostly PG-13 movies, making them more suitable to an older audience and that the movies themselves were not very appropriate for kids under the age of 13. Like the unnecessary sexual women, too much cuss words, almost graphical violence and the characters were not very good role models for kids to like and idolizes. \n\n\nBut this time, with a director who's known for making great and good kids movies(that being Josh Cooley), a Transformers animated movie for kids and families alike was finally happening. And after seeing the movie whhich was during the school holidays, it pretty much exceeded my expectations I had from the beginning. So if there is one thing that I would like to point out that the movie did right for the Transformers -  is besides it focusing on the Transformer characters themselves, but also because it was definitely a great Transformers animated movie designed to be suitable and enjoyable for kids aka a new generation of younger fans, rather than just being a \"far more mature, darker and gritty\" movie that can only be enjoyed by teenagers and adults and just abandon their core younger audience. Considering the fact that Transformers is for kids as the primary/core audience and that it has consistently been a franchise that's marketed towards a younger audience of kids(while also still being for families alike). And for the most part, it did so well with that kind of demographic, but that's mostly for the tv animated shows. The live action movies, while still has it's younger audience, they still weren't very appropriate for them. \n\n\nSo now, to add more things on why Transformers One is great for kids - especially to those kids who are fans of Transformers, the story is pretty simple, which is course the origin story of Optimus and Megatron, how the two iconic characters became rivals, the story is well-written in its own right. The movie has many things that I'm pretty sure any kids will love. \n\nIt's filled with appealing and interesting characters with good character developments and clear motivations, extraordinary CG/3D animation and visual effects, good voice acting, cool action scenes, lots of funny moments, it's lighthearted, has an interesting lore, nice worldbuilding, and lastly it has meaningful good themes and messages for the kiddos. It's such a great good vs evil tradition vibe movie. \n\n\nNow that's not to say that the movie is literally a masterpiece, because of course, like many things, it has its own problems. But there is no doubt that it's such a great kids movie as well as a great Transformers animation movie for kids/younger fans of Transformers, while at the same time is great to all families, including long time TF fans. So if you have any kids or younger siblings who are fans of Transformers, I recommend watching Transformers One, the kiddos are gonna love it. \n\n\nThank you for reading!",

In the beginning when Tommy is chasing the school bus, he runs through a yard and drops one of his school books -- a history book. \n\n2.) When talking to Michelle for the first time at the plant, he says \"I used to sit next to you in history class.\"\n\n3.) During his exam in college, when he hilariously answers \"Herbie Hancock,\" its a History 201 exam. \n\n\u200b\n\nI thought \"Oh how funny? He lost his history book, and was distracted by the pretty girl next to him in history, which all made him really bad at history.\" No other class exam was shown, and people who congratulate him refer specifically to his D+ (from the HIS201 exam). So did he ONLY struggle with history? \n\nI don't know, just thought that was funny/interesting. I don't know what it means... lol. \n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",

I would love to see a \u201cmaking of\u201d movie about it because I have no idea how they got Kermit to ride a bike but it was worth the cost of admission to see that scene alone.

'The Last Crusade' in particular has this brilliant pacing where Indy has a goal, sees an obstacle and has to quickly think on his feet to knock it down, let off a quip, then move to the next beat. It's just delightful. [The 'no ticket' scene is a great example.](https://youtu.be/s0vNsH81YeA?si=Y4DMb7z9itI2eAN8)\n\nIt's absolutely baffling to me that all we got out of the legacy of those are one good Mummy movie and two okay National treasure movies, iirc. And now Jungle Cruise, I guess? Ugh. \n\nEDIT: okay I'll rewatch the mummy returns, I stand by that national treasure is just okay though \n\nAnyway, can anyone please recommend some adventure movies that scratch my itch for quick thinking escapades? Doesn't have to be after Indiana Jones but bonus points if it is! Thank you! ",

        "title": "What \"never got made\" movie did the world miss out on the most?",
        "content": "I was thinking, the other day, after a rewatch of Pulp Fiction that we, collectively as a society, really missed out on a Vega brothers movie that would have been great. Looking at the performances of Michael Madsen and John Travolta in those movies, coupled with Tarantino's storytelling, it makes me kind of sick thinking about what could have been but never was. Just imagining a single scene of those two characters having a chummy interaction with each other makes me tingle a bit.\n\nThis got me thinking about the question I am posing today for you bunch of movie buffs... what do you think is the greatest movie that is known to have been conceived but never got made? What are we worse off for as a media consuming civilization for not getting the pleasure of watching? I will throw my hat in on the never made Vincent and Vic Vega movie, but I haven't really explored too many other options... I leave that to you all.\n\nI request that everyone, before replying, check the existing replies (Ctrl-F search if you have to) to see if your suggestion was recommended, give it a thumbs up, and add your take as a reply. Thank you.",

        "title": "A transparent film adaption of Gone with the Wind would be more a more realistic and horrifying portrayal of the Antebellum South then most modern films",
        "content": "I know another adaptation would never happen for multiple reasons but it\u2019s just a thought I had. \n\nI think many modern Southern Antebellum film/television scenes often fall into two groups:\n\nCamp 1: The romanticized Antebellum \n\nThe film maker is completely enamored by the fashion, chivalric customs, speech patterns, grand estates, etc. and would like them all to be the backdrop of whatever story they are trying to tell with all of the \u201c other nastiness\u201d kept far away. Slavery and the associated atrocities are lightly touched, never too graphic. The protagonist is kind-hearted or progressive beyond their time period. \n\nThe 1939 adaption  also falls into this camp. Scarlett isn\u2019t kind-hearted but Rhett is relatively more progressive than his book counterpart. They keep his kindness towards Mammy but remove his membership in the klan and his murder of a black man for being uppity. The klan, slurs, etc. are removed from the story altogether. \n\nCamp 2: The one-note Antebellum \n\nThe entire focus of the story is to highlight the atrocities of the period. The pro-slavery characters are sociopathic and cruel to the point of caricature. Their entire lives seem to revolve around inflicting as much pain and misery as possible.  It makes the viewer almost doubt if *real people* could ever behave this way leading to a disconnect. \n\nBut Gone with The Wind is different. Margaret Mitchell writes with transparency of a \u201cnormal person\u201d who doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s grown up in an evil social structure with an evil belief system and as a result, many of her characters are \u201cnormal people\u201d who do and say evil things  without any realization their worldview is evil. It feels more realistic and thus the hateful moments cut deeper. I think a modern adaption of that material would feel the same. \n\nTake a character like Melanie Hamilton. She is sweet, selfless, and sincere in nearly every regard. She is also a blatant racist who is horrified at the thought of her husband taking a cushy bank job in the north because it means their son will have to attend an integrated school. This, from a character whose primary father figure was a black slave after being orphaned as a child. The \u201cromanticized Antbellum\u201d film maker would feel the need to make her a secret abolitionist or someone who feels conflicted by slavery. The \u201cone note Antebellum\u201d film maker would take away her kindness and make her simply cruel and self-centered. Its not that simple with Mitchell. It\u2019s jarring, painful, and *real* to see that hate coming from a woman who had been so nice up to that point. \n\nThere\u2019s also a passage where the main character Scarlett O\u2019Hara is talking with two older women after the funeral of her father. At some point, the older woman brings up \u201cyellow babies\u201d on the plantation. They  also talk about yellow babies in the aftermath of union soldiers plowing through the area during the war. It is portrayed as funny commentary from a woman too old and too bold to feel embarrassed by insinuating sexual intercourse in casual conversation. It\u2019s clear the women don\u2019t see these \u201cyellow babies\u201d as the result of rape but merely the result of hyper-sexual women and  men who can\u2019t be expected to resist what is being thrown at them. The children are the embarrassing result they have to ignore. Once again, \u201cthe romanticized Antebellum\u201d film maker would not have written this scene at all or they would have made it obvious that the protagonist was disgusted by the rape. The \u201cone-note Antebellum\u201d film makers would have made their commentary about the rape victims more hateful. Instead, Mitchell gives us as whitty, likable, and spunky grandma who jarringly doesn\u2019t care her husband and sons might have raped a few women. ",

He did it with two completely polar opposite characters in a crazy  mishmash of realities.  I still can't beleive he didn't win an oscar for this one.  The movie itself is a such a mind trip that it actually makes \"Being John Malcovich\" a sidenote in its narrative path.  Is this movie breaking the 4th wall?  Hard to describe.  This movie is peak Charlie Kaufman using an equally peak Nicholas Cage.  The amazing performaces of Merryl Streep and Chris Cooper almost get shadowed.  This is probably the best Spike Jonze movie out there.",
