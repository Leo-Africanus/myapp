This sort of comment has become cliched in its own right.\n\nTo me, this has never bothered me; usually henchmen are killed in self-defense while the antagonist is typically disarmed and vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally: maybe killing the villain in cold blood is the \"right\" move to protect others, but I can't really fault the protagonist for not wanting to do that. I know I wouldn't want to have to deal with the psychological ramifications of that.\n\nAny other tropes you don't mind that Reddit really seems to hate?",

Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. \n\nI am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",

        "content": "The first scene of pro Baseketball, we see Coop blow the Denslow Cup. He gets psyched out so bad that he falls forward, and barely makes it in the direction of the rim. Squeak made his shot right before to bring Coop to the plate with a chance to walk off Denslow Cup 4. \n\nSqueak gets roasted nonstop the entire movie. He cannot be psyched out. He gets more fucked up shit said to him than anyone by far. He lives and plays with the best psych-out artists in the league. On the surface he seems like a nervous wreck, but he's the most clutch shooter on the team. He also psychs out Tuttle to beat the LA Riots to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nSqueak always protects Joey's heroic image of Coop, even though Coop is a complete asshole to him. It's all about the kid. He tells Joey that Coop is a major dude, while not pursuing the girl at the bar. Coop falls asleep at the plate, throws the 3rd homerun over the garage, and almost kills Joey at the hospital. Before that, Coop and Remer spend Joey's whole day with the team fighting over Jenna. \n\nSqueak is a leader. With Denslow Cup 5 slipping away and the team getting blown out, It is Squeak who rallies the team on the Mulakalaka balance board of trust, while dressed as a pineapple. Remer doesn't even try, while Coop merely sucks until then. Once again, Squeak never misses. In fact, the only shot Squeak misses the entire movie is when he's not even playing, and doesn't know the rules yet.\n\nSqueak puts himself in scoring position in the Denslow Cup 5 game so many times, he collapses from running the bases. He then scores the tying run on the game winning shot. Only then, with the championship won, does Squeak engage with the girl from the bar.\n\nCoop is overwhelmed and out of his element as the player/owner. He gets distracted with the ownership of the team on the line by chasing Jenna instead of maintaining the Beers franchise and trying to make the playoffs. He flies to Calcutta to deal with his clothing line scandal and barely makes it back in time for the big game.\n\nRemer is the team cancer. When he doesn't get his way, he pouts. He cares way more about money and status than winning. He actively colludes with the Dallas owner to begin turning the league into everything it was meant not to be. He basically gives up on the team on anal-probe night, dragging the rest of the team down. Only Squeak isn't pissed off about not controlling the team they aren't the owner of.\n\nSqueak \"Little Bitch\" Scholari. MVP of the Milwaukee Beers, and Denslow Cup champion.",

The Capybara\n\nNot only was the capybara the first animal on the boat, so automatically the most important, but the capybara was kind to all the animals, caused no problems, and helped with the boat. The capybara is essentially the peacekeeper and mother on the boat, making sure all animals get on the boat safely, and trying to help solve any scuffle on the boat. The capybara was very likable, for viewers and all the animals on the boat seemed to like the capybara as well. The capybara helped steer the boat and get more animals on the boat, showing its helpfulness and the importance of the character.\n\n2. The Bird\n\nThe bird was very loyal, sacrificing its wings to protect the cat, and staying out in the rain to make sure the boat never crashed (while it was on the \"wheel\"). It was very helpful, because as you could see when other animals tried steering, it was very difficult, and only the bird never crashed the boat. The bird did have a small fight with the lemur, it was mostly peaceful and was on good terms with the rest of the animals. The bird was also very likable, especially because it fought the leader of the birds to protect the cat.\n\n3. The Cat\n\nThe cat was the main character, and a good one. The cat was likable, being the main character, and it was nice to see the character development. As the story went on the cat began to become more comfortable around the other animals, and stopped being afraid of water. The cat was helpful, catching fish to feed itself, the bird and a few of the dogs. The cat was very skittish, especially at the beginning, so it didn't really form relationships with the other characters until the end. The cat cause a few problems, hissing and scratching at certain animals, but it become more friendly as the story progressed.\n\n4. The Golden Retriever\n\nThe golden retriever was very likable, with a personality very similar to a pet dog (which it probably was). The dog wasn't a very helpful character, but it was an important one. The golden retriever was part of the story from the beginning, and you can see tremendous character development when the golden retriever doesn't run off with the other dogs at the end, but instead stays and helps the capybara. The golden retriever was also very cute, and may remind viewers of their dogs at home.\n\n5. The Lemur\n\nThe lemur was very possessive over its stuff (bottles, spoons, a mirror, etc..) and this caused multiple problems when the other animals would mess with its stuff, even causing fights at times. The lemur was an interesting character, and despite its flaws, it was still likable. The lemur was not helpful in any way, though, and, wasn't much of an important character either. It was nice at the end when the lemur left the other lemurs to help the capybara, showing sore character development.\n\n6. The Small Black Dog\n\nVery small character. Not likable, helpful, or important but better than the rest of the dogs (except the golden retriever). Runs off after the rabbit and doesn't save the capybara.\n\n7. The Big Black Dog\n\nAnother very small character. Also, not likable, helpful, or important but better most of the dogs. This dog also runs off after the rabbit and doesn't save the capybara, AND messes with the lemurs stuff, making it slightly worse than the small black dog.\n\n8. The Orange Dog\n\nSmall character. Not at all likable, not helpful, and not important. Runs off after the rabbit and leaves the capybara AND takes and breaks the lemurs mirror causing a fight and getting other animals involved as well.\n\n9. The Leader Dog\n\nBiggest character of the dogs (not including the golden retriever). Started to run after the cat at the very beginning of the movie, notifies all the dogs off the rabbit which causes them all to run after it and leave the capybara, AND eats the rest of the cat's fish and leaves none for any other animal. Very unlikable, not helpful, and not really that important.",

        "content": "If you see Mildred Pierce, the film, you're left wondering what is Veda's problem? Why does she dislike her mom, Mildred, who's devoted and caring and does everything she can so she can please her spoiled and selfish daughter? \n\nThe book truly gives greater insight into Veda and the writer, James M. Cain, based it partly on his own experiences with his own mom. \n\nThe Michael Curtiz's film doesn't show how overbearing Mildred is, how she never gives space for Veda, how she's constantly badgering her child, how she cries out of joy over her youngest daughter, Kay, dying instead of Veda, her favorite. Veda blaming Mildred for her kid sister's death on Mildred because Mildred was away while Kay got sick.\n\nAt one point, Mildred suggests she harbors incestuous feelings for her daughter, getting excited over kissing her. Of course, the film could never touch on the subject of incest in 1945. \n\nThe impression I got was Veda was trying everything she could so she could get away from Mildred and her control. What Mildred saw as concern and love, Veda saw it as Mildred constantly hovering over her, never giving her space, being uncomfortable by how clingy she was. \n\nThe murder mystery was added into the film because they had to give the film a conventional ending. The subject of a parent being emotionally toxic was unheard of in the 40s.",

        "content": "I\u2019m soooo tired of the cliche where the main character-often female- solves a crime that the police can\u2019t.\n\nShe finds a phone number that leads to this long lost relative of the missing person who happens to remember an address that the main character drives to only to find a vhs of the antagonist leaving riddles and saying \u201cdon\u2019t call the police\u201d. Then she selfishly puts everyone in danger, and speeding (again, where are the cops) down the highway-they never stop for gas either. All in all the main character becomes the sole detective to solve their problem along with some random 50 year old cold case that hundreds of trained detectives couldn\u2019t do.\n\nAt this point, why not just have a vigilante task force and forgo the PD altogether.\n\nEdit: an example would be the 2017 movie: Kidnap ( Halle Berry)",

        "content": "This movie came out over 10 years ago; I don't think I have to litigate its quality to anyone here. \n\nI originally saw this movie in 2014, a couple years after it released. I figured, it's no match for Shaun of the Dead, which I grew up watching from when I was 10, and not as clever as Hot Fuzz. It was just a lukewarm movie that I got a handful of laughs out of. \n\nIt wasn't until I entered adulthood that I realized how much this movie spoke to who I am as a person. It laid bare my inadequacies far clearer than any media I have ever viewed.\n\nI think the vast majority of viewers see Gary King as a pitiful character. Some may have even known someone like him. \n\nOne thing that has always struck me about this movie in later years is that it felt like it was talking directly to me in its plot points and characters.\n\nGary King is not just a fictional character. He's me. I've never felt more affinity for a fictional character than hearing Gary's monologue towards the end of the film. \n\n\"That was supposed to be the beginning of my life. All that promise and fucking optimism. It was a big lie. Nothing happened.\"\n\nFuck, man. I watched this shit for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, out of obligation for Shaun and Fuzz at the time. I had no idea it would go on to describe an essential part of who I was for 10 years. \n\nI like to think that most people empathize with Gary here, but some of us really are that fucking pathetic to hold on to our \"glory days\" all these years later. For some of us, it really was all we ever had.\n\nIt never got better than that night.",
