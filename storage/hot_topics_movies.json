        "content": "It could be an inclusion done by a director, writer or producer, doesn't matter that much, as long as the pettiness is on full display in the film.\n\nTwo famous examples:\n\nRoland Emmerich had characters mocking critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel added in Godzilla (1998) after the two had criticized some of his earlier films. The characters on-screen are the useless mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene, the latter giving mayor Ebert two thumbs down at the end of the movie. The real life Ebert and Siskel were not impressed, neither by the movie nor their parodies.\n\nBob Fosse's semi-autobiographical All That Jazz (1979) starring Roy Scheider as Bob Fosse stand-in Joe Gideon features a rival Broadway/film director played by John Lithgow. While it was never confirmed who this character was based on, rumours suggest Fosse's Broadway rivals Harold Prince or Michael Bennett, or some amalgamation of the two. Regardless, in a non-pivotal scene Lithgow's character Lucas Sergeant is approached by a fan (much to his ego's excitement), when the fan says:\n\n'Could I have your autograph? I'm an actress, too. You're my favorite director after Joe Gideon. I'm so sorry your show was a flop.'",

Going by the timeline, it implies he was referring to JFK, who has Irish roots (&amp; is someone Frank seems to admire). And this line plays over the first time we see the guy on screen.\n\nIn that ballistics lecture Colin attends (Matt Damon's first scene), the subject matter being discussed/diagrams being used are that of JFK's head wounds when he was assassinated.\n\nDunno if it can be seen as foreshadowing that Colin will end up killing Costello, but if it is, nice touch.",

The whole thing starts at 49:18 and lasts up until 1:07:25, a solid 18mns and 07s. And Lorne Balfe's score is blood-pumping.\n\nThe entire thrilling sequence can be broken down into three segments:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrzr0rvmvjpe1.png?width=406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e35bd51fa98823abc1041c64eb1c6d50d127bcb7\n\nThe prison break: to secure three plutonium cores, Ethan Hunt and his team are forced to break out terrorist Solomon Lane from a prison transport. To prevent Zola Mitsopolis from killing police, Ethan and August Walker have to improvise  by ramming Lane's transport into the river and divert the police whilst Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell extract Lane.\n\nThe motorcycle chase: With police in pursuit, Walker and Ethan are forced to abandon their transport and flee on motorcycles.\n\nThe car chase: To get Lane to the meeting garage, Ethan has to take him by car, and avoid Ilsa Faust so she doesn't kill Lane.",

        "content": "The Man From Earth.\n\nIt's about a history professor that suddenly decides to quit his job and move away. His fellow professors decide to leave the party, and during that time they ask him why he's leaving. He decides to tell them he's 14,000-years-old, and he has to move on when people realize that he doesn't age. That's not giving anything away about the movie, even if it seems like it is. It's an absolutely fantastic movie, where they try to decide if he's crazy, or if he's telling the truth.",

        "content": "recently got hands on and watched the new Criterion 4K disc and Wow.  every time i revisit this movie i'm reminded of how much i love every minute of it.  Michael Mann's first movie and he crushes it.  i know some people may get bored of the long heist sequences but i'm riveted.   James Caan is peak James Caan, supporting characters are great, particularly the smarmy cops.  however, i  think the real star of this film is Tangerine Dream.  their original score is beyond fantastic.  it truly elevates every scene in a way that all other scores should aspire to.\n\nif you love Heat but have never seen Thief, do yourself a favor and fix that.  a lot of the themes are the same in that 'don't get attached to anything...' philosophy kind of way.  Neo Noir at it's finest",
