        "content": "Hi Reddit. I'm Eric Lin. I directed ROSEMEAD, which stars Lucy Liu, Lawrence Shou, Orion Lee, Jennifer Lim, Madison Hu, and James Chen. It opens nationwide and in Canada this weekend 1/9.\n\nROSEMEAD is the first feature I've directed though I've shot many films as a cinematographer. Some of those films include HEARTS BEAT LOUD, THE SOUND OF SILENCE, I SMILE BACK, EQUITY, and THE EXPLODING GIRL.\n\n**ROSEMEAD's synopsis:**\n\nInspired by the harrowing true story, Lucy Liu transforms in a riveting, career-redefining performance as an ailing woman who takes drastic measures to protect her troubled teenage son (Lawrence Shou). As his dark obsessions grow and time runs out, she is forced to make impossible choices: how far will she go and what is she willing to sacrifice? Set against the simmering tensions of a Chinese American community, ROSEMEAD is a gripping portrait of a family pushed to the edge.\n\n**Watch the trailer here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD](https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD)\n\nIt's a story about the desperate need for connection and it's a film that was meant to be seen and shared with other people. Please check it out in theaters this weekend.\n\nI'll be back on Tuesday 1/13 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to chat.\n\nAsk me anything! Talk to you all on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Whenever a new Wuthering Heights movie is announced, the same conversation starts again about casting, accents, age, or whether Heathcliff will be brooding or angry this time. All of that matters, but there is a bigger problem that almost every version trips over.\n\nThey turn the story into a tragic romance.\n\nIn the book, the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is ugly, obsessive and destructive to everyone around them, including themselves. It is not soft nor tender. It is two people feeding each other\u2019s worst impulses for years. That discomfort is the point. The novel feels like a slow emotional disaster where no one learns in time and no one comes out clean.\n\nMost adaptations sands that down. They frame it as doomed love, add swelling music, give the characters prettier motives and suddenly the story becomes something easier to sit with. You get longing instead of cruelty. You get passion instead of damage. The result is watchable, but it is no longer the same story.\n\nThat choice is understandable. A straight adaptation of the book would be bleak, repetitive in its bitterness and hard to sell as a date-night movie. But once you remove that harsh core, Wuthering Heights turns into just another period drama with nice clothes and sad eyes.\n\nI am genuinely curious what this new version will do. A version that stays honest to the book would probably divide viewers and annoy a lot of people. A safer version will likely look good and be easy to market, but forgettable in the long run.\n\nEither way, it feels like this story keeps getting remade because filmmakers love the mood and the setting, but struggle to live with what the story is actually saying.",

When he eyes the score of a lifetime, his path crosses that of a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads. Convinced he has found a pattern, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) is closing in, raising the stakes even higher. As the heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are faced with life-defining choices\u2013and the realization that there can be no turning back. \n\n&gt;Adapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter).

        "content": "I know it\u2019s a bit past the holidays, but I am going on a trip to NYC today and while looking at some maps of the city for some reason I started thinking of Elf. I love that movie and it\u2019s become a holiday classic, and while it does a great job of being a holiday movie I realized it\u2019s also such a New Yorker movie, as well. I love all the different scenes in the famous landmarks like Central Park, Lincoln Center and so on, and the characters and writing have a real New York feeling, at least to someone like me that hasn\u2019t lived in the city. \n\nWhat other movies do something like this? Where the themes or genre don\u2019t need to rely on the setting but the movie still does a great job of capturing the setting. Would love to hear some suggestions, one of the things I look for in movies is making the cities feel alive and beautiful in their own way.",

But these weren\u2019t proper cries, I only cried a little. Now I want a movie that\u2019ll make me sob hysterically, please and thank you. :)) \n\nedit: I can\u2019t reply to everyones comments but thank you sm for the suggestions! ",

        "content": "To put this in the right context, if you found a scene unintentionally hilarious, or cheesy rather than terrifying; if you made fun of Javier Bardem's hair during the coin toss scene, or  yawned when Spock died,  ***nobody else in the audience felt the same way as you did.*** And people noticed. The kind of moment where the room goes quiet and heads turn your way.\n\nI was watching TV at my brother's place with his in-laws in the room when *Downfall* came on. Not exactly a feel good movie, but seeing Nazis eat shit for a few hours didn't seem like such a bad time.\n\nEverything was fine until a scene about halfway through. The Russians are closing in, the war is clearly lost, all hope going if not yet gone. Eva Braun and her friend Trudi share a quiet smoke and some girl talk in a corner. The conversation turns to relationships, and Trudi asks Eva about what Hitler is *really* like in private.\n\nShe looks pensive for a moment, then quietly says, \"He's changed...\"\n\n***ADOLF FUCKING HITLER HE'S CHANGED JESUS GOOSESTEPPING CHRIST***\n\nI lost it. Couldn't help myself. Literally rolling on the floor. Hurt to breathe, nearly collapsed a lung. Disapproving looks did not sober me up at all. Could have been worse, of course. I could have seen the film in the theater.\n\nFeel free to share your own special moments below.",
