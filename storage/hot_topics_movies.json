        "content": "In 2035, all of Ian Fleming's original James Bond 007 novels, will enter the public domain. This means that anyone can make projects about these original books, including film adaptations. We've already seen non-Eon Productions Bond films in the past with Casino Royale 1967, and Never Say Never Again, but this will be a whole different ball game. \n\nThere are of course restrictions, like studios not being able to use anything made up for the movies, like the iconic opening gun barrel sequence. \n\nBut what do you think? With Eon notoriously prioritizing other projects like Othello over the highly anticipated Bond 26, could it be a good thing that other studios will get a crack at Bond? Or will it dilute the brand and ruin everything they've been building up since 1962?",

And considering it was a Godzilla movie I found myself incredibly moved by the characters, none of whom were one-dimensional characatures.\n\nI hate when movies are too optimistic and I thought this walked the line perfectly between tragedy and fortune.\n\nJust wanted to dole out some praise for this film and a wish that more western/American films were of this quality. \n\nA+ guys.",

        "content": "I recently watched Wicked. It's a great movie, check it out if you got the time. But it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. A 10-minute intermission would be cool. It would allow the audience to get up, get some more popcorn, and use the washroom. That being said; not all movies need one. If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.\n\nBut what is your thoughts on it? Should studios put an intermission in movies or not?",

        "content": "Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.\n\nIt just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying \"jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore\" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. \n\nOf course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic. Are there any other movies with bits that get more ridiculous as the story goes on?",

Classic action stuff.\n\nThe third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.\n\nSome ups and downs:\n+Denzel glooming\n+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again\n+Nice location\n-Boring villain\n-Slow pacing\n-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie\n\nI came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him. He then negotiated that number down to three and this movie is the result.",

But wow, it was one of the worst films I\u2019ve ever seen. I got the wierd sense that the script was written by an AI, but also it had that same writing that a very young teenager uses. It was like an AI was told to write a movie for kids, but to write it as a 13 year old. I don\u2019t know. But it was so terribly written. To be expected. But is it possible Hollywood snuck in an AI script attributed to a person to see if they could get away with it? Hell the quality of this thing was so lazy, the screenwriter could have asked AI to mke it and just never told his boss. ",

It\u2019s literally the worst and most ridiculous thing to use. The idea of putting any staples into your siding and shingles, let alone thousands, is so absurd, yet it barely even registers as a joke. AND HOW IS HE GOING TO REMOVE THE LIGHTS? Just rip them out like he\u2019s pull-starting an outboard? It\u2019s so stupid and wonderful.

        "content": "Like, I think he\u2019s a more talented actor than people give him credit for. I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad\n\nBut it\u2019s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of \u201ceccentric method genius!\u201d\n\nAfter a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven\u2019t been very successful recently.\n\nAlso, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close. There\u2019s a lot of nice pictures with them\u2026 the one caveat being that Leto is usually not in any of those pictures",

Not sorry for dissing your fave.\n\nI love zombie movies, particularly scary ones. I was six years old when I first watched Zombieland and ever since I've had a lifelong fear and interest in the undead.\n\nMy personal favourites are World War Z, The Night Eats the World, and Train to Busan, those are horrific!!\n\nI've seen Rec, all the Resident Evil movies, All of Us Are Dead, #Alive, the 28 movies, and a few others!\n\nI feel like I've exhausted all the ones that make your heart race, and I absolutely can't stand horror comedies!! So things like Shaun of the Dead, the fever dream that is Zombeavers, and unfortunately my origin story, Zombieland, are completely off my radar!\n\nI would love recommendations!",

        "content": "Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.\n\nWhat is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose.\u00a0\n\nthe film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent. Despite some expensive looking special effects quality is a non-ingredient, instead reaching to gutter levels for humour and placing all the weight of carrying the movie on Black's antics.",

This might sound naive but I genuinely believe if awards seasons took horror movies seriously she could be in awards conversations.",

        "content": "Ever since the assassination of the United Health Care CEO this past week, I haven't been able to get this movie out of my mind and I saw it many years ago.  It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  \n\nIt's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.  I see it's on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.\n\nUpdate:  Wild to see that this made it to the front page of the sub, thanks all!",
