        "title": "December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f\n\nThe man finally came around.\n\n***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.\n\n***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.\n\n***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.\n\nDebuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.\n\nThis is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?\n\nThe SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...\n\nBut how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.\n\nFor some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.\n\nThere was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. \n\nAccording to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible \"C\" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.\n\nAfter its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.\n\nBarely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.\n\nWhile ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.\n\nIt has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm \"B\" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.\n\nDespite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.\n\nIt took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.\n\n***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.\n\n***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.\n\n***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).\n\nA24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.\n\nParamount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.\n\nAmazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.\n\nGia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.\n\n***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.\n\n***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.\n\nAfter missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M\n\n- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\n***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.\n\nDisney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.\n\nThe other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.\n\nIn limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

Ms Piggy is made to play Pyscho Annie and her kidnapping the writer (not sure if Kermit or a human actor would work better) and forcing them to write her a book would be amazing to see!\n\nWhat do you all think?

        "content": "If you go through the Home Alone movies, the bond between Kevin and his mom is the heart of the Film. They have a love-hate relationship in which Kate (O'Hara) always sees the bad in Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), because he's a kid  who allows his emotions to get the best of him when he's bullied by Buzz or cursed at by his no good Uncle, but she also has a lot of love for him. But when Kevin is lost or left by the wayside, it's the mom who bears the guilt and tries to figure out what went wrong as well as acknowledging her mistakes. \n\nOne thing I felt lacked in Lost in New York was the mom's subplot. I loved the Catherine O'Hara and John Candy's scenes in the first movie, great chemistry and O'Hara's character got to do a self-examination. \n\nThe sequel, O'Hara is given less to do but the crux of the film continues to be the bond between Kevin and his mom. It's no accident that she's always the one whom Kevin runs to whenever he misses his family. The father is an after-thought in all of this. \n\nAnd Catherine O'Hara is superb as Kate. She gives a true depiction of motherhood, one which isn't perfect and it's often flawed but the love and care is still there. And O'Hara is an incredible comedienne and juices up a part which could have easily been another generic mom role.",

        "content": "The third Hobbit film came out ten years tomorrow, and there's no sign of him directing anything else any time soon.\n\nI think those movies are ever-so-slightly underrated (I stick up for the EEs as the best versions, as unnecessary as an even *longer* version of that story might sound). But it's hard not to think something about their troubled production, and maybe the ways Hollywood has changed over the years, broke something in old PJ.\n\nNot that he hasn't been keeping busy at all. They Shall Not Grow Old was a really good documentary, and Get Back is essential viewing for Beatles fans. Not to mention his part in getting their 'new' song made. He seems happy enough tinkering with his pet interests.\n\nIt's a little sad though to think back on when the LOTRs came out and he was gearing up for King Kong and was still in his early 40's, you could imagine he was only just getting started. But now he seems more or less retired as a director and accepting that LOTR is probably what he'll be remembered for.\n\nIn a way, that's fair enough. LOTR is more than most people achieve. Still, it would be nice to see him back and doing something new, even if it's just shooting another horror movie in his backyard like he used to talk about doing.",

        "title": "Finally Finished. Watched 505 Movies This Year! If Anyone Cares, Here's A Top 5 (Mostly) From Each Decade.",
        "content": "\\*Posted in r/moviecritic as well.\n\nAs the title says, I made a goal this year to watch 500 movies this year, roughly 40-50 from each decade to broaden my movie horizons, and while it required DAILY dedication, I finally finished today. In fact, I watched 505 as I also viewed a few bonus movies.\n\nI built the list from Best Picture winners from the big award shows. (Academy Awards, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, etc.) I also used every \u201cTop 100\u201d list I could find, and even used a helpful post here on Reddit that compiled the top 250 based on users scores, which helped find foreign movies.\n\nI made a rule for myself that I had to finish every movie, even if I hated it. (Which gave me the chance to change my mind on a few, like \u201cHoly Motors,\u201d etc.)\n\nSo, here\u2019s my Top 5 from each decade, except the 20s which only got 4, and the 2000s, which had too many great movies and gets 11. The movies are only listed in order of title length, except the first one, which was the best in my opinion.\n\nVery excited for next year's viewing list, which is the exact opposite of all this critical acclaim and made up of almost exclusively my Arrow Video Boxsets and Vinegar Syndrome purchases. (Although I am only doing 400 for an easier pace.)\n\n\\*EDIT\\* I did include an image that showed the list of the 505 movies I watched. As I said in comments, if anyone wants the excel file for their own list, let me know and its all yours.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* I made a mistake with the date for Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

        "content": "I watched the movie *Passengers* recently, and I just can\u2019t stop thinking about the scenarios that could have happened, especially how dark it could get. I mean, 90 years is a *looong* time! Here are some of the scenarios that came to mind:\n\n* Jim and Aurora have kids, and how would those kids have dealt with their lives? Would they have resented their situation and sabotaged the ship? Also, if they don't wake up other passengers, there could be a risk of inbreeding!\n* What if Jim and Aurora decided to wake up more passengers but ended up waking the wrong ones and it backfires when the new passengers are hostile?\n* The movie shows Aurora forgiving Jim, but realistically, forgiveness isn\u2019t that simple. What if she grew bitter over the years and sought revenge?\n* Jim passes away, leaving Aurora alone. She is unable to figure out how to wake another passenger like Jim did. Over time, she goes mad and maybe commits suicide. Yikes, that would be scary!\n* The entire passenger population wakes up far too early. With limited resources, the ship descends into chaos, leading to starvation, riots, and widespread death.\n* The darkest scenario I imagined is the ship malfunctioning, trapping everyone inside with no way out. They\u2019d be awake but unable to escape, turning the ship into a floating prison.\n* Cannibalism: If resources become critically scarce, they face unimaginable choices, including cannibalism if one dies or if hostility arises among awakened passengers.\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting, I can\u2019t stop thinking about all the possible scenarios!!!",

I think he is one of the better villains we have seen in recent years. Terrifying and well acted!\n\nThe movie does devolve into Hollywood shlock a bit by the end, but it is still entertaining.\n\nWould love to hear your thoguhts! \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I really would love to see a follow up showing the results of David\u2019s experiments on the colony!",

Anyway, I was playing on my phone and let the credits roll to the end, and something weird happened.\n\nInstead of the usual static that you get when a VHS tape finishes, there was a 3-second blip after the credits. It was grainy and muffled like someone was recording it on a camcorder they were trying to hide. It seemed to be one of the kids dads in front of the clubhouse saying something close to, \u2018Take Tish\u2019 (I watched it several times and that's the closest I could make out.)\n\nI\u2019ve Googled it, checked Reddit, and searched YouTube, but I can\u2019t find anyone talking about this. It feels like it could be an Easter egg or an accidental addition, but I can't make sense of it. \n\nDoes anyone have a copy of this VHS and if so, does it have the bit at the end like mine does? Alternatively, is there a better subreddit to ask this in? Does anyone know anything about this?",

        "content": "Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.\n\nSo this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.\n\nAnd one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.\n\nI know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about \"I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent\" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous). But I'm curious how did people react to this opening after seeing their favourite hero return.\n\nEDIT: Didn't realize this would start a huge discussion about internal consistency, established rules and the word \"physics\".",

She should\u2019ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.\n\nShe\u2019s so believable as twins it\u2019s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which \u201ctwin\u201d was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. \n\nEvery single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they\u2019re twins. There\u2019s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic.

His parents are also off sounding with their lines, like when they film dialogue separately using stand ins. All the dialogue has no flow between the characters. The cinematography(shots, pans, editing) feels weird and off. Comedy is all about timing and delivery, and every bit and line is a swing and a miss. Jack Black seems like he\u2019s just doing improv, poorly. It reminds me of someone new to stand up who hasn\u2019t worked out their rhythm yet. Even the music doesn\u2019t seem to match what I\u2019m watching, if that makes sense.\n\nCan anyone with more insight into film making tell me what is wrong with this film?
