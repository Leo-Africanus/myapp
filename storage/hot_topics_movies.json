These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):\n\n&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first \u201cMoana,\u201d at its best, transcended.\n\n[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.\n\n[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. \n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but \u201cMoana 2\u201d is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, much like \"Frozen II,\" \"The Incredibles 2,\" and \"Toy Story 4,\" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):\n\n&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There\u2019s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.\n\n[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):\n\n&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):\n\n&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here\u2019s a second movie that\u2019s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. If not, well: It\u2019s one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):\n\n&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn\u2019t feel richer or more exciting.\n\n[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): \n\n&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it\u2019s necessary to write 'there\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):\n\n&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :\n\n&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n&gt;\u201cMoana 2\u201d reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she\u2019s ever faced.\n\n**Staring**:\n\n* Auli'i Cravalho as Moana\n* Dwayne Johnson as Maui\n* Alan Tudyk as Heihei\n* Temuera Morrison as Chief Tui\n* Nicole Scherzinger as Sina\n* Rose Matafeo as Loto\n* David Fane as Kele\n* Hual\u0101lai Chung as Moni\n* Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda as Simea\n* Awhimai Fraser as Matangi\n* Gerald Ramsey as Tautai Vasa\n\nDirected by: David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nWritten by: Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nProduced by: Christina Chen and Yvett Merino\n\nEdited by: Jake Roberts\n\nMusic by: Mark Mancina (score and songs), Opetaia Foa\u02bbi (score and songs), Abigail Barlow (songs), Emily Bear (songs)\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes",

        "title": "Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films",
        "content": "When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like \"Title 2\", \"Title II\", \"Title Part 2\", \"Title: The Revenge\", \"Tit2e\", etc.\n\nThis can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.\n\nSometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.\n\nSo what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",

Racial justice and human rights are non existent. They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices, their intention to rule with the annihilation of the consciousness. We have been lulled into a trance. They have made us indifferent to ourselves,to others. We are focused only on our own gain. They want to keep us asleep, keep us selfish and keep us sedated\"\n\nHow did it take over 30 years for me to see the obvious parallels to real life?",

It stars Paul Newman, Bruce Willis, Jessica Tandy and Melanie Griffith. Newman plays a crotchety, dead beat dad who gets a chance to redeem himself when his adult son and grandchildren return to his small town in New York State. It's a holiday two for one, check it out!",

In television there's a scene in Workaholics where Anders is wearing a Paddy's Pub shirt and even Good Girls and Superstore are connected through Cloud 9. \n\nNowadays there's the MCU, DCU or the Monsterverse connecting movies together but before all that, were there any movies or tv shows that got connected because of a character or maybe even a location?",

There is a scene in it where Michelle Pfeiffer's character is lying on the floor and the camera pushes in, goes thru the floor, and then is beneath her looking up. I think I remember reading that Robert Zemeckis achieved this effect by shooting thru a glass floor with that was digitally covered up at the beginning of the shot. So wondering what other shots in movies just made you take a step back and go \" wow that was cool\". ",

        "content": "While at the Pasadena Playhouse, Holliman entered the Paramount lot by claiming he had an appointment with a studio barber. Eventually he became friendly with studio executives. Holliman first got a small bit part opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Scared Stiff (1953). Next he was cast as a marine in The Girls of Pleasure Island (1953), for which he needed a G.I. haircut. Finally he saw the barber and ended up with a haircut (and bangs) that changed his life.\n\nAfter he gained popularity in his image following a change in hairstyle, he then followed with three more films released in 1953.His many credits include: Broken Lance (1954), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), The Big Combo (1955), I Died a Thousand Times (1955), Forbidden Planet (1956), Giant (1956), The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Don't Go Near the Water (1957), Hot Spell (1958), The Trap (1959), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960), Armored Command (1961), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Anzio (1968), The Desperate Mission (1969), Smoke (1970), The Biscuit Eater (1972), The Solitary Man (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981) and Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (1987).\n\nHolliman played a doomed helicopter crewman in the William Holden war drama The Bridges at Toko-Ri and a gangster's double-crossed thug in The Big Combo. He co-starred with Jack Palance in the crime drama I Died a Thousand Times (1955), a remake of High Sierra. He starred in The Rainmaker (1956), opposite Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, playing a rancher's timid son, who finally must defy his brother to gain self-respect, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture; he was cast in the role instead of Elvis Presley. His role in Rainmaker brought him such praise that columnist Louella Parsons cited him being \"as dedicated as though he were Marlon Brando and Anthony Perkins combined\".",
