        "content": "**The Birdcage** is my favorite comedy. Funny thing, my PASTOR loves it too. He's the reason why I saw it. \n\nI was looking at 1/2 star reviews on Letterboxd because looking at bad reviews of movies you love is funny. Anyways, a bunch of negative reviews of this say that Val, the son, is the biggest villain in cinema history and he's homophobic to his own gay parents and such. \n\nI've seen the movie a handful of times, and I don't see it that way. \n\nVal clearly loves his parents, he gives them a kiss when he comes home, he doesn't show hatred to them, or anything like that. Sure, he gives them little time to redecorate their home, but he doesn't call them slurs or such. \n\nVal has also clearly never made his family change before. He mentions to his Dad that when he was a kid, he was told that he should tell teachers that his father is a businessman, not the owner of a gay drag club. So, it was his fathers who have made him change in the past. \n\nIt's always been clear to me that Val loves his 2 fathers, and that the changes are to not turn away his to be father-in-law. If Val's fianc\u00e9's family was much more accepting of gay people, he wouldn't have done that. \n\nI've never seen Val as the jerk. Kevin always was. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nNote: I'm not saying that Val is completely justified in every action he does.  I don't morally approve of Val kicking Albert out, for instance. Like all good characters (in terms of writing), he has a character arc. But the Letterboxd reviews that say he's the worst villain ever? Come on, he's not Cruella De Vil! \n\n",

Idk how much of a \u201cthing\u201d they are anymore (in relation to the heyday of midnight movies in the 80s I mean) but it\u2019s easily become my favourite kind of moviegoing experience. There\u2019s something so special to me about seeing some batshit movie at half past midnight with a bunch of strangers who wanted to be there enough to show up during that time. In a world where the \u201cmoviegoing experience\u201d seems to have changed so much, seeing The Thing in 35mm in a packed midnight showing or swinging by the IFC on a Friday night to watch some crazy foreign thing I had never previously heard of\u2026 easily my fav thing that I\u2019ve been able to do - especially in NYC (I\u2019m from the UK and midnight movies/art house theatres aren\u2019t as much of a thing anymore over there). The biggest joy of adulthood for me has been the ability to see my fav cult classics at midnight showings. Here\u2019s to weird movies - may they never die.",

        "content": "Just watched for the first time a few days ago so I'm late to the party but wow. I could go on and on about the cool intricacies of the time loop paradox but what hit me the most was how sad Jane/John's story is.\n\nAll her life she wishes to be loved. The only time she experiences it, she is quickly abandoned by the man. The next time she experiences that love is as John when he comes back in time and realizes he is the man she falls in love with. John gets to experience the same love all over again, but is forced to abandon her knowing the pain it will cause. Then as a temporal agent, he has to set Jane and John up, knowing the outcome.\n\nThe final scene of the movie where he says \"you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I miss you dreadfully\" hit me the hardest. Realizing that he's talking about him/herself. The only love Jane/John have ever and will ever experience is from themselves. It's so strange and sad. \n\nI would argue that he goes insane and becomes the fizzle bomber to maintain the paradox, not out of self-preservation but because he wants to make sure the love he experienced happens. idk y'all it's just sad to me. The majority of Jane/John's life is spent in isolation, orchestrating some cosmic self-cestuous love story that barely lasts a few weeks. ",

Looking for movies that keep you on the edge of the seat the whole time and are next to impossible to predict. The only rule is it can\u2019t be a horror movie as my gf doesn\u2019t like horror. Preferably post 1990 but open to older movies if they\u2019re that good. Limited series suggestions are also welcome. TIA!",

        "content": "I watched The Keep a 1984 Michael Mann movie. I really liked the premise of this ancient evil being held prisoner by an ancient order only for Nazis to kill them and accidentally release it, and a subsequent fight to lock it back up. Great 80's soundtrack and cool visuals, especially the evil being. However the movie feels chopped in half and stapled back together, with massive jumps in story. It doesn't recover and so I understand the movie's low rating.\n\nI feel this movie would be perfect to remake. They could set it in Syria or Iraq where you'd have a similar play out with an ancient evil being released during the war and destruction of the cultural sites. Showcase some of the ancient Mesopotamian evil monster mythology. You could really play into the horror.\n\nWhat would be another example you feel for a movie deserving of a remake?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The characters are acting they are in a mock buster. This movie doesn't even feel like it's sequal to its own franchise. What a waste of an opportunity to have science fiction franchise not based on existing Intellectual property. ",

But I also don't have the head space for anything heavy or difficult of course. I find often the best things to watch are really good escapists fluff lol. \n\nI am watching Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets right now and it's surprisingly good for this so far lol. It's decidedly not a great film lol but it's fun to look at. It doesn't ask much of me but it's very well done for what it is. ",

It's not like he was out of his prime either cause his next movie was Starship Troopers. I'm just curious what the reaction was for the time. I also always felt bad for Elizabeth Berkley because that role had to have been seen as a gigantic get after Saved by the bell got cancelled. I have to imagine she thought she was going to be a megastar. ",
