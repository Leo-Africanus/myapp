        "title": "Let's talk about \"Children of Men\"...",
        "content": "Seriously, how good was this movie? Twenty years later, it still holds up. Their depiction of 2027 didn't have flying cars or any crazy shit like that, in fact, it seems pretty spot on in terms of how the world actually looks from a technological standpoint. Less people glued to their phones, but perhaps the director was more optimistic than the movie let on.\n\nThat said, the film certainly did have its own flavour. The  shaky cam shots and tracking sequences were just as cool and engaging as the first time I'd seen the movie 15 years ago and brought about a sense of realism. True to this theme, the characters were human through and through, flawed, likeable, and relatable.\n\nClive Owen is a cynical alcoholic with a sad past, but as we see, is incapable of being anything short of a good man. His pot head friend in Michael Caine is similar in this regard. Serving both as comedic relief and the voice of reason despite being a stoner who lives in the woods. Kee, the first mother in over 18 years, is a far-cry from the Virgin Mary. Not only does she not know who the father is, she doesn't know \"who any of the wankers were.\"\n\nThen we have that ceasefire scene where we see the human side of a government that is initially portrayed as inhumanly cruel and oppressive. For as long as it lasts, it's a touching moment (and one of many scenes that makes great use of contrast -- the bombing at the beginning, Julie Anne-Moore being killed out of nowhere... there was never a moment where you could allow yourself to relax).\n\nI'm gonna leave the depictions of anti-immigrant sentiments alone, but you're free to discuss the relevance of that part amongst yourself.\n\nAnyways, what did you think of *Children of Men*?",

Imho it is the epitome of \u201ctruth is stranger than fiction\u201d cuz it\u2019s crazy to see so many big names from history books behaving like, well, idiotic, greedy children. How could one even underestimate Armando Iannucci, a legend for his political satire in Veep and Thick of It. The greatest choice the movie makes is to let all the actors keep their native accents, which sometimes makes this feel like watching an early Guy Ritchie movie set in Russia and if that isn\u2019t a compliment then I don\u2019t know what is.",

It should be as revered as Isabelle Adjani in \"Possession\". \n\nThe TV show never gave us a fully fledged portrait of Laura Palmer but in \"Fire Walk with Me\", we get to see who she is, how she lived in a constant state of panic, fear and brooding resignation. Her self-destruction through a promiscuous life was her way of escaping from the abuse inflicted in her home and the conflicted emotions she had for her abuser. \n\nLaura didn't want to live, death was her way of wanting to escape, wanting the angel to save her from BOB and all the pain and anger inflicted on her. Not even the love she got from James and Donna was enough. \n\nI absolutely adore this movie by David Lynch. I even think Moira Kelly was a better Donna than Lara Flynn Boyle (whom I always found to be miscast).",

        "content": "I think by now it's common knowledge that Richard Pryor (who was a co-writer from the start) was Mel Brooks' first choice to play Bart - the role that went to Cleavon Little. The money weasels claimed that Pryor's drug convictions made him uninsurable...\n\nWhat fascinates me more however is the fact that Books seems to have really wanted an older actor to play the Gene Wilder part - the Waco Kid. His top choice was John Wayne, who declined but said he'd be first in line to see it. Next he wanted Dan Dailey, whose film credits begin in 1940. Finally they tried Gig Young (b. 1913), who collapsed on the first day of shooting from alcohol withdrawal (*he* was insurable?). That's when they finally said screw it and flew in Gene, nobody's choice but available *and* insurable.\n\nThink about how different Blazing Saddles would have been with Brooks' first choices in the main roles! It's comical to even think about, which might have been Brooks' intention all along. It's a little nugget of humor buried in the back story of the film itself, a lasting legacy.",

I'm sure there are a bunch of horror films, but I really struggle to think of any other films that play this completely straight -  usually if it ends with the protagonist losing then they made a mistake somewhere along the line.\n\nI'd exclude biopics and movies in series from this as they are part of a larger story (eg: Empire Strikes Back ends with Han being frozen and Luke losing to Vader, but you know it's only the middle of the story) \n\nI'm sure I'm missing obvious ones but one of the only examples I can think of is actually Don't Look Up, where the main characters are correct, try to warn everyone, do it as well as they can... but it doesn't make any difference.",

        "title": "How did the 3D experience die out?",
        "content": "Apparently, I was just thinking about a while back how 3D was big for a while before dying out. We had 3D Blu-ray's, 3D movies, 3D TV's and 3D channels for a time. But this is where I found out that 3D was such a gimmick to audiences.\n\n&gt;The post-credits scene for Thor was originally filmed with 3D cameras, and it was created by The Avengers director Joss Whedon. Originally intended as a test to determine whether The Avengers would be shot in 3D, it resulted in Kevin Feige being discouraged from the process entirely moving forward. It was so difficult, that it was described as \"being an abysmal experience.\"\n\n&gt;The post-credits scene was a roughly 90-second clip and consists of little more than the meeting of Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's Erik Selvig setting up the MCU's future. However, despite the seeming simplicity of the scene, the decision to shoot it with 3D cameras caused the filming process to be unnecessarily long. Jeremy Latcham, an executive producer on The Avengers, described the tedious shoot. He said, \"It took so long to change a lens that it was truly awful. It was the longest day to shoot that tiny, tiny scene.\"\n\n&gt;Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's experience filming the post-credits scene caused him to ask Jeremy Latcham whether this would be how the next film was shot, and if it were so, then he would not be starring in it. Luckily, he was able to appear in The Avengers because they didn't shoot the movie in 3D.\n\nI think that the problem was that it was a gimmick to the audience, it was expensive and the novelty would wear out after a while. Plus, a lot of the 3D conversions were terrible (e.g. Clash of the Titans and any movie that had its 3D conversion rushed to cash-in on the success of Avatar). Look at 2010 where 60% of Shrek: Forever After's opening weekend came from 3D sales post-Avatar and by 2011, 40% of Kung Fu Panda 2's opening weekend came from 3D sales. That is a noticeable decline\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are still 3D movies being released but not as often as they were 5-10 years ago (Captain America: Brave New World is getting a 3D release next month). I just think the problem with 3D was that it proved to be a gimmick with audiences and the good 3D conversions were the ones shot in 3D like Avatar and stuff like that.",

Her friend is still crying from it and started crying when she read the speech. So there is hope for her. \n\nI just want to say my daughter has a dark sense of humor and loves to laugh but she is the sweetest kid. She is the first to offer help. Shes very kind and sweet. She helps her teacher during lunch. She also has a strong moral compass and compassion to animals and people. She stands up for her friends and her beliefs and is just a generally a great kid. I\u2019m sure in a few years so will be a crier like me. Thank you all for your suggestions. We will make our way through a lot of these. \n\nI think tomorrow we will do a Schindler\u2019s list family movie night. My husband is thrilled..\n\nI think we will have to do grave of the fireflies tomorrow as well. Lots of suggestions. I haven\u2019t heard of it. ",

        "content": "I know that there is often a bit of additional detail that gets generated surrounding the larger Mad Max universe that exists outside of just the movies themselves. Does anyone know if it\u2019s ever explained how Dementus\u2019s manages to keep an entire biker horde running without a clear source of guzzaline? While guzzaline is fairly common at the Citadel thanks to the proximity of gas town, Dementus and his horde appear to be unfamiliar with the existan e of either until they meet the war boy in the wasteland. \n\nJust wondering if this is covered anywhere? It\u2019s bugged me since watching the movie. ",

        "content": "Like a lot of others I was a fan of Marvel since 2008's \"Iron Man\" and Captain America: Brave New World looks good but recently I have lost a bit of enthusiasm for Marvel.\n\nI wish something new would become the next \"Big Thing\" in American cinema and I would prefer it to be sci fi movies.\n\nI think it would be awesome if we were living in a world where movie goers were excited to see a movie based on James S.A. Corey's \"Leviathan Wakes\" or something like it which warned against having corporations and governments gaining too much power and were inspired to put humanity on a brighter path.\n\nThere is an excellent TV show that was on Syfy but cancelled and then saved by Amazon called \"The Expanse\" but a movie would probably reach a bigger and wider mainstream audience.\n\nI think it would be cool if we were living in a world where the Mass Effect trilogy was getting a series of good big screen adaptations and were blowing people away with the new sci fi universe, aliens, and spaceships and showed people that \"Space Opera\" isn't just Star Wars or Star Trek.\n\nI think it would be cool to have Iain M. Banks's vision of the future, \"The Culture\" realized on the big screen.\n\nHopefully the success of the new Dune movies make Hollywood seriously think about giving us new sci fi movies.",

        "title": "One detail I really love about Speed Racer (2008)",
        "content": "To explain briefly, [Speed Racer (2008)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)) is a racing film directed by the Wachowskis (The Matrix, Cloud Atlas) and is an adaptation based on [a classic manga series of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer) by Tatsuo Yoshida. It's a somewhat wacky movie with live-action anime/cartoon physics and over-the-top characters and action, but if you could look past all the silliness, there's actually a decent story that deals with corporate corruption, idealism versus pragmatism, a close family bond that can help one overcome any odds however impossible it seems to be, and a willingness to stand up and fight for what you believe in.\n\nWhich brings us to the titular Speed Racer himself. Speed (yes, that's his actual name) is an extremely skilled racer who over the course of the film has participated in four races. He won three out of these four races, but only the last one is the one that he *truly* won in my opinion.\n\nNow, we'll go into SPOILER territory:\n\nThe first race, the opening race at Thunderhead Raceway, has Speed pretty much *dominating* the competition and nobody really gives him a real challenge, except he's *not* racing against them: he's racing against the *ghost* of his late brother Rex, who was killed years ago and was Speed's idol who inspired him to become a racer. Up until the last part of the race, Speed almost managed to beat Rex's record, but that record was all that remained of Rex's memory, so Speed decided to slow down and let \"Rex\" win, thus keeping Rex's record as it is. Though he technically won the race, Speed still \"lost\" to Rex because he just didn't have it in his heart to erase his brother's memory away.\n\nIn the second race at Fuji Raceway, Speed Racer outright lost due to the machinations of Arnold Royalton, a corrupt corporate tycoon who fixed the race by paying other racers to take out Speed before he could reach the finish line. Pretty straightforward, this one is.\n\nThe third race is the infamous Casa Cristo 5000 rally, the race in which Rex was supposedly killed years ago. Speed went through so much trouble through this race, even facing his deep fear that he'd end up dead just like his brother, and finally managed to help his team to victory. However, his team partner - Taejo - was actually manipulating Speed and his family into helping him secure Taejo's father's company financially and he had never intended to help Speed and his allies bring Royalton to justice. So, while Speed technically did win the Casa Cristo race, he failed to achieve his long-term goal of taking down Royalton, and now Speed's own family is on the brink of being forced to go out of business.\n\nWhich finally brings us to the fourth and final climatic race, the Grand Prix. Taejo's sister - remorseful over what her brother and father did to Speed's family - decided to help Speed enter the Grand Prix at the last second, much to Royalton's fury. Speed Racer then singlehandedly took on *all the racers* on the racing roster who were tempted by Royalton's bounty on Speed's head. Against all odds, Speed won the race fair and square after a spectacular last lap, revealing that Royalton was crooked in the process. He finally achieved his hard-earned victory and changed the entire racing world for the better.\n\nBy holding off Speed's one genuine win for last, the movie makes Speed and his family's ultimate victory *very* cathartic after everything they've been through over the course of the film. In previous races, Speed is held back by various setbacks both personally and from outside factors, so even if he won some of the races technically, they didn't really feel like a \"win\".\n\nIt was not until the final race that there was nothing that held Speed back anymore, and Speed was free to give it his everything and quite literally fight the entire racing world to earn that victory. The entire last five minutes with all the flashbacks and characters motivating Speed as he gets back into the race after a temporary car breakdown and Michael Giacchino's soundtrack (God, that man's a genius at uplifting soundtracks) all emphasize how crucial a moment this is for Speed - how it's not only about him defeating Royalton and his corrupt company, but it's about overcoming every inner demons that plagued his mind up to that point.\n\nMaybe I'm looking too much into this for a movie that has a pretty mixed reception by critics, but as a fan of racing movies that don't really come by often, Speed Racer is admittedly one of my favorite movies growing up and the more I go back to see it, the more I feel how *genuine* the emotional elements in the movie is, and that's the reason why I decided to write this entire essay lol. Would love to know what fellow Speed Racer fans (however many of them there are lol) think about all this as well. :)",
