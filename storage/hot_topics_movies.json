The pair's view turns deadly after a police confrontation, setting off a tragic chain of events that forces a reckoning with power, principle, and the limits of freedom.\\]\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_T4JHPowGbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T4JHPowGbg)\n\nAsk me anything, reddit.

        "content": "Yes, I know you cinephiles will say that Quentin, Chris Nolan, or PTA should be in this discussion too. But I'm here to make the case for someone whose early career run is arguably unmatched: **Rob Reiner**.\n\nJust look at this incredible string of films:\n\n* **This Is Spinal Tap** (1984): His very first movie and a genre-defining masterpiece. It single-handedly created the mockumentary genre and is one of the funniest films ever made. Reiner and his team so perfectly lampooned rock documentaries that the genre was never quite the same.\n* **The Sure Thing** (1985): A great pivot with a solid, early John Cusack performance.\n* **Stand By Me** (1986): A true classic and many people's pick for the best coming-of-age movie of all time.\n* **The Princess Bride** (1987): A fantasy-comedy-romance that is so widely beloved it's still quoted and celebrated today.\n* **When Harry Met Sally...** (1989): Considered by many to be the greatest romantic comedy ever made.\n* **Misery** (1990): A perfect, chilling adaptation of the Stephen King novel. It's a shocking turn from rom-com to horror that few directors could pull off.\n* **A Few Good Men** (1992): An iconic military courtroom drama, with some of the most memorable lines in film history.\n\nAfter this run, his filmography definitely cools down, but that initial stretch of seven films is an unbelievable display of versatility and skill. From mockumentary to horror to rom-com, what other director has put together a run like that?",

        "content": "Both are \"wacky summer vacation\" movies that succeed in no small part thanks to Candy's presence (among his many other talents, the man was just perfect at playing the beleaguered family man). Personally, I prefer \"The Great Outdoors\", not just because it gives Candy a better foil with Dan Aykroyd, but because it perfectly captures the look and feel of a vacation in the Midwest, specifically WI/MN at a lake. When Candy and Aykroyd are sitting on the cabin deck looking out at the lake, I want to be there with them. And then we get my favorite exchange in the movie.\n\n\"I see the underdeveloped resources of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, a consortium exploiting over a billion dollars in forest products. I see a paper mill and a mining operation, a green belt between lakeside condos and a waste management facility focusing on the newest rage in waste: Medical refuse. Infected bandages, body parts, IV tubing, syringes, fluid, blood, radioactive waste, all safely contained, sunken in the lake and sealed for centuries. I ask you, what do you see?\"\n\n\"I..I just see trees.\"\n\nYour preference?",

But where's all the love for French animation? It far more influential than most people probably realise but despite that barely gets talked about outside of enthusiast circles. Are there any fans of French animation here, and if so, what are your favourites? Some of my favourites are Persepolis, Fantastic Planet, Marona's Fantastic Tale, The Triplets of Belleville and Ernest &amp; Celestine.",

        "content": "[Character Actors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor) or \"That Guys\" have been an important fixture of movies since the artform began, with the most recognizable arriving in the 70's and 80's with your Keith Davids, Harry Dean Stantons, and M Emmet Walshes all appearing in dozens of films without appearing on the posters. The next younger generation with Steve Buscemi, PSH, John Turtorro and others from the 90s Indie Boom would achieve slightly more notoriety and leading fame over time, but still had a character actor foundation and were never above smaller weird cameos. \n\nand now as most of our greats have passed, or are acting less and the industry is changing as we all know, who are the younger actors following in those tradition?\n\nThe only ones who are currently coming to mind is [David Dastmalchian](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2810287/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) who while he is 50, didn't start until 2008 and has racked up 178 credits since then. and also [Stephen McKinley Henderson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376610/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) who is 76.... but also exclusively started working in the last decade appearing in everything. I felt like the great Jesse Plemmons has been close and had a great smaller run, but seems to be getting more A-List so not entirely sure he fits.",
