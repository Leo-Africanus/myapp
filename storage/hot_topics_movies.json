        "content": "This is a specific kind of movie, not stuff like *The Sixth Sense* or *The Others* where the whole story gets reframed by a twist. I\u2019m looking for films that specifically hint at something much deeper going on but never explicitly explain it.\n\nA common (and controversial) example is *Eyes Wide Shut*. On the surface it is about a nosey doctor who stumbles upon an elite sex cult. However, many viewers believe it may be pointing toward child sex abuse, based on cryptic dialogue and visual cues allegedly left by Kubrick. I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist, but given Kubrick\u2019s meticulous deliberation I find this interpretation at least plausible. Regardless, the film leaves you with the strong sense that something far darker is going on.\n\nAnother example would be David Lynch\u2019s *Twin Peaks: The Return*, where numerous blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it visual glitches are scattered throughout the entire season, suggesting cosmic disarray and an increasingly fragmented reality.\n\nLastly, in a very different vein the film *Local Hero* appears to be a very straightforward story about an oil man traveling to a remote Scottish village to build a refinery. Yet there are small, almost imperceptible hints throughout that the village may exist in a magical or mythological reality inspired by Scottish folklore. One might interpret these hints as throwaway references if not for a bizarre reveal that one character has webbed feet. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for films like this. Something feels deeply \u201coff\u201d or hidden, but the movie never confirms or explains it outright. ",

I watched Anaconda when I was younger maybe once or twice but I decided to rematch it today after I saw the new Jack Black version this past weekend. I am genuinely confused by Jon Voight's character. I understand that he's a big snake hunter amd that he thinks catching the giant anaconda will make him rich, but surely there were other ways to go about it instead of sabotaging a film crew and deliberately getting some of them killed? And what the hell is that accent? It sounds Spanish at times, Italian, Australian, and it's just all over the place. And who's bright idea was it to have him be swallowed whole by the snake, spit out, and then proceed to wink at Jennifer Lopez's character as his limp body falls to the floor? I'm just utterly confused by the thought process both in front of the camera and behind it. ",

        "content": "Occurred to me the other night when my wife and I were talking about the first album we ever bought as kids. I laughingly admitted mine were Kriss Kross and Ace of Base. She had a good laugh, and tried to remember the lyrics to \"Jump Jump.\" I tried to remind her by bringing it up on Spotify and she emphatically stopped me (No! Please no! I don't need that song stuck in my head all week!). So I joked I was going to secretly make it her alarm clock music. It then reminded of the gag from Groundhog day and got me thinking that \"Jump Jump\" would actually be an older song to someone now than \"I Got You Babe\" was to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. And then it reminded me of the cruel march of time... But I digress...\n\nIf Groundhog Day were remade today (please don't Mr Hollywood producer person), what song would our protagonist be waking up to every morning?\n\nEdit Edit: Lotsa folks getting hung up on the exact year difference. Can't change it now, but I didn't mean to sound like it had to be from *exactly* 1997, just that that was the rough era we were talking about. Any similarly old song is fair game.\n\nEdit: Some of my favorites listed so far:\n\nSpice Girls - Wannabe. Just opening every day with \"Yoooooo I'll tell ya what I want!\" would be hilarious\n\nSmash Mouth - All Star. Ditto: \"SOoooommmeBODY Once told me...\"\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Today. How poetic\n\nChumbawumba - Tubthumping\n\nLen - Steal My Sunshine\n\nWho Let The Dogs Out\n\nBittersweet Symphony\n\nGreen Day - Basketcase\n\nSheryl Crow - Every Day Is A Winding Road\n\nBare Naked Ladies - One Week. Starting every day with \"YIIIIITsss beeeen ONE WEEK!\"\n\nCher - Believe. Nice reference to the original.\n\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go One. Fits the sappiness and relevance of I Got You Babe.\n\n4 Non Blondes - What's Up.\n\nCardigans - Love Fool\n\nRembrants - I'll Be There For You.\n\nOasis - Wonderwall.\n\nThird Eye Blind - Jumper or Semi Charmed Life\n\nProclaimers - 500 Miles. \"When I wake up... Yeah I know I'm gonna be...\" Even a bit of a love song to boot. \n\nWhitney Houston version of I Will Always Love You. Imagine waking up every morning to AAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDDD IIIIIIIII eIIIIIIIIIIIII",

And how!\n\nI\u2019d resisted the movie for a long time because John Malkovich was never really on my radar as an actor, I didn\u2019t dislike him, I just didn\u2019t particularly care either. But after reading a bit about the movie, I realized the movie didn't have much to do with John Malkovich himself and way more to do with the crazy premise: Cusack plays a puppeteer who discovers a portal that leads directly into Malkovich\u2019s mind.\n\nI mean that made me go, What?!\n\nI\u2019m a fan of surreal comedies (like After Hours), so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot, telling myself I could always switch to something else if it sucked. You know, something intelligent and grounding, like The Waterboy, from a year earlier. :p\n\nBut wow. What an entertaining movie.\n\nFrom the very beginning, you\u2019re in for a whimsical mindfuck, absurd, funny, but oddly still packed with food for thought. I mean, stopping an elevator halfway between floors is just the starting point of the crazy adventure and it gets weirder but I won\u2019t say much more.\n\nWell, except: Malkovich malkovich, malkovich malkovich! Malkovich malkovich?\n\nYou\u2019ll understand if you\u2019ve seen it.\n\nThere are moments where nothing makes sense at all, and then other moments where the strangest things suddenly make perfect sense. It\u2019s weird in that very intentional and thought-out way, like it's crazy but smart.\n\nThere are plenty of \u201cmindfuck\u201d movies out there, so I'm not just asking about that in general, but more specifically about smart \u201cWhat the F did I just watch?\u201d films. Something weird, absurd, and surreal but clearly made with real thought behind it?",

        "title": "My ranking of the Star Trek movies and why.",
        "content": "For Christmas 2025, I decided to work through the Star Trek films. A few years ago, I did a James Bond marathon and enjoyed it; this time, I kept notes and tried to rank the movies as I went.\n\nMy ranking\n\n1. The Wrath of Khan (Star Trek II)\n2. First Contact (Star Trek VIII)\n3. The Motion Picture (Star Trek I)\n4. The Undiscovered Country (Star Trek VI)\n5. Star Trek (2009) (Star Trek XI)\n6. Into Darkness (Star Trek XII)\n7. The Voyage Home (Star Trek IV)\n8. The Search for Spock (Star Trek III)\n9. Nemesis (Star Trek X)\n10. Generations (Star Trek VII)\n11. Beyond (Star Trek XIII)\n12. The Final Frontier (Star Trek V)\n13. Insurrection (Star Trek IX)\n\n\n\n1)The Wrath of Khan\n\nNot only the best Star Trek film, but one of the best science-fiction films, full stop. Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n\u2019s Khan sets a benchmark for cinematic villains; the story hits every note you want from Star Trek and from SF in general, and the entire cast gets moments to shine. Also, it contains a GCI sequence (Genesis\u2026 no, not the band) that was far ahead of its time and still impresses even today.\n\n2) First Contact (VIII)\n\nThis one locks onto the Borg\u2014arguably TNG\u2019s most formidable enemy\u2014and frames the plot with a Terminator-like structure to tell the story of humanity\u2019s first contact. It deepens Data\u2019s character, introduces the Borg Queen as a new kind of menace, and uses its budget well: the action is sharper, and the effects (especially the CGI) finally feel \u201cbig screen\u201d and an even bigger surprise given how mediocre Generations (VII) was.\n\n3) The Motion Picture (I)\n\nThe plot twist is strong, but the real star is the Enterprise itself. It\u2019s easy to dismiss this film as slow until you remember what it was delivering: audiences raised on the original series had never truly seen the ship\u2014now they get extended, loving shots of the Enterprise simply doing what it was built to do. It\u2019s Star Trek luxuriating in the idea of the Starship, and for that generation, that was the point. Just look at how long the director (the very experienced Herbert Wise) spends on introducing our favorite Starship at the start of the film. For the rest of the film, the camera barely takes the lens away from it.\n\n4) The Undiscovered Country (VI)\n\nAt heart, it\u2019s a whodunnit, and that structure gives the characters room to move, investigate, argue, and act. It also clarifies who the film\u2019s emotional core really is\u2014especially in the Kirk\u2013McCoy dynamic, which gets more attention here than almost anywhere else. Christopher Plummer\u2019s General Chang makes a credible run at the \u201cgreat Star Trek villain\u201d standard. The one drawback is that some early CGI hasn\u2019t aged gracefully. It is better than you think it will be, and in a way, a great sendoff for the crew.\n\n5) Star Trek (2009) (XI)\n\nThe reboot nails the casting and gets a budget that allows it to be a genuine cinematic event. It\u2019s brisk, funny, tense, and relentlessly watchable. The more you think about how difficult this reboot could have been\u2014and how spectacularly it could have failed\u2014the more respect it earns. It made Star Trek feel like a mainstream blockbuster again, and it did it so convincingly that most people didn\u2019t care whether it was \u201cthe\u201d timeline or an alternate one. While the TV series still has the raw nostalgia going for it, the truth here is that Star Trek has never looked better. Those transporter effects say it all and are half the star of the show.\n\n6) Into Darkness (XII)\n\nIf there\u2019s a link between budget and box-office success in Star Trek, this is the exhibit: it looks expensive, and it plays that way. The pacing is tight, the set pieces are polished, and the plot keeps throwing turns. The big twist is that it\u2019s essentially a rework of the franchise\u2019s best story\u2014just altered enough to underline that this reboot alternative timeline is its own continuity. Cumberbatch covers a lot of ground in the role of the bad guy Kirk has to cooperate with. Still, it also exposes a fault line: the reboot series starts sliding toward action-first spectacle at the expense of the more philosophical SF tone Star Trek does best. The crew dynamics that made the reboot work so well are also here, and that is what we want.\n\n7) The Voyage Home (IV)\n\nThis film sells itself on one wonderfully simple pitch: the crew travels back in time to 1986 to save the future. It\u2019s warm, broadly comedic, and built around an eco-message, and it\u2019s undeniably fun. The trade-off is that it\u2019s lighter and less substantial than the films above it\u2014and the most significant absence is the Enterprise (at least in the way it should matter). The film distracts you from that gap with jokes and momentum. Worth noting: it\u2019s also a direct continuation of The Search for Spock, and it lands better when watched as the second half of that story. If you like your ST to be funny then you can put IV up there with the top four, but we don\u2019t really watch ST for the comedy. It just came as a pleasant and surprisingly viable bonus with IV.\n\n8) The Search for Spock (III)\n\nComing after Khan is an impossible assignment, so it\u2019s destined to feel smaller by comparison. Because of how Khan ends, Nimoy\u2019s presence is limited\u2014reused footage, then an impaired Spock for only a short stretch\u2014so \u201cthe search\u201d is for someone who isn\u2019t fully there yet. Even so, it\u2019s still an above-average SF adventure, and Christopher Lloyd clearly enjoys himself as Kruge, a Klingon villain with real bite. In fact, this might be the best of the Federation vs Klingon themes of them all. Like The Voyage Home, it\u2019s best treated as part of a two-film arc.\n\n9) Nemesis (X)\n\nThis tries to echo First Contact by giving Picard a strong opponent: a younger clone of himself (Tom Hardy), with the Remans, a slave species, as a bitter, weaponized underclass of the Romulans. It gives the TNG crew more space\u2014especially Data and Picard, and Riker and Troi\u2014and it functions as a kind of swan song after the crash and burn of Insurrection. It\u2019s not bad; it\u2019s just clearly designed for committed TNG fans more than general audiences, and it plays like a conclusion rather than a peak. The theme of identity and cloning is given a more than fair philosophical treatment.\n\n10) Generations (VII)\n\nA film with a perfect premise\u2014Kirk meets Picard\u2014that never quite goes to warp. The core story feels thin, the middle portion drags (including Guinan\u2019s advisory role and an unconvincing Klingon-sisters subplot), and Kirk\u2019s sendoff is nowhere near equal to the man\u2019s history. The holodeck sequence with the tall ship, plus the crew celebrating Worf\u2019s promotion, is a highlight\u2014unfortunately, it\u2019s the exception and only lasts for a few minutes near the start of the film. After that, it is all downhill. Malcolm McDowell, cast as Soran, the mad scientist, is never given much depth and ends up as the pantomime bad guy, which is a problem given the ST benchmark this role set.\n\n11) Beyond (XIII)\n\nOn paper, it has what it needs: cast, budget, momentum from the prior two entries. In practice, it often doesn\u2019t feel like Star Trek\u2014especially after the Enterprise is taken off the board early. The tone leans toward high-octane sci-fi action (at times closer to Riddick or Fast &amp; Furious in space), and while the spectacle is competent, little of it is memorable, and there is far too much clich\u00e9. Jaylah is the standout addition, and Idris Elba does what he can as Krall, but the ensemble chemistry feels diminished, and the result is simply average. Not even the excellent makeup effects or complex CGI can save it from being a mediocre ST movie. It might be a good SF movie, just not a good ST one, and that is what it needs to be. I wanted this movie to be better than VII or even X, but in the end, even those films left me thinking about some things, while I forgot this one as soon as the popcorn box hit the bin.\n\n12) The Final Frontier (V)\n\nThe concept is excellent: a godlike being imprisoned at the center of the galaxy (Sha Ka Ree / beyond the Great Barrier) uses faith and longing as bait to free itself. The problem is execution\u2014key explanations never land, the final act is bewildering, and the film feels like the product of major production trouble and heavy cutting. What survives is less a fully realized film than a salvage operation, and it stands out as one of the franchise\u2019s clearest \u201cwhat happened here?\u201d entries\u2014made more frustrating because the idea deserved better. I would not have understood this if I hadn\u2019t read Shatner\u2019s book, Movie Memories, many years ago. And yes, production did completely fall apart, which is a pity because it was Shatner\u2019s directorial debut. It is too late in the game to be learning production planning lessons.\n\n13) Insurrection (IX)\n\nIf you think it can\u2019t get worse, this is the contender. The most damaging issue is the look: the effects often appear unfinished, and that\u2019s close to fatal for a franchise that depends on convincing spectacle. Visual choices frequently feel off (including odd color dominance and sequences that look like they were staged for effects work that never fully materialized), and some shots appear inconsistently processed in a distracting way (wrong screen ratios are used, resulting in substantial squishing). Even strong performers (F. Murray Abraham) can\u2019t rescue it. The underlying premise\u2014rejuvenation, moral trade-offs\u2014could have supported a worthwhile Star Trek story. Still, it looks like several departments dropped the ball on whatever they were supposed to be doing, and not the sort of thing they want to put on their resumes going forward.",

I won't even look at the title before playing. Mostly mediocre films, Madame Webb being an exception in that it was absolutely horrible. \n\nPride and Prejudice being the exception in that it was phenomal. I'm a 25 year old male, I don't like romantic films, at least I don't think I did. I was apprehensive about watching it because when the title card came up and I seen what it was, I had heard it was a love story and just assumed it would be stereotypical. Glad I stuck with it. It doesn't force any stereotypes, it let's you sit with the characters and see the tension build up through their dialogue and physical body language. The scene where Elizabeth is looking at Mr D'Arcys statue after finding out he paid for the weddings is where I think we see her fall in love. I watched Cold Mountain yesterday and the romance in that was nowhere near the standard here, felt very forced and sudden. The only other romance film I've enjoyed as much, in fact I enjoyed a little more, was A Portrait of A Lady on Fire. They're both very similar and maybe that's the type of romantic film I need to lean into. Both I went in thinking \"ugh, another romance film, do I even want to watch it?\" Well, yes, I do. \n\nAnyone else who is put of by the idea of these films, just give them a try, they are truly remarkable.",
