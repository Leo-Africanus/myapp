In the same vein, I remember watching a scene from the Lion King remake and thinking Timon and Pumbaa were just so boring. Where was all of their signature flare? Especially Timon. In the cartoon that Meerkat just oozed charisma, and in the remake he felt super flat.\n\nCalling these performances phoned-in feels harsh, but I honestly don't know what else to call them. These entire movies feel phoned-in, and the worst part is that I know a lot of people worked really hard on them.\n\nI know a lot of these have writing and story differences (*ahem* Lilo and Stitch), but even with a shot-for-shot adaptation like HTTYD, it feels like the same movie, but worse.\n\nSomeone explain this to me.",

It\u2019s Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn being effortlessly charming in Paris, with a twisty mystery plot that somehow blends romance, suspense, and comedy without feeling forced.\n\n Hepburn is attempting to find her dead husbands lost money amongst spies and thieves. It\u2019s stylish as hell, funny, weirdly dark in places, and has some great character actors like Walter Matthau and James Coburn all pulling their weight.\n\n It's snappy, modern, and it's even in color! \n\nI\u2019m on here all the time and barely ever see it brought up, even on the classic film subs. Like how is Charade not in regular rotation for people who love Hitchcock-style thrillers or old Hollywood stuff? Is anyone else a fan? \n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/C6T2Q4XO7uA?si=WgRhVNO-KfNWH8bO\n\nHere is the full movie: https://youtu.be/-uc86VH8hdA?si=sSuJTK1EBjYUMKiz",

Like its predecessor, it's delightfully silly, but now we're in an era where those movies aren't made as often... and when someone tries, it's a 50/50 chance they land it. *Happy Gilmore 2* is a solid return to the kind of film that, honestly, there should be more of. Some jokes run too long, don\u2019t land, or could use another draft. It's a constant stream of cameos, which is overall fun but sometimes a little distracting. But, at its core, the sequel is a good-natured charmer about a troubled everyman who is trying hard to grow up without losing himself in the process, and it gives us a lot to laugh about on the way. What more can you ask for?\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/review-adam-sandlers-happy-gilmore-2-may-be-worst-sequel-of-all-time/)\n\n&gt;With all due respect to *Grown Ups 2*, *The Ridiculous 6*, and *Sandy Wexler*, *Happy Gilmore 2* is the bottom of the Sandler barrel\u2014a grim disaster that not only sullies the good name of its ancestor, but so badly flails on its own limited terms that it suggests the A-lister should concentrate on dramatic parts and leave the immature comedy to others.",

        "title": "Looking for an animated movie I saw over 15 years ago\u2014hand-drawn, talking animals, stormy factory prison escape",
        "content": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019ve been searching for this animated movie for over 15 years, and I\u2019m hoping someone here can help me out. I saw it on Boomerang when I was younger (so it must be from the late 90s to early 2000s) and I can only remember a few key scenes and details.\n\n* Animation Style: The movie was hand-drawn, similar to classic Disney films like Robin Hood, The Aristocats, or All Dogs Go to Heaven\u2014so it\u2019s that kind of aesthetic.\n\n* Main Characters: The movie features talking animals, one of which is an older, scruffy dog (possibly a stray) and another is a ginger-and-white cat. I think there were also some kittens involved in the escape.\n\n* Key Scenes:\n\n    1. There\u2019s a scene where the grey dog gets locked in a narrow, chimney-like prison cell made of stone bricks. The dark stormy clouds can be seen through the top, and the dog becomes angry (his eyes turn red as he gets enraged). He uses this anger to escape, jumping from wall to wall until he reaches the top.\n\n    2. Toward the end of the film, there\u2019s a shot of an army jeep driving away from a factory. The tarps on the back flap in the wind, and the ginger-and-white cat escapes with her kittens. The scene is stormy, with wind blowing the flaps back and revealing them.\n\n* Tone and Setting: The film wasn\u2019t focused solely on this prison\u2014it was just a part of the movie. The setting is more realistic with no magical elements. It\u2019s a modern-day environment, and there are no main human characters\u2014just the animals trying to escape.\n\n* What it\u2019s NOT:\n\n    * It\u2019s not \"Watership Down\", \"Balto\", or \"The Rescuers\"\u2014those movies have different animation styles or fantasy elements that don\u2019t match what I remember.\n\n    * This is also not Plague Dogs. The animation style is also different\u2014think more classic Disney-style (similar to Robin Hood, The Aristocats, etc.) rather than the darker, more realistic tone of Plague Dogs.\n\nI\u2019ve been searching for this movie for so long and haven\u2019t had any luck, so if anyone has any ideas, I\u2019d really appreciate it!\n",
