        "content": "I appreciate the 007 story and want to see good James Bond movies arrive.\n\nBut spying is not the same game it was in the 20th Century, and the stories we are getting are increasingly bizarre and implausible, and it just doesn\u2019t work to shoehorn 007 into the current year.\n\nSo let\u2019s bring 007 not only back to the beginning, but let\u2019s start him as a brand new British spy during World War II, behind the front lines. There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we\u2019re hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",

Am I overreacting?XD but it really has been a while since i watched such an amazing film ",

He enjoys the corporal punishment he inflicts on the students. \n\nAs the movie nears the end... something happens where McCarthy finally fights back from the abuse and it's such a moment, such a rush for me I've never forgotten that feeling.

Mark Wahlberg, Zoey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and I was surprised to see Alan Ruck and Jeremy Strong too. \n\nThe actors are soooo good but the dialogue is SO bad that it makes them all look like it\u2019s their first time performing. And the story line is like\u2026 idk definitely interesting enough to keep you watching. It\u2019s really my favorite combo. \n\nI find it hilarious that they keep some things out of view of the audience (people shooting themselves in the head) then 10 minutes later show a man voluntarily feeding his own arm to a lion. The direction is absolutely insane. \n\nWell worth a rewatch imo if you haven\u2019t seen it in a while and are looking for something entertaining. ",

And it's fucking awesome. Yes, it's a B-movie, but it kicks ass. Much like Jables and KG did the devil.\n\nThe movies follows JB and KG as they try to find the Pick of Destiny, \n\n*The Devil thought he had us, he brought his A-game,\nBut we had something stronger\u2014our rock 'n' roll flame!\nHe summoned fire, thunder, and rage,\nBut we stood tall, we were locked in a cage - and fuck you, the devil's defeated!*\n\nand end up fighting the Devil with their rock. \n\n\n(I really tried to make this post like the lyrics in the movie but I really suck at lyrics so forgive me. I didn't even learn the powerslide)",

        "title": "1408 has two endings, and only one of them is good (Spoilers)",
        "content": "I've seen plenty of people talk about how much they prefer the \"Mike survives\" ending, and having seen this movie in full over a dozen times, I could not disagree more strongly. \n\nFor the purpose of simplicity, I will refer to the ending where Mike Enslin dies as the \"death ending\". \n\nHere are two of the most common reasons to prefer the survival ending, with which I disagree on a fundamental level: \n\n       After decades of killing people, Mike Enslin deserves to be the one person who finally beats the Room. \n\nMike Enslin *did* beat the Room. In the death ending, the Room has been destroyed. It cannot harm anyone ever again. And more than that, he lasted long enough to turn down the multitudinous opportunities to throw himself out the window, slash his own throat, drown in soup, or kill himself in any number of gruesome ways that every previous resident did. He made it farther than anyone else did, and he destroyed the Room. I fail to see how that's not a total win, whether Mike himself survives the process or not.\n\n       \"Guy learns from his mistakes and gives his life for the greater good\" trope is overdone. \n\nExcept this didn't happen. This is a mischaracterization of what actually happened in the death ending. Mike didn't destroy the Room to save people from his fate. He destroyed it to spite the Room itself. To show that It couldn't beat him. The fact that his spirit still lingers over the ashes proves this. Mike Enslin is stuck in the torment of the Room, even as the Room loses all of its power over others. He wasn't doing it to save other people, he wasn't even doing it to save himself. He was doing it because, quite literally, fuck you. Fuck you for making me go through this torment, fuck you with all your mumbo jumbo supernatural bullshit. Fuck. You. \n\nMike Enslin never jumped out of the window, never slit his own throat, never drowned in his chicken soup. Mike Enslin fought to the end, to the death. He kept himself, even if it meant being trapped in a state of existence between life and death for all time. \n\nI don't think people realize just how bleak the death ending is for Mike Enslin. \n\nAnd that's how it should be. Mike may have defeated the room, but it cost him. It cost him much more than his life - it cost him his soul, and it wasn't some noble sacrifice for the greater good. It was kill or be killed.\n\n\"Never kill what you can't eat.\" 1408 is dead, and so is Mike Enslin. \n\nNow, was the way they handled the death ending kinda cringe? Yeah, it was kinda cringe. I think we all could've done without car-mirror jump scare. But on substance, this is the ending I prefer, and I'll die on this hill.",
