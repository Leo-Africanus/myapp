Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

        "title": "Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.",
        "content": "Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.\n\nThe movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. \n\nI'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.\n\nThis movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. \n\nThe action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.\n\nAmy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.\n \nThere's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. &gt;!The public sex scene!&lt;. This scene kind of has a &gt;!rapey!&lt; moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.\n\nI feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.\n\nEdit: &gt;!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!&lt;",

I also liked the end and how subversive it was. So I was pretty surprised to see that the entire Internet seems to agree it's the worst thing since unsliced bread. I've read the complaints and I must agree, people who have seen the first two movies don't wonder if it's all real because they know they really have powers, and fans of the trilogy just find the end underwhelming. So, in a way, the best way to enjoy this movie is to either watch it before the other two, or to not watch them. Does anyone else feel this way?",

I just wanted to say that, regardless of who you side with in the movie (I found myself either agreeing with both in different situations, or at least empathizing with each character in instances where I disagreed), what hit me the most was the CIVIL discourse that occurred.  The both LISTENED to each other.  Neither was interrupting the other.  No personal attacks.  No talking over each other.  Nothing like \"I'm right and you're wrong\".\n\nWhen I think of discussions that I've had in real life, it usually ends up the opposite.  Friends constantly interrupting each other and being dismissive of each others' opinions.  And personal attacks galore!\n\nNow I know this is just a movie, and it's possible that situations like this movie possibly occur in real life, but I just don't think it's common.\n\n  \nI will add that I was very much surprised that Troma Inc was involved in the production of this movie.  I LOVE Troma movies, and I always associated them with the awesome B-horror flicks.  So that was probably the biggest surprise.",

        "content": "Sometimes when you first watch a movie, the protagonist(s) are so front and center that while you realize the supporting characters are good, you don't realize how important they are to the quality of the film. This can be because they have less screen time or they play a villain. But after watching it several times, you start to realize that you prefer the supporting character's part even more than the protagonist, at least in terms of several watches, because the characters are more rich and meaningful than first realized.\n\nIt just dawned on me recently rewatching Forrest Gump that as much as I love Gump's journey, I now find Lieutenant Dan's to be my favorite character arc.\n\nWhat are some movies where the supporting actor(s) with less screen time have wound up being perhaps your favorite chacracter arc of a great movie. Here are some examples so far imo:\n\nThe Dark Knight: Harvey Dent/Aaron Eckhart\n\nForrest Gump: Lietenant Dan/Gary Sinise\n\nJaws: Quint/Robert Shaw\n\nGladiator: Commodus/Joaquin Phoenix",

        "content": "There was a movie that my kids and I watched when they were younger between 2015-2018. It was on Netflix\u2014 I highly believe it was an international animated film\u2014 the plot is: a group of children from other countries visit the United States to warn about the dangers of technology and how it\u2019s harming the world. One of the kids has a special connection with nature and animals, able to communicate with them. They try to convey a message about how the world is being hurt by technology, with a key focus on a tree that symbolizes nature\u2019s power and connection to the world. The kids had Southeast Asian traditional golden necklaces that stacks up to make their neck look longer\u2014They also met this boy from America who had father in the government and they were trying to warn him about technology.  Eventually the technology was taking over the planet and the special kid was able to communicate with this tree to tell others to unplug everything to help earth heal.  \n\nI hope someone knows what I\u2019m talking about!!!  I have tried to Google it but I couldn\u2019t find it. ",

Like yeah it's definitely not a movie for everyone but it's so good and I'd expect somewhat of a fanbase. I just can't understand how this movie doesn't just feel like home to someone else at all. Do most people just think it's bad? Because if that's the case I feel like they just don't understand it.\nNot only is the story is an amazing critique of capitalism and monopolies controlling and destroying your life, but also it just has this nostalgic feel to it that makes you feel like you understand it all.",

        "content": "I\u2019m going to put a spoiler tag just in case. \n\nThe Watchers is far from a perfect movie. It\u2019s flawed and has some serious issues. I just see so many people hating on it when I feel like it wasn\u2019t that bad and doesn\u2019t warrant so much hate so I\u2019m going to attempt to defend the watchers. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d probably watch it again if it came to streaming. But I\u2019d just stop at when they get rescued. For me, it\u2019s a perfect movie up until that point. This may be my personal preference but I\u2019m able to just disconnect and suspense disbelief if I like the movie enough. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of errors or details that I was able to ignore. \n\nI was on the edge of my seat for the first half, the coop part. It was full of suspense. I liked the setting too. The isolation of the woods and the small square of the coop, added to the suspense and the dread. It all felt very atmospheric. The monsters were unique too. I forgot what I read but accidentally read an article that said the monsters were fairies and was immediately turned off for a little bit. Them being fairies just made me roll my eyes. I love monsters but not fairies lol. They can\u2019t be scary lol. But these fairies were scary and I loved it. The monster design was cool as well, so creepy and unsettling. I liked the folklore and history of the fairies as well. I wanted to solve all the mysteries of the story. \n\nFor me, in the second half, it all fell apart. I hated what happened when they escaped. Also if you think that death as they were escaping is stupid like I do. Blame the book. It came from there. It felt like two different movies to movie. When they escaped, it felt like a whole different movie. Also the professor office still being there? Lol. I get that it\u2019s prettier cinematically for her to look through his office but c\u2019mon. I couldn\u2019t suspense my disbelief on that one. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot wrong with it for sure, but it\u2019s still overall an entertaining, suspenseful, and unique movie. I think people are too hard on it sometimes. The trailer was killer too. \n\nI\u2019m fragile so please don\u2019t tear me apart too badly in the comments. Trust me, i know it\u2019s not perfect and there\u2019s millions of better movies. For a first time director, based on a book, it\u2019s a pretty good movie. \n",
