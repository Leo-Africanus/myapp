        "content": "I just finished Amadeus and while F. Murray Abraham is phenomenal and totally deserving, I kind of feel like Tom Hulce had the harder role and maybe got snubbed. That performance is such a unique one. The laugh, the immaturity, the arrogance, it could\u2019ve been unbearable if he was even slightly off, but instead it made me want to keep watching. And then the Requiem scene is just unreal. Abraham anchors the film, but Hulce had to make chaotic genius believable, which feels harder as an acting challenge. I get why Abraham won, but part of me thinks Hulce pulled off something risky as fuck and doesn\u2019t get enough credit.",
