But somehow, no matter how many times I see this movie, I never get tired of it. The scene where Steven Strait javelins the Pharaoh and shouts \"He is not a god!\" is one of my favourite movie scenes ever. Also, the music is awesome, the filming locations are gorgeous, and the miniature pyramid models used in production are fantastic. So despite the story being illogical and stupid, and the historiography being absolutely batshit, 10,000 BC will always be one of my guilty pleasures.",

I am talking about actors that you have somehow essentially avoided everything they've ever been in.

I hear he is amazing, but somehow none of his movies have found there way to me, nor have I cared to seek them out.  So I would have to watch one of his movies for the sole purpose to see Daniel Day Lewis.  Which I am open to but just haven't gotten around to it.  How bout you?",

        "content": "Ted Sarandos (Netflix CEO) recently gave an interview where he re-iterated how the theatrical model was outdated. So I thought I'd ask a sub of movie lovers. How many of you still enjoy going to the movies? Personally I still go when there's something that really peaks my interest. But current ticket prices have made me a lot more selective and obviously I tend to favor the big movies where the theatrical set up really shines vs the samller films that you can enjoy at home without missing much in terms of bigger screen and super duper sound set up. But, I do agree with the aspect that streaming has \"democratized\" the movie viewing experience. Not everyone lives close to a movie theater and not everyone has the time to go to one. Being able to press play and just enjoy is a huge plus. Also, home set ups are becoming more advanced. Some OLED and Mini LED tvs are out of this world in terms of quality and you can get a great sound system too. So I guess I'm 50/50 on this. What do you guys think?",

        "content": "So today, I took a nostalgic journey back to my childhood. Revenge of the Sith was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw in theaters, and I still carry some memories with me from that experience. I still remember reacting to the opening aerial battle over Coruscant, and I was so loud that my then-best friend who was sitting beside me had to lean over to me and tell me, \u201cDude, be quiet.\u201d \u00a0I also remember after the car ride home, my grandmother, who has since passed away, called my cousin, my friend and I all \u201clittle Skywalker\u2019s.\u201d\n\nToday, I took my dad to see the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith. He's the one I showed scenes to from all the Star Wars movies as a kid over and over and over, and he was the main one I had lightsaber fights with as a kid. He gave me new memories that I can carry with me from this theater experience. He always mimics Windu's face when he is lightsaber locked with Palpatine about mid-fight, he mouthed, \u201cDarth\u2026.Vader\u201d as Palpatine names him, and I noticed he side-eyed me when Anakin ignites his lightsaber in front of the Younglings.\n\nNow I have memories of old and new, and I had a very entertaining experience revisiting 2005 in 2025.",
