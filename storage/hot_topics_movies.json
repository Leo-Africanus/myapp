The Monkey - Theo James playing twins Hal and Bill\n2. Sinners - Michael B. Jordan playing twins Smoke and Stacks\n3. Superman - David Corensweet playing Superman and Ultraman, a Lex Luthor controlled clone of Superman\n4. Predator: Badlands - Elle Fanning plays Thia and Tessa, two Weyland Yutani synthetics.\n\nI always enjoy it when I spot these weird commonalities between movies in a given year. Like how in 2016 there were 3 films where Idris Elba voiced an animal (Zootropolis, Finding Dory and Jungle Book).\nOr how in 2017 there are TWO movies that star Channing Tatum where someone singing Take Me Home, Country Roads is a key scene (Logan Lucky and Kingsman: The Golden Circle) \n\nAre there any strange recurring elements among films in a given year that you've noticed?",

Doesn't matter genre, doesn't matter if they're critically acclaimed or if they made a gazillion dollars or not\n\nIf you like it I'll watch it. \n\n",

Highly recommend.",

Before we begin, just a few clarifications from years past:\n\n* I do view myself as a \"typical moviegoer\" and don't see myself as a cinephile at all. I know I go a lot, but I go through the lens of just wanted to do something fun, I don't really care to judge a movie on its artistic merit.\n* My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours, which can be limiting - Also, in 2025 she started traveling more for work, and while I like to go to the movies alone, I also prefer to do other things while she's gone \\[typical hobby stuff that she doesn't enjoy partaking in\\]. So there are a lot of movies that we do miss that we did want to see. We caught a few of those at home, but they're not included in this list.\n* There are a lot of movies we'd like to see but don't get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we're very busy and don't get to the theater for a few weeks.\n* This list does include movies from 2024 that I either saw at the beginning of 2025, or we saw in 2024 after releasing my list last year.\n* Everyone asks me every year, I do have a letterboxd, its \"egnards,\" but its one of those things that I update for 1-2 months at the beginning of the year and than just forget about it.\n\n**A Quick Note on Categories:**\n\nOther than \"Favorite of the Year\" I don't particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite. There are movies in the \"Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again\" category that I liked better than movies in the \"Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again\" category, but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings.\n\nPeople tend to get caught up in the categories in assuming that I'm ranking a particular movie over another particular movie - The reality is that there are many movies that I love, but dont feel a need to rewatch, and there are many movies that are mediocre that I find to have a lot of replay value.\n\nAlso, I specifically write all of the blurbs at the end of the year, with the purpose being that I want to focus on the resonant feeling a movie gave me, and less on rehashing the plot of a movie you've probably seen already.\n\n# Favorite of the Year [Ranked in Order]\n\n* **Eternity:** I thought I was going to go the whole year without having a really strong standout for a favorite movie, but I just really enjoyed this one so damn much. It feels a little long in the final act, but other than that it's a very cute story.\n* **Good Fortune:** I wanted to see this because the trailers reminded me of a Dogma vibe but I went in kind of expecting the best parts of the movie to be in the trailer. Overall I think it was very well done and threaded the line of \"serious message, but very funny delivery\" very nicely.\n* **F1 The Movie:** I mostly dislike sports, and I've never watched a race in my life, but in the last few years I've been a sucker for racing movies. F1 is very well done for a movie that I didn't even anticipate staying awake during.\n* **The Amateur:** I love a good spy thriller - Mission Impossible was one of my favorite movies for feel less like an action movie, and more like a CIA spy thriller. I stopped watching Mission Impossible movies as they got more and more grandiose. . .This felt a lot like the original Mission Impossible and it made me happy.\n\n# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again\n\n* **The Naked Gun:** I have always liked this style of parody humor. It's not something I'm going to watch often, but my wife and I have already rewatched it at least once after a few drinks and a gummy. I'd like to see a return of this style in short spurts every year.\n* **Novocaine:** Look, the movie is dumb. But it knows what it is, and it stays true to exactly what it is. It's just turn your brain off dumb comedy/action, and I am ok with that.\n* **Final Destination Bloodlines:** I gave up on Final Destination after the third one, and yes that log truck from the second one will always be a core memory, but this one has breathed enough new life into the franchise that if they make another I'd go see it.\n* **Death of a Unicorn:** It's not a perfect movie by any means, and it loses itself in its own absurdity at times, but it had a fun black comedy/horror feel that I liked.\n* **One of Them Days:** It's a stupid romp comedy that benefits from sneaking a few beers into the movie, but that's ok and I hope they make another one.\n* **Sinners:**  It's a very good movie, though feels long at parts. My one frustration of which is that these types of movies always come down to \"that one character did that one thing they were specifically warned that they absolutely under no circumstances should do.\"\n\n# Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected\n\n* **Lilo &amp; Stitch:** Often with live action remakes I feel that the best I can hope for is not hating it. I found Lilo and Stitch to be cute and enjoyed the journey. People get caught up in trying to relive a movie as a shot for shot remake, but in that case. . What even is the point?\n* **Freakier Friday:** The original is a classic. The Lindsay Lohan version is also a classic. I didn't expect much going into a \"20 years later\" sequel, as I've been burned so many times recently, but it was a fun romp that I'd probably watch again if I needed a turn off my brain movie.\n* **Jurassic World Rebirth:** I have kind of hated the last 3 Jurassic Park movies for taking us into more \"Action Movies that Dinosaurs exist within\" so didn't have high expectations. I wouldn't say it's a great movie, but it felt far more like Jurassic Park to me and I was pleasantly surprised.\n* **Karate Kid: Legends:** I went in with pretty low expectations. Everyone else I know that grew up on Karate Kid kind of disliked it, but I enjoyed it. I think it has a bunch of pacing issues with training montages and having be believe that this tournament was happening across multiple venues in a very short amount of time. But if you just lose yourself in the stupidity of 80s style stupidity it's fun.\n* **Thunderbolts\\*:**  I found the Black Widow movie to be forgettable so I had the lowest of hopes for Thunderbolts\\* but really enjoyed it for what it was.\n* **Mickey 17:**  My wife is the Robert Pattinson fan and I probably wouldn't have seen this otherwise, but I really liked it. Though it's one of those movies that does feel like it kind of gets lost in its own conclusion and could end 15-20 minutes early without losing much, if any, plot.\n* **Now You See Me: Now You Dont:** The franchise overall isn't for me, my wife always liked them. But overall I enjoyed this one, even if it's just a \"look at this magic trick I can do\" porn duel between characters at times.\n* **Roofman:** Didn't really know what to expect from the trailers but I thought it was a cute movie with a lot of heart.\n* **Superman:**  I haven't enjoyed many of the DC Comics movies that have come out and I'm honestly so beyond tired of Superman reboots, but the trailer being very \"camp\" heavy made me optimistic. It's not amazing by any means, but I feel this lighter comic book tone really works, and hope that DC remains consistent with this.\n\n# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again\n\n* **Presence:** I really enjoyed this because it felt new and different - Its the first time I've seen something from this perspective. It's not particularly scary, but I feel like it's one of those \"one and done\" journeys that doesn't need to be revisited.\n* **A Minecraft Movie:** Its a silly/stupid video game movie, and I think it was done well. One thing I noticed with Minecraft \\[and a lot of these kids movies in the last few years\\] is that it doesn't give scenes any time to breath. It's just one fast packed action sequence after each other and probably could have benefited from a slower narrative driven scene inserted in a few places - This is, I think, just the culture of kids movies these days.\n* **The Long Walk:** Not much to say here - I think for a movie that basically fully takes place while walking across the country that it's pretty damn well done, just don't feel any need to ever have a repeat viewing.\n* **The Housemaid:** The whole movie I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd read the book, and kind of new what was going to happen. Turns out there is *another* similar book \\[The Last Mrs. Parish\\] that I read with my wife during Covid which is essentially the same story. All that said, I think overall it was pretty well done.\n* **Paddington in Peru:** In my opinion it's the weakest of the 3 Paddington movies, with the other two being near perfect. It's still a perfectly good movie that had me tearing at the end.\n* **A Complete Unknown:** We saw a captioned showing with my in-laws, which seems to be how we go to all of the music biopics. I'm not much of music person myself, but I didn't find myself bored, even if it felt like I was just watching vignettes.\n* **Drop:** I am fully a sucker for thriller movies that take place in a very confined space.\n* **28 Years Later:** My wife had never seen the other 2, so I got to watch all 3 in pretty quick succession. Overall I enjoyed it, but I'm also a bit hesitant about the series going forward. I'll remain cautiously optimistic of The Bone Temple though I feel like the \"zombies are this new species now\" plot line is a line that can be very difficult to pull off long term.\n* **Weapons:**  It's fine, but I was really hoping for more of a grounded horror thriller and less of a supernatural \"weird creepy clown witch doctor\" lady kind of horror thriller. I knew it had to have some supernatural threads, but it went further than I wanted it to.\n* **Last Breath:** Like Drop, I just really like thriller movies that take place in very confined environments. I also *hate* water when it comes to video games, and will 100% walk away if a game features an extended water area with enemies. This movie was anxiety inducing the entire runtime, and I'm ok with it.\n* **The Smashing Machine:** The Smashing Machine gets very long at times and by the end I really was waiting for the conclusion, but overall, as someone who grew up in the early era of UFC, I think it was a story told in a really entertaining way \\[whether it was accurate or not\\].\n* **Caught Stealing:** It's a perfectly fine one viewing movie but for a very short movie it jumps around to different scenes so often that it felt like so much longer - Also, I'm just not buying that this \"average joe\" kind of guy would go through the amount of abuse he went through and \"just run away\" as often as he was able to.\n\n# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be\n\n* **How to Train Your Dragon:** My wife had never seen the original so we watched it a few days before going to see the live action version. It's not a bad movie, but it definitely falls into the \"shot for shot remake\" category and offers nothing new. . .Which makes it feel very long and not very engaging when you've watched it pretty recently.\n* **Eddington:** I really enjoyed the first half but the second half totally lost me. I felt the covid era small town story was interesting and made for a good movie. . As the scale kept increasing I gave less and less shits about what was going on.\n* **Nosferatu:** I know I'm going to get grilled for this one - My wife loved it and will probably have it ranked as one of her top movies seen - I found it to be long and full of itself. Honestly I think I could say that about most of the Robert Eggers movies I've seen.\n* **Mufasa:** I didn't hate the movie, but I really didn't enjoy the soundtrack at all. I work in 5th grade and one of the girls in my class said it best to be pretty recently. . .\"how did Lin Manuel Miranda come up with THAT?\"\n* **Friendship:**  You either like Tim Robinson, or you dont get Tim Robinson - I happen to like Tim Robinson, but I feel like a lot of Friendship sort of just gets lost in itself and forgets that it's not 12 little sketches stitched together, and is supposed to be a full movie.\n* **Wicked: For Good:** The problem with Wicked: For Good is the same problem that the Wicked Musical has, in that the second half of the play is significantly weaker than the first half of the play. That is to say that I think that this is far more enjoyable than post-intermission Wicked.\n* **Captain America: Brave New World:**  I don't even really know what I was expecting from the new Captain America. I have enjoyed the Marvel Movies overall less and less lately, but it's not a terrible one - I wish the trailers didn't basically give the entire movie away. . .But what can you do?\n* **I know What You Did Last Summer:** It's exactly what I expected it to be. That's it.\n* **Materialists:** Mostly forgettable. I just didn't feel like there was enough buy-in on the characters for me to give a shit about what was going on.\n* **The Strangers - Chapter 2:** It's fine. We skipped the first reimagining when it came out in theaters because we heard it was terrible, though did end up watching it at home right before going to see Chapter 2. I think it walks this line of \"am I losing the scare factor when you give too much context to these characters?\" and I'm not entirely sure if it crosses it yet.\n* **Wolf Man:** The trailers make it feel like a unique movie, but I just didn't feel like Wolf Man did very much to allow it to stand out, and told an interesting story in a not so interesting way.\n* **Fight or Flight:** Bullet Train 2: This Time on a Plane - There ya go, that's the movie.\n* **Heart Eyes:** I kind of like these holiday horror romps that have been happening in the last few years, but this one was a bit of a miss for me and too on the nose.\n\n# Expected More and Left Disappointed\n\n* **Zootopia 2:** I need to stipulate this by saying that the movie looks to be a really solid kids movie, and I think I'm being mildly unfair in my personal taste here. I loved the original, but I think the novelty of what Zootopia is has worn off for me, and that the newer movie didn't do enough to keep me engaged as an adult audience member - Even if I don't think they necessarily have to do that.\n* **The Monkey:** Being based on a short story I feel like The Monkey kind of just gets lost in itself and doesn't do enough to buy me into the fact that this monkey exists. It just gets more and more over the top without allowing me to feel like I have earned the suspension of disbelief that it's asking me to have.\n* **Babygirl:** I think that Babygirl could have been so much more than it was, and it sort of forgets to allow me to buy into any of the relationships in the movie. They kind of \"just happen\" for no other reason than to move the narrative along. I love me some Nicole Kidman but I found myself checking the time often hoping for it to be over.\n* **Black Phone 2:** Black Phone 2 isn't terrible but I think it's a significant downgrade from Black Phone and goes a little *too far* into trying to be the new age Nightmare on Elm Street.\n* **Honey Don't!:** It's fine. . .I guess? I just didn't think Aubrey Plaza worked very well as a villain. It became one of those \"i'm just going to guess that the bad guy is Aubrey Plaza, because it makes no sense, but they'll do it because nobody will ever see it coming.\"\n* **Fantastic Four: First Steps:**  I really enjoyed the hyper \"post-modern 1960s/70s\" esthetic of the trailers and had high hopes. And while I didn't hate watching it, I just don't think it did anything special for being the flagship property that so many Marvel fans have been waiting for for so many years \\[the return of FF to Marvel/Disney\\].\n\n# Didn't Expect Much, and Got What I Expected\n\n* **M3GAN 2.0:** I liked the original a lot, but the trailer for this one kind of showed me they were trying to transcend genres and they flew too close to the sun on being self aware. The line, \"hold onto your vaginas\" will live rent free in my head forever as I had to sit through that trailer about 20 times, and it's practically my only memory of the whole thing.\n* **Hell of a Summer:** The entire thing is forgettable and when looking through my ticket stubs on the AMC app I needed to google it to even remind myself of what it was even about.\n\n# Worst of the Year\n\n* **Die My Love**: I had never walked out of a movie before seeing Die My Love. About 45 minutes in my wife and I saw another couple get up and leave, we both looked at each other and kind of whispered, \"oh right, we don't have to stay,\" and left. Honestly the parts we did watch felt like the kind of college art student film that nobody likes but the filmmaker thinks is the most brilliant thing in the world.\n* **Five Nights at Freddy's 2:** I've never played the games but enjoyed the first one as a silly horror romp. I was warned before hand that this one was bad, but also assured that if I enjoyed the first I'd probably still like this one - To the Redditor that told me that? I hate you forever.\n\n**Note:**\u00a0At roughly $25/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5.50/ticket to see each movie. We often do get popcorn so the new Popcorn Pass is attractive, unfortunately I've committed to cutting down on my popcorn intake this year. . .Right in the nick of time obviously.\n\n**Note 2:** Normally I post this list at the end of December but AMC was bugging out on their app and not allowing me to see all my ticket stubs - I actually didn't even expect to do a list this year because of it, but thankfully they got their act together and fixed the issue!",
