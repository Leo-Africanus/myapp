        "content": "#[Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) if you want to just nab one and skip the wall of text.\n\n---\n\nAlright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen during the ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1itlqyx/oscar_bingo_xii_submission_thread/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- If you win just be sure to yell \"BINGO\" really loud wherever you are. And if you wanna post your gamecard to the game thread that would be fine too.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

        "content": "I'm an avid movie/tv junky and have been since my teen years in the 80's'.\n\nThere are a number of films that i rewatch, usually about once a year, and a few weeks ago I watched\u00a0**Wind River**\u00a0(2017) and it still impresses me as such a great film. I was thinking about other films and tv shows that have intense scenes like the flanking scene, and came up with a few. I'm posting to see what ya'll can add to my small list so far.\n\n**13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi**\u00a0(2016)  \n\\- I'm watching this right now and the movie manages to maintain such intensity throughout, i just love it.\n\n**Sicario**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The border crossing scene is so great.\n\n**Heat**\u00a0(1995)  \n\\- I haven't rewatched in a while, but i do remember the big shoot-out scene as being pretty intense. It's time for a rewatch i think.\n\n**Bone Tomahawk**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- I don't want to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it, but my recommendation if you have not is to go in blind and not read anything about it. It's just a great film.\n\n**The Revenant**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The bear attack is pretty riveting. The entire movie is pretty intense and a bit depressing, but i do like that there is a bit of justice in the end.\n\n**Saving Private Ryan**\u00a0(1998)  \n\\- The Knife kill scene is etched in my memory for all time.\n\nI will also mention\u00a0**Black Hawk Down**\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0**Band of Brothers**\u00a0(2001) which both have many such scenes, too many to list here. Also time for a rewatch i thinks.",

I recommend the first if you want to be on the edge of your seat for 3 hours! \n\nOther missing details: \n\n\n&gt;!Balian and his wife lost a baby in the beginning, she killed herself because of it, Balian was placed in custody for madness in his grief. He burned the baby\u2019s unfinished shirt she had been sewing before killing his brother in a rage. This shows why he felt he had nothing left and went on the crusade. Also, Balian had other family in the crusades, including his uncles! His father\u2019s backstory is further discussed and there is an entire plot about Sybilla and her son being king Baldwin that is left out!&lt;",

        "content": "I just finished watching Deepwater Horizon, which is generally fine, but one thing I really appreciated was the way it found to explain what was happening on Deepwater Horizon and what Marky Mark's company did, thus allowing the rest of the movie to be a lot easier to understand from both a technical and political perspective. Basically, an early scene has Marky Mark's young daughter practicing her speech for class on what her Dad does, with a Coke can as a demonstration. \n\nThat got me wondering, in an era where so many movies seem to just plunk two characters down and have them talk about things that they are both already aware of solely for the audience's benefit (\"Wow, I can't believe it's been 5 years since you had that car accident where you lost your young son named Michael, after which your wife left you because she couldn't process her grief, and you moved back in with your estranged father....\"), do you have any other examples where a movie found an elegant or effective way to deliver some complicated backstory or foundational knowledge required to understand the specifics of the story?",

I think she really channels the vibe of the animation and brought Motoko to life. despite not being Japanese. You can tell she did her homework on the character and it wasn't just an easy paycheck\n\nI'd say her biggest sin was being too big. she quickly became the female face of Hollywood, especially as an action star, aside from Black Widow I think Lucy came out before this and was critically panned. It also doesn't help that this movie wasn't great and didn't live up to the astronomical standards set by the anime. However, Scarjo did live up to it. I'll stand by that.",

        "content": "Perfect movie for a day off. Just sit back and let the score and the hard dialogue wash over you. I\u2019m always wondering what people watch when they reminisce about this era, especially if you saw it in theaters. It really helps if it has one of those strong, thumping music scores that you can recognize from the next room through the walls and that draw you in\u2026.",

        "content": "Just watched the movie Flow with my toddler, who immediately insisted we started it over again. We loved it. Such a beautiful film. \n\nThe post-human world filled me with such existential dread though, thinking that all our climate inaction will lead us to a post-human water world. I might personally be scarred from watching Water World at too young an age when it came out, I had nightmares about it.\n\nIs anyone else hung up on the when / why of the Flow world? One person mentioned that another planet close to earth would cause the severity of the gravitational pull of the water, a cycle of flood. Does anyone have any insight to the directors intentions? ",

        "content": "Also we all know her from the 80s with big hits like Red Dawn, Ferris Bueller and Dirty Dancing which she had a great fame. But you all are forgetting something she did do some films after Dirty Dancing like Gandahar in a English version and it was renamed Light years was an animated film and Bloodhounds of Broadway 1989 film with Madonna. Then in 1990 she did do a TV movie I just mentioned on the title and she did made a comeback in the Hollywood films in 1992 called Wind and during the making of the film she had a second nose job afterwards she became unrecognisable and in 1993 she did do a TV movie called A Case for Murder and she came in 1995 doing a guest role in a classic sitcom show Friends. So what do you think about the TV movie she did in 1990, 1991 and 1993 are they forgotten or remembered and do you recognise her nose differences in them well any suggestions.",

A group of kids, maybe all boys, build or fix up some type of clubhouse, treehouse or the like.\n\nThere's a taxidermied moose or similar on the wall. Somehow when triggered, a can of cola shoots out of its mouth and to one of the kids.\n\nIt's been decades since I saw this, and can't find the title. Perhaps someone else remembers it? It was almost certainly a kids' film from the USA, probably 1990s. Can anyone help?\n\nIf anyone can remember it, please also tell me what you think of it! I am gonna watch it as soon as I learn the title.",

        "content": "My wife and I noticed a particularly specific trope while watching Despicable Me 4 tonight. An old man with a dog is sitting in front of a remote gas station when an extraordinary vehicle (space ship, high tech car, huge bus, etc.) arrives. A regular person exits the vehicle to do normal gas station things while the old man stares in stunned silence and the dog usually runs to hide. It\u2019s not the creepy gas attendant trope. It\u2019s always done as a comedic moment. We were wondering where this trope started from. If this isn\u2019t the place to ask, would you please point me in the right direction? I tried tvtropes but all I got from there is the creepy gas attendant trope.\n\nEdit: I really appreciate all the helpful responses. Unfortunately I can\u2019t seem to google up any of the suggestions even after trying to reword or combine them.",
