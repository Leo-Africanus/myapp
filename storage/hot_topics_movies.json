The Long Walk hits theaters on September 12. Ask me anything about the book or movie. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8)\n\n&gt;In a dystopian United States ruled by a totalitarian regime, a group of young men enter an annual walking contest in which they must maintain a speed of at least three miles per hour or risk execution. The contest ends when only one walker remains alive.\n\nIt stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Ben Wang, Charlie Plummer, Roman Griffin Davis, Garrett Wareing, Joshua Odjick, Tut Nyuot, Mark Hamill, Judy Greer, and Josh Hamilton. \n\nI'll be back on Wednesday 8/27 at 12:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\n",

I know there was a novel, but Jesus, how did he channel this character and his destruction so perfectly. \n\nWas watching videos of Tarantino talking about this movie and his love and respect for it. Watched this scene with fresh eyes and it just reminds me of the few but deranged narcissists I've had in my life. \n\nPerfect scene of a narcissist in full abuse mode.\n\nAlso, the end of that scene where Daniel is fatherly, and they have a close relationship is what makes a relationship with a malignant narcissist so painful. \n\nThere were good times. There were great times. But the narcissists are programmed to discard, and those in their wrath and path are made to feel like actual garbage that can be thrown away. \n\nIts confusing. Lewis just nails it",

The whole concept of the movie is incredible and feels more relevant now than it did back then.\n\nBut it's that final moment that always hits me. He doesn't have a big angry speech. He just smiles and says \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" and then takes a bow and leaves.\n\nThere's just something so hopeful and terrifying and brilliant about it. It\u2019s one of those scenes that\u2019s just permanently burned into my brain.\n\nWhat are some other movie endings or single scenes that have that effect on you?

        "content": "As in: films that contained two actors who you would never imagine working together\n\nFor example, Red Heat starring Jim Belushi and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even for the 80s that does not sound like a real movie.\n\nAnother buddy cop comedy: 2002\u2019s Bad Company with Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins. If someone told me that an actor from Grown Ups stared alongside the star of Hannibal. \n\nOf course there\u2019s the late Gene Hackman\u2019s final film, Welcome to Mooseport. Staring Hackman with\u2026Ray Romano? What?\n\nAlso seeing Margaret Qualley in Happy Gilmore 2 was something I would\u2019ve never guessed. Also Jack Nicholson and John C Riley both being in Adam Sandler\u2019s Anger Management seems random as hell. \n\nAnd as much as I love Captain America: The Winter Soldier, having Robert Redford in a Marvel movie with Chris Evans is pretty weird. Almost as weird as Edward Norton being in Sausage Party along with Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera and others. ",

It got me thinking some of the best villains aren\u2019t just evil, they\u2019re complex enough to make us question whose side we\u2019re on. Which movie villain was written so well that you found yourself empathizing with them, even just for a moment?",
