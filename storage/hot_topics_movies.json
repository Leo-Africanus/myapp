        "title": "There's few characters in cinema who are a big and as entertaining a loser as Jerry Lundegaard in \"Fargo.\" Not only is William H. Macy one of the best casting choices ever, but a big part of the film's appeal is just watching him mess up EVERYTHING.",
        "content": "I fully understand why Macy was so determined to play this role that he jokingly threatened to shoot the Coens' dogs if he didn't get it. Not only is Macy one of the best actors ever at playing this kind of character (see \"The Cooler\" for another excellent example), but Jerry is just such a screw-up at everything he does. Right from the beginning, his whole \"kidnap my own wife\" plan is so half-baked and inane that the very crooks he hires to do it are dubious about it. Think of how many ways he screws up:\n\n1. He hired Carl and Gaer on reference from someone at work (who only knows the latter and won't vouch for the former), knowing nothing about them or how competent they may be.(Short answer; not very.)\n\n2. Because of that, he can't contact them to call off the kidnapping when it looks like he might not need it done.\n\n3. He's amazed when his father in law, who is established from the beginning to not care much for him, won't just give him $750,000 with no strings attached.\n\n4. His mumbled excuses to the GM lawyer about the serial numbers to the non-existent cars he scammed them with. (\"Those're in the mail!\")\n\n5. His plan revolving around being able to deliver the ransom himself and therefore cut out most of it to keep, never realizing that his stubborn and controlling father in law (who, again, DOES NOT LIKE YOU, JERRY) might demand on doing it himself. And sure enough...\n\nAnd so on. And watching Jerry constantly fail and lose it is one of the great pleasures of the film, like when he impotently attacks his ice-covered windshield in rage or how his office blinds look like prison bars. Frequently, a character like this might bring about sympathy for his misfortunes, but not Jerry. Not only is he a loser, but his troubles are all self-inflicted. And in the end, when it all comes down on him, it feels earned and very satisfying.\n\nEven though he did manage to knock off $100 on the truecoat. You did accomplish that, Jerry.\n\n",

        "title": "I Watched All 63 Disney Animated Movies, And It Was Delightful",
        "content": "I was born in the early 90s, in the midst of the Disney Renaissance, and I grew up on Disney movies. My mom showed me a lot of the classics in addition to the new ones that came out during my life, but I hadn't seen the vast majority of these films since childhood. So, nearly two years ago, I set out to watch every movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios (so, no live-action remakes, no made-for-TV sequels, etc.), in chronological order, to refresh my memory and fill in my blind spots. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I ranked all of the movies on Letterboxd, and included my favorite moment from each one (usually an animated flourish, but occasionally a quote or an extended sequence). And below, I listed some good and bad surprises, and I ranked villains, vocal performances, and songs, just for fun!\n\nhttps://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/\n\nGood Surprises:\n\n1. Cinderella - I really, really did not expect to come away from this with Cinderella as my favorite Disney movie and one of my favorite animated movies of all time. But it is. In my memory, it was the classic \"helpless princess, handsome prince, happily ever after\" story. Imagine my surprise when I find that it's a movie about a woman overcoming the most dreadful circumstances with kindness and humility and persistence and self-confidence. She's not immune to the weight of her terrible life, but when life gets her down, she picks her head up and gets back to solving her problems. She is a role model not just for little girls, but for all of us. AND it's beautifully animated, well-paced, and has one absolutely remarkable sequence (the transformation of everyone/everything in preparation for the ball). It's just splendid.\n\n2. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - I expected One Hundred and One Dalmatians to be relatively minor Disney, but I was blown away. From the gorgeous, painterly animation style, to the thrilling plot, to the devious villain, to the delightful side characters (Horace and Jasper are all-time great laughable lackeys)...it all just works.\n\n3. The Emperor's New Groove - I knew I was going to love The Emperor's New Groove, but not this much. It's just one amazing sight gag after another, coming in at an efficient 72 minutes (not including credits), and its blistering pace never runs out of steam. Amazing.\n\n4. Robin Hood - Robin Hood was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid, but as an adult, I realized it didn't have the best reputation, so I wasn't optimistic going in...but I still loved it. It's fun, it's got some great music (\"Phony King of England\", especially), and a ridiculous villain+sidekick combo (Prince John and Sir Hiss).\n\n5. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The crew could not be any more trope-y if it tried. Milo, the out-of-his-depth, nerdy scholar who the group reluctantly depends on. Rourke, the gruff, grizzled captain who clearly has ulterior motives. Helga, a young German woman and Rourke's second-in-command, who thinks she has to act all tough to look like she belongs next to her superior. Vinny, the cavalier Italian demolitions expert who just wants to run the family flower shop. Dr. Sweet, the physically imposing African-American/Native American doctor with a heart of gold. Audrey, the plucky, teenage Puerto Rican mechanic trying to impress her dad (who really wanted a son). Wilhelmina, the chain-smoking communications officer who looks and acts like she should have retired years ago. Cookie, the elderly chef of the expedition, who seems to have come from the Confederate South. Geatan Moliere, a Frenchman who goes by Mole, and also acts like a mole, and also looks like a mole. But it leans into those tropes with such affection, that I couldn't help but love it. \n\nBad Surprises: \n\n1. The Sword in the Stone - Like Robin Hood, The Sword in the Stone was one of my favorites growing up. I don't know what childhood me was thinking. The wizard duel is entertaining, but the plot is just totally inert otherwise. \n\n2. Tarzan - I didn't find the story all that interesting, nor the characters compelling. Much to my surprise, I also didn't love the music - it all sounded the same and didn't hook me whatsoever. RIP to the Phil Collins burning piano meme :(. \n\n3. Fantasia - Hailed as one of the all-time greats of Disney, I was excited...but it was too inconsistent. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is among the best things Disney has ever done, and Night on Bald Mountain is a good time...but otherwise? Couldn't find much to latch on to.\n\n4. The Black Cauldron - Yet another of my childhood favorite that I ranked lower than I'd hoped. I still probably have it higher than most, maybe due to my affinity for all things spooky and the fact that this is certainly the darkest Disney has ever gotten...but still didn't live up to expectations.\n\n5. Wish - This movie is SO bad. I skipped it in theaters when it came out a couple years ago (shortly after I started this project, actually) because of the so-so reviews, but I still thought I'd at least give it a solid 3/5 stars. But it looks terrible (like something from Disney Channel 10 years ago), the songs aren't the least bit memorable, there are no interesting characters, and the plot doesn't carry half the weight that it feels like it should. I LOVE the idea of this movie, and it fits so well into the mythology of Disney...which I think made me all the more angry at how it turned out. \n\n\nTop 10 Villains:\n\n1. Cruella De Vil (One Hundred and One Dalmatians)\n\n2. Hades (Hercules)\n\n3. Ursula (The Little Mermaid)\n\n4. Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty)\n\n5. Mother Gothel (Tangled)\n\n6. Yzma (The Emperor's New Groove)\n\n7. Ratigan (The Great Mouse Detective)\n\n8. John Silver (Treasure Planet)\n\n9. Scar (The Lion King)\n\n10. Doctor Facilier (The Princess and the Frog)\n\n\nTop 10 Vocal Performances:\n\n1. Robin Williams (Genie, Aladdin)\n\n2. James Woods (Hades, Hercules)\n\n3. Jodi Benson (Ariel, The Little Mermaid)\n\n4. Susan Egan (Meg, Hercules)\n\n5. Pat Carroll (Ursula, The Little Mermaid)\n\n6. Eleanor Audley (Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty)\n\n7. Eartha Kitt (Yzma, The Emperor's New Groove)\n\n8. Peter Ustinov (Prince John, Robin Hood)\n\n9. Patrick Warburton (Kronk, The Emperor's New Groove)\n\n10. Ming Na Wen (Mulan, Mulan)\n\n\nTop 20 Disney Songs:\n\n1. Friend Like Me (Aladdin)\n\n2. Part Of Your World (The Little Mermaid)\n\n3. I'll Make a Man Out of You (Mulan)\n\n4. Lost in the Woods (Frozen II)\n\n5. I've Got a Dream (Tangled)\n\n6. The Phony King of England (Robin Hood)\n\n7. For the First Time in Forever (Frozen)\n\n8. Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid)\n\n9. Surface Pressure (Encanto)\n\n10. Belle (Beauty and the Beast)\n\n11. Poor Unfortunate Souls (The Little Mermaid)\n\n12. Hellfire (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)\n\n13. I Just Can't Wait to Be King (The Lion King)\n\n14. Zero to Hero (Hercules)\n\n15. Hakuna Matata (The Lion King)\n\n16. The Bear Necessities (The Jungle Book)\n\n17. The Family Madrigal (Encanto)\n\n18. How Far I'll Go (Moana)\n\n19. I Won't Say (I'm In Love) (Hercules)\n\n20. Cruella de Vil (One Hundred and One Dalmatians)\n\nThat's it! It was a great little journey through the history of animation, and I'd encourage anyone interested to take it!",

        "content": "I know I'm late to this, but yesterday I stumbled upon this movie, read the description and the cast. My expectations going in were: \"I just want a Taken knock-off that survives on the charm of Jason Statham.\" So I think I set them realistically low for an evening of kinda mindless entertainment. But even then, I was mostly bored and so disappointed that I wanted to make this post...\n\nThe biggest problem is, a big chunk of this movie is entirely useless. And I don't mean, I didn't like it or it was not that impactful. I mean, you could literally cut out the entire side plot about his daughter and father-in-law and it would change not a single thing about the main story. How do you even fumble this hard? Even in the places where it is set up to intersect, it doesn't. Statham is set up to need money to pay for his lawyers in the custody case for his daughter which never becomes relevant. Does he keep the money from the Russians? No. Is he tempted to sell the drugs he acquired in his investigation? No, the movie makes a point of him immediately flushing them. Do the Russians tempt him with a bribe to stop? Not even a throw-away scene like that...   \nAnd then, in the only intersection of these plots in the movie, the \"Russians\" set his father-in-laws house on fire. I say \"Russians\" because we don't even see one of our established bad guys doing it. And then, they do it to the father-in-law which is set up to be hateable anyways. His daughter is safe the entire time. Great emotional investment you got from me there, movie. On top of that, his father-in-law is completely fine. So there is zero consequences from this for our protagonist and, again, impacts him in no way. Does it change his motivations? No. Does it change his course of action? No. Does it maybe just make him hesitate a little or reflect on the danger he is causing? Not even that.\n\nSo we have 20 minutes of useless scenes in a movie that is already 20 minutes longer than Taken. On top of that, the movie really undercuts the emotional stakes by making the kidnappers complete buffoons that repeatedly get outsmarted by the kidnapped Girl. I have no problem with giving her more agency, but then do it in a way that makes her seem clever and not by making the bad guys completely non threatening.\n\nAnd lastly, David Ayer cannot help himself to insert his pathos over the top cringe. You want to honor the troops? Fine by me. But to have Jason Statham say to our drug producing and dealing, russian mafia associate, biker gang leader \"My beef wasn't with you\" before killing him because he was also a soldier? Wtf is even the message here?\n\nAll in all, completely wasted opportunity to make a fun, competency porn, Jason Statham against the world movie. Instead, every second scene is pointless, and the bad guys are incompetent and non-threatening. Has David Ayer made anything decent since Fury?",

The one I noticed first was the weird awkward joke scenes that look like they were out of jag with that weird music. Also how the plot didn't make much sense like why were the lights in the line-up room turned on. The old Hollywood chloroform shtick where in reality you have to place the rag over a victims face between 5 and 10 minutes to knock someone out and you need to get the right dosage or you'll either give the victim a headache or they will die.\n\n Also if you hire people to kill your wife pay them on time. Like I said it's not the worst movie it's not something I'd watch again. But I would subject my kids to it though.",

        "title": "Which moment in a Disney live-action remake most misses the point of the original?",
        "content": "Freezing take: the disney live-action remakes aren't very good. But I think what's most frustrating about these movies is how often it seems that the people tasked with recreating those classic movies don't seem to understand why the original movies were the way they were in the first place.\n\nSo, often, you have times where they will change a certain plot point without understanding why that plot point was important in the original, or the consequences that it has for the rest of the story. Or, on the other hand, you have moments where they will KEEP a certain plot point of the original, while removing the reason for said plot point to exist in the first place. In the current discussion for the recent Lilo and Stitch remake, the most upvoted comment points out that the movie keeps Lilo's ritual of feeding her doll because she claims it controls the weather, while removing the information that Lilo's parents died in an accident caused by bad weather, which gave Lilo's silly ritual emotional weight and purpose.\n\nSo I want to know which moment in these live action remakes is most telling that the writers didn't understand the original movie. For me, I'll submit Pinocchio going to school in the remake. In the original movie, Gepeto tells Pinocchio to go to school, but on the way there, he is accosted by Honest John who convinces him to join the Strombolli's puppet show instead, which Pinocchio agrees, ignoring the advice of his conscience. When Pinocchio joins the puppet show, he is abused by the owner and is only freed when he learns what he did wrong.\n\nIn the remake, after meeting with Honest John, Cricket actually convinces Pinocchio to go to school and he does... only to be abused by the teacher for being a puppet and thrown out, at which point he follows John to the puppet show.\n\nThis is an absolutely baffling change because it completely contradicts the point of the movie. Pinocchio wishes to be a real boy, but in order to achieve that, he must first learn to be a *good* boy, which, among other things, involves obeying his father and steering clear of bad influences. In the original, Pinocchio willingly disobeys his father and fucks off to do something fun instead, which leads to a bad time. It's a simple morality tale; Pinocchio is rewarded for being good, and punished for being bad. Pinocchio's nose grows when lies. All of Pleasure Island. The story is centered on this theme\n\nBut in the remake, not only does Pinocchio obey his father from the start, he is PUNISHED FOR DOING SO. Now, joining the puppet show isn't a reckless decision by Pinocchio, it's his only option because obeying his father was actively bad for him.\n\nMaybe the writers wanted to make Pinocchio a \"better\" character by making him a well-behaved kid but, THE ENTIRE POINT OF THAT SCENE IS THAT PINOCCHIO MISBEHAVES. It's like if they made Pinocchio's nose grow even when he tells the truth\n\nAnyway, that's mine. What's yours?",
