Tomorrow is the last day to watch it on Netflix, so if someone is reading me and has Netflix, Prisoners is a must-watch.\n\nFirst, the acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman were fvcking magnificent on this movie. Every scene that they have together makes you feel and understand their respective situations perfectly.\n\nSecondly, no soundtrack: whoever decided to add little soundtrack to this movie had a great idea, because it is only used in crucial moments and never in ankward situations.\n\nI really think that the plot and the pacing were good.\n\nTo sum up, I think that Prisoners is a great movie that, although being hard to watch sometimes, it's a great experience. \n\n10/10.",

What a movie, man.\n\nIt's such a time capsule in terms of culture, in its attempt to capture the social evolution of a 30 year gap difference, the movie itself becomes the same but for us, another 30 years later. Yeah it can get a lil bit cringy here and there, but that goes with the point I'm making. You know how Police Academy stopped being legitimately funny more than 20 years ago, yet it's still \"heartwarm\" funny in a way? Blast from the Past, if you're vibing, is still freaking hilarious.\n\nAnd to the 90s Brendan Fraser, where in the Greek's Mythology did you come from? I'm a straight man but I can't stand so much beauty! He's such a great comedic actor you can forget he's showing an incredible range here. This is the same year as The Mummy so he's pretty much at the top of his game.\n\nSeriously, if you haven't, watch it. Such a wonderful movie. Probably top 5 funniest Christopher Walken role as well, no diminishing the rest of the cast who are pretty much the perfect choice.\n\nI don't know man, it just REEKS of these kinda movies we can't do anymore. Makes me long for a style of cinema we gradually lost to granularity and political sarcasm.\n\n",

I mean movies that demonize intellectuals and education, that dismiss experts as \"elites\" in favor of good old fashioned \"common sense\" and values, that promote skepticism of established facts and people that know better.\n\nMovies like God's Not Dead, where university professors are portrayed as evil atheists who hate God and try to brainwash Christians into abandoning their faith, literally the atheist professor copypasta in movie form. The creators knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nMovies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off where cutting school for no reason other than thinking that school is a waste of time and lived experience is better. Any movie where scientists are portrayed as amoral sociopaths or as asocial \"eggheads\" that need to lighten up.\n\nYou could even argue that Forrest Gump is anti-intellectual, since the movie portrays Forrest's \"simple\" attitude through life that that leads to success and happiness while smarter people are unhappy jerks, but I don't think that was the intention of the creators.\n\nSo what movies do you think promote anti-intellectualism?

        "content": "Gillian Armstrong's *Little Women* is one of my favorite Christmas movies. This year my seven year old daughter asked to watch it with me. Caught me waaaaaayyyy off-guard wanting to talk about Laurie.\n\n\"Why is he sometimes nice and sometimes mean?\"\n\n\"Why does he want to be their brother?\"\n\n\"Why doesn't Jo want to marry him?\"\n\n\"How come he marries Amy? Would he just marry *any* of them?\"\n\n...totally \"bah\" to my \"humbug\" the way only a kid can be. But it did make me look at Christian Bale's portrayal and the vibe he brings. True, he wasn't Batman, yet. And his fiery reputation hadn't gotten going. But for people who've read the book AND seen the other films, what is it about Teddy that my daughter's missing?  ",

Judging from the title alone I was expecting a B horror movie/drama. I legit couldn't have been farther from the truth. This is probably one of the more emotional movies I've seen in a long time, and by far doesn't get enough recognition. I can't recommend this movie enough if you haven't seen it yet. ",
