        "content": "Over the years I've watched Blade Runner a couple of times, but it never sat right with me. I kind of understood why it is considered a masterpiece, but I also kind of didn't.\n\nI watched it again yesterday, and it finally clicked and I also know why: I watched the theatrical version for the first time. The one with Deckard's voice-overs. I don't remember ever having voice-overs in this movie, so it must be that before I've always watched Ridley Scott's Director's Cut or the Final Cut.\n\nI now understand that what I was missing was context. Blade Runner has always been awing me with its imagery and music, but I also found the dialogues to be on the philosophical rather than the logical side and I didn't understand why certain things were happening as they were. This took me out of the movie pretty early, thus I couldn't really appreciate what I was seeing. Now, with Deckard's voice-overs, I do. And the film finally works for me. And it makes me happy, because I too can now fully appreciate a milestone of filmmaking as much as so many other people do.\n\nEDIT: Based on some comments below, I'd like to add that I'm not claiming the voice-over version of the movie is better than the later cuts. I am just glad to now have the context that is given in the voice-overs. Now that I have this context, I will probably watch the \"purer\" Director's Cut or the Final Cut again in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if I prefer them over the theatrical, too. I just needed to context given in the theatrical to better understand the movie in general.",

But when a botched bank robbery interrupts the municipality\u2019s tranquil pace, a sordid secret is inadvertently exposed and Ulysses learns that the town is anything but its namesake. Suddenly everyone is trying to shoot the sheriff, even his own deputies, and our put-upon policeman must rely on his affable mettle and some motley crooks if he is to survive the night.

        "content": "On HBO Max, there is the Watchmen live action movie, an episodic series of the motion comic book, and a two chapter movie series; all telling the same story. Most of the visuals, flashbacks, and plots are the same.\n\nThe main differences I\u2019ve seen so far have mostly been when the information was given to the audience, whether this is when the flashbacks are cut into the present day narrative or the conversation pacing. An example of the latter being Rorschach\u2019s \u201cYou quit.\u201d in reply to Dan\u2019s musing of what happened to the \u201cgreat times\u201d. In on version, Rorschach waits a beat, and another he sharply cuts off Dan\u2019s question. This former shows Rorschach longs for his friend to take up the mantle again, while the latter shows Dan\u2019s abandonment stills hurts. That being said, it feels like every version is sharing both sentiments.\n\nEdit: What I\u2019m getting at is like you get to watch a different cut of your favorite movie, or how the scene would have played out in a different setting. Like the chronological cut of Pulp Fiction someone posted on YouTube years ago.",

        "title": "The Rocky Horror Picture Show",
        "content": "I remember (doing the time warp) when I was 13 years old. I am the son of a very conservative southern Baptist pastor, and a very conservative southern Baptist pastor\u2019s wife. We couldn\u2019t say fart in my family. That\u2019s enough context for this story.\n\n\nI was 13 and I had heard of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but I had never seen it. I had just received a tv for my birthday a month prior, a little 13 inch color tv, and I was so proud of it. It was October and I stumbled across TRHPS on VH1. I was entranced, the music was amazing and it was scandalous and dirty and I am just watching it with eyes as wide as saucers. I\u2019m in the middle of sweet Transvestite, and I hear my mom knock and begin opening the door. I fumble the remote and Jesus, knowing my shame\u2026makes the remote not work. My mom walk in and looks at the TV, and I know I\u2019m busted. She\u2019s going to have a heart attack and call my dad in and I\u2019m going to get a lecture and possibly my tv taken away. My mom looks at me and I know what\u2019s coming\u2026.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watching Rocky Horror\u2026I saw it in the theater.\u201d\n\n\nWhaaaaaaaat?!?!?!\n\nIt was on that day, 31 years ago that I realized my mom was cooler than me. Over the next few years I realized how cool she was. She could play any hymn by ear\u2026but she also knew Beth by KISS, Come Sail Away by STYX. She knew Alice Cooper, Ozzy, Led Zeppelin. She had been in a band as a teen with my cousin who grew up to play lead guitar for the Osmond Brothers, and his band has opened for Alice, and The Beach Boys, and David Cassidy, and STYX, and the Bay City Rollers. And she was just as cool. \n\nShe still is. She\u2019s slowed down a lot, she fell over Thanksgiving and broke her hand so she\u2019s not playing piano for a while. We\u2019ve been doing end of life planning as she is approaching 80, and my dad has Parkinson\u2019s, and she is giving me her 1974 Rhodes stage piano which is in absolute mint condition. All this has been on my mind lately and tonight I saw Rocky Horror was on Disney+. I had my 13 year old daughter come into my room and watch it with me, and told her this story of my rocker preachers wife mom. I think it\u2019s a cool legacy to hand down, and I just thought I\u2019d share it here.\n\nEven today, Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the best rock operas in existence; and it is special to me because it reminds me that people are very complex\u2026even moms.",

        "content": "Spoilers for a 60 year old movie below.\n\n\nI watched the apartment last night and realized this has the quintessential anti Chekhov gun moment. About halfway through Jack Lemmon\u2019s character is talking about his past suicide attempt by shooting himself. At the end of the movie he has seemingly lost everything and is packing up his apartment when we see him pick up a gun. At the end of the film we hear what sounds like a gunshot but it turns out the gun was never used, violating the rule. What other movies have scenes like this?",

        "content": "I watched the 2025 Frankenstein a day before watching Children of Men. I was about to joke how Frankenstein shows how badly men want to give birth and this film was definitely inspired by that but I can't.\n\nIt's too beautiful for that. The dystopian world in the film might seem hopeless but characters portray otherwise. There is this slick contrast between the world and the characters. They reek of courage and hope unlike the world.\n\nThe famous scene shot in one take when the fishes and army ceasfires after hearing a baby's cry is such a powerful one. For a moment the world seems full of hope and peace; all because of a baby. Only for the firing to begin right after. This as per me is a contrast between the world we can have and the world we have made into our reality. We keep getting glimpse of this hopeful world through different characters be it Theo, Julian, Jasper, Miriam, Marichka, the family that helped them and finally everyone; from the people in the building to the army when there was ceasefire.\n\nPersonally speaking I feel like this film portrays today's situation really well. We might not be infertile(yet) but the hatred people seem to have for one of their own knows no bound. Looking at it; everything may seems like the end of the world but then you meet someone like Theo, Julian, Jasper or Marichka and the world starts glimmering with hope.\n\nAlright, that's it. Thank you for listening to my Ted talks and I hope everyone of you get pregnent quickly.",

        "title": "Movies where the language barrier hid some bad acting?",
        "content": "There's this low budget Japanese cult movie called Versus from 2000 or so that I was obsessed with as a kid. It's basically about a bunch of Yakuza that guys go to meet up with some escaped convicts in a forest where all the people they've killed over the years start rising from the dead, and it turns out both the convicts and the boss they were waiting for are more than they seem.\n\nNow according to the filmmakers, especially the director, the lead actor Tak Sakaguchi delivers his dialogue terribly in a lot of scenes, which I guess is unsurprising for an early effort from an inexperienced director like Ryuhei Kitamura was. I don't know if he's wooden in his inflection, emotes incorrectly, or what because I can't speak a single sentence of Japanese.\n\nRobert Rodriguez also speculated about his breakout feature El Mariachi that he figured Americans took it more seriously and got more out of it because the fact it was in subtitled Spanish convinced them it must be more highbrow that the kind of silly, contrived B movie that it he felt it actually was. One of the lead villains was 19 years old and delivered his lines very woodenly in Spanish but looked old enough to still be intimidating to an English speaker. \n\nAre there any movies you've seen from your home country being watched by people in other countries where you think you'd enjoy them less if they were native speakers of your language?",
