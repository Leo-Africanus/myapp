        "content": "I was born in 1993, my first time watching Terminator 2 was with my family (when age appropriate, probably 10 years old or so lol) in preparation for us going to the Universal Studios theme park where they had the Terminator 3-D experience (does that even exist anymore?). \n\nMy brothers and I became obsessed and would literally put the DVD in just to watch the Minigun/Helicopter scene or the Motorcycle/Truck chase through the storm drains. \n\nWatched it with my wife last night, it\u2019s probably been at least 15 years since I watched it front to back, I could still quote most lines but now that I\u2019m an adult with a career, wife and pets that depend on me it felt completely different. \n\nThe scene that hit me the hardest was Sarah Connor attacking Miles Dyson\u2019s house. The man is brilliant, successful, has a beautiful house/family and is a part of a groundbreaking technology but also oblivious to the potential that this technology makes him \u201cresponsible for the death of 3 billion people\u201d because it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Why would he have thought of that? At the end he\u2019s willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind. \n\nSkynet doesn\u2019t even feel that farfetched at this point, in fact it\u2019s probably going to be worse considering there\u2019s no politics involved in the movie. \n\nI feel like my perspective on the movie completely changed from someone that idolized Arnold for being a badass to realizing how scary the reality is of the situation. \n\nAll of this is not mentioning the acting, special effects cinematography and everything that helped make the movie such an incredible experience. I hate to say it but it\u2019s as close to a perfect movie if I\u2019ve ever seen one. \n",

        "content": "I recently rewatched the movie, put it on as background noise, but found myself looking at it critically. I realized just how good of a movie it is and not just based off being a fan of DND. There\u2019s so much to like about this movie even if you don\u2019t like or care about DND.\n\nThe dialogue is tight. The plot is simple, but endearing. Characters are defined quickly and are all played really well. You can feel the sincerity and fun they had being these characters and being in the movie. \n\nWith Snow White being all over with comments from the actress disparaging romance in movies. I like how the movie counters the romantic plot being needed without having to call attention to it. I especially love Ed and Holga\u2019s relationship and how naturally platonic it is without needing one of them being secretly in love with the other or something cliche like that. I love how it ties into the overall plot as well with Ed realizing Holga was the mother his daughter loved and deserved. It reinforces the platonic dynamic and gives you an alternative family dynamic without feeling like it needs to justify it or parade it around unlike other movies that see it as a selling point. \n\nAll in all, this movie is amazing and something we need more of. I need another movie with this much depth and sincerity. ",

To the greatest shootout ever put on in film. Everything about this film is ambitious\n\nOne issue I have with it though is Neil is presented as a highly intelligent and calculated criminal. When he is talking to Michael telling him that he has other sources of income **\"t-bonds, real estate\"** and that he should cut lose. Shouldn't Neil also have other sources of income as well, alternative ways of making money. it almost makes it sound like he is dependent on the bank job and the scores he does, but maybe I am looking into it too much in that scene\n\nAll in All an epic film, and how do you guys feel about Mann trying to get Heat 2 off the ground, He just submitted his script which I assume is based off the book (which i haven't read yet)",

Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.\n\nI have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.\n\nFor example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.\n\nThe dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,\n\nThere is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. \n\nThen there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.\n\nI love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.\n\nAnyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",

        "content": "Do you have a film of this genre that you liked, despite the fact that the film may not follow historical facts very well?\n\nFor me, it's Spike Lee's \"Blackkklansman.\" This is a good crime thriller based on a true story about Ron Stallworth, a black policeman who infiltrated the ranks of the Ku Klux Klan in the 70s. But it's full of historical inaccuracies. Starting from the minor ones, like the fact that Ron's partner wasn't Jewish. And starting with the fact that the whole bomb storyline was invented for a movie and hiding the fact that Ron had been the mole in the Black Panthers for much longer.",

        "content": "When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.\n\nIt's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.\n\nWhat could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??\n\nI didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.\n\nGladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.\n\nIt's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.\n\nHe managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.\n\nWith Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.\n\nHe's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.\n\nIt's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.\n\nIt's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.\n\nRussell's performance wasn't just \"playing the hero\" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.\n\nHe's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.\n\nIt's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.\n\nI hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.\n\n\n",

Makes you wonder how much better movies would look if they focused on the film itself rather than casting the most \u201con trend\u201d actors. \n\nWhat other examples can you think of?",

Absolute shame it's not playing in more theaters, as I saw plenty of trailers for it.  Carey Mulligan is great but she's always great, and I wasn't aware of Tom Basden before but he was also great and they both actually performed the music in the movie.  Tim Key is another actor I was unaware of who was also perfect. (Yes I'm terrible at reviewing movies but wanted to give this one a shoutout).  If you have a chance to see it and you're not in the mood for any of the bombastic commercial stuff out right now, and would prefer something a little more charming and heartfelt, I highly recommend this one.",

Now we literally have people voluntarily documenting every aspect of their lives for strangers online.\n\nThe scene where Truman realizes patterns in his world (same people walking past at the same time) reminds me of how recommendation algorithms keep showing us the same content. And when he tries to leave town but encounters obstacles? That's basically what happens when we try to disconnect from social media - there's always something pulling us back in.\n\nThe most haunting part was when Truman asks \"Was nothing real?\" That question hits harder now when we're all curating these perfect online versions of ourselves.\n\nAnyone else revisit older films that seem to predict our modern reality in ways that weren't obvious when they were released?\n",

        "content": "Found it on Netflix and just finished watching, don\u2019t remember seeing anything about it when it came out.\n\nStars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal. They had top billing for obvious reasons, Brolin and Gyllenhaal are what attracted me to it, but there\u2019s a lot of actors sharing the screen and they\u2019re all top notch in this movie.\n\nI decided to watch it despite thinking to myself \u201cokay, this is gonna be one of those movies that I can go ahead and play in my mind with probably 70% accuracy.\u201d I thought it was gonna be superficial and formulaic - it was not.\n\nIt\u2019s based on a true story of a disaster on Mt Everest in 1996. Won\u2019t go into more detail than that to avoid spoilers.\n\nI doubt the movie would blow anybody\u2019s mind but it\u2019s just a really good, solid film. There\u2019s a lot of human drama that felt very genuine to me, no melodrama. No cheesy dialogue. No caricatures. No actors hamming it up or overacting, in my opinion. No major genre cliches that I can recall. In fact I feel that it\u2019s the type of movie that kinda defies genre, although you could categorize the themes well enough.\n\nPlot wise I didn\u2019t find it predictable at all. If you\u2019re already familiar with the story then I think you\u2019ll find that the events aren\u2019t portrayed predictably. No cheap thrills or cheap sentiment, just real ones. It made me feel shit.\n\nThe cinematography is great, there\u2019s a lot of astounding shots of the mountain and surrounding environment. I don\u2019t know if it was IMAX, but I\u2019d have to assume it was because of some of the photography that just screams IMAX. Watch it on your biggest screen\n\nLong story short, I was expecting to accept a certain degree of eye rolling bullshit but there was none to be found. Really solid movie, it impressed me a lot.",
