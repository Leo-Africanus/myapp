        "content": "For having 25 years to make a sequel, they really did the bare minimum. They literally took 90% of the first movie and repeated it, changing minor details and setting it 15 years later. They retconned Lucius\u2019s parentage, making Maximus into a unfaithful husband. They made Maximus\u2019s sacrifice pointless by sending Lucius away immediately after his death. How Ridley Scott not only produced this piece of shit, but directed it, really lowers his ranking amongst the great filmmakers of the last 50 years. But I guess we can chalk it up to him being 85 during production. Gladiator is one the greatest movies in the history of cinema and they just took a huge shit on it with Gladiator II. \n\nI\u2019m just a random dude and my opinion doesn\u2019t mean and won\u2019t change anything. But I had to say something. I\u2019m so glad Tony Scott isn\u2019t around to see his brother devolve and crank out garbage like this. ",

Is there a name for this trope?\n\nEdit: I personally think this does not fall under deus ex machina because it\u2019s still somewhat realistic to use an improvised weapon in a fight but it\u2019s definitely similiar to deus ex machina and feels like lazy writing to me\n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s apparently called \u201dWithin arm\u2019s reach\u201d but I like the term \u201dconvenient cudgel\u201d invented by the comments better :)",

Now I'm obsessed with it and it keeps me awake instead of putting me to sleep.\n\nSo now I need a new movie that lol",

The homey vibes and heartwarming feel definitely struck a chord with me, but overall I just thought it was extremely well directed and acted throughout. \n\nPaul Giamatti is also not an actor that I\u2019m familiar with, but his work was incredible here. Amazing character. Domniac Sesso turns in a great performance too for it being his first feature film. Super impressive. Da'Vine Joy Randolph definitely deserved that Oscar nom too. \n\nSuch a Christmas classic in my book. Absolutely loved every second of it.",
