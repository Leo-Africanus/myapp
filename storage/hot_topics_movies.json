        "title": "August 22-24 Box Office Recap \u2013 'KPop Demon Hunters' makes history by debuting at #1 with $19.2M, the first Netflix film to achieve it. 'Honey Don't!' and 'Eden' disappoint in their debuts. 'F1' and 'Superman' cross $600M worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/1h05hcmbi8lf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=882372efef206439b03c971b604e3c84e25ca93f\n\nShowing that audiences will want to watch streaming films in theaters, ***KPop Demon Hunters*** managed to take the top spot at the box office, despite its very limited release. There were newcomers this week, but they all failed to make a single good impression, with ***Honey Don't***, ***Relay*** and ***Eden*** all disappointing. And A24's re-release of ***Ne Zha 2*** domestically massively flopped. It was also a big week to hit milestones, as both ***Superman*** and ***F1*** have crossed $600 million worldwide.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $68.9 million this weekend. That's down 16.3% from last year, when ***Deadpool &amp; Wolverine*** stayed at #1, and stuff like ***Blink Twice*** and ***The Crow*** failed to impress.\n\n***KPop Demon Hunters*** managed to hit #1 with a pretty great $19.2 million. This is a very impressive result, considering it's been on Netflix for two months, it was playing in just 1,700 theaters (none of which includes AMC), and the film was only available for two days on theaters. It made history as the first Netflix Original to hit #1.\n\nThe film achieved this because it simply became a worldwide phenomenon. Who knows what were the expectations for this before it debuted, but not only did it become the most watched animated film in Netflix's history, but it has become the second most watched English-language film in the platform, being viewed 184.6 million times in the eight weeks following its premiere. And the music has also become massively popular, with \"Golden\" reaching #1 at the Billboard Top 100. All this popularity successfully convinced Netflix in launching sing-along screenings.\n\nYep, a fantastic result. But let's get something out of the way: Netflix is not gonna make this a norm. They refused to show actuals for this, so the figures had to be provided by other trade sources. And they're clearly content with leaving money on the table for theaters: the sing-along version is already available on Netflix today. Upcoming films like ***Frankenstein*** and ***Jay Kelly***? Only a few screenings before they hit Netflix and nothing else. It is what it is.\n\nWhile it had to cede the top spot, ***Weapons*** is still holding incredibly well. It eased just 37%, earning a further $15.4 million. The film has now earned $115.6 million domestically, and it still has one last week left before facing direct horror competition in ***The Conjuring: Last Rites***.\n\n***Freakier Friday*** eased just 38% and earned $8.8 million this weekend. The film has made $70.2 million, and it should benefit from Labor Day next week.\n\nIn fifth place, ***The Bad Guys 2*** dipped just 32%, earning $5.1 million. The film has amassed $66.1 million, and it's running eerily on par with the original through the same point. It should have another great hold next week thanks to Labor Day.\n\nAfter its very soft debut, ***Nobody 2*** appears to be fizzling out. It collapsed a very poor 60%, earning just $3.7 million this weekend. That drop is worse than the original, which dropped 56% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, it has made just $16.5 million, and it's now guaranteed to finish below the original's $27.5 million domestic total.\n\n***Superman*** eased 35%, for a $3.4 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $346.9 million, and it will cross the $350 million milestone by next week.\n\nIt's not until eighth place where we find another newcomer this week. That's Focus Features' release of Ethan Coen's ***Honey Don't***, which flopped with just $3 million in 1,317 theaters. That's above Coen's ***Drive-Away Dolls*** ($2.4 million), and that film had the advantage of opening in 2,280 theaters. But ***Honey Don't*** has the disadvantage of costing a hefty $20 million budget, which doesn't bode well for its profitability prospects.\n\nThe film lost so much buzz after its premiere in Cannes, where the film failed to impress critics. Reviews haven't really improved; it's sitting at a very weak 45% on RT. In order to get a chance, films like these need very strong reviews. It was reported that 54% of the audience was female. No CinemaScore, but the film had a horrible 1 1/2 stars and 28% definite recommend on PostTrak. Given that ***Drive-Away Dolls*** faded quickly, expect the same to happen to ***Honey Don't***. It'd be a surprise if it made anything past $7 million domestically.\n\n***The Naked Gun*** dropped just 39%, adding $2.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $47.6 million, and it should hit the $50 million milestone by next week.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Jurassic World Rebirth***, which dropped just 29% and added $2.1 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $335.5 million.\n\nBleecker Street released ***Relay*** in 1,483 theaters, but the film flopped with just $1.9 million.\n\n***F1*** continues having great legs. It eased just 35% and added $1.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $185.8 million, and it will finish with around $190 million domestically.\n\nA24 decided to release an English-dubbed version of ***Ne Zha 2*** in 2,228 theaters. The subtitled film already made $17 million domestically, despite never playing in more than 800 theaters. But audiences were practically uninterested in this version, as the film flopped with just $1.7 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at 2,000 theaters, and translates to a paltry $695 per-theater average. It will disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nBut wait, there's actually another newcomer! That was Ron Howard's ***Eden***, which starred Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, Sydney Sweeney, Daniel Br\u00fchl. Vertical released it in just 664 theaters, and so the film flopped with just $1 million. Nowhere close to its $50 million budget. It also achieved the absolute worst debut in Ron Howard's career, and that's just unadjusted.\n\nThe result is unsurprising. The film premiered back in TIFF, but it earned mixed reviews and struggled to find a distributor. Vertical only bought it a few months ago, but the marketing was very limited and the reviews (56% on RT) never moved the needle. Don't expect this to last long in theaters.\n\nNeon's ***Splitsville*** debuted in 5 theaters, earning $108,315 this weekend. That translates to an okay $21,663 per-theater average. Neon will expand it to wide release in September 5.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle*** added $32.5 million, taking its overseas run to a fantastic $242.5 million. The film made a killer debut in South Korea with a pretty great $12.6 million this weekend. It will continue adding more markets in the next few weeks.\n\n***Weapons*** added $13.2 million overseas, taking the worldwide total to $199.6 million. The best markets are the UK ($11.6M), Mexico ($7.5M), Spain ($5.7M), France ($5.6M) and Australia ($5.1M). Today, it will finally cross $200 million.\n\n***The Bad Guys 2*** added $12 million, for a $149.8 million worldwide total. It had a very good hold in China ($4.5M, just 32% off) and had a solid debut in Italy ($1.7M). The best markets are China ($16.4M), UK ($13.7M), France ($8.7M), Spain ($6.2M) and Mexico ($5.5M), and it has so many markets left.\n\n3 months after it released in practically everywhere, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** finally hit its... final destination, China, despite not a single film in the franchise playing in theaters there. It over-performed projections, opening with a pretty good $8.2 million. And that took its worldwide total to $295.5 million. After getting so close, the film will finally hit the $300 million milestone in the next few days.\n\n***Jurassic World Rebirth*** added $6.2 million overseas, for a $844.5 million worldwide total. The best markets are China ($79M), the UK ($47.3M), Mexico ($36.4M), Germany ($32.6M) and France ($28.4M).\n\n***Freakier Friday*** added $6.2 million, taking the worldwide total to $113.1 million. The best markets are the UK ($7.9M), Mexico ($7.6M), Australia ($3.3M), Argentina ($2.3M) and Colombia ($2.2M).\n\n***Materialists*** continues its great run overseas. This weekend, it added $6.2 million, allowing it to cross $85 million worldwide. It's already A24's fourth biggest ever worldwide, and it will cross the $100 million milestone eventually.\n\nWith $6.1 million this weekend, ***F1*** has officially crossed $600 million, tripling its budget. The best markets are China ($59.2M), South Korea ($35.2M), France ($30M), the UK ($29.7M) and Mexico ($19.9M). With exceptional holds, it still has a lot of gas left in the tank. In the next few days, it will pass ***Superman*** to become the sixth biggest film of the year.\n\n***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** hit $5.8 million, taking its worldwide total to $490.5 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.5M), Mexico ($27.4M), France ($15.4M), Brazil ($13.5M) and Australia ($11.1M). It will pass $500 million next week, but it doesn't much left in the tank.\n\nWith $1.8 million overseas, ***Superman*** has finally crossed the $600 million milestone. Its worldwide total stands at $604.4 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThere's three newcomers opening, so it'll be a tight battle for #1, hoping to dethrone ***Weapons***.\n\nThe most likely will be Sony's release of Darren Aronofsky's ***Caught Stealing***, which stars Austin Butler, Regina King, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Matt Smith, Liev Schreiber, Vincent D'Onofrio, Griffin Dunne, Bad Bunny, and Carol Kane. Aronofsky has been inconsistent at the box office, but this film is sold mostly as a crime with some comedy. Perhaps that will convince people to check it out.\n\nThere's also Searchlight's ***The Roses***, a new version of ***The War of the Roses***, now starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman. The 1989 film was a big hit, earning $160 million worldwide. But this is not getting to those numbers. Reviews aren't glowing (61% on RT), so there's gonna be a big battle for this to break out.\n\nAnd finally, there's Cineverse's ***The Toxic Avenger***, a new reboot of the franchise starring Peter Dinklage in the title role. The film premiered in festivals 2 years ago, but it struggled to find a distributor to its graphic content. Finally, Cineverse bought the film, promising to release it unrated in theaters. They've hit gold with the ***Terrifier*** franchise, but can they also succeed in resurrecting ***The Toxic Avenger***?",

        "content": "I remember watching an interview with Tarantino a while ago and he talks about how whenever he watches Dazed &amp; Confused for him it's like catching up with old friends, which got me thinking about what film that is for me. I can firmly say that nothing beats hitting play and watching those opening words \"Oceans are Now Battlefields\" and then spending the next 2 hours with Lucky Jack and the rest of the gang.",

It got me thinking some of the best villains aren\u2019t just evil, they\u2019re complex enough to make us question whose side we\u2019re on. Which movie villain was written so well that you found yourself empathizing with them, even just for a moment?",

        "content": "There are a lot of movies that might not have been great to begin with, but were pushed over the edge by miscasting. Sometimes all it takes is one role that doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nFor me, Gangs of New York is a big one. And surprisingly, Terminator Genisys too. It might have been a bad (or even average) movie on its own, but casting Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, a character meant to be a hardened survivor, just killed it completely. \n\nWhat movies do you think were ruined by casting choices?",
