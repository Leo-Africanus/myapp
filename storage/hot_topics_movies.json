        "content": "In Zack Snyder\u2019s Army of the Dead, the original zombie lords over the alphas that he created, who in turn make hordes of their own. The OG zombie even shows reason and bargains with the main characters for his partner\u2019s life.\n\nZombies having coherent thoughts and a pecking order makes them LESS scary, not more. Zombies are frightening because of the total loss of identity. Orthopedic surgeon? Buddhist monk? You\u2019re zombies 2,034,002 and 2,034,003 now.\n\nAlpha zombies and different levels in \u201czombie society\u201d kind of shit all over that, which is a major reason 28 Years Later couldn\u2019t match 28 Days Later.",

        "content": "I subscribe to Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and a few smaller services like Dropout and Nebula.\n\nAnd yet every time I think of an older movie I want to watch, it's not on any of them. Sometimes it's on one of the services I don't subscribe to, like Peacock, but a lot of the time it doesn't seem to be available for streaming anywhere without \"renting\" it. \n\nAre we really back in the 90s where I've got to rent movies and make sure i finish them within 48 hours before my rental is up? \n\nI certainly prefer to watch movies straight through in one sitting, but I'm busy. I have a life, a toddler, and things that demand my attention. I'm lucky if I get an hour of uninterrupted time in an evening to watch stuff. I already pay for too many services; I shouldn't have to pay-per-view and still worry about finishing a movie before it expires. \n\nThis sucks. \n\nAs for buying physical media, that's a great solution... sometimes. But like a lot of people these days, I don't want to be tethered to my couch. I watch across a series of devices, from my TV in my house, to the TV in my shop, to my phone.\n\nAnd yes, I know about the high seas, but that's not for me. I *want* to stream content legitimately, but damn if they're not making it difficult. ",
