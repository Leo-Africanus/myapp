We've worked on other docs like Jazz, The War, Prohibition, The Vietnam War, Hemingway, and more. Ask us anything!\n\nHere are the first 10 minutes of our new docuseries, The American Revolution:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1o8FTXQuzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1o8FTXQuzo)\n\nAll episodes are now streaming!\n\n&gt;Thirteen American colonies unite in rebellion, win an eight-year war to secure their independence, and establish a new form of government that would inspire democratic movements at home and around the globe. What begins as a political clash between colonists and the British government grows into a bloody struggle that will engage more than two dozen nations and forever change the world.\n\n**Sarah's Bio:**\n\nSarah Botstein has produced some of the most popular and acclaimed documentaries on PBS. She is currently producing and co-directing The American Revolution along with Ken Burns and David Schmidt. Her previous work includes Jazz, The War, Prohibition, The Vietnam War, College Behind Bars, and Hemingway. The U.S. and the Holocaust marked Botstein's debut as a co-director. Botstein works closely with PBS LearningMedia to develop educational materials as part of the Ken Burns Classroom, and she was an original contributor to Ken Burns's UNUM. In addition to The American Revolution, Botstein is working on a three-part series about Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society.\n\n**David's Bio:**\n\nDavid Schmidt is the producer and co-director, along with Ken Burns and Sarah Botstein, of The American Revolution, a six-part, 12-hour series premiering on PBS in the fall of 2025. Schmidt began working with Florentine Films as a researcher and apprentice editor for The Roosevelts (2014), while also supervising the documentary\u2019s seven-episode script. His research on The Vietnam War (2017) won him the Jane Mercer Footage Researcher of the Year award, and he also worked closely on that project with writer Geoffrey C. Ward and helped coordinate postproduction. With Burns, Schmidt also produced the two-part biography Benjamin Franklin (2022) for PBS. A graduate of Dartmouth College with a degree in history, Schmidt grew up on the Virginia Peninsula within the Historic Triangle of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown\u2014each site only minutes from his childhood home. He spent his summers working in the living history museum in Colonial Williamsburg and on the archaeological dig at Historic Jamestown. Those childhood experiences led him to pursue a career telling American history.\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back today Wednesday at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions :)",

I appreciate this movie actually takes time to show how scary situations can bring people together in such a short time.\n\nYou root for Keanu to save them.

He strikes a good mix between humorous and serious, and towards the end his \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\" epilogue is a great way to end the film.\n\nApocalypse Now- Martin Sheen's narration gives you the feeling of being in the mind of a Vietnam special forces soldier who's journeying into the depths of human insanity. Amazing job.\n\nGoodfellas- When listening to the narration of Goodfellas it feels like you're listening to the real Henry Hill tell you his life story and fall from grace, it flows so naturally.",

It's like a forth wall break of sorts. What are some examples of the rare trope? Is there a name for it? \n\nExample:\nIn Wallace and Gromet there's a scene where they're in the church talking about the ware rabbit and suspenseful organ music starts playing and we assume is the score, until the vicar turns and says \"stop playing that music\". The camera then pans to a woman on the organ who says \"sorry\"\n\n\n",

I can't think of much that would warrant it. The drinking? The guns? The skeletons? The scene where Jack Sparrow rips off Elizabeth's corset? Like, I'm sure they'll understand it all and have seen much worse outside of school. If you guys agree with her, I could show another movie, it's just that my students would be disappointed.\n\nEdit: I'm half to blame since I asked in English but I should have said I'm from Brazil and this movie's age rating here is 12 and not PG-13 like in the USA. But that's besides the point, because I've been convinced that parents are the fucking worst and could potentially ruin my mental health again lol. Thanks, everyone!",

Yet he was always a co-star, never a solo lead.  He was in so many hits I\u2019m sure that he would have had many offers on the table for his own vehicle. I have to assume it was of his choosing, but if so, why?",

But the humor is so good.\n\nThe lesbian plotline with Noreen crushing on Marcia in the movie and kissing her in the end credits, the sequel having the incest stepbrother/stepsister plot with awkward curtain scene, all the scenes with Jan and her schizophrenia, the fake boyfriends, the car jacker, putting on their Sunday best and going to Sears, etc.\n\nI just can't get over these movies came out 30 years ago now. They felt like meta or parody movies played straight. I'm also surprised how many LGBT elements or jokes there were in the movie where they don't seem dated or insulting either. All the actors of the family were so perfectly cast.",

They use magic as a crutch to not have to come up with clever schemes like the Ocean's movies, while making the magic tricks so implausible they might as well be something out of Harry Potter. \n\nIs it just me, or would a more grounded movie using real magic tricks/illusions be much, much better films?\n\nEdit: Yes, I've seen \"F/X\" and \"Lord of Illusions\" and liked them both.",
