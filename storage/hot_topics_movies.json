        "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t complain about this, so here\u2019s me complaining about this.\n\nAgainst my better judgement I decided to watch The Gorge on Apple\u2018s streaming platform, and boy it turns out even an ending as trite as that can be [further undercut by Ted Lasso\u2019s beaming face.](https://i.imgur.com/mB9Z1D6.jpeg)\n\nI remember the story about how George Lucas had to go non-union or pay fines to the director\u2019s guild because he refused to open Star Wars with credits. They cared about them that much. Now, in space year 2026, apparently every professional association of filmmakers give not one solitary shit about credits, allowing as they do every single streaming platform to shrink them to Borrower size so they can Run Some Fucken Adverts. \u201cYes you just watched Schindler's List for three hours and change, but stop processing it there\u2019s not a moment to lose, have you heard about *House MD*? We're gonna play it in 5 seconds unless you tell us not to.\" \n\nThis is Apple\u2019s own movie, these are their people, and they couldn\u2019t even wait for the animations to stop. Like the disrespect afforded to the standard white on black scroll is bad enough, but there are visual effects going on in that little box. You paid vfx artists real human money to make this look good, not enough, granted, but you paid them, and then you made it two inches tall. Morality obviously doesn\u2019t sway these people but how are their shareholders not beating down the door at the sheer waste of it?\n\nNetflix is particularly bad now too, some people will say \"hey you can just make it bigger again\" (as if ruining the vibe alone were not sin enough) but on both Smart TVs and Xbox, the only two places I've bothered testing, going over the \"back\" arrow to get to the tiny credits crashes them all together, like they're punishing you for even questioning their wisdom. How *dare* you try to find out who the best boy is.\n\nAnd just so Disney+ doesn't escape here, when I was watching season 2 of Andor last year their title images for next episodes which pop up unprompted over the credits \\*included spoilers\\*. If anyone has the address for the person who did that, stick it in the comments, I just wanna talk.\n\nI am quite unreasonably mad about this and I don't expect them to change how they do it, but boy I\u2019d sure take an option in the settings, off by default no doubt, that just says \u201crespect the goddamn films you dorks\u201d with a little checkbox.",

However, I think a key part of that experience is the petty-yet-undeniably-righteous thrill of seeing a critic or fan tear into a truly terrible flick. Negative? Granted. Often a thing of beauty? Definitely.\n\nMy favourite, and a contender for greatest of all time, is this autopsy of Steven Seagal's *Contract to Kill:*\n\n&gt;Seagal...walks stiffly and very slowly. It is possible that he never once bends at the waist. Most of the movie, he spends sitting down or walking (again, slowly) up and down flights of stairs. There is a love scene - and, Jesus, what a love scene. His fully dressed body is lowered over a naked woman like a drawbridge.\n\nhttps://www.avclub.com/contract-to-kill-isn-t-just-bad-it-s-steven-seagal-bad-1798189772\n\nSo, movie fans...what reviews live in your head rent-free?\n\nEDIT: So the number one thing I'm taking from the replies is that Roger Ebert was the John Wick of film criticism; a man of focus, commitment and sheer will. \n\n*\"Baba Yaga...\"*\n",

        "content": "The China Syndrome (1979) starring Jane Fonda &amp; Jack Lemmon was a movie about a nuclear power plant that suffers a turbine trip and radiation leaks out. \n\nUpon release it was met with backlash from the nuclear power industry as sheer fiction and character assasination of an entire industry \n\n12 days after the release The Three Mile nuclear accident happens. certain things in the movie and the real incident were similar. \n\nBoth incidents started off the same way, control staff misread instruments, there was a cover up that happens\n\nWhat other films released close to a real life event that was unplanned?",

        "content": "Spoilers!\n\nHad mixed feelings about it initially but then the more I thought about it the more I realized that it is Ari Aster extending a big giant cynical middle finger at current day American society and social media. It really pulls no punches in how it trolls everyone on all sides of the social and political aisle.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nThe corporate sponsored leftist terrorist group flown in on their (Soros) jet coming to sow armed militant chaos in a small town. It's an obvious smirking nod to RW conspiracies about Soros or other wealthy billionaires funding all leftist political violence.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as the covid denying sheriff going off the deep end after spiritual guru con man (Austin Butler) cucks him and takes his mentally ill wife. Butler and Emma Stone had small roles but were fantastic in this.\n\nThe conservative black deputy trading bitcoin and into guns getting bullied by his white douchebag co-worker who keeps doubting which side he's on. Then he ends up being set up.\n\nThe various naive BLM young adults doing hysterical performative activism.\n\nLoads of sly jabs all throughout making fun of both left wing covid hysteria and right wing covid denialism, btc/precious metals grifting, and social media based con men.\n\nThe kid who \"saves\" the sheriff at the end with his phone out killing the paid leftist terrorist ends up being a celebrated right wing hero on fox news. It's a sly nod to how media grifts off various fake heroes and props them up for political causes.\n\nThe awkward racial tension between everyone was over the top and just making a statement about how far off the deep end the social conversation has gone in some spaces.\n\nEddington was basically an alternative reality based on the most extreme online commentary about American politics and society. It feels like Ari Aster is saying \"Hey if what you guys believe online is all true then this is the chaotic mess it would be like..\"\n\nThe ending where the sheriff is trapped in his own existential hell and being taken care of by his MIL like she's a surrogate wife while also being forced into some weird polyamorous situation in bed.",

        "title": "Watched Good Time (2017) tonight with Robert Patterson.",
        "content": "Just wanted to give major props to Robert Patterson for so effectively playing this character. On the one hand, you are absolutely convinced of how manipulative and destructive he is. He literally gaslights and attacks everyone he comes across throughout the film. And yet, his loyalty to his brother is so severe that you can't help but root for him. Even as he destroys himself to the point of no return, you're still convinced the film will keep rolling as the camera zooms in on him in the back of the police cruiser because you're certain he's going to get his brother out somehow.\n\nAnd then the film ends, and the credits roll, and you realise--\n\n&gt;!It's not intensity you're seeing in his eyes in the back of the police cruiser, it's guilt.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Connie was the one who broke their grandmother's arm, not Nick.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Connie likely blamed it on Nick, which made them homeless and destitute, and that's why Connie had to rob the bank.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!He didn't just take Nick along to the bank as muscle... he took him along to take the fall.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Just like he let the 16 year old he met (and seduced) take the fall outside of Adventureland.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Everyone Connie meets... gets burned. Some immediately, some within mere hours of having met him.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But because the film puts you in his shoes, and because the film is a total non-stop rush with the thinnest line between acts--!&lt;\n\nYou don't realise any of this until the very end.\n\nEven still, you're left with the gnawing doubt that Connie might've acted with at least some good intentions when it comes to his brother. Trying to rack up the bail money to get him out on parole, but the more you reflect--the less likely that seems. The Safdies did an excellent job of leaving it so totally warped and screwed-up. All in all, I feel like it was a better *Place Beyond the Pines.* And I know that's a bit of an odd comparison, but I can't help but compare *Place's* Act 1 to this film. They both feel very similar somehow, but I feel like the Safdie's version of the theme hits a whole lot harder with me.\n\nAnd honestly, just a stellar performance from Patterson. He slams in this film. He's so greasy and wired and unpredictable. You can never tell what he's thinking at any given moment, except for: ''*I need to keep going.*'' ",
