I had heard good things but it still exceeded my expectations. Visuals, fantastic. Story, even better. The pacing was damn near perfect as far as I'm concerned. And considering it was a Godzilla movie I found myself incredibly moved by the characters, none of whom were one-dimensional characatures.\n\nI hate when movies are too optimistic and I thought this walked the line perfectly between tragedy and fortune.\n\nJust wanted to dole out some praise for this film and a wish that more western/American films were of this quality. \n\nA+ guys.",

        "content": "Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.\n\nIt just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying \"jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore\" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. \n\nOf course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic. Are there any other movies with bits that get more ridiculous as the story goes on?",

It would allow the audience to get up, get some more popcorn, and use the washroom. That being said; not all movies need one. If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.\n\nBut what is your thoughts on it? Should studios put an intermission in movies or not?",

        "content": "Like, I think he\u2019s a more talented actor than people give him credit for. I feel like a lot of the criticism of his ability comes from people who have only seen Morbius and Suicide Squad\n\nBut it\u2019s well known that he seems like a huge pain in the ass. His method thing seems really annoying for his costars, and also just wastes a lot of time. Leto seems to have a lot of confidence in his formula, not realizing most of the roles that made him famous were just relatively normal dudes. Now he wants to prove himself as some kind of \u201ceccentric method genius!\u201d\n\nAfter a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven\u2019t been very successful recently.\n\nAlso, I know David Ayer seemed to like his weird process, which I suppose makes sense considering Ayer got along with Shia Labeouf very well. However, what I find funny is when you look at the behind the scenes for the Suicide Squad, the cast seemed legitimately very close. There\u2019s a lot of nice pictures with them\u2026 the one caveat being that Leto is usually not in any of those pictures",

It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  \n\nIt's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.  I see it's on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.\n\nUpdate:  Wild to see that this made it to the front page of the sub, thanks all!",

        "content": "Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.\n\nWhat is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose.\u00a0\n\nthe film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent. Despite some expensive looking special effects quality is a non-ingredient, instead reaching to gutter levels for humour and placing all the weight of carrying the movie on Black's antics.",

Just rip them out like he\u2019s pull-starting an outboard? It\u2019s so stupid and wonderful. One of my favorite undersold comedy bits. \n\nAny other similar subtle/background gags that deserve extra appreciation?\n\n",

        "content": "Hello there!\n\nYesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a \"fpreign-but-not-so-foreign\" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.\n\nBut [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 44: Spain - El labertino del fauno (engl.: Pan's Labyrinth)\n\n&gt;Day 43: Slovenia - Moj ata, socialisti\u010dni kulak (engl.: My dad, the socialist kulak)\n\n&gt;Day 42: Slovakia - Obchod na Korze (engl.: The Shop on Main Street)\n\n&gt;Day 41: Serbia - Balkanski \u0161pijun (engl.: Balkan Spy)\n\n&gt;Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: Unknown Men of San Marino)\n\n&gt;Day 39: Russia - \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440 (engl.: Stalker)\n\n&gt;Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2ni \u0219i 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n&gt;Day 37: Portugal - Capit\u00e3o Falc\u00e3o (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n&gt;Day 36: Poland - Kr\u00f3tki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n&gt;Day 35: Norway - Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 (engl.: You Won\u2019t Be Alone)\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

Im very impressed. \n\nWinslet, also, was amazing as Lee. I dont know how true to form she was regarding Lee. I havent yet read Lee's biography. What I do know is Winslet represents a strong woman to me and I think she lived up to that in Lee. \n\nWhat do you giys think about the movie? ",
