Watching Dead Poets Society and siding with the cautious parents Seeing The Little Mermaid and thinking Triton had valid concerns about his 16-year-old daughter.

It's a tense WW2 action drama starring Burt Lancaster as Labiche, a French rail master trying to prevent the Nazis from looting French artworks. Paul Scofield is the perfect antagonist trying to secure the French treasures for Nazi Germany.\n\nI first saw this about 40 years ago as it was one of my father's favourites and I have to agree. It's tense, emotional, plenty of action, and beautifully shot, with great performances by everyone. Special mention to Papa Boule (Michel Simon) for just being a hero and Jeanne Moreau as Christine, the hotel owner who gives refuge to Labiche. \n\nWatch it and you won't be disappointed. It's a Desert Island Discs kind of movie IMO.",

        "content": "There are way too many (as in any) posts about how a movie \u201cspoils\u201d something you wish you were surprised by. A movie revealing information to you, the audience, before the characters know it, is not \u201cspoiling\u201d the story.  You having information that the characters don\u2019t is a purposeful technique that writers use to create suspense, to make you more sympathetic to the characters, or even to provide comic relief to tension being built up. No matter the reason, it\u2019s on purpose, it\u2019s part of the story. Not every movie would be better if everything was completely subjective from the character\u2019s point of view. ",

        "content": "I always thought the opening to Predator that shows the spaceship landing on Earth to be pointless and should have been cut. We didn\u2019t need a hint that the creature was an alien at the very beginning because it would have been better to be left a mystery, especially since the scene lasts 5 seconds. It got me wondering what other scenes from movies should have been deleted during the production process. What are your thoughts?",

I'm looking for movie suggestions around cults, not necessarily supernatural / horror films, can be religious themed, even political. Could also be TV Show format.\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n\nRosemary's Baby\n\nThe Believers\n\nLate Night With the Devil\n\nHereditary\n\nGet Out\n\nThe Invitation (2015)\n\nWaco (TV)\n\nThe Master\n\n  \nAny really good suggestions around this theme?\n\n",
