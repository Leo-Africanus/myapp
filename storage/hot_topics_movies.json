        "title": "3,400 movies later... here are my top WTFs...",
        "content": "Hi Reddit! I've been lurking here for a long time and I rarely post but I reached a milestone recently and thought it might be nice to celebrate with you by jumping on.\n\nI have been keeping a list of movies that I've watched for nearly 25 years (since I was \\~13). It started in a notebook and eventually I moved the list to a spreadsheet. I log the name of the movie, the name of the director(s), the year it was released, my own rating (out of 5), whether or not I own a physical copy, and what my thoughts were after watching it. Today that list is over 3,400, entries strong!\n\nIn honour of the last WTF movie I watched, I wanted to share a list of my most recent and memorable WTFs that I've either seen more than once or would watch again, for anyone else who likes this as a \"genre\". If you enjoyed at least one movie from this list, then I'm fairly confident you'll also enjoy any of the others which you haven't seen yet.\n\nIf you have any other WTF movies you would recommend in return, I am very grateful for your suggestions.\n\n**My top 10 WTFs**\n\nIn no particular order and released within the last 20 years:\n\n* [The Substance (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714/) \\- I finally got around to seeing this today, and I haven't said WTF this much in a very long time. I thought it was utterly brilliant.\n* [Hereditary (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/) \\- one of the only true \"horror\" movies on this list. Difficult to unsee. Genuinely scary.\n* [Kill List (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1788391/) \\- very original, completely unexpected. I watched it a second time with audio commentary from the cast which I thought was really interesting.\n* [Eden Lake (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020530/) \\- not the ending I was hoping for, but a total bucket of WTFs from start to finish.\n* [I Saw the Devil (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/) \\- one of two Korean entries on this list. Really brilliantly done. Just when you think it can't be more WTF, it gets more WTF...\n* [Parasite (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/) \\- the second of the two Korean movies, with completely unexpected scenes out of the blue that had me saying WTF for a very long time.\n* [Uncut Gems (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/) \\- whilst not entirely WTF the whole way through, that ending came out of nowhere and it hit me hard.... I watched it twice. Brilliant.\n* [Midsommar (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/) \\- this movie had Wicker Man vibes but I was really much more freaked out watching this. There is at least one total WTF scene that you will definitely say WTF to... and then it almost immediately hits you again.\n* [The House That Jack Built (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4003440/) \\- this is kind of a modern take on Dante's Divine Comedy, it's quite... \"poetic\"... and as far as serial killer movies go, this is really out there as one of the most WTF ever. Great soundtrack too.\n* [Der Goldene Handschuh (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt7670212/) \\- the only time I've ever paused a movie to take a photo and send a WhatsApp to the friend that recommended it... total WTF from start to finish, bordering on over the top, but I'd probably watch it again so I'll mention it. It's also \"based on a true story\"... which makes it even more WTF.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\n* [The Platform (2019) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8228288/)\\- I thought this was very original, and it had quite a lot of WTF moments. Not sure it needed a sequel though?\n* [We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242460/) \\- so many WTF moments...\n* [Tusk (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498/) \\- I've never really seen anything else quite like this. I remember sitting through the credits and the only recurring thought was... \"WTFAF was that?!\". I haven't seen it a second time but I would definitely watch it again.\n* [Three\u2026 Extremes (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420251/) \\- this was really on the verge of being too much and it's technically three short films blended into a feature, it's also the oldest on this entire list, but I've watched it more than once and it is uniquely WTF. You probably won't want to eat anything before, during, or after seeing this movie.\n* **EDIT - adding a few more I completely neglected:**\n* [The Menu (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/) \\- another insane rollercoaster of WTF that just keeps building. It should really be in the top 10.\n* [The Perfect Host (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334553/) \\- can't believe I forgot about this. I couldn't remember the name.\n\nI wanted to add that I've deliberately avoided the more \"extreme\" WTFs. There are several that I've seen that were so excessive, WTF doesn't quite cut it. If you want to see the most messed up shock cinema, there are several entries that come up quite frequently in other WTF threads which I've seen over the years of lurking here. For what it's worth, I think when a movie reaches the point of sacrificing any sincerity or logic in its story in favour of shock value, it's lost its entertainment value completely for me, hence the aversion to mentioning those titles here.",

        "content": "For me, it was The Heat with Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock.\n\nEarly on in the movie, Melissa's character is arresting a John for trying to pick up a hooker.  He attempts to justify it by stating his wife just gave birth and you can't imagine what's going on down there. \n\nMelissa's character responds something along the lines of he's got a lot of nerve to dry that to the mother of his children, he's blessed, her body goes through so much and so on.\n\nI think about this every time I'm upset with my wife, how I'm lucky to have her, and it doesn't matter what she looks like all the time after giving multiple births.  Or when I'm looking at other husbands doing similar things to their wives.  There are others, but this scene holds a special place in my head. ",

(I forgot they started the second half with Superman.)\n\nThey included smaller pieces from movies like Dial of Destiny which whatever you think of the movie this piece was incredible with a single violinist as the focus. And the Jaws score for when they all go out on the boat.\n\nWhen the Star Wars segment begins a ton of lightsabers light up in the crowd... the whole place is lit up... it's pretty gorgeous.\n\n[Light Sabers John Williams](https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15101902/Maestro-of-the-Movies-Celebrating-the-Music-of-John-Williams-at-the-hollywood-bowl.webp)\n\nThey couldn't do all his stuff of course. It changes a bit year to year.\n\nOh and they did as a nod to Lalo Schifrin who just passed away 2 months ago, the Mission Impossible theme which sounded so freaking good at the bowl with that orchestra.\n\nYou have a favorite? Or a favorite score from a particular scene?",

        "content": "I was going through my annual James Stewart run, when I rewatched one of my favorite western movies of all time.  Destry Rides Again, directed by [George Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(director)).\n\nIt's about a small town run by crooks, corruption, and a hooker with a heart of gold. The newly appointed \"sheriff\" is the town drunkard, given the role so that the bad guys can continue to run roughshod.  However, he ends up hiring a pacifist deputy with an aversion to firearms due to their namesake, the legendary Destry.\n\nIt's truly one of my favorites.  But what really made me re-evaluate it, was rewatching the 1952 film High Noon with Gary Cooper.  Considered one of, if not the, first mainstream movies to \"deconstruct\" the western, it was labeled \"down right Un-American\" by John Wayne due to it's plot regarding a town that refused to help the hero.  And yet Destry Rides Again, which was arguably worse, came out 13 years earlier.\n\nA wonderful movie which may be overlooked due to Jimmy Stewart's other films at the time.  I implore everyone to watch it.",

The interviewer responded \"...elaborate on that\" to which Lynch famously responded, \"No\". \n\nI would say Aronofsky's *Pi* is similar in that it is the director's most spiritual film and yet, I don't think there should be a concrete explanation to the abstractions explored in either film. *Pi* also echoes *Eraserhead i*n  other ways from the black and white cinematography, dystopian industrial set design, both films really (at least for me) showcase a lot of what each director would go on to do with the rest of his career (both thematically and artistically/visually), and they both happened to bet the respective director's first film. I'd say neither is my favorite work of the director (*Twin Peaks et. al.* for Lynch and *Requiem for a Dream* for Aronofsky), but there is clearly influence on those works from the directors' original film. \n\nCan you think of any other examples where a director's first work really embodies the rest of their career?
