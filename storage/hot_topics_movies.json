        "content": "Hi /r/movies, we're Matthew Salleh and Rose Tucker, the documentary filmmaking duo behind\n\n\u201cSlice of Life: The American Dream. In Former Pizza Huts.\u201dWe also made \"Barbecue\"\n\n(2017) and \"We Don't Deserve Dogs\" (2020) - Ask us anything!!\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re Matthew Salleh and Rose Tucker, a two-person documentary team originally from\n\nAustralia, now based in the US. Our new documentary film, \u201cSlice of Life: The American\n\nDream. In Former Pizza Huts.\u201d was released online last week after touring the film festival\n\ncircuit the last 6 months.\n\n\n\nFor the film, we captured a portrait of America through businesses that operate out of\n\nthose iconic former Pizza Hut buildings. It\u2019s our third feature documentary \u2013 we previously\n\nmade \u201cBarbecue\u201d (where we journeyed around the world looking at how communities\n\ngather by cooking meat over fire) and \u201cWe Don\u2019t Deserve Dogs\u201d (where we journeyed\n\naround the world looking at the relationship between humans and dogs). You might detect\n\na recurring theme in our films!\n\n\n\nWe do all this as a two-person team \u2013 Matt directs and shoots, Rose produces and does the\n\nsound, we do all the editing, sound mixing and post production out of our one bedroom\n\napartment, and we fund and distribute the films entirely ourselves. We\u2019re also a couple\n\n(going on 19 years \u2013 since this question usually comes up pretty quickly).\n\nWe also readily admit that we work freelance (as corporate video editors) to make this\n\ndream job work. In fact, we were pretty much secretly \u2018working from home\u2019 for the entire\n\nproduction and release of this new film. We try to be very honest and open about how\n\ntough independent filmmaking can be, and are trying to remove the stigma around working\n\nthe second job when Hollywood doesn\u2019t come calling. We\u2019ve seen the highs and lows of\n\nthis biz \u2013 our first feature was sold to Netflix, our second film\u2019s world premiere was\n\ncanceled in the first week of the pandemic...\n\n\n\nAsk us anything! About the new film, about the old films, about independent filmmaking,\n\nabout the grind of corporate video work, about how we got to meet and interview the\n\noriginal 91-year-old founder of Pizza Hut, about lenses and microphones, about anything!\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re interested in seeing the new film, it\u2019s available on Amazon Prime Video\n\nand also direct through our website \u2013 [sliceoflifedoc.com](http://sliceoflifedoc.com) . If you go to the site and click the\n\n\u2018Stream Now\u2019 button, use the code FORMER to see the film for free (or the code PIZZA for\n\n50% off if the other code runs out).\n\n**SYNOPSIS**\n\nA contemporary portrait of America, observed within the walls of former Pizza Hut buildings\n\nacross the country. These nostalgic spaces hold memories of a bygone era, but through\n\nthe power of transformation, they provide something new and special for the communities\n\nthat continue to flow through them.\n\nFrom an LGBTQ+ church in Florida, to a karaoke bar in Texas, to a cannabis dispensary in\n\nrural Colorado, these modern-day portraits are paralleled with the origin story of Pizza Hut -\n\none of America's most iconic brands, and the two brothers who founded the company in\n\nWichita, Kansas in 1958.\n\n**TRAILER**: [https://youtu.be/alql\\_8UgJlI](https://youtu.be/alql_8UgJlI)\n\n**HOW TO WATCH**: the film is available now on Amazon Prime Video and direct via our\n\nwebsite [sliceoflifedoc.com](http://sliceoflifedoc.com)\n\nBack at 3 PM ET to answer your questions!\n\n",

        "content": "**Rotten Tomatoes:** [97%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/predator_killer_of_killers)\n\n**Metacritic:** [80/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-killer-of-killers/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Total Film - Amy West - 5/5](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/predator-killer-of-killers-review-great-characters-thrilling-action-and-gorgeous-arcane-esque-animation/)\n\n&gt;It's clear Wassung and Trachtenberg just get it. Somehow, they're able to push the sci-fi envelope and offer up fresh images and ideas the series has yet to see, while also appealing to diehard fans with Easter eggs (keeps your eyes peeled for a pistol in the final act and a franchise-first look at something fans have been dying to see realized since 1987), as well as cheeky teases of a connected universe and potential sequel, too. Before we get anything like that, though, the latter  is set to release the upcoming live-action flick Predator: Badlands, yet another take on the menacingly-mandibled meanies. After Prey, we had faith the series was in good hands. After Predator: Killer of Killers, we don't want anyone else getting their mitts on it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-killer-of-killers-review-dan-trachtenbergs-animated-anthology-puts-an-inventive-spin-on-a-durable-franchise-1236247198/)\n\n&gt;Predator: Killer of Killers provides the non-stop action that the diehard fans crave. And no concession has been made to the animated format; the film easily earns its R rating with copious amounts of gruesome violence and bloody gore that should well sate viewers\u2019 bloodthirsty tendencies. The animation takes a bit of getting used to, with its exaggerated, video game-style visuals, but it serves the material well.\n\n[The Guardian - Catherine Bray - 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/05/predator-killer-of-killers-review-animated-anthology-of-arnies-old-antagonists)\n\n&gt;The only problem with this stuff is that you can\u2019t help picturing how much more spectacular it would look in live action. The animation is all perfectly competent but it\u2019s lacking a little something \u2013 that spark of life and ingenuity that can make even flawed animation so fascinating. There\u2019s something quite slick about all this, almost to a fault. Was AI involved? We\u2019ll probably never know, but it\u2019s a problem that the suspicion has got inside the door.\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/predator-killer-of-killers-review-hulu/)\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg and Joshua Wassung\u2019s animated \u201cPredator\u201d sequel takes a while to prove it\u2019s more than just a demo reel of superficial badassery, but when it does, it\u2019s involving and intense. It\u2019s hard not to love at least a couple of these characters, who keep getting screwed over by their own propensity for violence. If you\u2019re so deadly that monsters travel millions of light years just to try to murder you, you might have flown a little too close to the sun. You never see a Predator hunting the attendees at a needlepointing convention, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.",

        "content": "Phenomenal movie with a lot of memorable scenes and characters, but the standout is obviously Dementus\n\nEven from a design standpoint, he\u2019s very distinct. A cape made of a parachute, crooked nose, and the teddy bear on his armor. Also a super nasally and abrasive voice. I would say in terms of cruelty, he probably does the most fucked up things of any villain from the last few years, including to his own men\n\nWe know very little about his backstory other than that his family was killed early on in the wasteland, leaving him with only the teddy bear to remember them by. As a result, Dementus commits heinous acts just to feel something, anything. While it gives him an initial rush of adrenaline, we see how he has to do worse and worse things just to feel something, until it\u2019s never enough. In his old age, he\u2019s extra unhinged and obsessed with misery. In his \u201cthere is no hope!\u201d speech, I kind of interpreted Dementus as being upset with the idea of other people finding solace in eachother.\n\nEarlier in the movie, he tries to become a twisted father figure to Furiosa and have her replace the family he lost, and seems genuinely hurt when she hates him (he lacks the self awareness to know she would obviously hate him for killing her mother)",

        "title": "My story with 127 Hours",
        "content": "I\u2019m autistic and 127 Hours is not only my favorite movie, but it\u2019s also my main special interest/fixation. My special interest with this film has lasted over fourteen years. I thought I would share my story.\n\nThe first time I watched 127 Hours was on April 25th, 2011. It was on a Monday night. I was 16. I checked out the dvd from the library. I didn\u2019t think it would make a big impact on me. But after that first watch, something clicked for me and I felt like a changed person. It was life affirming. I was totally blown away. I knew I had to watch it again very soon. I ended up renting it the next weekend. I fell in love with this movie. I eventually bought the dvd. It was being played so much that I was worried it\u2019d break, so I ended up buying a second dvd copy, which is actually still sealed! At some point later, I bought the Blu Ray copy, even though I didn\u2019t have a Blu Ray player at the time.\n\nI came across this film during my sophomore year of high school. I started showing it to my friends. There was a time in my theater class in which I had to make a movie set with a box set. I ended up creating Blue John Canyon. I also bought a book of the script and I brought it with me to school every day. 127 Hours was becoming my favorite thing in the world.\n\nNot only was 127 Hours my main source for joy and comfort, but it left a positive impact on my life. Before I watched it for the first time, I was taking my life and loved ones for granted. I learned to appreciate them so much more. But it also helped me physically. I used to refuse to drink water. I\u2019d be forced to drink it, and I\u2019d take the tiniest sips. Thanks to the film focusing on how important water is, it became my go-to drink. It made me a hydro homie, if you will. One thing autistic people struggle with are how their bodies lack signals, like hunger, thirst, using the bathroom, etc. The movie made me become more aware of my body\u2019s needs.\n\nThere was also a time in my life when I was very depressed. I turned to self harm and had suicidal thoughts. My breaking point was when I posted a goodbye post on Facebook. I thankfully got help. 127 Hours was one of the things that helped me get better. And I\u2019m forever grateful for that.\n\nI also did some pretty cool things because of 127 Hours. I was never much of an outdoor person before, but it made me fall in love with it. Whenever I\u2019m anywhere near the mountains, I feel most at peace. Utah has become my favorite state to visit. I love to hike out there. I also met James Franco in 2014. I told him how many times I watched it at the time (around 300), and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of times.\u201d I had my Blu Ray copy for him to sign. He drew a heart on it. I never met Aron Ralston or Danny Boyle, but I\u2019d love to meet them both one day, especially Aron! I have a semi-tribute tattoo for 127 Hours on my right arm. It\u2019s a mountain outline. Every time I look at it, I think about the movie and being by the mountains. It makes me happy.\n\nThe last year really took a turn for me, both in good and bad ways. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness late last year, but I dealt with the nearly unbearable symptoms all year. I was in so much pain. Whenever I was at my worst, I turned to 127 Hours for comfort it would almost always make me feel better. And then at some point, I started to share my love for it on Reddit, particularly on r/letterboxd. I\u2019d talk about how many times I\u2019ve seen it. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get many responses to whenever I\u2019d post or comment, but they ended up getting a lot of attention. I would become known as the 127 Hours girl.\n\nThe best thing about being the 127 Hours girl is that I\u2019ve made a positive impact on people. I like to post because I like to share my love for the film. I\u2019ve gotten so many responses from other users that sharing my love makes them happy. I feel like making people happy is one of my life\u2019s purposes. And I definitely feel like I\u2019m accomplishing that.\n\nBut the most exciting thing happened last month. I made a Tik Tok about my story with the film in April. I decided to tag Searchlight Pictures to see if they\u2019d watch it. I didn\u2019t think much of it. A few weeks go by and I open Tik Tok. I got a few notifications. I didn\u2019t think it was anything out of the ordinary. But then I saw that Searchlight Pictures liked, commented and sent me a dm! They wanted to send me some things. I was so excited and happy that I screamed and cried!  I was so anxious to see what they were going to send me! And then it finally arrived. They sent me some merch. They got me a dvd copy (probably because I mentioned in the Tik Tok how I got a second copy in case if the first one broke), a poster, a 127 Hours Nalgene water bottle, a carabiner with a couple keychains, a t shirt they had when the film was released that says \u201cI kept my eyes open for 127 Hours\u201d, and a very nice handwritten note. Getting them to notice how much I love 127 Hours was always something I had on my bucket list, but I always thought it would be unrealistic to accomplish. It was a dream come true. They went above and beyond.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve watched 127 Hours, but my guess is at least a thousand times. I\u2019ve watched it over 100 times this year alone. I don\u2019t watch the whole film every day, but the biggest part of my fixation is my favorite scene, which I watch several times a day every day. It\u2019s one of the video message scenes. I can never exactly pinpoint why it\u2019s my favorite part of the film, but it\u2019s been that way since the beginning. I have sessions where I\u2019d watch it. They\u2019d usually last between 15 minutes-to a half hour each, but there have been times where I\u2019d watch it for an hour straight. I love it so much.\n\nI think I covered all the bases. I\u2019m very open to answering questions. So if you have any, feel free to let me know!\n\nXOXO, 127 Hours girl",
