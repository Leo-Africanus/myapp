Alien was one of the best sci fi horror movies of all time with probably THE BEST creature design of all time and Aliens was one of the best action movies of all time and now Rapace is forever tied to this franchise. \n\nThe franchise is experiencing a bit of a revival with Alien: Romulus last year and the Alien: Earth tv show so her character feels even more relevant than ever ",

Most of the sad movies out there are not appropriate for kids and most kids movies aren't really sad, or at least sad for kids. The opening scene in 'UP' breaks my heart every time but it doesn't really register for a kid. \n\nWe often use 'Song of the Sea'. It's great animated movie but we need something new. Does anyone have any suggestions for kids friendly movies that have a meloncholic theme that don't have a lot of violence, scary scenes or mature content. ",

        "content": "For me, it has to be The Sixth Sense. I remember watching it for the first time not knowing anything about the plot, and when the twist finally hit\u2014that Bruce Willis\u2019 character was dead the whole time\u2014it honestly flipped my brain. I sat in silence for a good five minutes just replaying the whole movie in my head. Suddenly, all those little details made sense, and I realized how carefully the film was crafted to hide the truth in plain sight.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is how the twist doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Some movies throw in a random reveal at the end just for shock value, but The Sixth Sense actually becomes a richer film after you know the ending. Rewatching it feels like a completely different experience, almost like you\u2019re seeing it from another perspective.\n\nAnother one that stuck with me was Fight Club. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all that Tyler Durden and the narrator were the same person. It completely reframed not just the character interactions, but also the movie\u2019s commentary on consumerism and identity. Again, it\u2019s the type of twist that rewards rewatching\u2014you pick up on so many subtle clues that you just miss the first time around.\n\nSo my question is: what\u2019s that one movie twist that left you stunned the first time you saw it? And more importantly, did the twist make the movie better for you, or did it feel like a gimmick?",

Nearly 100 years later It's essentially a cliche, a form of unresolved storytelling/sequel bait that reeks of cheesiness.\n\nDoes anyone know of any **earlier examples** \u2014 especially silent-era films \u2014 that play with the final \u201cTHE END\u201d card in this way? Either literally with punctuation, or in some similar wink at the audience? Bonus points if the title card literally shows \"THE END\" before a question marks is cheekily appended.\n\nThanks in advance \u2014 I\u2019d love to trace how far back this schlocky trope goes",

I've been lurking here for a long time and I rarely post but I reached a milestone recently and thought it might be nice to celebrate with you by jumping on.\n\nI have been keeping a list of movies that I've watched for nearly 25 years (since I was \\~13). It started in a notebook and eventually I moved the list to a spreadsheet. I log the name of the movie, the name of the director(s), the year it was released, my own rating (out of 5), whether or not I own a physical copy, and what my thoughts were after watching it. Today that list is over 3,400 entries strong!\n\nIn honour of the last WTF movie I watched, I wanted to share a list of my most recent and memorable WTFs that I've either seen more than once or would watch again, for anyone else who likes this as a \"genre\". If you enjoyed at least one movie from this list, then I'm fairly confident you'll also enjoy any of the others which you haven't seen yet.\n\nIf you have any other WTF movies you would recommend in return, I am very grateful for your suggestions.\n\n**My top 10 WTFs**\n\nIn no particular order and released within the last 20 years:\n\n* [The Substance (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714/) \\- I finally got around to seeing this today, and I haven't said WTF this much in a very long time. I thought it was utterly brilliant.\n* [Hereditary (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/) \\- one of the only true \"horror\" movies on this list. Difficult to unsee. Genuinely scary.\n* [Kill List (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1788391/) \\- very original, completely unexpected. I watched it a second time with audio commentary from the cast which I thought was really interesting.\n* [Eden Lake (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020530/) \\- not the ending I was hoping for, but a total bucket of WTFs from start to finish.\n* [I Saw the Devil (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/) \\- one of two Korean entries on this list. Really brilliantly done. Just when you think it can't be more WTF, it gets more WTF...\n* [Parasite (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/) \\- the second of the two Korean movies, with completely unexpected scenes out of the blue that had me saying WTF for a very long time.\n* [The Menu (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/) \\- another insane rollercoaster of WTF that just keeps building.\n* [Midsommar (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/) \\- this movie had Wicker Man vibes but I was really much more freaked out watching this. There is at least one total WTF scene that you will definitely say WTF to... and then it almost immediately hits you again.\n* [The House That Jack Built (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4003440/) \\- this is kind of a modern take on Dante's Divine Comedy, it's quite... \"poetic\"... and as far as serial killer movies go, this is really out there as one of the most WTF ever. Great soundtrack too.\n* [Der Goldene Handschuh (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt7670212/) \\- the only time I've ever paused a movie to take a photo and send a WhatsApp to the friend that recommended it... total WTF from start to finish, bordering on over the top, but I'd probably watch it again so I'll mention it. It's also \"based on a true story\"... which makes it even more WTF.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\n* [The Platform (2019) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8228288/)\\- I thought this was very original, and it had quite a lot of WTF moments. Not sure it needed a sequel though?\n* [We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242460/) \\- so many WTF moments...\n* [Tusk (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498/) \\- I've never really seen anything else quite like this. I remember sitting through the credits and the only recurring thought was... \"WTFAF was that?!\". I haven't seen it a second time but I would definitely watch it again.\n* [Three\u2026 Extremes (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420251/) \\- this was really on the verge of being too much and it's technically three short films blended into a feature, it's also the oldest on this entire list, but I've watched it more than once and it is uniquely WTF. You probably won't want to eat anything before, during, or after seeing this movie.\n* [Uncut Gems (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/) \\- whilst not entirely WTF the whole way through, that ending came out of nowhere and it hit me hard.... I watched it twice. Brilliant.\n* [The Perfect Host (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334553/) \\- can't believe I forgot about this. I couldn't remember the name.\n\nI wanted to add that I've deliberately avoided the more \"extreme\" WTFs. There are several that I've seen that were so excessive, WTF doesn't quite cut it. If you want to see the most messed up shock cinema, there are several entries that come up quite frequently in other WTF threads which I've seen over the years of lurking here. For what it's worth, I think when a movie reaches the point of sacrificing any sincerity or logic in its story in favour of shock value, it's lost its entertainment value completely for me, hence the aversion to mentioning those titles here.\n\n**Edits:**\n\n24.08 - I swapped *The Menu* with *Uncut Gems* because I totally agree with some of the comments. Uncut Gems wasn't overly WTF, whereas The Menu really was WTF the whole way through. I also wanted to say a **huge thanks** for the support and comments, I never expected this to take off and the many suggestions you have given me will keep me busy for weeks!",

TBH I did not have the cojones to admit that this movie freaked me the f**k out when I first watched it-this was after released to video! If I recall it\u2019s \u201cloosely\u201d based on a true story?  I lived in LA during this time and \u201cknew of\u201d the \u201ccharacter types\u201d to a distant extent. I don\u2019t want to give too much away but I do remember the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the kid brother I think it was  and the shocking outcome. This movie completely shook me to my core! To this day I remember being sooo distraught and disturbed I cannot bring myself to watch again almost 20 years later. I\u2019m in my feelings composing this post. Did this movie affect anyone else this way? Is there another movie that affected you in this manner?",

        "content": "For me, it was The Heat with Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock.\n\nEarly on in the movie, Melissa's character is arresting a John for trying to pick up a hooker.  He attempts to justify it by stating his wife just gave birth and you can't imagine what's going on down there. \n\nMelissa's character responds something along the lines of he's got a lot of nerve to dry that to the mother of his children, he's blessed, her body goes through so much and so on.\n\nI think about this every time I'm upset with my wife, how I'm lucky to have her, and it doesn't matter what she looks like all the time after giving multiple births.  Or when I'm looking at other husbands doing similar things to their wives.  There are others, but this scene holds a special place in my head. ",

Seems like he gets down. If it isn't him then it's got to be Owen Wilson. ",

        "content": "If anyone has ever struggled with loss, depression, anxiety this movie hits so close to home. I went through a divorce a few years back and both prior to that and following I felt like I was slowly fading away. I told my therapist this, that I just felt invisible. This movie, while slow, really does a good job of showing what that feels like. At first it is comforting to forget your trauma and just walk through life as an observer. You find others like that and have these co-dependent relationships that feel good initially\u2026but it all is just a cycle. It also demonstrates how incredibly hard it is to work through it and past that grief. It is such a thoughtful and moving movie; it\u2019s not flashy or entertaining in the classical sense; but it is quite beautiful and honest.",
