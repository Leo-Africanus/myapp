Mexican actor Jorge Rivero played Adam, while newcomer Candice 'Candy' Wilson played Eve. There are no other actors in the film. The movie is largely silent, with the actors gesturing and calling each other's names to communicate. The film has some opening narration, as well as the voice of God saying a few phrases from the heavens.\n\nThe film gained notoriety because Rivero and Wilson appear fully nude throughout most of the film, with occasional glimpses of genitalia, pubic hair and female nipples.\n\nThe film was picked up by Dimension Pictures. Stephanie Rothman and her husband Charles Swartz supervised re editing and dubbing the film for US release\u201d \n\nIt was a Mexican film titled El pecado de Ad\u00e1n y Eva that released in 1969 but later released in the states in 1973.

Grant, John Slattery, Colin Hanks\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nuremberg_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [60 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nuremberg/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[TheWrap - Matthew Creith](https://www.thewrap.com/nuremberg-review-rami-malek-russell-crowe-tiff-2025/)\n\n&gt;\"Nuremberg\u201d benefits not only from a terrifying performance from Crowe in a larger-than-life role like those that defined the early part of his career, but also from the ensemble of actors that makes it possible to doubt and also sympathize with the crimes at hand. Shannon and his co-counsel, Richard E. Grant, as British lawyer David Maxwell Fyfe, take the courtroom scenes to higher ground, tearing G\u00f6ring down with carefully crafted monologues. \n\n[NextBestPicture - Jason Gorber](https://nextbestpicture.com/nuremberg/) - 7 / 10\n\n&gt;An incredible performance from Russel Crowe. But for all its bold moments of courtroom antics and mind games between monsters and their keepers, this is an almost insultingly pared down version of events from one of the most important legalistic moments in human history. By providing a convenient in within a broader entertainment, the film certainly introduces newer generations to what transpired, but it provides such a simplified view that it may actually do more harm than good.\n\n[Collider - Ross Bonaime](https://collider.com/nuremberg-review-russell-crowe-rami-makek/)\n\n&gt;Quite frankly, it never hurts for a film to preach the dangers of Nazis and how they can be anywhere and everywhere, but it is a bit of a shame Nuremberg isn\u2019t finding a more compelling, enticing way to tell this inherently fascinating true story.",

        "content": "Sometimes it feels like most movies with male heroes focus on action, violence, fighting, shooting etc.\nOn top of this there seems to be an upsurge in movie heroes who start off meek and ordinary but then turn into John Wick when their families (or whatever) are threatened.\n\nWhat are some good movies with male leads that solve their problems without ever resorting to aggression but rather through being morally good, steadfast, kind, thoughtful, quiet, cautious, or clever? (Although not clever in the abrasive and cocky Dr House sort of way.)\n\nSome examples that spring to mind for me are:\n\n*Small Things Like These* - a meek man tries to do the right thing against social pressure.\n\n*Conclave* - a similarly timid man tries to uncover corruption during the election of the next pope.\n\n*Twelve Angry Men* - a man uses calm reason to positively guide a jury to the truth.\n\n*Everything Everywhere All At Once* - not the main character but her husband, helps to save the day by being resolutely joyful and silly in the face of life's hardships.",

        "content": "What are your thoughts on The Curse of the Black Pearl?\n\nI decided to rewatch The Curse of the Black Pearl and I must say, I loved this film as a kid, I still love it as an adult. It\u2019s such a fun, compelling adventure film. The Special Effects I feel still hold up,\u00a0and the Big Action Pieces are great to watch. What I also found with this film is that I feels a little more grounded than the sequels, which I feel dial it up but I like 2 and 3, 4 is okay, 5, I just didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe Cast is great. Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Jack Sparrow and I feel he is at his best with the character in the 1st film. In the 1st film, Jack is a master manipulator who excels at improving his strategy when things go sideways and you can never really tell if he is a joke or if he\u2019s serious. He is unpredictable, he is charismatic, He is just fun to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also great as Barbossa and makes for a great villain and his banter with Depp is fun to watch.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are also good as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but I must admit, without Jack Sparrow, their story was a little bland but It didn\u2019t dissuade me, I still love this film.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I just love this film and rewatching it, it is a great adventure film.",

        "content": "I watched Eddington last night and thought it was a very solid film. It was original and ambitious, which is more than can be said for the majority of movies coming out these days. I\u2019ve read reviews that have called it \u201csoulless\u201d and \u201cbland\u201d which I can\u2019t begin to understand; we see a man losing everything he holds dear due to hubris and his own unrecognized ignorance. His trajectory might not be a literal battle for his soul, but it\u2019s not too far from it. In regards to a bland aesthetic or bland film making, Aster nailed the run/down and dilapidated feel of a small and forgotten Southwestern town. If the film looked ugly and unappealing it\u2019s because the natural setting of the story is ugly and unappealing (Sorry New Mexico). Lastly, one of the loudest commentaries Aster was making is ironically the one I\u2019ve heard no one mention in either reviews or Reddit critiques. The data center! The opening and closing shots of the film are of the data center. The data center is a perfect symbol for New American Progress and everything it fucks along the way. We hear characters discuss the environmental impact of the center and the ridiculous amount of energy and water it will need to operate. But, since Eddington is a depressed small town in the middle of nowhere, those complaints will of course fall on deaf ears, and the the extremely powerful system behind the data center will do whatever it pleases, including running right over the poor have-nots of Eddington. This is how America operates now, the few holding massive amounts of power lord it over the masses and do whatever they want with that power, without consequence. The squabbling of the people of Eddington is the same bickering and fighting happening all across America, and while we use our energy to point fingers and take sides, the data center keep getting built. \n",

It was a colossal, record-shattering success and won Best Picture, yet it's maybe the most earnest, non-cynical, old-fashioned studio epic of the entire decade. It feels like the last time a film like that could dominate the culture before the counter-culture took over.\n\nWhat's your pick? What film do you watch and think, \"Yep, that's it.

        "content": "Who are some actors that you thought were from somewhere (e.g. American) only to later find out they weren't (e.g. Irish)?\n\nFor me, it's Matthew Rhys and Toni Collette, the two I can think off the top of my head at this moment.\n\nMatthew Rhys did such a great job in The Americans that I just assumed he was an American. I never noticed an accent slip. There's certain words that UK/Aussie's usually slip on if their accent skill isn't perfected.\n\nToni Collette for just everything I've seen her in. I think I saw a movie where her natural accent was used but I can't even think of it.\n\nBoth I just assumed were Americans until I randomly found out weren't.\n\nEdit: Yes, I made a mistake and put who's and not whose. I get it. Thank you",

It is a work of art visually, the writing is incredible, it\u2019s ingeniously funny while also being super deep at times, and the acting is superb; some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. I was so lost in the movie that I got sad when I realized it was almost over. I could\u2019ve watched a whole season of this. It\u2019s my new favorite movie hands down. I need to check out the director\u2019s other work because he is insanely talented. If you watch or have watched it, let me know what you think!!",

Philip Kaufman's 1983 epic \"The Right Stuff\" contains an extremely talented ensemble cast; Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI personally believe this film is one of the greatest films to ever don the screen - and I was lucky enough to catch a viewing of this film on 70mm. The cinematography is absolutley gorgeous, the acting is amazing and the screenplay is funny, uplifting, sad and inspiring.\n\nThis is the definition of a must watch!",
