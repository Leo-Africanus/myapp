(Here for context: https://youtu.be/jFNdcCqYgBg?si=38f-2BM6uROQ5QHD) There\u2019s no footage from the film, it\u2019s weirdly liminal and unsettling, and it\u2019s just a minute and a half of Robin Williams riffing. It\u2019s better than the movie itself.\n\nTeaser trailers are a lost art form. They don\u2019t exist to showcase the plot, but to intrigue people into finding out more, or to get them thinking about the movie long term. The teaser trailer eventually died, mostly because with the internet, you can announce when a movie is coming much easier than putting together a minute of unrelated footage, but it lives on in my heart.\n\nThat got me thinking, what are other people\u2019s favorite teaser trailers? What trailers got people excited for a movie without revealing too much information about the movie itself?",

Despite its thematic richness, it never loses it fun charm and clever wit. Not only that, we have very well-written nuanced characters that represents the relationship of the mind and the soul.

I mean.. with all the camp and cheesiness that that movie drips with as well? The grand swelling music, the multiple romantic love triangles, all the side stories, the wars, etc. Thanks in advance! \n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the wonderful recommendations! Very much appreciated ",
