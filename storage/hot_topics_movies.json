        "content": "*World-renowned detective Benoit Blanc returns for his most dangerous case yet.*\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nCast: Daniel Craig, Cailee Spaeney, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis, Thomas Haden Church, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Kerry Washington, Josh O'Connor\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wake_up_dead_man_a_knives_out_mystery)\n\n**Metacritic:** [85/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-review-daniel-craig-1236510178/)\n\n&gt;Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is an enticingly clever and droll, nearly pitch-perfect piece of murder-mystery fun \u2014 a whodunit that lives up to the expectations set six years ago by \u201cKnives Out,\u201d which offered its own perfect revival of the Agatha Christie spirit, with a tasty frosting of meta cheekiness.\n\n[TheWrap - Chase Hutchinson](https://www.thewrap.com/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-knives-out-3/)\n\n&gt;Although \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d is the \u201cKnives Out\u201d movie that\u2019s most preoccupied with existential questions surrounding death, writer/director Rian Johnson\u2019s third film in the series is also the one that\u2019s most full of life.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/09/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-1236510199/)\n\n&gt;After the bright, light, summery holiday special that was *Glass Onion*, the *Knives Out* franchise returns to its gothic roots with a wintry whodunit that, for some at least, might endure as the the best one yet. Where the first and second used the murder-mystery as a jumping-off point for some very funny contemporary satire, *Wake Up Dead Man* is much more introspective. In a funny way, it\u2019s a little analogous to *Joker 2*, not because it unloads on its audience in the same acerbic way but because it poses similarly metaphysical questions about its own popularity. Why do people respond so eagerly to stories of murder and betrayal? To answer that, director [Rian Johnson](https://deadline.com/tag/rian-johnson/) goes back to the greatest story ever told, using a small religious community as the setting for the third instalment.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-third-knives-out-1235149631/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;It works, and it\u2019s no big mystery why \u2014 Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.\n\n[Awards Radar - Joey Magidson](https://awardsradar.com/2025/09/07/tiff-review-wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-is-rian-johnsons-best-and-most-ambitious-installment-yet/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Filmmaker Rian Johnson trusts the strength of his franchise to play around with format and theme. The gothic elements on display, as well as the religious aspect, may initially seem like a left turn, but it all ends up fitting like a glove. He knows the must haves for a *Knives Out* flick and absolutely delivers. A few big sequences here at TIFF received ovations once completed. You just can feel that you\u2019re in the hands of a master storyteller, so you\u2019ll follow him anywhere. Johnson knows that and 100% makes the most of it.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-3-finds-god-and-is-so-good-because-of-it/)\n\n&gt;In terms of pure, heady kicks, it outpaces *Knives Out* but falls just short of *Glass Onion*. In the big picture, however, such distinctions are rather inconsequential; more important is that Johnson\u2019s franchise remains a sly and sure-footed delight, as well as demonstrates, with its religiously minded latest, that it\u2019s capable of coloring its Christie-esque mysteries in a variety of shades.",

She might be an author or something like that. There is a younger woman (potentially a man) who is like a mentee who kinds of ends up being her caregiver. She wants to be more and successful but the older woman is sort of dragging her down mentally.\n\nI believe the younger person is engaged, and the older woman is against that I think. The older woman is married and the husband is not around often. A lot of the movie takes place in the house. There are books, I think it ends in a garden.\n\nThe older woman might have dementia or some kind of illness. She\u2019s very snappy and manipulative.\n\nThe closest thing I\u2019ve found is The Lesson but it\u2019s not that.\n\nSlow burn drama. Not a ton happens. English language. Made in the last 10 years.\n\nScenes at dinner table, bathroom, bedroom, flowery garden.\n\nPlease help me.\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU REDDIT! You movie buffs did what AI couldn\u2019t. It was Shirley.

        "content": "For me, it was Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. I don't think that the movie is bad (it does has some cool scenes such as the Darth Maul fight scene) but I am saying this: we were all excited for the return of Star Wars after a 16 year hiatus, it was constantly hyped up, was the most anticipated movie of our lives and we were curious to know about the rise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader...\n\nInstead, we ended up getting Jar-Jar, a long podracing scene, CGI overload and corny dialogue that was written by a 7 year old. We waited 16 years for this film to come out and also, we get a sci-fi movie, disguised as a children's film for the first 2/3rds of the movie. It was a huge letdown at the time but despite this, I since have cooled down quite a bit on the prequels with the exception of Jar-Jar Binks as at least, it still has the Star Wars feel to it and a cool fight scene to Phantom Menace which is the Darth Maul fight scene with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.",

With Paul Newman leading the way, the wild Hanson Brothers, the rough old-school hockey feel, and jokes that still land today, what other hockey film really stacks up to its mix of laughs, fights, and pure chaos on and off the ice? I say nothing comes close. The Mighty Ducks was for kids, Mystery Alaska? Meh. Love to hear your opinions.",

So many Iconic European actresses: Tilda, Angela Winkler, Renee Soutjendiik, Sylvie Testud, Ingrid Caven, and then, there's the original leading lady, Jessica Harper. \n\nAs much flak as Dakota Johnson gets for her acting,I thought her performance as Susie was very good, even though they made some drastic changes with her character. Tilda is good as usual. I loved Mia Goth, her scenes are definitely the closest ones to Horror. Chloe Moretz has an unforgettable cameo. \n\nBut the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's very uneven. The political commentary felt pointless. And Tilda's stunt casting as an elderly man was distracting and mostly boring. It was like the Dominic Guard scenes in Picnic at Hanging Rock, a irritating distraction.",

        "content": "([https://archive.org/details/who-discovered-roger-rabbit-script-1998](https://archive.org/details/who-discovered-roger-rabbit-script-1998))\n\n**Writers:** Sherri Stoner &amp; Deanna Oliver\n\n**Note:** This was a script that was commissioned by Michael Eisner - as it was developed around the late-90s, after the original prior Toon Platoon prequel script (by Nat Mauldin &amp; Tony Sheehan &amp; Jeff Stein) was cancelled - although it retained the element of Roger searching for his mother, but Stoner &amp; Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, \"This Only Happens in the Movies\", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.\u00a0\n\nSteven Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI, but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film.\n\n\\*Attached is Stoner &amp; Oliver's November 20, 1998/1st draft -- Enjoy!",

I absolutely love the way that it's shot, a long with the score giving it a mythical or dreamlike feel at times. I was thinking recently about Tom Hardy and how his career trajectory has changed since the venom movies and I feel like he doesn't stand out as much as an actor anymore, and rewatching this movie reminded me just how great Tom Hardy can be. His role as Fitzgerald is genuinely his best in my opinion. The cinematography is stunning, the performances are bold, the violence feels real, and the desperation of Hugh Glass really is felt. Of course this movie won DiCaprio his Oscar and I feel that's well deserved despite some saying he tortured himself to get the Oscar. For the life of me I don't understand how so many people I know were underwhelmed with the movie upon its release. Have you revisited it recently? And if so, how have your thoughts on the film changed since release?",

        "content": "Or at least, as close to perfect as a film can get. \n\nIt had been years since I watched Jaws, probably since I was in high school as a freshman, and I just went a few days ago to see it in IMAX for its 50th anniversary. It felt like watching it again for the first time. What I couldn\u2019t believe was how, despite having watched the film countless times as a kid, and remembering everything even after not having seen it in years, it felt like the first time watching it again. The movie magic was there in a way I haven\u2019t felt in a really long time. This was driven home by the fact I really couldn\u2019t find a single flaw with this film. \n\nYes, some minor visual stuff with some shark props, but that\u2019s excusable since it\u2019s a film from 1975 and this was a 4K remaster. Of course there will be at least a few visual things to notice. I don\u2019t count that, because those weren\u2019t mistakes. Simply limitations of the time. The effect for the shark in the water still looks great, and the editing between the animatronic and live shark footage was seamless. The cinematography is still outstanding. Spielberg\u2019s use of long takes has always been my favorite staple of him. \n\nI truly think Jaws is about as close to a perfect film as you can really get. It truly is flawless from a filmmaking perspective, especially considering how troubled the production was, it\u2019s miraculous the movie even exists, let alone with the level of quality it has. Literally every single facet of the filmmaking was dialed to perfection, and Spielberg maintained this with a multitude of films in his career. Just breathtaking to finally see it on the big screen. It was a real treat.",
