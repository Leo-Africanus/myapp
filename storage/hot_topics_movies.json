        "content": "Hey\u00a0[r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/)! We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.\n\nSynopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father\u2019s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.\n\nTrailer:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M)\n\nWatch on MUBI:\u00a0[https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024)\n\nAsk us anything!

        "title": "'Apocalypse Now' is one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - cinematic experiences I've ever had",
        "content": "An ever-degrading fever dream. That's what watching Apocalypse Now I felt like. It probably didn't help that I watched it while coming down from a fever, sweating and a little uncomfortable, with an overcast, drizzling sky outside - but damn, the *atmosphere* this movie creates is second to none.\n\nIt's a bad trip that gets worse and worse, as Willard and his crew undertake their hellish odyssey down the river to find Kurtz. I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I was aware that Apocalypse Now is loosely based on that story. It's a masterful interpretation of that story, widening the scope and scale and making it feel somehow even more sinister.\n\nA lot of this is due to how the movie *looks.* Apocalypse Now might be the most visually stunning movie I've ever watched. It's frankly insane to me that it came out almost *50* years ago because it would still blow away pretty much anything released by even the best directors today. It looks so bold, lush and vibrant, with incredible shot composition and lighting. A sickly orange-yellow glow suffuses the landscape, and mist and fog always shrouds the horizon. It's like the characters are traversing through hell, and it adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie.\n\nIt also has one of my favourite cinematic interpretations of war in a movie. Sure, it shows war as bad, and Americans as imperialists and all of that. But more than that, in Apocalypse Now, war is much more abstract, a dark, primordial force that acts as both catalyst and conduit for humanity's darkest urges. It affects everyone. Killgore, Kurtz, the boys on the boat, Willard. Everyone becomes a beast prowling through the jungle. \n\nMarlon Brando's limited screen time is as impressive as advertised - both the writing and his performance, along with how he's shot - portray him as almost a mythical figure out of a twisted fairy tale. Kurtz is more a concept and an idea than a man. Martin Sheen is more restrained, but you can always see the madness just under the surface.\n\nAnd there's that steadily escalating nightmare-feel of the movie, and what makes it so damn incredible. Each sequence and set piece feels more surreal, bleak and unhinged than the last, culminating with the ritual slaughter/assassination at the temple that's one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I've seen in a long time. Honestly, even if you choose not to overanalyze the movie or interpret what it's trying to say, I think it would still be a 5-star watch based simply on the power of its audiovisual presentation alone. It's such a staggering achievement in filmmaking, I can't say enough about it.\n\nNote: I watched the 2 hr 27 min. theatrical cut. At some point in the future I'll probably check out Redux or The Final Cut",

A catastrophic event that changes the entire globe/area can occur, but if a few group survives, hey, it's all good. \n\nI love the \"random character says one thing out of context that pushes the plot forward\". Like in Die Hard with a Vengeance, some kid is like \"it's Christmas, you could steal City Hall\" and McClane is like \"OHHHHHHH, that's what the bad guys are doing\". Contrived way to push a plot forward, but I can enjoy it for being \"movie\" logic.",

        "content": "X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). \n\nIs there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? \n\nEdit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense \u2014 but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman\u2019s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don\u2019t discount it. ",

You expect movies to set a plot, to set up characters, to set up story, MMFR does everything without slowing down, and that's art for me.\n\nIt's like a video game where you follow the main character. It's like a heavy metal song you love. It's like the best TV series payoff you wait to happen for years. It's legit perfect. \n\nFrom the ridiculous guitarist belting riffs Iron Maiden would be proud of to the pole swinging assassins, it's just a feast for all senses. \n\nAnd, dare I say, if you little high, there not exists a better adrenaline inducing movie.\n\nCheers.

Boyhood really captured that through Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette\u2019s empathetic portrayals. \n\nLastly, I liked Hereditary on first viewing. It was so well acted and sad af, but it didn\u2019t scare me. (I\u2019d just gone through a traumatic event, so that might have made me numb in that regard). But Then I watched it with surround sound\u2026 in the middle of the night\u2026 in a secluded cabin\u2026 pretty high\u2026 and DAMN.

        "title": "Spielberg\u2019s directing is amazing even in his lesser movies",
        "content": "Was recently rewatching The Lost World and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to see how they hold up. Both of these films are absolutely flawed, but I am happy to say I really enjoy them, especially Lost World. \n\nStill, both of these movies have some of the dumbest fucking scenes I\u2019ve ever seen that I genuinely don\u2019t know how they got out of the writers room. Kicking the raptor out the window, Nuking the fridge, swinging with Monkeys, the entire character of Mac in Crystal Skull, all of that was pretty bad. \n\nBut man, there is some genuinely brilliant filmmaking in both, some of my favorite scenes from Spielberg ever. Everything with the T-Rex\u2019s in Lost World is incredible. The Raptors long grass scene, all impeccably shot and tensely crafted filmmaking. Lost World is far and away the best Jurassic Park sequel. I really enjoy the San Diego 3rd act but it does absolutely feel very disconnected from the rest of the film. \n\nI love Crystal Skull\u2019s opening at Area 51, vintage Indiana Jones, as well as the chase at the University. Love the chemistry between Shia Laboeuf and Harrison Ford, as they have a very interesting dynamic. I honestly think this movie is mostly very enjoyable, but definitely has the weakest 3rd act in the series. Everything after the Ants fight and waterfall is pretty stale. Still, the direction just has so much energy and urgency when compared to Dial of Destiny, which I think is good but slightly worse than Crystal Skull. Just nothing can beat Spielberg\u2019s directing. \n\n",
