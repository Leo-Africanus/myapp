They made it sound like he was the frontrunner, but when James Cameron asked him to do another take opposite Kate Winslet (without his southern accent) he said, 'No. That was pretty good. Thanks.'\n\nTom Hardy was so late to the set of \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" that he kept people waiting for horus for him--finally Charlize Theron had a verbal confrontation with him as a result because he did it so persistently.\n\nRaquel Welch - Apparently, she was constantly late on the set (\"The Biggest Bundle of Them All\"), keeping the cast and crew waiting for hours while she had her hair and make-up done. When co-star Edward G. Robinson went off on her in a 10-minute tirade, she burst into tears and apologized. But she showed up late the very next day.\n\nFaye Dunaway, according to Bette Davis. Reading the Mommie Dearest book, Diana Scarwid and Faye hated each other. Faye was constantly having scenes changed at the last minute, with changes that benefitted her. Diana was so appalled by Faye's behavior that she contemplated quitting the business for good after making the movie.\n\nFaye also got so into filming the scene where she chokes Christina that she wound up hitting Rutayna Alda in the chest. Jocelyn Brando was scared shitless that Faye was going to hit her as well.",

The shelves were full of clutter and the refrigerators had pictures all over them and colorful cereal boxes on top. \n\nNow everything looks like a staged showroom set and is perfectly clean. Is it a budget thing? \n\nI remember reading an article a few years ago that referenced Eyes Wide Shut and how the kitchen looked compared to new movies but I can't find it now so maybe someone here knows. \n\nIt's just so unrealistic. Especially in drama movies or tv shows. The houses literally are spotless and lifeless. I was watching When Harry Met Sally and the party scene at their friend's house struck me like wow, the shelves are full of books and clutter and rolled up newspapers and random knicknacks and it looked amazing and real. \n\nStuff now just feels...sterile.",

If the entire movie had been about what was revealed at the end \\[not giving any spoilers here\\], it could have been an interesting -- albeit entirely different -- movie.

It had magic, wizards, dragons, giants, elves, knights, kings, all sorts of mythological creatures and had an amazing worldbuilding. For people who like fantasy stories (you know like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter that sort of thing) is was gold at least as a kid. The only other show with such was Gummie Bears.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think any of the recent theatrical movies captured any of that, nor that the people behind them even saw the show. I think Hollywood execs think of the Smurfs in the most basic, elementary level, to be this:\n\n\u00a0\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A show about a wizard trying to capture these little things, like the Coyote and the Roadrunner and Tom and Jerry.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cute little mascots things that are good for marketing like the Minions or Trollz.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(and don\u2019t get me wrong, Tom and Jerry and Coyote and Roadrunner are of my favorite cartoons but I don\u2019t think Hollywood understand them either).\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn practice a live action adaptation of the Smurfs should not be like Alvin and the Chipmunks, should be like WILLOW.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019m not taking that comparison lightly. Is that literally there\u2019s the framework on how to make a good Smurfs movie based in both the comic and the cartoon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst you can choose a villain like Balthazar or Chloridris (yes, for those of you who didn\u2019t know because the movies always use Gargamel, the Smurfs have a whole rogue gallery of interesting and colorful villains) to hold the role of the BigBad, of the wizard-emperor/emperess of the realm like Bavmorda. Then you can add two human companions like Johan and Peewit (or choose other names, whatever) to be the human protagonists (like Willow and Madmartigan), and of course the Smurfs themselves. And if you want to use Gargamel (I personally will save him for the sequel maybe just referring to him offhand, like the Joker in Batman Begins/The Batman but\u2026) you can make him either someone Balthazar/Chloridris hires or forcebly recruits to chase the good guys or even put him in a \u201cenemy mine\u201d situation as Token Evil Teammate much like the last movie did. And is a fantasy film, you can add dragons, ogres, giants, elves, goblins, wizards\u2026 everything you want.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut instead they either brought them to the \u201creal world\u201d or make them into just a plot with such local and minimal stakes (like the Lost Village) that only works as the plot for an episode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyway that\u2019s my view on that. I do wonder about the recent film which is so bad:\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy they make the character of Razamel as main villain? Why not just use Gargamel anyway, is a reboot is not like they needed to \u201ctake care\u201d of any continuity or previous depiction of the character. And if they were going to make a new character maybe because they really didn\u2019t wanted Gargamel to be \u201cbad\u201d, why not use Balthazar? He\u2019s already a relative of Gargamel and would work as nostalgia call back to the cartoon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTho I guess you can ask the same on why they make Papa Smurf to be the kidnappee in distress, and then introduced what is basically another younger Papa Smurf (they could have just use any other smurf to be the McGuffin and just use Papa Smurf instead of a completely made-up, yet similar character).",

His cut of Kingdom of Heaven is still in my top 5 of all time list. I just think he's lost his touch (no offense, the guy is almost 90)",
