        "content": "So I was curious about little details from older movies that modern audiences might not realize or fully appreciate/understand.\n\nTake Jaws for example, the famous scene where Quint crushes the can of beer in his hand.  I didn't realize until someone pointed out to me that beer cans were much thicker and were made of steel instead of aluminum.  They were difficult to crush unlike modern cans and doing so was seen as a genuine feat of strength.\n\nOr something else I recently learned was that there was also an old etiquette rule where men who were seated would stand up if a woman entered the room out of respect.  This is now an outdated custom which has been in decline since the ~~90s~~ 70s.  \n\nI'm sure there are some people who might still do it especially in more formal settings, but at 25 this is a rule I was never taught.  \n\n*Edited for mistake and spelling \n\n*Thanks to everyone who commented, it's been fun reading your answers! I did not expect this to blow up like it did!\n",

Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/roofman-review-channing-tatum-1236510112/)\n\n&gt;In the end, it\u2019s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing. Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies all those years ago, as the star\u2019s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who\u2019s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith. While she plays Leigh as closed off to love, leave it to Tatum to find that unconventional point of entry.\n\n[TheWrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/roofman-review-channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-are-a-charmingly-doomed-couple-in-dark-rom-com/)\n\n&gt;The tonal juggling act isn\u2019t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give Roofman its life. It\u2019s a sad movie, really, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn\u2019t make sense, maybe it\u2019s the whole point.",

        "content": "I wonder why the movie bombed. Great reviews, great popular song, great story. Everyone I know who has seen it really likes it. Was it too dark to release in spring of 1986? Would a fall/winter release have been better?\n\nThe scene with an injured Sean Penn confronting Christopher Walken at his home is a master class in acting from Walken. Fear, bravado, nuance, resignation all in one scene. Brilliant.\n\nAnd the score by Patrick Leonard is iconic. Synth 80s moody. Loved it. Patrick Leonard tells the story of how Warner fought Madonna hard on releasing Live to Tell  first, or at all. As he said, there was nothing like it on radio, and it was a long song, with stops in the middle. Her voice was very low, and it was a huge departure for her. Madonna said if they didn\u2019t release it first she wouldn\u2019t do any videos for True Blue  singles. Pat said the execs at Warner were beyond angry at this power move and felt the song would flop hard. Madonna said it would be a hit. This cemented her control over her career.\n\nI'm still shocked the song wasn't nominated for an Oscar.",

'Gabby's Dollhouse' opens with $13.6M. 'The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2' debuts with just $5.8M. 'Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle' crosses $600M worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/gxdw9gv2l6sf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e413b513efedb7d45b8e2fb4b5afa72fc01437e3\n\nSeptember is coming to an end with three newcomers, and neither had a particularly impressive start.\n\nWarner Bros.'s ***One Battle After Another*** topped the box office, but its numbers are a far cry from its profitability prospects. DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** also had a soft debut, followed by an even worse performance overseas. But the week's worst performer was ***The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2***, which fizzled out from the original film.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $67.3 million this weekend. That's down 20.1% from last year, when ***The Wild Robot*** topped the box office and ***Megalopolis*** massively flopped.\n\nDebuting at #1, WB's ***One Battle After Another*** opened with $22 million in 3,634 theaters. And so, after 7 films, WB's streak of films debuting with $40+ million has come to an end. This debut is slightly below Leonardo DiCaprio's previous film ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($23.2 million). This was also Paul Thomas Anderson's first film to hit #1 and was his biggest debut, although that's not a high bar; none of his films started on wide release, none played at more than 2,000 theaters, and none earned more than $5 million on a weekend. \n\nOn its own, this would be a respectable figure. But there's one big problem: the film is carrying a gigantic $130 million budget. And so it goes from respectable to \"quite bad\". These numbers are eerily similar to the performance of ***Mickey 17*** earlier this year; it debuted with just $19 million on a $118 million budget before fizzling out quickly. One could argue that the film was made solely for acclaim or awards, but it's still a $130 million blockbuster with an extensive marketing campaign and a huge emphasis on IMAX. So its performance must be judged as a blockbuster.\n\nSo how could the film open this low? It's got a fantastic filmmaker teaming up with one of the most popular actors today, and the reviews are fucking fantastic (96% on RT, 95 on Metacritic). Wouldn't that translate into at least $30 million?\n\nFor starters, and this is something that it's a very sad truth, Paul Thomas Anderson is a stranger to the public. He's got the acclaim and awards, but his films have not connected with the public. His highest grossing film is ***There Will Be Blood*** with $40 million domestically. The rest of his films haven't cracked $30 million, and his last three films didn't even hit $25 million. With the exception of ***There Will Be Blood*** and ***Boogie Nights***, all of his films have flopped at the box office. And that's a huge shame, for he has delivered so much high quality for the decades. But audiences only recognize a few directors, and sadly, Anderson is not one of those directors.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is definitely a box office draw. Otherwise, the film wouldn't have opened to $20 million (and it's quite similar to ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** last year). But it's strange that this film opened below that film, considering it had a \"shorter\" runtime, more action and proper actor promotion (***Killers*** debuted during the SAG strike). While DiCaprio can attract audiences to theaters, seems like there's only so much he can do for a film like this.\n\nThe \"no marketing\" excuse can't be thrown here. WB mounted a very extensive marketing campaign, to the point that they even had a Fornite collaboration. It simply seems that the audience just wasn't interested in what the film had to offer, or the interest was smaller than expected. The first trailer also struggled to properly sell the film, focusing solely on DiCaprio and the cast going on crazy shenanigans. The second trailer properly sold the film's premise on a clearer angle, but it feels like the audience didn't want to give it a chance. With current tensions (both inside and outside America), it seems like audiences weren't in the mood for a story about revolutionaries.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 62% of the audience was male, and a colossal 77% was 25 and over. Those demographics are a bit concerning; it means young audiences didn't give a chance to the film, and that DiCaprio's presence failed to attract women to the film. 45% of the audience primarily watched the film for Anderson, and 41% for DiCaprio.\n\nAs an interesting stat, Deadline just reported that 72% of the film's performance came from blue counties. It overperformed in theaters located in blue counties by 13%, and underperformed in red counties by 24%. 51% of the film's attendance were in areas with populations north of 1 million. Compared to non-horror R-rated films, it over-performed in New York City (22% over the norm), San Francisco (+21%), Washington, DC (+26%) and Toronto (+61%). Two underperforming cities were Houston (-30%) and Dallas (-23%).\n\nNow, not everything is lost. Audiences gave the film a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which is the best of Anderson's career and the greatest score for DiCaprio since ***Titanic***. The film's older demographic also indicates that those don't neccessarily rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. With strong word of mouth and awards buzz, perhaps the film could leg out through October. It should definitely cross $70 million domestically. But is that going to be enough for this film? Look at the overseas section.\n\nIn second place, Universal/DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** debuted with $13.6 million in 3,500 theaters. That's DreamWorks' seventh lowest debut ever, and it goes all the way to top 5 worst if we adjust inflation.\n\nConsidering the film's tepid $32 million budget, this is not really a bad way to start. But it truly shows that a show's popularity doesn't always translate to a great result in the box office. Getting audiences invested in a ***Gabby's Dollhouse*** film was always going to be a challenge; it's a pre-scholar show with basically nothing for adults. Kids are obviously the main target, but adults are the ones who pay tickets and so it came a dilemma: will adults pay to watch something that their kids can watch at home in Netflix?\n\nAccording to Universal, 72% of the audience was female, and obviously the main demo was young girls. They gave it a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore, which is actually DreamWorks' first ever film to get that grade (crazy, right?). The film's advantage is that there's not much family competition through October, so it could leg out. For now, it should hit around $45 million domestically.\n\nDropping to third place after topping the box office for two weeks, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** continued its collapse. This time, it dropped 59%, adding $7.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $118.1 million so far, and it should finish with around $130 million.\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped 45%, adding $6.7 million. The film's domestic total stands at $161.3 million, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $180 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, Lionsgate's ***The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2*** mustered just $5.8 million in 2,690 theaters. That's down a very rough 51% from ***Chapter 1*** ($11.8 million), which debuted back in May 2024.\n\nThere was no way this film was gonna come close to ***Chapter 1***. Not only because they waited 17 months to release the sequel, which was already complete back then, but because the film also earned very poor reviews, signaling that there was very little interest in a follow-up. And if you were expecting the film to be an improvement, well, that's not really the case (16% on RT).\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 51% of the audience was female and 73% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a brutal \"C\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is the lowest in the franchise. Given the horror competition on its way, it would be a surprise if ***Chapter 2*** made it past $15 million domestically. And there's still a ***Chapter 3*** waiting to be released, so we'll see how low the floor can get.\n\nUniversal's ***Him*** fumbled hard on its second weekend. The film collapsed a horrible 73%, earning just $3.5 million this weekend. The drop is not a surprise, considering the film's very poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $20.7 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $30 million domestically.\n\n***The Long Walk*** keeps on walking with some good drops. Once again, it dropped just 47% and added $3.3 million this weekend. The film has earned $28.7 million, and it should get to over $35 million by the end of its run.\n\nIn eighth place, ***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** earned $3.3 million, for a 48% drop. The film has made $38.9 million, and it should finish with around $47 million domestically.\n\nFathom Events re-released Sam Raimi's ***Spider-Man*** trilogy, and they made $2.25 million this weekend combined.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was the Indian film ***They Call Him OG***, which made $1.4 million ($5.2 million four-day).\n\nAfter its horrible start last week, Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** pretty much died this week. It earned just $1.1 million, which was a very poor 66% second weekend drop. Romance films never drop that high. With just $5.7 million in 10 days, the film is going to lose so many screens. It won't make it much further than $7 million domestically.\n\nVertical released ***Dead of Winter*** in 605 theaters, but it could only make $1 million. It won't last long in theaters.\n\nSony also released Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut ***Eleanor the Great*** in 892 theaters, but it was a misfire with just $865,000 this weekend. Ouch.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***One Battle After Another*** debuted with $26 million overseas, for a $48 million worldwide debut. That's just a little bit better than the worldwide debut of ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($21 million overseas, $44 million worldwide). Anderson's biggest debut, but like the domestic market, not a high bar; none of his film has made more than $80 million worldwide. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.4M), France ($3.4M), Germany ($2M), Italy ($1.4M) and Saudi Arabia ($1.3M). Markets like South Korea, Japan, Turkey and China are left.\n\nThe one way to describe these numbers is \"incredibly soft\", but it's also close to \"bad.\" DiCaprio's films are known for legging out, but it's still a huge barrier for the film to reach the $300 million it needs to break even. We'll keep an eye on this one. At the very least, this film should win tons of awards. And with this film, WB has officially crossed $4 billion, becoming the first studio this year to achieve it.\n\n***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** added $19.2 million. As such, the film has crossed $600 million worldwide, the first anime title to do so. The best Crunchyroll/Sony markets are Mexico ($16.6M), Germany ($12.5M), France ($12.3M), India ($9M) and the UK ($8.4M).\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $15.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $436 million. The best markets are Mexico ($28.5M), the UK ($22.1M), France ($18M), Brazil ($16.4M) and Germany ($14.4M). \n\nIn Asia, ***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** added $7 million, for a $26 million overseas run. It will release in other markets through October.\n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse*** opened with a soft $5.5 million overseas, for a so-so $19.2 million worldwide debut. While it still has many markets left, that's not an encouraging sign for its prospects.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Jurassic World: Rebirth* | Jul/2 | Universal | $92,016,065 | $339,640,400 | $867,114,682 | $180M\n\n- Universal's ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** has closed its run with $339 million domestically and $867 million worldwide. Another big success in this dino trilogy, despite the very mediocre reception it has garnered. Universal did everything on its power to make sure the film got finished quickly and released here because reasons. And it paid off profit-wise. Although it didn't really change the fact that the franchise has continued its decline at the box office; going $1.6B &gt; $1.3B &gt; $1.0B &gt; $867M suggests that maybe you should work on improving the writing, you know?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe're getting three wide releases and a limited release.\n\nThe biggest release is actually not a film. It's ***Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl***, a special program for the release of Swift's new album, ***The Life of a Showgirl***. She already had a lot of power with ***The Eras Tour*** making over $260 million, and while this won't perform like that, it will still post some strong numbers. It was reported that the film has already sold $15 million in pre-sales in its first 24 hours across all circuits. But this event will only last one weekend.\n\nThere's also A24's ***The Smashing Machine***, the new film from Benny Safdie. It stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, following the life of former amateur wrestler and MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The film is sold pretty much on \"The Rock is acting\" and has been a point of praise in all the film's reviews so far. Reviews for the film are positive (but not exactly highly acclaimed), and maybe the audience will respond favorably to the film.\n\nIFC and Shudder are also releasing horror film ***Good Boy***, which tells the story of a haunted house from the perspective of a dog. The companies seem confident in the film, considering they chose to open it in wide release instead of starting slow. The budget is insanely low, so the chances of breaking out are on its favor.\n\nAnd in limited release, there's Focus Features' ***Anemone***. The film has one selling point: the return of the GOAT Daniel Day-Lewis after a 8-year absence, who co-wrote the film with his son Ronan (the director). Everyone knows he always delivers, and this is not going to be the exception. The film itself, however, won't. It's currently sitting at a middling 60% on RT and 48% on Metacritic, which is very poor for a platform release. With other adult dramas this month, it's likely that it will get lost once it expands wide next week.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "I can't believe I actually have something to add to this because I usually find something good to say about any movie that I choose to watch but holy shit my dad put on **Unsung Hero** the other day. Very misleading synopsis, that talked about faith but we assumed it meant faith in a more general, spiritual sense of endurance and perserverance, not actual religious faith, and we had imdb giving it a 7.0 so we gave it a go. We're not americans so we had no idea about the people the film was actually about. \n\nJust basically a movie about filthy rich, extremely religious white (australian) people that get some (~~debatably minor~~) setbacks in life but they endure with the help of their equally filthy rich, extremely religious white (southern american) friends. I get that they go from million dollar home to a middle class house with no furniture and they all have to chip in and help out with paying the bills and groceries but that's literally most of the lives of people I know lol. And then everything gets better because they are religious and have religious friends helping them out, giving them a car, giving them gifts for christmas, paying their hospital bills, etc and eventually getting the daughter a label deal basically. Oh and the absolute corniness of it all didn't help one bit. \n\nI don't know, I feel like a very specific group of people would enjoy this movie (~~christian southern americans~~) and that's completely fine if you do like it. But I don't see anyone else enjoying this movie.",

        "title": "I watched every Steven Spielberg film and ranked them (1971 to present)",
        "content": "I'd seen at least 60% of these before over the years so I decided to just start from the beginning and work my way through to the end. He really only has like three bad films, which is an amazing hit rate for someone with this big a body of work.\n\nRanked list below with some quick reviews on each movie. Let me know your thoughts and where you think i'm crazy for ranking something over another!\n\n34) **1941 (1979)** I just didn\u2019t give a shit about any of this. There\u2019s like 5 plot lines in this and I just didn\u2019t feel like any of them were interesting. For a farce this wasn\u2019t particularly funny, I didn\u2019t really laugh at any of this\n\n33) **The BFG (2016)** - At a certain point I just burst out laughing after the Queen of England had been on the screen for like 20 minutes already and it was clear she and the government were going to continue being a major part of the film. The military all coming in at that moment too was hilarious. Genuinely can\u2019t believe this ends with &gt;!the UK government carting off the giants to live in exile!&lt; what the fuck was this movie. Rare Spielberg miss\n\n32) **The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)** - Eh, this is fine I guess? Ian Malcolm doesn\u2019t really work as the main character and a lot of this feels like it doesn\u2019t understand what made Jurassic Park work, but this isn\u2019t as terrible as any of the other sequels at least. The gymnastics velociraptor kill really was quite stupid though lol\n\n31) **The Terminal (2004)** - The Diego Luna romance subplot is fucking ridiculous, like sure what the hell lol. This was mostly fine, just didn\u2019t really care for this\n\n30) **Always (1989)** - Spielberg's hallmark channel movie basically but I still weirdly liked this enough? The first act before Richard Dreyfuss becomes a ghost is actually pretty decent. The forest fires all the stuff with the firefighters and planes are all shot well. The dancing scene with Holly Hunter and all the firemen is weird af though \n\n29) **Munich (2005)** - Just never really felt like this grabbed me? It's not bad it's just not for me. There are other films that deal with the cycle of revenge and violence much better than this\n\n28) **Hook (1991)** - Hmmm I liked the first act and most of the setup, really didn\u2019t care for most of the stuff with the lost boys and then the climax and finale were a mixed bag. Not as bad as I was expecting but didn\u2019t love this. Production design and blocking and camera work is great as always though Stephen \ud83d\udc4d As much as I just didn\u2019t like for the kids I did find the \u201cis it really you Peter?\u201d and a few other moments sweet\n\n27) **Ready Player One (2018)** - I like parts of this but anything that\u2019s just like \u201cwoah! You like *reference*? I like *reference* too!\u201d immediately makes me roll my eyes. The scenes of people using the tech in the real world like in the climatic battle just looks so goofy. Everything in this regard from Wade\u2019s \u201cgamers rise up\u201d monologues to seeing the people fighting in the streets and showing up with their avatars just fell so flat with me \n\n26) **War Horse (2011)** - The first cavalry charge is a standout sequence, the close up first time a machine gun appears was especially cool framing and conveyed just how fucked the British were. Intercutting between the soldiers charging and empty horses jumping over machine guns was pretty harrowing. Spielberg did a great job showing the horrors of the First World War. Also, unironically, great performance from the horse lol. There are a number of close ups and zoom ins on a dramatic face he\u2019s making and I can\u2019t help but laugh sometimes at the melodrama \n\n25) **Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)** - Not nearly as bad as most people say. The first half of this is pretty good and even the bad stuff still has some good sequences. For every \"Mutt swinging on vines\" and \"PART TIME\" moments you get the motorcycle chase through campus and fight scenes around the big sea of evil ants\n\n24) **The Color Purple (1985)** - Great performances, always a sucker for a decades spanning drama. The Spielberg whimsical tone feels weird and doesn't really work all the time though.\n\n23) **West Side Story (2021)** - Rachel Zegler is fantastic in this (Ansel Elgort is there too). Camerawork and blocking is great as always though. \"America\", The dance at the gym and \"Cool\" where they play keep away with the gun are the standout songs.\n\n22) **Empire of the Sun (1987)** - Great performance from Christian Bale, easily up there as one of the better child actor performances i've seen. I cried a little at the end when he &gt;!finally reunites with his parents!&lt;. Spielberg is also amazing at directing organized chaos, the scenes during the attempted evacuation at the beginning and the military invading were especially good\n\n21) **The Sugarland Express (1974)** - A solid pretty straightforward picture. Love a good car chase and that's basically the whole film\n\n20) **The Adventures of Tintin (2011)** - Did not like the animation style at all but thought this was a lot of fun with a nice twisty turny mystery \ud83d\udc4d if only it didn\u2019t have to look like the polar express\n\n19) **Duel (1971)** - Crazy how Spielberg had so much juice right out the gate, this is such an impressive first feature that feels so fully formed. Love that the truck driver is like Jaws in that you basically never get a full good look at him\n\n18) **Bridge of Spies (2015)** - Liked this more than I remembered, forgot that this is basically a legal drama. Love the classic \u201cim a lawyer just trying to defend my client\u201d shtick as Tom Hanks is the only one who steps up for Abel\u2019s rights as literally everyone around him tells him he\u2019s a fucking idiot for wanting to give him a robust defense\n\n17) **Amistad (1997)** - Djimon Hounsou really shines in this, super underrated performance. The very opening scene where he manages to pick the lock on his shackles with the extreme camera closeups was a great way to grab your attention immediately. Rest of the ensemble also is great, when you\u2019ve got Stellan Skarsgard, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Matthew McConaughey all in one film together you know you\u2019re cooking.\n\n16) **Catch Me If You Can (2002)** - Not really a lot to say on this one, solid movie with a great cast and fun premise. A good movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon. Favorite part is when Frank pretends to be secret service with Hanratty\n\n15) **Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)** - Willie Scott is mostly insufferable but this is still pretty good! The third act and escape from the mine is my favorite part\n\n14) **War of the Worlds (2005)** - That first sequence where everyone realizes something is wrong with the weather up until after the aliens first attack was masterfully done, the panic in that scene was portrayed really well. Love how relentless this is, once the horrors start it really doesn\u2019t let up until the end\n\n13) **The Post (2017)** - When Streep finally makes the decision to publish (the first time) there\u2019s this amazing effect and release of tension I felt, which makes it all the more annoying this moment is kinda undercut when they basically do the exact scene again after they find out his source is the same as The Times\u2019, but that moment of Streep saying \u201cgo go go publish go go fuck it\u201d is so so so satisfying. \n\nReally cool choice watching the publishing decision trickle down after the fact to the reporters, editorial, then the physical printing machines and guys bringing the news around town. Also love how they shoot Nixon from afar and behind, really makes him feel menacing \n\n12) **Minority Report (2002)** - The depiction of the future in this one doesn't feel that far off from what we'll see one day. It's not the main focus of the film but the window dressing of stuff like \"eye scans that personalize advertisements\" is a great addition to this futuristic hell. Love that this is basically Spielberg's noir detective film\n\n11) **The Fabelmans (2022)** - Love the shot where Sammy sees himself filming his family breaking apart. The family drama and emotional core is really strong in this and the ending with &gt;!David Lynch as John Ford!&lt; is such amazing casting and a perfect way to end the film. If this was his last the ending and final shot of this would be an incredibly fitting way to close out the career of one of the greatest directors of all time.\n\n10) **Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)** - The initial scene where Neary first encounters the aliens when they look like headlights in his rear mirror is very well done. Crazy that he &gt;!abandons his family so quickly at the end to go on an alien spaceship lmao!&lt;.\n\n9) **Lincoln (2012)** - Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal as Lincoln. It\u2019s a cliched thing to say about him at this point lol but he totally disappears into the role. He brings this amazing physicality and gravitas to the performance which makes it all more shocking when you cut to his lifeless, crumpled body on the bed at the end of the film. I audibly said \u201coh nooo\u201d out loud when I realized he was heading to the theater at the end there. Really cool way they portray that part happening, ripping away the character we\u2019d just spent 2+ hours with offscreen was a great effect\n\nLove how the editing in this lets the scene and gazes between characters breathe before cutting to a new shot, it helps you really take in the detail and performance on screen.\n\n8) **Saving Private Ryan (1998)** - Opening D-Day sequence is so insane. I know historians say it was actually worse than what was shown on screen but like Jesus Christ what they do show is so fucked, just countless horrific death shown one after another. \n\nI love the calm before the storm moment in Act 3 before the nazis assault the bridge, each character gets a nice moment of reflection before it goes to hell. Each member of Miller\u2019s platoon feels so well developed despite the short time we spend with them, you really feel this bond and brotherhood formed between all of them \n\n7) **Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)** - Always crack up at the scene where Indy accidentally gets Hitler to sign the grail diary. There\u2019s a crazy range of emotions that Harrison conveys in the span of a second (mainly holy shit am I actually getting away with this) and it\u2019s basically all through his eyes, fantastic performance \n\nLove this movie to death but some of the grail tests at the end are kinda bullshit. Not to get all cinema sins-y, but like the \"penitent man kneels before god\" to dodge the massive blades that come out of the wall and kill you shouldn\u2019t take a genius to figure out lol. That and the \u201cleap of faith\u201d but actually a leap onto a pretty thick stone bridge that only works as an optical illusion from the most specific POV is like whatever, but it\u2019s fine! I\u2019ve just seen this a million times so at this point all I have are minor nitpicks\n\n6) **A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)** - The way this progresses and builds over the course of the film is masterful, it starts as a black mirror-y \u201cwot if ur son wos a robot\u201d type of story and escalates into something much different and darker than what I was expecting. The second it began with a narrator talking about how we almost killed ourselves because of climate change really struck a tone and I was hooked immediately \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever ended a Spielberg film feeling uncomfortable and unsettled (Schindler's list aside) but this left me with such dread after finishing, the final 30 minutes especially are incredibly bleak. When the narration kicks back in &gt;!underwater towards the end!&lt; I had such a pit in my gut . Hailey Joel Osment gives probably the greatest child actor performance of all time in this. He has a lot to do and so many different personas to play in this and he and manages them all exceptionally well\n\n5) **Schindler's List (1993)** - I held myself together mostly during this but the final 20 or so minutes had me weeping on the couch. It is kind of a big swing to end this the way it does with the &gt;!Schindler Jews visiting his grave with their acting counterparts!&lt; but it\u2019s such an earned ending and Spielberg handles it masterfully. What a picture\n\n4) **Jaws (1975)** - It's insane this is his third film. The final shark attack before the beach is closed is insanely well directed, the chaos of all the beachgoers fleeing is so well blocked and shot especially. \n\n3) **Jurassic Park (1993)** - Good picture \ud83d\udc4d\n\n2) **E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982)** - Wow! I must\u2019ve been in the wrong headspace or something when I first saw this a few years ago (I gave it a 3/5 when I first saw it in 2021) but I loved this on a rewatch. I love the kids dynamic especially, all three of them give such great performances and really do a good job of selling them all coming back together as a family again. ET looks great and is shot well especially in the first 30 or so when he\u2019s still a mysterious stranger to the audience. The film makes really great usage of lighting in all of his scenes which makes it really that more shocking when he\u2019s &gt;!found by the water in broad daylight half dead and shriveled up!&lt;\n\nThis score might be among John William\u2019s best, the final 20 minutes especially are genuinely stunning and moved me to tears\n\n1) **Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)** - The pacing in this is excellent, there\u2019s not an ounce of fat on the film really it just keeps chugging along. Like, Indy and Marion are locked inside the tomb and then 8 minutes later they're busting out and fighting the bald plane guy before then immediately speeding along to recapture the Ark, the film really just does not let up at all in the best way. Very fun and quintessential summer film",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I was rewatching The Godfather Part II and noticed something that stuck with me. Toward the end of the movie, there\u2019s that scene where Michael is meeting with Al Neri, Rocco, and Tom Hagen to plan the hit on Hyman Roth.\n\nWhile they\u2019re talking, Michael is holding and eating an orange. What caught my attention is the way he eats it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t peel the whole fruit first like most people would. Instead, he kind of tears it open and eats from the middle, pulling out sections as he goes.\n\nIs this just a normal way of eating mandarins/tangerines back then, or is it meant to look unusual? Did anyone else find that odd?",

Parker (Mark Wahlberg), along with Grofield (LaKeith Stanfield), Zen (Rosa Salazar) and a skilled crew, stumble onto a score that pits them against the New York mob in this gritty, clever caper.*\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, LaKeith Stanfield, Rosa Salazar, Keegan Michael-Key, Chukwudi Iwuji,\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [66%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_dirty_2025_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [55 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/play-dirty/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Collider - Nate Richard](https://collider.com/play-dirty-review-mark-wahlberg-lakeith-stanfield-shane-black/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;If you watch *Play Dirty* expecting something on the level of *The Nice Guys* or *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, you will be disappointed. However, the latest action-comedy from Black proves that he's still capable of delivering an equal parts funny and action-heavy comedy with all the trademarks that make us love him as a filmmaker. It's a straight-to-streaming movie starring Mark Wahlberg, and considering some of the movie star's other recent films, such as *The Family Plan* and *The Union*, *Play Dirty* is far better than you'd expect it to be.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/play-dirty-movie-review-prime-video-mark-wahlberg-1235153455/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;More to the point, it\u2019s a \u201cParker\u201d reboot with an eye toward franchise potential, which is something about it that would\u2019ve made Westlake happy (he only allowed productions to use that name if they agreed to produce a whole series of films based on his books). And while this isn\u2019t *quite* the stuff of vintage Black, it\u2019s close enough that I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing him crank another one out every two years for the next decade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/play-dirty-review-mark-wahlberg-amazon-prime-video-movie/)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n&gt;You can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, but you have to know how to crack them, or you could end up with a bowl full of shells. And you have to know how to cook them, or else they lose their texture. \u201cPlay Dirty\u201d makes for a decent omelette, but the recipe is a little off, and that\u2019s annoying because we\u2019re hungry for a great Parker movie. We\u2019ve had a lot of adaptations, actually, but only a few did the job right (John Boorman\u2019s \u201cPoint Blank\u201d remains the gold standard). But if you\u2019re starving for caper flicks, \u201cPlay Dirty\u201d is just hard-boiled enough to satisfy. It just isn\u2019t up to Parker\u2019s own high, and highly professional, professional standards.",
