        "content": "*William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes, celebrate the birth of their son, Hamnet. However, when tragedy strikes and Hamnet dies at a young age, it inspires Shakespeare to write his timeless masterpiece \"Hamlet.\"*\n\nCast: Paul Mescal, Jessie Buckley, Joe Alwyn, Emily Watson\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamnet)\n\n**Metacritic:** [95/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hamnet/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Vulture - Bilge Ebiri](https://www.vulture.com/article/hamnet-review-the-most-devastating-movie-ive-seen-in-years.html)\n\n&gt;*Hamnet* is devastating, maybe the most emotionally shattering movie I\u2019ve seen in years. I did not really expect to cry *this* much. That\u2019s not just because of the tragic weight of the material, but because the picture reimagines the poetic act of creating *Hamlet*. Shakespeare\u2019s play sits on the highest shelf, fixed by the dust from centuries of acclaim. It is about as unimpeachable as a work of art can be. And yet, here is a movie that dares to explore its inception. The attempt itself is noble, and maybe a little brazen; that it succeeds feels downright supernatural.\n\n[Clayton Davis - Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/hamnet-telluride-oscars-buzz-jessie-buckley-paul-mescal-1236500107/)\n\n&gt;The moving and fictionalized portrait of grief and loss that inspired one of history\u2019s most treasured playwrights held the audience in its grip for 125-minutes, where audible sounds of sniffles and crying filled the venue, testifying to the film\u2019s emotional depth.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Daniel Howat](https://nextbestpicture.com/hamnet/) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Devastating in all the best ways, this is a gut-wrenching tale of the way grief pulls us apart, and how we try to pull ourselves back together again. Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s naturalistic, sensitive direction helps the heavy emotions take center stage. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal have never been better.\n\n[The Playlist - Gregory Ellwood](https://theplaylist.net/hamnet-review-jessie-buckley-paul-mescal-are-utterly-extraordinary-in-chloe-zhaos-expressionistic-wonder-telluride-20250830/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;But despite some stellar sequences throughout the entire film, Zhao saves her gut-punch for the final act. There are two moments in the last ten minutes of \u201cHamnet\u201d that may stick with you for months on end.\n\n[Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/hamnet-review-jessie-buckley-1236502623/)\n\n&gt;As conceived by \u201cNomadland\u201d director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, \u201cHamnet\u201d is so emotionally raw as to be almost excruciating at times, featuring a heroic performance from Jessie Buckley as Shakespeare\u2019s wife and the mother of his children \u2014 although as presented, she could be the mother of us all \u2014 the grounded, near-shamanic spirit forced to confront the death of her son, Hamnet. Meanwhile, Paul Mescal plays Shakespeare, who pours his grief into \u201cthe Danish play,\u201d but both the actor and character are eclipsed by the feminine elements of this story.",

My thoughts: what a bizarre, unique, gem of a movie. Hard to even categorize. Yes it's a comedy, but only because it accurately reflects the absurdity of Stalinist politics. It manages to be over the top while staying basically true to history. The chaos, performative grief, scheming, and backstabbing following Stalin's death is played perfectly by a cast of heavy-hitters who make it all the more farcical by playing it straight. Overall, I really liked this movie, but it's probably not for everyone. Thoughts?",

While Netflix is giving this visual feast just a three-week theatrical run ahead of its streaming debut, it begs to be experienced on the big screen.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi/):\n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is a remarkable achievement that in a way hijacks the flagship story of the horror genre and turns it into a tale of forgiveness. James Whale, one suspects, would approve \u2013 and Mary Shelley, too.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/frankenstein-review-jacob-elordi-guillermo-del-toro-1235147197/) (B):\n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s second Netflix movie is bolted to the Earth by hands-on production design and crafty period detail. While it may be too reverently faithful to Mary Shelley\u2019s source material to end up as a GDT all-timer, Jacob Elordi gives poignant life to the most emotionally complex Frankenstein monster since Boris Karloff.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/30/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi star as the freethinking anatomist and his creature as Mary Shelley\u2019s story is reimagined with bombast in the director\u2019s unmistakable visual style\n\n[RadioTimes](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/frankenstein-review-2025-guillermo-del-toro/) (5/5):\n\n&gt;Perhaps its hyperbole to call the film del Toro\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 especially a story that has been told countless times. But this is a work that is the accumulation of three-and-a-half decades of filmmaking knowledge. Gory and grim it may be, but it is a tragic tale told in a captivating manner.\n\n\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nWritten and Directed by Guillermo del Toro:\n\n&gt;A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.\n\nCast:\n\n* Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein\n   * Christian Convery as young Victor\n* Jacob Elordi as the Creature\n* Mia Goth as Elizabeth Lavenza\n* Christoph Waltz as Henrich Harlander\n* Felix Kammerer as William Frankenstein\n* Lauren Collins as Claire Frankenstein\n* Lars Mikkelsen as Captain Anderson\n* David Bradley as Blind Man\n* Sofia Galasso as Little Girl\n* Charles Dance as Leopold Frankenstein\n* Ralph Ineson as Professor Krempe\n* Burn Gorman as Fritz",

Because of this strong connection to my every day problems of living in a society who is commenting unspeakable crimes against humanity this movie hit me even harder. i never cried so hard, 30 minutes of tiers going down my face. I think that in order to understand the terrors of war every, person in Israel should watch this masterpiece. ",

The relationship itself was never one built on genuine foundation, but I did love her despite it all. Since then, I\u2019ve felt very lonely, dissatisfied and regretful. Ive had days where I feel amazing but just this undercurrent. Ive seen \u201cher\u201d a few times, once when I was 15, when I was 21 and now. I really appreciate it now. I do use Ai for advice here and there and can\u2019t believe how ahead of its time it is. What I love is such an odd story has such a real connection with me, it shows how amazing love and connection can be, but also just how heartbreaking it can all be, how your Identity is attached to someone else. The colour, imagery music is perfect. This movie breaks my heart but also makes me realise how normal my fucking problems are. Long live the movies!! ",

        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/after_the_hunt): 50% (20 reviews) with 6.10 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/after-the-hunt/): 56/100 (11 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Sure, it\u2019s exciting to watch Roberts sprout horns and turn spiky with defensiveness in another great scene when a student questions whether she \u201ccondones othering someone rather than advocating against it.\u201d But we deserve more substantial compensation after spending more than two hours with these people.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-1236356837/)\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ultimately isn\u2019t against-the-grain enough. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie \u2014 he is one of the best filmmakers working \u2014 but \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d isn\u2019t enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/after-the-hunt-review-1235148028/): C\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has been made with a fair amount of craft and intrigue, but it\u2019s also a weirdly muddled experience \u2014 a tale that\u2019s tense and compelling at times, but dotted with contrivances and too many vague unanswered questions. That\u2019s why, in the end, it\u2019s a less than satisfying movie. Do not expect box-office fireworks.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-1236501798/)\n\n&gt; Like most of Guadagnino\u2019s movies, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is very stylish and a lot of fun in a serious kind of way; it\u2019s also a little arch and very self-aware, which the director admits with the last line of the film. The end credits may go back to looking like Woody, but the feel you\u2019re left with is definitely Luca.\n\n-[Steve Pond, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-ayo-edebiri-luca-guadagnino/)\n\n&gt; Naturally, everyone including Alma gets sucked into the scandal, where lofty philosophical principles play less of a role than their proponents might have liked to think. It\u2019s a film that prowls around with blood in its nostrils, watching us as intently as we watch it, and waiting for just the right moment to strike.\n\n-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/julia-roberts-after-the-hunt-review/): 5/5\n\n&gt; Luca Guadagnino misfires with this bafflingly overlong, overwrought #MeToo campus accusation drama from screenwriter Nora Garrett, broadly in the tradition of David Mamet\u2019s Oleanna or Neil LaBute\u2019s The Shape of Things. It is worryingly muddled and contrived, perhaps in need of further script drafts to excavate a clearer and more satisfying drama inside.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/29/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-ayo-edebiri-andrew-garfield-yale): 2/5\n\n&gt; While the picture could have used more drive, perhaps one virtue of its bagginess is the space it creates to provoke. There will be some who dismiss After the Hunt right out of the gate, because they\u2019ll see any attempt to address such issues as playing into the hands of cynical opportunists who reject progress precisely because it is progress. Then there will be those who adore it simply for daring to bring up such seemingly taboo matters. In truth, the movie seems engineered to let each viewer see what they want in it, both the good and the bad. After the Hunt might be confused, and it might even be unsatisfying \u2014 but it also refuses to coddle anyone, and that feels like some sort of victory.\n\n-[Bilge Ebiri, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-after-the-hunt-doesnt-have-that-much-to-say.html)\n\n&gt; It won\u2019t be a watercooler movie in that respect, and it may be a shock to unwary audiences lured in by Roberts\u2019s star wattage. But it could mark another milestone for the actress, being her strongest role since 2000\u2019s Erin Brockovich and an astonishing performance in its very own right. Lars Von Trier, eat your heart out.\n\n-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/08/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-andrew-garfield-1236501325/)\n\n&gt; There are some interesting ideas in After The Hunt, Luca Guadagnino\u2019s star-studded #MeToo treatise; the corrupting nature of privilege, the pandemic of entitlement, toxic feminism and the ideological gulf between generations. And the Italian filmmaker knows how to make a handsome film, the lofty Ivy League spires of Yale University providing a lavish background for this tale of elitism gone sour. Ultimately, however, the film\u2019s inflated self-importance serves to not only overwhelm but also undermine its finer points.\n\n-[Nikki Baughan, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/after-the-hunt-review-julia-roberts-heads-luca-guadagninos-problematic-metoo-drama/5208358.article)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nA college professor is forced to grapple with her own secretive past after one of her colleagues is faced with a serious accusation.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\n**WRITER**\n\nNora Garrett\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nTrent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nMalik Hassan Sayeed\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nMarco Costa\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- August 29, 2025 (Venice Film Festival)\n\n- October 10, 2025 (worldwide)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n139 minutes\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Julia Roberts as Alma Imhoff\n\n- Ayo Edebiri as Margaret \"Maggie\" Resnick\n\n- Andrew Garfield as Henrik \"Hank\" Gibson\n\n- Michael Stuhlbarg as Frederik Imhoff\n\n- Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as Dr. Kim Sayers",
