        "content": "Holy shit. I just watched this movie for the first time and I\u2019m sitting here unpacking it and I\u2019m falling more and more in love with it.\n\nI enjoyed the movie but wasn\u2019t blown away\u2026until I started thinking about what every little thing meant, and damn it touches on so many things.\n\nGRIEF\n\nObviously the movie as a whole explores coping with grief, or rather avoiding grieving, and each of the brothers avoids this in a different way.\n\nSEARCH FOR ANSWERS/MEANING\n\nInteresting how they all missed their dad\u2019s funeral but have come all this way to figure out why their mum never went. Almost as if that will help them understand why they themselves never went. But we see that she herself doesn\u2019t have the answers. We also kind of see how we inherit things from parents (in a psychological sense).\n\nFRANCIS\u2019 BANDAGES &amp; NEED FOR CONTROL\n\nHe\u2019s so focused with being in control and hiding his vulnerability. Cool how it\u2019s when he loses control (the train literally getting lost) that he has his most spiritual moments. Love that he chooses to take his bandages off and show his scars. At the end, he\u2019s bandaged again but he\u2019s healing now.\n\nPETER &amp; ALSO HIS DAMN SNAKE\n\nTrying to contain something dangerous but then it gets out. Metaphor for negative emotions? Also him wearing his father\u2019s glasses the whole time that he can\u2019t even see out of because the prescription is wrong. Also is that why he had headaches?\n\nLUGGAGE\n\nLiterally carrying their dead dad\u2019s baggage with them on this spiritual journey until the very end when they choose to let go and move forward.\n\nIDEALISATION OF EASTERN CULTURE\n\nBut having no real respect or understanding of it.\n\nJACK EXTERNALISING EVERYTHING\n\nHaving his depresso soundtracks playing, his short stories that have \u201cfictional characters\u201d, his freaking mace.\n\nSEE NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL ETC.\n\nMight be a stretch, but the bandaged head, the glasses and the stache?\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed so much but just wow.",

Kidman had amazing acting aswell like a mother who hides her emotions in front of their kid, seen in the last scene truly mesmerizing with great meaning. Bill goes onto wandering around trying to truly spike his masculinity while still having the thoughts of his wife in his head, Numerous amounts of times. the relationship turns truly toxic where nicole cheats in her \u201cdreams\u201d signifying she had been to one of those parties before and bill cheating in real life or his \u201cdaydream\u201d even though he couldn\u2019t actually do it, his inner conscious always stops him like when he went to the bar to visit his old friend instead of fucking an escort.\n\nThe parties signifying what the elites really do and half of them being pedophiles was a great message sent by Kubrick on how they all have sex cults and are fucked up morally, It may be a reach but the parties did look at lot like the rothschild parties lol.\n\nThe ending really proved the statement said above as the cycle repeats and the elites get what they want.",

        "content": "Sometimes a movie comes out and is completely rejected or beloved by the public, but as the years and decades pass the cultural opinion on it shifts. What movie comes to mind for you?\n\nA big one for me is Batman &amp; Robin. As a gay kid in 1997 this movie was everything to me. The camp, the excess, the stupid puns, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze, the bat nipples, all of it! The movie was widely hated, mocked by its own star, and plans were scrapped for Schumacher\u2019s next Batman movie. The Adam West-ish tone didn\u2019t fly at all in 1997, and resulted in the deeply serious Batman films we still get today. \n\nAlmost 30 years later, I see so much love for this movie all over social media. People seem to have embraced it for the campy, ridiculous good time that it is. Maybe they were kids like I was at the time and we\u2019ve reclaimed it as our own. It\u2019s interesting to see how opinions shift over time. ",

        "content": "The sci-fi romantic comedy is incredibly fresh, the chemistry between the leads is off the charts, and it\u2019s genuinely a great love story for two very disillusioned people.\n\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are incredibly charismatic on their own, but put them across each other in a bickering back and forth and you have genuine gold. And the reason I\u2019m not talking about plot stuff is because it\u2019s fundamentally better to go into this blind. This is a treat, treat yourself.\n\nAlso JK Simmons hunts Andy like an animal. So there you go.",

        "content": "Why is it so hard to find? \n\nWhen I started game emulation about 20 years ago I saw the game in my list of ROMs, i remembered the film being around, it was advertised inside a VHS cover or two and I have seen adverts on TV for it but I am not sure if they were for the film being in cinemas or because it was shown on TV at some point here in the UK. \n\nRecently I looked up streaming services that have it and there aren't any in English, i've tried buying it and it's available on VHS and DVD for more than I am willing to pay. \n\nI know it wasn't the most popular or well known film and it was quickly forgotten but I figured it would be relatively easy to find in 2026. I have never seen it and i vary between forgetting about it and looking for it but I have never actually seen it on physical media. I am sure I could download it but that doesn't answer the main question which is why is it not widely distributed like other Robin Williams films? Is it a rights issue or is there something sinister about the film that has caused it to not be deemed as controversial (similar to Song of the South)?",

His body is constantly being flopped around &amp; comforted into poses.\n\nI'm not surprised to find out that he broke three ribs during the course of filming. A lot of the dangerous bits were carried out by a stunt double.  Still there was a lot required of him due to his face needing to be onscreen. ",
