What a perfect slasher.  First of all, there is no fat in this movie.  It jumps right into the darkness, with Loomis driving with the psychiatric hospital nurse, stumbling upon the patients walking around outside in the dark.  The atmosphere is eerie and unsettling.  I never realized how much heavy mask breathing from Myers stalking perspective there was.  It was super creepy.  You've got Laurie just trying to go about her day babysitting on Halloween night and the movie has a nice slow burn to it building up to a boil as Myers inches closer.  The cinematography is great.  There are countless iconic scenes.  Now I need to re-watch part two and see how it holds up.  Is the original Halloween still your favorite in the franchise?",

I need some finely directed movies that capture the vibes of a lone wolf terrorising a vilage / town.\n\nBonus- It would be my greatest pleasure to watch a scene where our good folks escape the forest in a horse carriage with those werewolves in pursuit.Thanks!",

        "content": "Rita is aware of how it all works, and that the day will reset when Cage dies.\n\nAt one point she is training him, but he\u2019s injured, and so to save time she just shoots him to reset the day and start again. That\u2019s fine, apart from\u2026 what will happen to her the moment he dies?\n\nWill everything immediately reset, effectively meaning instant \u2018death\u2019 for that version of her, given that she won\u2019t remember any of this? In which case it\u2019s the same as if she had put the gun to her own head and pulled the trigger. Or will her universe carry on, in which case presumably she is arrested and locked up for shooting a man in the head (unless she can get out of it somehow) and then she has to wait for death when the Mimics overcome everyone?\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, then fact that they\u2019re going to \u2018try again\u2019 means absolutely nothing to her, in a way! If someone told me that I was about to die, but not to worry, a version of me would wake up tomorrow, not remembering any of this, and win the lottery, then I wouldn\u2019t be happy, I\u2019d be terrified! The only thing that makes me \u2018me\u2019, is the string of consciousness and memories that I\u2019ve had since I was a child.\n\nSo yeah, every time he was resetting, he\u2019s effectively killing (or condemning to certain death) the Rita who he\u2019s brought that far with him, and she really should have been more alarmed/scared about that prospect.",
