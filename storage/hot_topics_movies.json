        "content": "What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. \n\nI am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",

        "content": "This movie came out over 10 years ago; I don't think I have to litigate its quality to anyone here. \n\nI originally saw this movie in 2014, a couple years after it released. I figured, it's no match for Shaun of the Dead, which I grew up watching from when I was 10, and not as clever as Hot Fuzz. It was just a lukewarm movie that I got a handful of laughs out of. \n\nIt wasn't until I entered adulthood that I realized how much this movie spoke to who I am as a person. It laid bare my inadequacies far clearer than any media I have ever viewed.\n\nI think the vast majority of viewers see Gary King as a pitiful character. Some may have even known someone like him. \n\nOne thing that has always struck me about this movie in later years is that it felt like it was talking directly to me in its plot points and characters.\n\nGary King is not just a fictional character. He's me. I've never felt more affinity for a fictional character than hearing Gary's monologue towards the end of the film. \n\n\"That was supposed to be the beginning of my life. All that promise and fucking optimism. It was a big lie. Nothing happened.\"\n\nFuck, man. I watched this shit for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, out of obligation for Shaun and Fuzz at the time. I had no idea it would go on to describe an essential part of who I was for 10 years. \n\nI like to think that most people empathize with Gary here, but some of us really are that fucking pathetic to hold on to our \"glory days\" all these years later. For some of us, it really was all we ever had.\n\nIt never got better than that night.",

        "content": "This movie wasn\u2019t supposed to surprise me. The ending was spoiled for me long before I even hit play nd to make it worse i had already seen a few key shots on YouTube so going in I thought, 'What is left to enjoy?' Turns out , everything lol\nEven knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn\u2019t expect. It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !!\nThe cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requires effort, humility nd courage.\nSpeaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layeered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real like you kinda have met them before lol tthe stubborn one , the quiet one , the loud one who doesn\u2019t shut up etc ..nd yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn\u2019t overdo anything like he keeps it simple , letting the dialogue nd performances do all the heavy lifting lol . As much as I loved the movie , it doesn\u2019t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don\u2019t get me wrong this is smart, layered nd almost flawless but it is more cerebral than emotional ,I honestly didn\u2019t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker nd more tragic stories. It challenged me sure but it didn\u2019t hit as hard as I expected\nAnyway even spoiled, 12 Angry Men is a masterclass in filmmaking nd that is how you know it is a damn good film",

The film is a clear love letter to Elliot Miller and the other men in Mendoza\u2019s unit, but the verisimilitude with which it recreates the worst day of their lives \u2014 when measured against the ambiguity as to what it hopes to achieve by doing so \u2014 ultimately makes \u201cWarfare\u201d seem like a natural evolution of Garland\u2019s previous work, so much of which has hinged on the belief that our history as a species (and, more recently, America\u2019s self-image as a country) is shaped by the limits of our imagination.\u00a0\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \\- [G.

But the director\u2019s skill with the compressed narrative would be nothing without the rigorous sense of authenticity and first-hand tactical knowledge that Mendoza brings to the material \u2014 and no doubt to the commitment of the actors.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Brianna Zigler](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/brianna-zigler) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Simply depicting the plain, ugly truth of human combat makes *Warfare* all the more effective as a piece of art setting out to evoke a time and place. The bombing set piece is equal parts horrific and thrilling; the filmmakers draw out the sensory reality of the slaughter as the men slowly come to, disoriented, ears ringing, ultimately leading to a frenzy of confusion, agita, and howling agony. The cacophony of torment and its reaction in the men meant to arrive with help is as grim as the bureaucratic resistance to send in medic vehicles to give the wounded any chance to survive their injuries.\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Alex Garland has now constructed what could be called his trilogy of violence... Warfare, at least, is the most successful of the three, because its myopia is a crucial part of its structure. Garland and Mendoza do, at least in this instance, make careful, considerate use of the film\u2019s framework. We\u2019re shown how US soldiers invade the home of an Iraqi family who, for the rest of *Warfare*\u2019s duration, are held hostage in a downstairs bedroom, guns routinely thrust into their faces. In its final scene, they reemerge into the rubble of what was once their home, their lives upended by US forces and then abandoned without a second thought. It\u2019s quite the metaphor.\n\n[Daily Telegraph (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/921) \\- [Robbie Collin](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/robbie-collin) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s necessarily less sweeping than Garland\u2019s recent Civil War, and for all its fire and fury plays as something of a philosophical B-side to that bigger earlier film. I\u2019d certainly be uncomfortable calling it an action movie, even though vast tracts of it are nothing but. It leaves questions ringing in your ears as well as gunfire.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such as Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s The Hurt Locker or Nick Broomfield\u2019s Battle for Haditha, or indeed Brian De Palma\u2019s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn\u2019t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.\n\n[Times (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/823) \\- [Kevin Maher](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kevin-maher) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;This is a movie that\u2019s as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It\u2019s a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\n\n[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \\- [Gregory Nussen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/gregory-nussen)\n\n&gt;While it aims for an unromantic portrait of combat, it can only conceive of doing so through haptic recreation in lieu of actual characterization. The result is a cacophonous temper tantrum, a vacuous and perfidious advertisement for military recruitment.\n\n[London Evening Standard](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/446) \\- [Martin Robinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/martin-robinson) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;Given all the America First stuff going on, and the history of the Iraq War, Warfare may suffer from a lack of sympathy for American military operations. And yet, the sheer technical brilliance and strength of performances, cannot fail to connect when you take on the film on its own terms, as pure human experience in the most hellish of circumstances.",

(I consider films to be literature, not just books)\n\nAs such, we would like to come up with a list of essentially the western canon, but in film. \n\nWhat are the movies you think everyone should watch, movies that set up or include structures seen in other works, movies that expose people to classic storylines, even if not the original story, and movies that are, above all, entertaining?\n\nBonus points if the movie is known to have a great Spanish dub. We want to avoid subtitles for now. \n\nShrek would be a movie I consider part of the western canon, for example, and it has a great Spanish dub, but I would not feel it\u2019s a good option to start them with it given that it requires knowledge or familiarity fairy tales, fantasy tropes, and satire to enjoy.\n\nSo, with this in mind, what are some films you think would be good for the goal of exposing our parents to these movies and build up their cultural knowledge, worldly experience, and enjoyment?",
