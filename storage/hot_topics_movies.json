The incredible score by Hans Zimmer elevated this moment to pure sexual tension, however they only share one gentle kiss. Not something I would consider sexual. \n\nAre there any other scenes that come to mind? ",

It feels ethically wrong that voice actors didn\u2019t get placed, but they hired popular stars for faceless roles. I didn\u2019t even know Ant Mackie was the 3rd-most present role\u2026did he do this WHILE doing Cap America??\n\nThis seems to be a trend among Disney-type projects, to blow up a budget in stupid ways. Were they expecting people to cheer for Woody Harrelson *not using his talent* as a peanut?\n\nWhen they marketed Little Mermaid, did they expect 8-year-olds to hear Awkwafina and go, \u201cMother, Father, a sassy trending comedian I don\u2019t know is in this remake of a movie I\u2019ve never seen. We MUST see it.\u201d ?? \n\nNo hate at all to these celebs, it just seems like the budget &amp; the voice union get shafted by the industry\u2026",

I recently found out that it was released 5 years before the first Matrix, and had already been used on a French film soundtrack (oddly enough called Clubbed to Death).\n\nSo let me know of your example.",

Michael Parks is brilliant(rip). David Carradine(rip) is fantastic. But a personal favorite is Budd\u2019s boss Larry played by Larry Bishop. This guy owns his scene.",
        "content": "Kill Bill is just an embarrassment of riches as far as actors is concerned. You watch these people and wonder how they aren\u2019t in everything. But Larry Bishop. Budd\u2019s boss. I watched Kill Bill when it came out as a teenager and this guy just jumped off the screen. \u201cGo ahead, be somebody baby\u201d. Who is this guy? He looks like a Jewish Al Pacino.\n\nLike\u2026just watch this guy play the scene. When he leans back, looks at Budd and says \u201cand, that hat. That fuckin hat. How many times have I told you?\u201d. It\u2019s such a small scene but this leaves an impression. We know Budd could destroy this guy and yet Larry feels like the most intimidating man on the planet. \u201cFuckin with your cash is the only thing you kids understand\u201d. He calls a 40+ year old man a kid. I love it. \n\nYou know you have something special when you are watching an epic revenge saga and you can\u2019t help but want to stay with this character and spend more time with him, \n\nI want a Larry spinoff. Running his strip club, hating hats, doing coke, and wearing denim all the fucking time. \n\nNot only is this part of the film great because part of us wonders, why is Budd taking this shit from this guy? He could snap him in half like a twig. But Michael Madsen plays Budd with this mix of sadness &amp; stoicism. Is this Budd paying a penance for his years of killing people? He endures this daily indignity knowing he could kill all these people, yet he takes it as some sort of karmic punishment. He even says \u201cI don\u2019t dodge guilt\u201d. When he says \u201cthe customers wear hats\u201d it sounds so pathetic and sad. \n\n\nBudd could\u2019ve killed Beatrix easily. A buck shot instead of rock salt in that gun? Movies over. He could\u2019ve sprayed that can of mace in her eyeballs. Then she really would\u2019ve suffered to her last breath. Yet Budd gives her the flashlight. One could say, the flashlight is cruel so she can see how helpless she really is. But I don\u2019t think so.\n\n There\u2019s almost a knowing glance between the two that says \u201cOk. You\u2019ll probably die buried in this grave. But you have a chance, small though it may be, and perhaps, maybe, this flashlight will help you. Or it won\u2019t\u201d. Hence \u201cthat\u2019s a wise decision\u201d when Beatrix nods at the flashlight.\n\nAnd again, speaking of actors, that little guy who digs the hole. \u201cThis bitch is furious\u201d. His little stubby hands holding the beer can? \u201cWhite women call this the silent treatment\u201d. Like\u2026who is this guy? I\u2019ve never seen him in anything else. \n\nNot to mention Michael Parks. Ok. I\u2019m going to say it, I don\u2019t care that he\u2019s a white dude, he should\u2019ve won and been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Esteban. What a performance. (Ricardo Montalban had the role before him BUT one day Ricardo couldn\u2019t show up for a read thru rehearsal so Parks, who played the Sheriff, read the role in his stead. Tarantino loved what Parks did and that\u2019s all she wrote. He even kept Esteban in a wheelchair due to Montalban being chair bound). \n\nHere\u2019s another character, right at towards the end of the movie where I\u2019m thinking \u201cI wana spend more time with Esteban!\u201d.",
