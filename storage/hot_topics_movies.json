        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

It\u2019s darkly funny watching him try to get it right and failing in ridiculous ways, yet slowly improving. \n\nThat experience made me realize how many films I might dismiss too quickly based on trailers or hype.

The camaraderie shown by the group is not unlike the foxhole friendships developed between soldiers during wartime, but given the hopelessness of their situation, it starts to feel like we're watching the American version of \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Wang provides a majority of the much-needed levity with his sharp tongue and fearless delivery, while Baker's warm, gentle optimism represents the best of humanity.",

Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick\u2019s *Dr Strangelove*. Unlike Kubrick, Bigelow doesn\u2019t offer much humour \u2013 satirical or otherwise \u2013 but this is a white knuckle ride of a movie in which the tension is ratcheted up to near breaking point early on, and then simply keeps on rising. German composer Volker Bertelmann\u2019s ominous score, heavy on the strident strings, puts viewers on edge even more.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-idris-elba-kathryn-bigelow-1236504169/)\n\n&gt;\u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d a countdown-to-nuclear-disaster thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is jacked up with so many familiar MOR tropes that even though it\u2019s trying to be realistic about what it shows you (spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t really succeed), it still has the feel of a self-consciously jittery high-end cautionary potboiler. Don\u2019t try this at home! Or in the White House Situation Room!\n\n[RogerEbert](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-movie-review) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;Bigelow's ability to take a series of hypotheticals and render them into narrative actuality has never been more pinpoint accurate or merciless.",

        "content": "One that comes to mind for me is Last Action Hero. When it came out, people wanted a straight Arnold action flick and wrote it off. I also loved it and enjoyed it for what it was trying to do. But rewatching it recently really makes it feel like a movie out of time. It was doing the whole meta, self-aware thing long before it caught on. Movies like Cabin in the Woods, Tropic Thunder and Deadpool later got praised for that same kind of storytelling, but Last Action Hero was already playing with those ideas in the early 90s.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to revisit it now and see how much it holds up, especially knowing how common that style has become.\n\nCurious what other movies people think were misunderstood at release but actually aged really well.",

        "content": "It\u2019s 2AM, I can\u2019t sleep and I need some fodder on the screen to put me to bed. Picking \u2018The Mighty Ducks\u2019 was the wrong movie but in watching it, it has really made me realize how much the world has changed since 1992.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s a work of exaggerated fiction. Even in 1992, no law firm is giving a pee wee hockey team $15k to buy equipment, there weren\u2019t publicly broadcast televised pee wee tournaments with commentators, analysts and a full stadium audience, coaches aren\u2019t telling 10 year olds that if they don\u2019t make the game winning shot, not only are they letting their coach down but they are letting their team and their dead dad down and finally, the dialogue is way too clever and quippy for a bunch of 10 year old kids.\n\nGreat, we got that out of the way. But the movie unintentionally captures a vibe in the 90s that has since disappeared. They shot it earnestly and now it\u2019s a time capsule for that time. The kids are out hanging out with each other, the cities are lively, people communicate in the wild. The kids have this sense of adventure that I recall in my childhood but don\u2019t see in kids today. They are generally just out in the world without parental supervision, and that\u2019s *okay*. Shit, the notion of a grown man trying to teach kids hockey didn\u2019t come with the default assumption of grooming and pedophilia. \n\nIt\u2019s just wild how different things are today. I was a teenager in the 90s and again, yes the film exaggerates but the details they showcase in how we freely communicated back then and how people didn\u2019t jump to the worst conclusions of each other, is just wildly different.\n\nFinally, this is a little off topic, but this movie was rated PG yet it gets away with so much stuff and definitely isn\u2019t just a kids movie, as we know them today. The kids are looking at dirty magazines, they make light hearted race jokes like calling the 2 black kids and one white kid \u201cOreos\u201d, Gordon Bombay verbally rips the kids apart and straight up tells them they \u201csuck\u201d. I just can\u2019t imagine a PG movie today having any of these vibes.\n\nI really encourage giving the film a shot. I haven\u2019t seen it since I was probably 10 years old myself. No it is not high art and it won\u2019t blow your socks off. But if you recognize that the days we live in today are just\u2026so\u2026bland, I think you\u2019ll have a good time with this unintentional time capsule of a film.",
