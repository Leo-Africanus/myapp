I didn't trust any of the click-bait articles I found online, and figured if anyone should be trusted, it's an obscure crowd sourced wiki called [Cinemorgue](https://cinemorgue.fandom.com/wiki/Cinemorgue_Wiki).\n\n  \nTo spare everyone the ironically gory details of manual-entry text clean up, and partially because I wanted to doodle in Illustrator, I made a summary of the top 8. For the sweats, the code used to get to this point can be found [here](https://github.com/MDeanLindsay/Cinemorgue).",

The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said \"do you want to go to burger king?\"\n\n\"No Burbank\"\n\n\"Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?\"\n\n\"No Burbank!\" \n\n\"Destination set for baja mexico\"\n\nWow, so funny/s. I've seen this joke so many times but it just doesn't do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it's been so overused by this point that it's overstayed it's welcome.\n\nAre there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?",
