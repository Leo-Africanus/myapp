We never get finality on what happens to him in the real world, and it\u2019s an amazing parallel to how the people watching the show are no longer under full observation of Truman himself. It\u2019s one of the best endings to a movie I\u2019ve ever seen, even if it is a cliffhanger.",

I mean, that does happen, don't get me wrong, but it takes a LONG time to get there, because they spend the first half of the movie setting up the actual conflict. The daughter and Joshua Jackson seem to have much more screentime than Jackie Chan does; just saying.\n\nI think if it had been a bit more honest about what the movie was actually going to be, it would be doing better.",

        "content": "The Graduate is often mistaken for being deeply ambiguous, but this opinion came from Mike Nichols\u2019 decision not to yell \u201ccut\u201d at the end of the final scene, allowing the characters to fade silent and stare at the camera to show uncertain expressions. This tonal shift feels profound, but it\u2019s more of an aesthetic flourish than a true narrative or thematic ambiguity. The story itself is quite clear: Benjamin rebels against a future he doesn\u2019t want, chases Elaine, and gets what he wants, and they laugh happily at each other when they board the bus. They look into the camera because they are looking into their future.\n\nOn the other hand, Rear Window is more genuinely ambiguous. While the murder is solved, the film raises unresolved ethical questions about voyeurism and whether Jeff's decisions are ethical or not. Was he a hero for stepping in and helping others solve a problem or was he stepping into peoples' boundaries? Even we don't know how Jeff and Lisa would end up.",

Seth Rogen has never really played a villain to my knowledge, and while a lot of people pointed out that it\u2019s a weird casting choice, I think it could be super smart overall. People are so used to him as a goofy good guy that it would be extra crazy to see Napoleon become the tyrant of the farm.\n\nSince it\u2019s directed by Andy Serkis, I have a hard time believing he would make the movie more sanitized. Even with the jokes at the end, there\u2019s a very sinister undercurrent to the scene, especially with the music. Napoleon saying \u201cpigs should stick with pigs\u201d definitely foreshadows his cruel intentions",

        "title": "Tyler Perry\u2019s Trauma Machine: When Storytelling Becomes Exploitation",
        "content": "I hate how Tyler Perry has moved over the years. And I say this not to tear down a Black creative \u2014 but to question why someone with so much power, influence, and access consistently chooses to recycle the same painful narrative over and over again, to the point where it feels less like representation\u2026 and more like exploitation.\n\nIt feels like his movies don\u2019t just touch on trauma \u2014 they traumatize Black audiences.\n\nYes, Black people have endured and survived unimaginable things. Yes, there are deep-rooted issues in our communities that deserve to be spoken about. But there\u2019s a difference between storytelling and trauma-dumping. There\u2019s a line between bringing awareness and dragging your people through hell just because you can.\n\nTake his latest movie as an example \u2014 a single Black mother at the center, and every horrible thing imaginable happens to her. Her landlord kicks her out. Her boss fires her. A cop runs her off the road and threatens her. Her child gets taken away. And just when you think maybe she\u2019ll catch a break\u2026 her child dies too.\n\nWhy? For what?\n\nAt what point does this stop being a story and start becoming suffering as spectacle? It\u2019s not just emotionally exhausting \u2014 it\u2019s deeply disturbing.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern here. In nearly all of Perry\u2019s films and series, Black women are abused, broken, or abandoned. Black men are either abusers, cheaters, or saviors \u2014 never something in between. The characters lack depth. The pain is constant. The message? That suffering is part of being Black. That pain is our destiny. That endurance is our only virtue.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true.\n\nWe are so much more than our trauma.\n\nWe are joy. We are excellence. We are innovators, leaders, healers, artists, and dreamers. We are breaking generational curses. We are loving each other. We are making it. And those stories deserve to be told just as loudly, just as boldly, just as frequently.\n\nWhat\u2019s most disheartening is that someone like Tyler Perry could tell those stories. He has a studio. He has funding. He has a loyal audience. He has access to some of the best Black talent in the world. But instead of evolving his storytelling, he keeps feeding us the same pain \u2014 dressed up as entertainment.\n\nWhen I look at the landscape of Black film and television, I can name dozens of shows and movies that uplift, that stretch beyond trauma, that imagine something better for us: shows like Queen Sugar, Insecure, Abbott Elementary, Black Panther, The Photograph, The Harder They Fall. These works show that we can tell layered stories \u2014 ones that reflect struggle and joy.\n\nBut I truly cannot name a single Tyler Perry production that left me feeling uplifted.\n\nAt some point, we have to ask: Who is this really for? Who benefits from a never-ending loop of Black pain? And when will it be enough?\n\nBecause we deserve more than to see ourselves repeatedly battered by life, by each other, and by scripts that refuse to imagine us as anything but victims.\n\nWe deserve healing stories, hopeful stories, and whole stories.\n\nWe deserve better from someone who claims to love us.",

You know like toward the end in Mrs Doubtfire in the restaurant and the guy begins choking on the overly spicy shrimp or whatever? Suddenly the movie gets all serious. \n\nSo any mood changes like that interest me, esoecially when handled skillfully. \n\nCould be frightening to funny, funny to sad, sad to angry, etc.\nExamples that stand out for you?

I\u2019ve been watching a bunch recently, from classics like *Groundhog Day* and *Edge of Tomorrow* to some underrated gems like *Palm Springs* and *Happy Death Day*.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite time loop movie?

Here's a running list of everything folks have recommended so far \u2014 across movies, anime, TV, even games:\n\n# \ud83c\udfac Movies\n\n* *Run Lola Run*\n* *12 Monkeys*\n* *Primer*\n* *Triangle*\n* *Timecrimes* (aka *Time Crimes*, Spanish)\n* *12:01*\n* *Source Code*\n* *Coherence*\n* *Omni Loop*\n* *Looper*\n* *Predestination*\n* *Project Almanac*\n* *Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel*\n* *The Endless*\n* *ARQ*\n* *The Map of Tiny Perfect Things*\n* *Donnie Darko*\n* *Before I Fall*\n* *Boss Level*\n* *Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes*\n* *River* (2023)\n* *Time Lapse*\n* *About Time*\n* *Memento* (or *Momento* as someone wrote \ud83d\ude05)\n* *Maanadu* (Tamil)\n* *Deja Vu*\n* *Tenet*\n* *Re/Member*\n* *Until Dawn*\n* *Room 0*\n* *Timechasers*\n* *The Infinite Man*\n* *Premonition*\n* *Arrival*\n* *The Butterfly Effect*\n* *Round and Round*\n* *Resolution*\n* *Flashback* (2020)\n* *Caddo Lake*\n* *Hot Tub Time Machine*\n* *1994: A.P.E.X.*\n* *Two Distant Strangers*\n* *Happy Monday(s)*\n* *Detention*\n* *The Final Countdown*\n* *Peggy Sue Got Married*\n* *Doctor Strange*\n* *The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife*\n* *Fetching Cody*\n* *Things Will Be Different*\n* *Inside Llewyn Davis*\n* *In the Tall Grass*\n* *Dead of Night* (1945)\n* *Mulholland Drive*\n* *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*\n* *The Father*\n\n# \ud83d\udcfa TV Shows / Episodes\n\n* *Russian Doll*\n* *Dark*\n* *Lost*\n* *Bodies*\n* *X-Files* \u2013 \u201cMonday\u201d (S6E14)\n* *Window of Opportunity* \u2013 *Stargate SG-1*\n* *Twin Peaks: The Return*\n* *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*\n\n# \ud83c\udf8c Anime\n\n* *Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya*\n* *Re/Member*\n\n# \ud83c\udfae Games\n\n* *Outer Wilds*\n\nLet me know what I missed \u2014 I\u2019m still working my way through replies. Some of these blur the line between time loop and time travel, but hey, if it bends time and breaks your brain, it counts in my book.\n\nMassive thanks again to everyone who dropped a rec \ud83d\ude4c  \nThis list\u2019s a goldmine.",

        "content": "What are the movies you can watch over and over again? Maybe even as soon as the credits roll your ready to watch again. Mine would be Dolores Claiborne. I just love the way Kathy Bates plays a mother who loves her daughter no matter how muchthe daughter  blames her for everything and shows how Dolores did everything for her daughter. Jennifer Jason Leigh was amazing as well playing the roll of emotionally mess up woman who had yet to face the trauma of her past. Really a deep good movie. Also read Kathy Bates said it was her favorite roll because of the non linear timeline of the story\n\nThe other used to be before I got sober requiem for a dream. I used to love watching that movie again I was so obsessed with it the DVD I had of it I watched all the special features of including listening to the directors commentary over the movie. I loved it. But it also was the movie I loved to get high too so I cut it out of my life after I sobered up.\n\nMy final one was as kid because a pretty girl I rode the school bus with told me she would watch this over and over again and I had a huge crush on her at the time I did the same but also really liked the movie was the original Wayne's World. I still remember the VHS copy we had was from a promo Mc Donald's was running where they where selling a few select movies at the restaurant for I think like five bucks. I do remember another they where selling with Wayne World was Field of dreams. ",

I thank the replies in that removed post.\n\nWatched the movie a few years ago, but I kept thinking about the details involving their meetings.\n\nWhen Malenkov held the meeting to give out assignments after Stalin died, the committee members always looked at each other before raising their hands to vote on a motion, and every motion was passed \"unanimously\". Even when khrushchev was obviously against some of those motions, he had to reluctantly raise his hand.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what it was poking at, it was incredibly funny. I'm guessing this was something that happened regularly in Soviet era, because nobody wanted to be seen outside of the official party stance?\n\nAnother example, when the doctors were giving a conclusion on the medical conditions of Stalin, they kept emphasizing this was a collective finding.",
