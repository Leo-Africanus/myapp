Nic Cage is suitably unhinged, and the action scenes and production design are manic and over-the-top in a fun way. Directed by the people who brought the Crank movies, if you watched the behind the scenes they put their lives on the line to pull off the stunts. The story is whatever, but are you there for that or to see Ghost Rider piss fire? The only thing missing was a hard R rating but I was entertained and it didn\u2019t overstay its welcome \n",

        "content": "I saw it on VHS through Blockbusters and I wasn't expecting a lot. I knew it had been a failure. It got theatrically released in my country and my sister tried to see it, she wasn't allowed in because it was R-rated. \n\nI was SHATTERED when I saw Strange Days. I couldn't believe how daring and creative the film was and the direction was stunning. Stylish, quick and kinetic, every major sequence was a adrenalin rush, like when the two cops are chasing after a woman on the subway and it isn't shot like a clean sequence, it's highly aggressive. Like the snuff sequence shot on video and through the perspective of the killer, a highly disturbing scene. \n\nI had seen The English Patient before so I was taken aback by Ralph Fiennes playing Lenny Nero, a part I wouldn't have expected from Ralph Fiennes and yet he killed it. He was convincing as a \"loser\" who becomes imbroiled in a dangerous situation he can't comprehend while obsessing over his ex, Faith, played by a smoldering Juliette Lewis. The standout, though, was Angela Basset as Mace, a bodyguard/limousine driver who's a cool fierce warrior and becomes a protector/platonic lover of Lenny Nero when he wounds up being targeted. Even small roles played by Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Wincott, Josef Sommer and Tom Sizemore stand out. The casting process made no mistakes.\n\nIt's also a commentary on race in America while set in a dystopian future of the US (sadly current today) and using the Rodney King beating as a inspiration for a key subplot. \n\nKathryn Bigelow, a genius, and someone I wish had directed more films.",

They did everything really well, from the acting, fight scenes, story, plot, and even nailed the quiet moments of the characters.  It felt like Steins; Gate having a baby with Helldivers 2. \n\nTom Cruise's acting in this movie was excellent for me, as the realism of his being put on the frontlines that he never experienced was immaculate. I have always known him as the \"Mission: Impossible\" guy, but he totally showed how he is a genuinely good actor. Emily Blunt as the full metal was really cool as well. Her chemistry with Tom really felt like they were real people fighting to save the world. \n\nOverall, this movie was such a treat. Going into a movie blind is the best way for me to watch, as it can surprise me in so many ways. Since I'm a massive fan of Steins; Gate and Helldivers, this movie gets a 9/10 for me. I'm kind of saddened to the fact that no one really remembers this movie.",

        "title": "1986's \"The Wraith\" is one of the strangest cult films of the 80s; a genre-hopping road rage revenge flip that also happens to be inspired by a Clint Eastwood Western.",
        "content": "That's not a joke; the writer/director admitted he based it in no small part on \"High Plains Drifter\" with the plot of a mysterious and apparently supernatural avenger coming into a small town to wreak havoc. Except while \"Drifter\" is deliberately ambiguous, \"The Wraith\" is about as subtle as a brick to the face as its otherworldly vigilante drives around in a fantastical car that can appear and disappear at will and dresses up in a quasi-superhero outfit. And while \"Drifter\" was morally ambiguous, this one is straight up revenge wish fulfillment with the villains (led by Nick Cassavetes long before he followed in his dad's footsteps behind the camera) all cartoons you can't wait to see eat it. (Two of them are like an evil Bill and Ted prototype with one dressing like a \"Mad Max\" cosplayer and the other with teeth that'd make a dentist weep.) Plus, the acting is...well, often shaky to say the least. (Sherilyn Fenn as the leading lady is absolutely gorgeous, but her acting notably improved between this and \"Twin Peaks\" a few years later.)\n\nThat said, goofy as it is, the movie is a lot of fun. It comes off a lot of the time like an 80s music video expanded to feature length, has lots of fun car chases and explosions and numerous future name actors like Charlie Sheen as the charming newcomer who romances Fenn (gee, wonder if he has anything to do with the titular avenger) and Clint Howard, sporting an \"Eraserhead\" hairdo as the most sympathetic of the bad guy gang. (Randy Quaid also shows up as the local sheriff investigating the matter but also openly not caring if the punks get wiped out.) And I find it impressive how many genres this film encompasses. Is it an action movie? Teen drama? Road race? Horror? Fantasy? Revenge saga? A little bit of everything. Throw in a quintessential 80s soundtrack and you've got a fun if singularly bizarre time.\n\nAnd yes, if it sounds like \"The Crow\" as well some of the time, you're not alone.",
