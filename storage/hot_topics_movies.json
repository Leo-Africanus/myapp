Why are women almost always making the worst decisions  in all these movies??\n\nThis scene creeped me out most of all because as someone who\u2019s been in NYC their entire life I\u2019ve always found late night empty train stations kinda creepy, especially when the streets feel empty too. It always feels like someone is watching you or following you. \n\nIt\u2019s a film set in NYC but it\u2019s an Italian production. I love when foreign films are set in the states. They\u2019re always so bizarre. But it\u2019s interesting to see what foreign studios do with their films set in the states. I imagine it is how foreign countries view Hollywood productions set in their countries. \n\nThe actor they cast to play the murderer was genuinely creepy. ",

Directed by Terry Gilliam and released in 1998. Stars Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Based on the novel of the same name by the journalist and novelist Hunter S. Thompson. \n\n\"The film follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio del Toro) as they embark on a drug-fueled road trip to Las Vegas. The story explores themes of the American Dream, the failure of the 1960s counterculture, and the chaotic nature of their drug-induced experiences.\"",

Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

        "title": "Finally watched Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind",
        "content": "I was told by many online and in-person that this film would break me, especially if you related to the story being told. Two years ago around this time, I experienced the most painful breakup I had ever felt in my life. Me and my ex had permanently split lives right after a partial breakup, and it completely destroyed me. A woman who I thought would birth my first child and share many more memories with me suddenly became a stranger and at the time an enemy to me. In the moment, none of our heart felt moments felt like anything. I legitimately remember crying begging God or somebody above to erase any thought I had of her, because for that time then and to this day I have thoughts of her that used to send chills up my spine and give me goosebumps. My heart would drop thinking of the fact she was moving on completely care-free while I was stutter stepping around my life while also having her in the back of my brain at most times. It genuinely upset me how much time and effort I thought about her and how or what I could have done differently to make our lives work together. We were very different people with very different upbringings, but when we made it work it was beautiful. I have never fully forgiven myself for letting her slip away and I think I will forever hold some space for her. After watching this film, it has completely shifted my perspective on the memories we share. I think a very important lesson in this movie to save is that relationships will be extremely ugly, and extremely breath-taking. As humans I feel we like to cling on to negativity, no matter what the ratio is. One awful moment can completely erase 1000 thoughtful acts, and that\u2019s completely fair. There\u2019s no measuring disrespect or hurt, if something hurts you to the point of leaving even after reconsidering, leave. And so what I will take with me from this film is pushing through the ugly is worth it, what\u2019s worth having will take forgiveness, not all great things have great endings, memories are worth keeping even the bad ones, and that we can love the right person at the wrong time. I genuinely wanna thank Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for their amazing performances, if I could give them both a handshake right now I would, but the best I can do is a little more than lengthy reddit post off of a couple drinks. Amazing film that I rented on youtube (i have never rented a film on youtube before), cannot recommend anymore and would love to converse over the film or any topics it touched on\ud83d\udc95 much love ",
