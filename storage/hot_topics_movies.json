        "content": "*From the* r/movies *Mod team:*\n\nPlease excuse the typo in the title. It's Rosy McEwen (as Bryn says below), not Rose McEwen. Our automod post scheduler screwed up with auto-correct!\n\n*From Bryn:*\n\nHi r/movies, I'm Bryn Chainey. I wrote and directed RABBIT TRAP, a psychological folk-horror that premiered at Sundance last year and that will be out in UK cinemas this weekend via Picturehouse Entertainment. It stars Dev Patel &amp; Rosy McEwen, and I'm here to answer your questions.\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nIn 1976, married musicians Daphne (Rosy McEwen) and Darcy Davenport (Dev Patel) move to the Welsh countryside to finish their new record. While making field recordings in the ancient woodlands, Darcy captures a forbidden sound not meant for human ears. This brings a strange boy to their doorstep who draws them into an enigmatic realm where the line between reality and myth begins to blur.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y953Fl\\_BdWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y953Fl_BdWM)\n\nStarring Dev Patel &amp; Rosy McEwen. In UK cinemas January 30.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back Thursday 1/29 at 8 AM ET to answer your questions!",

        "content": "Hey, Reddit! I\u2019m Sook-Yin Lee! You may know me from Shortbus, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, or as a musician &amp; ex-MuchMusic VJ. My new movie, PAYING FOR IT, a live-action feature film adaptation of cartoonist Chester Brown\u2019s best-selling graphic novel, opens in theaters: NYC 1/30, L.A. 2/3 &amp; more. AMA!\n\n**Official Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw)\n\n**More Information**: [https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it](https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it)\n\n**ABOUT PAYING FOR IT**\n\nSet in the late 90\u2019s, PAYING FOR IT follows the trials and travails of Chester (Dan Beirne), a cartoonist and Sonny (Emily L\u00ea), a TV host, who are in a long-term, committed, romantic relationship. When Sonny introduces the idea of opening up their relationship, Chester begins sleeping with sex workers, forcing him to face his issues with intimacy and romance in the process. Based on the best-selling graphic novel by acclaimed alternative-cartoonist Chester Brown, PAYING FOR IT is a \u201cprovocative, hilarious and heartfelt\u201d (The Globe and Mail) personal take on romance and relationships. From writer/director Sook-Yin Lee, the film \u201cdisplays a maturity and thoughtfulness (...) in the messy contradictions we may hold about love\u201d (RogerEbert.com).  Celebrating the vibrant underground comic and zine era through the experiences of cartoonist Brown, PAYING FOR IT connects the past with the present by bringing together emerging comic actors, performance artists, authors, activists and multimedia creators in front of and behind the camera, and it has resonated for festival audiences and critics alike.\n\n**ABOUT SOOK-YIN LEE**\n\nSook-Yin Lee (Writer, Director, Co-Producer) is a Toronto-based filmmaker, musician, actor and broadcaster (CBC, BBC, MuchMusic). She starred in Shortbus, the ground-breaking 2SLGBTQ movie directed by John Cameron Mitchell that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Her feature film writer and directorial debut, Year of the Carnivore, starring Cristin Milioti, premiered at TIFF. In 2014, Lee won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by a Lead Dramatic Actress in Jack and went on to write and perform Unsafe for Canadian Stage, which examined questions of censorship and artistic freedom. She won Best Director and Best Picture at the 2018 Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival for Octavio is Dead! --a ghost story starring Sarah Gadon and Rosanna Arquette. Death and Sickness, her feature movie made with Dylan Gamble, streams on CBC Gem. She acts in Darkest Miriam, executive produced by Charlie Kaufman, and is set to release her experimental comedy Rest and Relax. Sook-Yin is a music recording artist and film score composer. She contributed songs to Brandon Cronenberg's horror movies Infinity Pool and Antiviral.\n\nAsk me anything r/movies! I'll be back tomorrow, Thursday 1/29 at 3 PM ET, to answer your questions.\n\n",

But what they meant was that it's a movie that is hard to relate to in today's cultural context.\n\nI've also read a Reddit comment that said essentially something similar about *This Is Spinal Tap.*  They essentially said that it is the kind of movie that is much harder to understand if you didn't grow up during the rock era.\n\n**EDIT:**  People, READ MY POST BEFORE YOU ANSWER!  I'm *not* asking about movies that have elements that are offensive by today's standards (like Revenge of the Nerds, Sixteen Candles, Blazing Saddles).  I am asking about movies that are simply hard to relate to for younger viewers because they were very specific to a particular time, place and/or cultural moment.",

He directs a really strong feature film debut in Safety Not Guaranteed and then revitalizes the Jurassic Park franchise and basically gets handed a Star Wars movie and destroyed it all with one movie.",

He went from being one of the more in demand big budget directors to getting fired off of Star Wars and instantly becoming hated by critics. It's insane one mediocre misfire of a movie completely tanked this dudes career. ",

        "content": "No I'm not recommending an oddly specific genre here. This is actually the title of a new movie from director/star Jason Biggs. Yes that Jason of American Pie fame. Maybe it was because I had no expectations but I really rather enjoyed this. \n\nBasically it's about a man whose marriage is in a rut and in an attempt to try and reignite a spark in his wife he stages a fake home invasion so he can pretend to heroically save her and fend off the intruder. Things go all kinds of sideways from there. \n\nVery impressed by Biggs in his directorial debut. Nice little comedic/crime indy film. Gave me some early Coen brothers vibes. Obviously not on par with their best stuff but I'd say shades of Burn After Reading as far as mood. Anyways, I thought I'd recommend this little hidden gem to you guys as I'm sure plenty of people have never heard of it. ",
