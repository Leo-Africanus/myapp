But my mental well-being has also changed dramatically.\n\nScrolling videos made my brain feel like porridge. I'd suddenly realize after 5 seconds that I was watching an obnoxious ad. No focus at all. Totally spaced out.\n\nWatching a movie actually makes me feel good. Being engaged in a storyline, maybe watching a feelgood movie like I did yesterday (The Intern) \u2026 It makes me happy and relaxed. It makes me enjoy life *more* afterwards.\n\nReading and working out is great as well, but it never made me not want to scroll. Watching a movie fulfills my desire for easy entertainment, without making it impossible to do something productive after.\n\nTomorrow marks a month of watching a movie every single day. Well, sometimes I watch half one day and the other half the next. I still think it counts.\n\nEdit: [Yes, I know I'm on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qxdevy/comment/o3w4oe1/?context=3)",

        "content": "Sometimes a movie is not deep, not award level, not trying to be smart. It just knows exactly what it is and does it perfectly.\n\nFor me it is Fast Five.   \n  \nIt is simple. Big action. Big moments. Great team energy. It is fun from start to finish and never pretends to be anything else. That confidence makes it perfect for what it is.\n\nWhat is your low brow movie that you think is secretly perfect?\n\nThank you.",

Regulars can recite the pre-recorded spiel that plays before a by heart: no talking, no texting, and keep your devices dark, silent, and\u00a0out of sight. That last point currently has customers up in arms.\n\nCurrently, any Alamo Drafthouse social media post\u2014no matter the subject\u2014is accompanied by an onslaught of comments about the theater's plan to kill its classic paper-and-pen ordering model and replace it with a QR code-based platform, effectively ending its longstanding \u201cno phones\u201d policy. The shift is seen as a betrayal of Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s promise of a viewing experience with limited distractions. People have called it a bellwether of staffing reductions. And what better way to justify the development cost of a new ordering platform than by cutting expenses?\n\nAlamo Drafthouse\u2019s current predicament notwithstanding, there is no reason a theater cannot implement mobile ordering technology without sacrificing its soul. In fact, another Texas-based chain has done exactly that over the past several years. ",

It's one of those movies where you would say: this one is definitely in my top 3.\n\nFor me this is Poor Things (2023). Saw it last year, and I keep thinking about it. I think it was my first movie with Emma Stone. Really worth it to see in 4k HDR/DV, cinematography so gorgeous. Music so original. Definitely going to watch Yorgos Lanthimos (director).\n\nNoticeable mentions: One Battle After Another (2025) - Sean Penn is so good in this.",
