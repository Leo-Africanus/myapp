        "content": "\"I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.\"\n\n\"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out the types of visual effects made with Unreal aren't necessarily bad. \"It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don't think it takes light the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface, scattering, and how light hits skin and reflects in the same way,\" he said. \"So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand.\"",

        "content": "Reviews are starting to come out for Amazon's 'Mercy'. Lot of people expecting this to be a dud but let's see... I'll update this post with reviews I keep finding.\n\nRotten Tomatoes - [12%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mercy_2026/reviews)\n\nMetacritic - [39/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mercy-2026/)\n\nReviews:\n\n[ThePragueReporter](https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2026/1/20/mercy-movie-review-chris-pratt-pleads-before-an-ai-algorithm-in-the-trial-of-his-life/)\n\n[TheGeekTyrant](https://geektyrant.com/news/mercy-is-a-tense-surprisingly-effective-ai-thriller-that-kept-me-hooked) \n\n&gt;I walked away feeling genuinely entertained and a little impressed. It is not a movie that completely reinvents sci-fi thrillers, but it delivers a tight, engaging ride with strong performances and a concept that keeps your brain busy the entire time.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2026/01/mercy-review-chris-pratt-rebecca-ferguson-ai-judge-thriller-1236691222/)\n\n&gt;All the technical production elements are first rate, and I guarantee this one will have you on the edge of your seat in its compact running time. It was shot for IMAX, and in a movie all about screens dominating our lives, this one is ideal to be seen on the biggest one of all if you have a chance like I did.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mercy-review-chris-pratt-rebecca-ferguson-ai-thriller-1236477844/)\n\n&gt;Taking place in real time, Mercy mercifully moves along fairly briskly. But after it\u2019s over you\u2019ll definitely feel the need for a digital detox. While Pratt can be effective in the right vehicle (Jurassic World, Guardians of the Galaxy), he\u2019s very dependent on his athletic physicality. Watching him as he sits motionless in a chair for nearly 90 minutes, not able to resort to the humor with which he often peppers his performances, mainly serves as a demonstration of his limitations as an actor. Ferguson comes off much better, especially when she subtly reveals the hints of emotionality that begin to seep into her character\u2019s data-driven persona.",

        "content": "i went into Bone Tomahawk expecting a normal western, maybe even a slightly funny or laid-back one, but it ended up completely catching me off guard. Instead of the usual cowboy banter and simple shootouts, the movie slowly turns really dark and brutal, especially as it goes on. The tone is serious and uncomfortable, and the violence feels way more realistic and disturbing than I expected, which made it hard to watch at times. What shocked me most was how it tricks you into thinking it\u2019s a standard western before revealing that it\u2019s basically a horror movie hiding under that surface, and once it gets there, it doesn\u2019t hold back at all.",

        "content": "Aight so, there are movies which take huge creative risks and completely fall apart, but when it works, it\u2019s unforgettable. Talking bout films that gamble with structure, tone, or audience expectations and actually earn it. IMO, movies like *Memento* telling its story backwards, or *Parasite* shifting genres without warning. *From Dusk Till Dawn* shouldn\u2019t work after that midpoint turn, yet it somehow does. Even *Mad Max: Fury Road* betting almost everything on visual storytelling paid off massively.  \n\n\nThese aren\u2019t twists for shock value, they\u2019re bold choices that redefine the film itself. like whhen a movie trusts the audience enough to keep up, it hits differently. Which creative risk do you think paid off instead of backfiring?",
