Not that I want her to.)\n\n2) Great lines delivered exceptionally well and with perfect timing by Mr. CP.\n\n3) A fat dragon.\n\n4) Above average special effects, with the exception of one potato-throwing scene.\n\n5) Running joke about magic that echoes what I always think, but doesn\u2019t drag on past its usefulness.\n\n6) A complex plot that\u2019s clear enough not to feel complicated.\n\n7) An ending I should have seen coming but still made me cry. YES it\u2019s okay to cry over a fat dragon movie, although the fat dragon didn\u2019t make me cry and only featured in one of the quests.\n\nI look forward to all the comments agreeing with me.\n\n",

It\u2019s said in the beginning of the movie that Enos makes such a bet with \u201cevery gear jammer he can.\u201d What does Big Enos get out of this? Would Bandit have owed Enos something if he lost the bet?\n\nAnd before you say, \u201cEnos wanted the beer for the party after the Southern Classic,\u201d Enos wouldn\u2019t have got the beer if Bandit got caught or didn\u2019t deliver in time. So no matter what, Enos seems to gain nothing from the \u201cbet\u201d. Am I missing something? Smokey and the Bandit is one of my all-time favorite movies, but this has never made sense to me.",
