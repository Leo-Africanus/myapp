I haven't seen much discussion of it but it's a great surreal comedy in the vein of Quentin Dupieux. It's doesn't have a great score on Letterboxd, so I understand it's not for everyone, but it's my first encounter with filmmaker Guy Maddin and I loved it. \n\nI'll also mention: Orion and the Dark (2024) written by Charlie Kaufman who manages to apply his meta sensibilities to a kids movie perfectly. \n\nI'd love to hear some recommendations for a chance to catch up on some interesting titles I might have missed.

        "content": "So this movie is about as far removed from what I would normally watch as could be, but it was in a group setting and that's what was decided on so I was like alright, not my cup of tea but whatever.\n\nFor the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect a Netflix original comedy with a single-digit RT score to be; not overly offensive, just a complete waste of time that feels like it was made in a laboratory. That being said, there's one plot point towards the end of this that I cannot stop thinking about because it's so *weird*, and I feel like I must either be missing something or the people making this are really as out of touch as I think they are. \n\nBasically, one of the plot points throughout the movie is that Mark Wahlberg's character owes a ton of money, which at the end Kevin Hart agrees to pay him for, but then it's revealed that Seal (who had shown up at the birthday party) didn't actually just appear as a favor, he did so because Mark Wahlberg paid him $12.5K or something to appear at the party.\n\nThis isn't really played as overtly farcical, and the rest of the movie is very much about establishing Kevin hart as \"just a regular suburban dad\". If this was a satire about out-of-touch Hollywood elitists, it would make FAR more sense for this to be a plot point rather than being in the same movie where another plot point is having to replace a minivan. \n\nI can't help but feel like the bubble of Hollywood has gotten so thick that the people creating these types of totally soulless Netflix originals genuinely think that paying a musician 12.5 grand for a birthday appearance is just as relatable to people as Clark Griswold getting the new family pool. I know I'm overanalyzing a movie that was literally just made to farm watch-minutes and it isn't that deep, but this in particular was one of the most baffling things I've seen in any movie in a long time.

        "title": "John Carpenter's The Thing: What The Host Perceives",
        "content": "**Note:** I made this as a comment to a question on this subreddit 2 years ago, and I felt so intrigued by the question itself I wanted to bring it back up as a discussion. The question is (credit to u/cinemaofthevoid FYI):\n\n\"Do the characters in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) in fact know they have been assimilated by the Thing?\"\n\nu/cinemaofthevoid cited Norris's behavior before his assimilation was discovered as what provoked this question, wondering if \"the imitation might be so perfect that even the person might not know they were an imitation. Norris appears to be genuinely in pain before he collapses, a human response that would be unnecessary to imitate, especially when he is not around others.\"\n\nMy answer on my own take of this is copy pasted from the comment I made on the thread:\n\n\"I think it depends on HOW the assimilation occurred.\n\nNorris-Thing had no objective reason to feign a heart attack or those pains. In fact, it had the opposite. Norris-Thing would probably know defibrillators are one of the ways to revive a person who has had a heart attack. And given how it reacts to the defibrillator (aka with great hostility where it would risk revealing itself which it canonically strives to avoid doing as the movie established), that means that if Norris-Thing was aware it had been infected, it voluntarily placed itself in a situation where it would have been in danger. That makes no sense; everything we know about the Thing's characterization goes against this.\n\nBut then there's instances like Bennings, who was quite clearly infected and was aware of being infected (aka Bennings no longer was acting like Bennings, but a Thing) in one of the rare instances on screen we see an infection actually occur in real time.\n\nSo that brings me to my initial claim, that it entirely depends on how the infection happened. I believe that when a blatant assimilation occurs, like with Bennings, the dogs, Windows, etc., yes, the Thing instances are 100% aware they are a Thing instance, and thus behave as such while still pretending to be the host.\n\nBut when the assimilation is NOT blatant, that changes the formula.\n\nTake what Fuchs talks about in regards to food, and how he suggests that they should prepare their own meals and put it in cans to protect themselves from infection. Let's say that someone gets infected via food; aka a Thing instance puts their own cells into the food mixture, host eats it, Thing cells are now in the body.\n\nThe assimilation is consequently much more subtle. Less body horror, and more cells are simply being changed one by one. But full assimilation and imitation requires the cells to still behave as they are. A Thing blood cell is not going to be different from a normal blood cell in behavior...until it strikes.\n\nSo I believe that the Thing instances that are subtly infected in such a manner remain consciously unaware that they're infected. Their neurons, their behaviors, remain the same, because the Thing cells are still so deep undercover that the host isn't even aware there's an assimilation happening. Even when assimilation is complete, the Thing cells still operate like their normal real counterparts. Thus, the host behaves the exact same as their normal counterpart, because they don't know they're a Thing. No matter what you do or say to get them to confess or reveal themself, they won't deviate. It's a perfect camouflage; how better to convince something you're one of them if you genuinely believe it yourself?\n\nIt's only when there's external stimuli (aka something that would endanger it) that these subtle \"Thing\" instances turn the switch, and they become aware of what they are. Take the Norris-Thing instance. If it had survived and reconstituted itself into Norris once again, it would now be aware of what it is. Thus, it would now behave like a Thing pretending to be Norris, and not simply think that it's still Norris, because there's now no way the Thing neurons can pretend they aren't a Thing anymore.\n\nMore evidence of this behavior is the heart attack itself. It's implied Norris has heart problems, which would occur because of biological processes. So the Thing cells, in imitating Norris so perfectly, now mimic his biological processes, even if it's disadvantageous, because the Thing cells are acting as though they AREN'T infected unless it endangers them. And the heart attack doesn't actually endanger the Thing; the Thing is just a conglomerate of cells that decide it'd work to their advantage to work together, and are imitating a heart attack perfectly.\n\nThis is all consistent with the Thing's characterization. It doesn't WANT to do the body horror shit it does in the movie, because that would impact the ability of Thing instances to infiltrate and just naturally infect people. If it just naturally infects people over time, those people won't deviate at all. They won't try to sabotage or create in-fighting to deflect attention; they simply act the same, while allowing the inherent process of exposure to other organisms to do the infecting for them. \n\nMeanwhile, blatantly infected Thing instances WILL deviate from the behaviors of their host because it knows what it actually wants, aka spreading to all living organisms, and thus will work specifically towards that goal. Thus, it will sabotage, it will provoke paranoia, it'll do anything it can to survive, even if it's out of character of what it's imitating. It's still pretending to be the host, yes. But it doesn't THINK its the host, it doesn't think LIKE the host. Therefore, it's an ultimately inferior imitation.\n\nMeanwhile, the more subtly infected Thing instances won't deviate, because that host still thinks they're normal. And the infection and success rate of these instances will be much more effective. Think about how often cells are exchanged between organisms on a daily basis. Wipe off a sneeze with your hand, a few hours later, shake hands with another person. That person is now infected with Thing cells.\n\nThis is much more consistent with how the Thing displays its preferences and personality. The Thing is patient. The Thing is smart. The Thing doesn't want people to know its among them. It's only when it's in danger that it changes into the infamous body horror forms the franchise is known for. If it had a choice, the Thing would conquer the planet without anyone ever knowing it.\n\nThis is an overall extremely long rant, but the short summary is:\n\nThe Thing cells, when they infiltrate the host subtly, are so good at imitation that they trick the body and brain into thinking there's no assimilating process occurring. Therefore, the Thing IS that person, even though that person is now long gone. Meanwhile, instances like Blair or Bennings are distinctly aware they have been assimilated, and thus act according to the Thing's interests, and not to what the host would be interested in, and they therefore make for a more imperfect copy.\n\nBlatant assimilation, the Thing is pretending to be the host (aka worse camouflage).\n\nSubtle assimilation, the Thing IS the host (aka better camouflage).\"\n\nI'm not sure if this is the clearest explanation of my thought process; I don't think there's an easy way to describe it.\n\nBut I thought I'd reignite the discussion, and see what the folk on Reddit think of this.",

The plot involves astronauts being possessed by energy vampire like beings that feed on a human's lifeforce and they start possessing more and more people.\n\nIt's a complete mess of a film because it can be wildly incoherent and seems like it's making stuff up as it goes along, There is some good special effects work going on and there is a woman who spends the majority of her screentime nude, her character is possessed by one of these energy beings and kills numerous people.  \n\nThis film was made during a point in Tobe Hooper's directing career when he was contracted by Cannon films to make several films for them and they proceeded to butcher most of them by making edits and cutting the films, which happened here, lots of stuff which probably explained things in better detail was probably deleted in some fashion.  Though despite all this I still find the film an enjoyable entertaining watch ",

        "content": "I've just been watching Dr No and it struck me how much of an awesome introduction it was to James Bond and how it must have taken audiences by storm when it first came out.\n\nIn the [first scene](https://youtu.be/b15-P12gIf0?si=IHj8iRMQ0PlKRb4R) we see Bond, played by Sean Connery hanging out at the poker table, winning a hand against a glamorous exotic woman, in a tux and smoking a cigarette. She asks who he is. 'Bond, James Bond' that iconic line. Then the just as iconic music plays. It gave me chills watching it now, there's just some magic in that moment. I can't imagine what it must have been like for movie fans at the time.\n\nHe is called away and cool as ice he gets his massive bundle of chips exchanged, and while he's waiting, he seduces the woman who was at the card table. He arranges a date and leaves his card while he walks away with his notes in hand.\n\nJust a quick snappy scene that encompasses so much of what makes Bond cool. Just a pure alpha male depiction. A male fantasy, even. All just simply crafted in quick 3 minutes of show don't tell. Amazing scene.\n\nI also like how Dr No is fairly grounded to begin with. No huge balls to wall fight scenes, gun fights or mad chase sequences. We see Bond doing what you'd expect of an international secret agent, following leads, sniffing out deception, being tales and interrogating villains, whike also pulling off some nifty defensive moves using his and his physicality. \n\nAnd you can't help but love the schoolboy rapscallion energy he has when speaking to his boss M. Sure he seems a bit handsy and pervy with Moneypenny but I'll give that a pass for now, haha - but audiences wouldn't have seen any issue with that type of behaviour at the time. Plus, they had a great dynamic and chemistry.\n\nWhat other introductions to movie characters are fantastic?",

In fact, the entire basis of the deal Landa was able to strike for his own benefit was under the assumption that operation kino was the only way the 4 primary targets would be killed that night. Otherwise Landa's actions were just redundant. \n\nIn a way the characters Shoshanna and Marcel may be a representation (whether intentional by Tarantino or not) of all the unknown people that, in their own way, made the ultimate sacrifice trying to destroy the Nazi regime.",
