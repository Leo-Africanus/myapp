It\u2019s a strange little gem that deserves way more love than it gets. Give it a watch, you might be surprised!",

And it also reminded me of the \"Will you go to lunch? Go to lunch. Will You Go To Lunch?\" line in Glengarry Glen Ross. Something about repeating lines gives the actors such a bone to chew on, giving multiple takes all for an audience to see.\n\nWhat other repeated lines (triple or otherwise) are remarkable in film history? Also I noticed those two examples are questions. I suppose questions lend themselves to repetition?\n\nETA: Not talking about catch phrases or motifs that come back later (though those can both be fun) but lines that repeat immediately in the script.",

        "content": "Kate Winslet almost runs away with the film as the slightly rebellious Marianne Dashwood. I miss characters who are openly flawed and still oddly likable. \n\nAs the film went on, my eyes were on Marianne as she comes across as a strong personality who becomes enamored by the mysterious yet charming John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Her older sister, Elinor (Emma Thompson), falls for Ferrars (Hugh Grant) though she is aware she and Ferrars can't ever be together because the Dashwoods have become poor after the patriarch died and left a inheritance of 500 pounds per year for the remaining survivors. \n\nSense and Sensiblity leaves you with characters whom you're invested in. You want the Dashwoods to be okay and everything is lovely and amusing until something bad happens and it gets dark and depressing. \n\nAng Lee's versatility can never be left unsaid. He could do anything. Who knew he'd direct a critically acclaimed period drama and the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel?",

        "content": "**How are you feeling about Americana finally hitting theaters? I know you worked on this a few years back.**\n\n*Americana* is legitimately my favorite movie I\u2019ve ever made, which you can print. I\u2019m not worried about any social blowback there. I just think it\u2019s wildly original, the script was so attractive. It was all about the writing, and Sydney Sweeney was just on the come up where everyone was starting to find out who she was because of *White Lotus* and *Euphoria*. When we wrapped, we were told it would go to a festival. A year later, we had it at SXSW in Austin, and we got great reviews, so we were like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re sitting pretty.\u201d Then we were just sitting. There was no pretty. We were wondering what the hell happened.\n\n...\n\n**Where do you think you\u2019re at as an actor in terms of selecting projects? Do you feel you\u2019d found the space you fit in or do you have things you\u2019re still hoping to explore?**\n\nThere\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t done that I want to do desperately. Kevin Costner offered me a part in *Horizon*, but it was one line of dialogue and the character had nothing to them. I don\u2019t need to be a piece of furniture in anybody\u2019s movie. I love Kevin Costner, and I want to work with him, and it\u2019d be an honor, but I also want to do something good. The same thing with Luca Guadagnino, \\[who\\] offered me \\[a role\\] to play the tennis judge during the big matches in *Challengers*. I could tell it was going to be something, and I love Luca, and he\u2019s been nothing but sweet to me, but also I feel way too competitive and way too hungry to eat garnish and pretend it\u2019s a meal. I would rather hold out for the right thing. On the day I\u2019m just going to be all hungry, and then I\u2019m going to look stupid and then I\u2019m going to feel awkward. In Hollywood, I don\u2019t feel like I fit in at all.\n\n**Really?**\n\nNo, I\u2019m an outspoken Jesus guy, but I also can\u2019t stand Donald Trump. I no longer live in L.A. I am obsessed with professional wrestling, and I\u2019ve made somewhat of a career out of that. In a weird way, I almost feel like I fit in the wrestling world more than I do in Hollywood. I\u2019m a way better actor than I am a wrestler, but I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, when I walk into a wrestling arena and there\u2019s a bunch of nerdy fans with signs and autograph stuff, and I feel like one of them. Whereas, when I\u2019m at a Hollywood function or a premiere, it feels like that awkward high school thing \\[where\\] there\u2019s a bunch of pretty people who are saying all the right things, and I\u2019m the only one who wants to truly be some sort of unleashed version of themselves, and I feel very alone in that for some reason.",
