It's about a guy whose wife gets sick, their health insurance reaches their limit and he tries to cash in on his pension from the military, but most of it was put into stocks and this film's setting was the 2008-2009 Wall Street crash.  The wife feels guilty, commits suicide and the husband goes off the edge and starts going on a killing spree against stock brokers and CEOs.  \n\nIt's directed by Uwe Boll (Of course, yes, that Uwe Boll) but as far as his movies go, I don't remember this one being half bad.  I remember Dominic Purcell from Prison Break as the husband and John Heard as the main antagonist.  I see it's on Tubi, I might rewatch it this weekend.",

        "content": "Growing up is realizing you align more with Myron than Howard. \n\nHoward waits until the last minute to do anything for his kid and doesn\u2019t really grow throughout the whole movie. It\u2019s understandable to think that he\u2019s just going to fall back into the same workaholic lifestyle after the movies conclusion. Meanwhile Myron\u2019s plight, akin to an Amazon worker, is way more relatable. He\u2019s had to work crazy hours, probably doesn\u2019t get compensated enough, and desperately is trying to do whatever he can to do what he can for his kid. Even Ted, if you can ignore his cartoonishly devilish intentions, is just a neighborhood single father doing everything he can for his kid (trying to bang a married woman notwithstanding). \n\nI enjoyed this movie as a kid and it still brings back fond memories.",

I stop what I'm doing to watch him. \"I didn't go looking for her, cuz there was nothing to find.\"  In a movie full of amazing acting, I think he tops the list. \n\nAnd a shout out to Charleton Heston in Wayne's World. He came out of nowhere and went all out for that bit. ",

        "title": "Losing your local movie theater",
        "content": "When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.\n\nExcept for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.\n\nThe last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person. Weird projection problems were common. Half the toilets didn't work.\n\nI haven't been inside, but word is the building was badly damaged a few months after closure by the a big storm. It just sold at auction for $750k and will probably be turned into another strip mall or condo development. According to the assessor, the land itself is worth twice what was paid, so somebody will probably make bank. The buyer is unknown, but I wonder if the contents will go up for auction at some point. There are a bunch of intact standees last I knew, plus old-ass, but viable, projectors &amp; audio equipment.",

With what happened to Vic Marrow and the two kids, the movie being delayed, and Noone really being held accountable it seems like it would have gotten the \"R\" rating, but it's also generally terrifying and has realistic depictions of extreme racism. Pretty intense for a \"PG\" movie. What are your guys favorite \"underrated\" movies?",
