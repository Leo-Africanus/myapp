        "title": "Meet Joe Black made me rethink what real love and connection actually look like",
        "content": "I\u2019ve seen Meet Joe Black three times now, and every time it impacts me more. As a guy who doesn\u2019t usually enjoy romance-heavy movies, I didn\u2019t expect this one to grab me the way it did\u2014but it really did. It\u2019s not just about love or death or philosophy\u2014it\u2019s about the kind of deep, genuine connection that most of us long for but rarely see portrayed with this kind of sincerity.\n\nWhat really hit me is the portrayal of Death\u2014not as a monster or villain, but as a spirit who\u2019s never experienced life, love, or connection. Watching Death interact with Susan feels innocent, honest, and deeply curious. He doesn\u2019t approach her with game or charm or hidden motives. He\u2019s just\u2026 open. Vulnerable. Trying to understand why being around her makes him feel something entirely new.\n\nAs a 22-year-old married man, that spoke volumes to me. I think a lot of guys are taught\u2014either directly or through culture\u2014that love is about conquest, performance, or even just fulfilling expectations. But Meet Joe Black shows a kind of love that\u2019s raw and unfiltered. Death doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s feeling\u2014he just knows that being close to Susan matters to him. That kind of presence and simplicity is something I think a lot of us have lost or never learned to begin with.\n\nThe sex scene between them really stood out, not because it was graphic (it wasn\u2019t), but because it felt sacred. I don\u2019t usually like sex scenes in movies\u2014they often feel cheap, or like they\u2019re just there for shock or entertainment. But this one felt like something else entirely. It felt like watching someone experience intimacy for the first time\u2014not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. There\u2019s no lust, no selfishness\u2014just a desire to be close, to be known, and to hold something real with someone else. It made me reflect on how important it is to approach love and sex with purity\u2014not just in terms of physical boundaries, but in terms of motive and mindset. Are we connecting to consume or to truly unite?\n\nThen there\u2019s the quote from Bill to Death that\u2019s been echoing in my head ever since:\n\u201cTruth, responsibility, taking the weight for your choices and feelings, and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love.\u201d\n\nThat line punched me in the chest. Because that\u2019s the part of love we don\u2019t talk about enough\u2014the weight. Love isn\u2019t just about chemistry, passion, or even compatibility. It\u2019s about making a choice, over and over again, to be someone your partner can rely on. To carry the consequences of your actions. To not run when things get hard. To live with integrity and protect the heart of the person who trusts you with theirs. That\u2019s what being a husband means to me, and this movie put words to it in a way I hadn\u2019t felt before.\n\nI recommend any guy watch this movie\u2014especially if you\u2019ve ever felt unsure or confused about what love really is. If you\u2019ve struggled with warped ideas about sex, bonding, or what emotional connection looks like, Meet Joe Black might surprise you. It\u2019s not a perfect film, but it\u2019s honest, and sometimes that\u2019s the thing that sticks with you most.",

        "title": "A24's 'Friendship' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*A man tries to befriend his charismatic new neighbour, but it soon threatens to ruin both of their lives.*  \n  \nDirector: Andrew DeYoung\n\nCast: Tim Robinson, Paul Rudd, Kate Mara, Jack Dylan Grazer\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [91%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friendship_2024)\n\n**Metacritic:** [78/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/friendship/critic-reviews/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Chase Hutchinson - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson)[TheWrap](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2205) \n\n&gt;Never could the story be described as a series of sketches haphazardly stitched together as many comedies can fall into being. It looks and feels like a drama that is coming apart at the seams as Robinson careens his way through it.\n\n[Fred Topel - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/fred-topel)[United Press International](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2795)\n\n&gt;In Friendship, the world around Craig reacts appropriately to his inappropriate behavior. So whereas an Adam Sandler character, or Bill Murray before him, would endear himself to the audience, Craig just digs himself deeper and deeper.\n\n[Marshall Shaffer ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/marshall-shaffer)\\- [Slant Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/821) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;But even for those in the audience whose mileage only goes so far with Robinson\u2019s schtick, *Friendship* has more to offer than cringe-inducing, often bawdy humor. He and DeYoung expertly skewer the rituals that trap men in prisons of consumption and estrange them from their emotions. The film is deeply attuned to male malaise, though it steers away from offering anything resembling an overly academic thesis about its roots. More than anything, *Friendship* makes the conditions of modern masculinity feel as weird to watch as they are to understand\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;Robinson\u2019s brand of middle-class psycho surrealism works perfectly in bite-size sketch-comedy doses. Stretched out to feature length, a character like Craig simply stops making sense.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Jacob Oller](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jacob-oller) \\- B-\n\n&gt;But it all relies on the chemistry between the abrasive Robinson and the too-cool Rudd. Their dynamic, either playing off each other or playing with the idea of each other when they\u2019re not sharing the screen, is strong, and DeYoung keeps them both contained to the right frequencies throughout the film. I certainly wish Kate Mara had more to do, or even to react to, as Craig\u2019s wife, but she makes her moments count. And, for better or for (much, much) worse, *Friendship* is one for the boys.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "May 2-4 Box Office Recap: 'Thunderbolts*' debuts with a solid $74.3 million domestically and $160.4 million worldwide. Meanwhile, 'Sinners' crosses $200 million worldwide, while 'A Minecraft Movie' nears $900 million worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wngz60kwb1ze1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1eddccb860443e3e769a9c792de4692c33d63c\n\nWell, the summer season is officially underway.\n\nThe MCU returned to the first weekend of May, earning another #1 spot with ***Thunderbolts***. Which hopefully will be a sign of good legs ahead. Meanwhile, ***Sinners*** had another incredible hold, despite losing IMAX and other premium-large formats.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $142.3 million this weekend. That's up a massive 108.2% from last year, when ***The Fall Guy*** flopped and delivered the worst start to the summer season in decades.\n\nDebuting on top, Marvel Studios' ***Thunderbolts*** earned $74.3 million in 4,330 theaters. That's below ***Captain America: Brave New World*** ($88.8 million), which premiered on February. Compared to other MCU titles, that's below ***Ant-Man and The Wasp*** ($75.6 million) and ***Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*** ($75.3 million) and above ***Eternals*** ($71.2 million).\n\nAll in all, this is a solid (but not fantastic) debut. At the end of the day, it's a team-up film following secondary characters that aren't very popular, with the exception of Bucky and Yelena. Marvel probably wasn't expecting this film to open at $100+ million, considering ***Brave New World*** didn't get that with a more well known character. ***Thunderbolts*** only had one hook: the introduction of Sentry. There's also curiosity surrounding the meaning behind the asterisk in the title (we'll get to that in a moment).\n\nMarvel knows that audiences haven't been fully on board with some of their previous projects (***Quantumania***, ***The Marvels***, ***Brave New World***, etc.), but they still hoped the audience could be interested in ***Thunderbolts***. To the point that one of its trailers highlighted the crew's involvement in multiple projects (most of which were A24). Well, the crew's involvement at least resulted in some great reviews (88% on RT). Not to mention the fact that back in March, Marvel confirmed that a lot of cast members from the film would be back in ***Avengers: Doomsday*** next year. While that spoiled the fate of the characters, it might have helped boost interest.\n\nAccording to Disney, 65% of the audience was male. Marvel has had a problem in attracting younger audiences, and this film is another proof of that: only 30% of the audience was under 25. What does this mean? That they're losing ground with Gen Z. This has been noted a few years, and it doesn't look like it will be fixed any time soon.\n\nIn some good news, the audience gave the film an \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore. That represents a solid response from the audience, although the MCU mostly falls in the \"A\" score. At the very least, that's better than ***Brave New World***'s poor \"B\u2013\". There's no competition over the coming weeks, although ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** will probably dethrone it in its third weekend. We'll see how it goes, but for now, a final total around $200 million is likely for ***Thunderbolts***.\n\nMarvel didn't even wait until the second week just to finally confirm on social media the meaning of the asterisk in the title. Just today, they've started promoting the film [under a new title](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/thunderbolts-poster-the-new-avengers-title-change-1236386731/) (big spoilers in that article). That's a bit too early, but will the audience be more interested in the film now?\n\nEven with the arrival of ***Thunderbolts*** and losing IMAX and other formats, ***Sinners*** was not affected in the slightest. The film dipped just 28% this weekend, adding another $33.1 million. That's almost on par with ***Get Out***'s third weekend drop (26.5%), which is simply insane. The film has earned a fantastic $179.8 million domestically, and it should continue legging out. For now, the film should hit $270 million domestically. The fact that it's getting close to $300 million is simply spectacular.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 40%, adding $13.7 million this weekend. One thing on its favor was [the \"rowdy screenings\" for this weekend.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/minecraft-movie-block-party-edition-1236202463/) Have theater employees in your hearts, for this might have been a very ugly experience. The film has earned $398.2 million so far.\n\nWell, the math is out and the numbers aren't good for ***The Accountant 2***. The film earned $9.4 million, which is a very poor 61% drop from last week. In contrast, the original dropped just 44.8%. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $41.1 million, which is $6 million below the original through the same point. That gap will continue to widen. For now, the film should finish with around $60 million domestically.\n\n***Until Dawn*** won't see a sunrise any time soon. The film dropped 52%, adding $3.8 million this weekend. That's not a horrible drop for a horror, but considering how low it began, it's simply unremarkable to make a difference. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.3 million, and it only has one weekend before facing tough competition with ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***.\n\nIn sixth place, ***The Amateur*** dropped 48%, earning $1.9 million. That takes its domestic total to $37 million, and while it should cross $40 million, it won't be by much.\n\n***The King of Kings*** continues losing steam. This weekend, it collapsed another 59%, earning $1.7 million. The film has earned $57.7 million so far, and it won't make it much further than $60 million.\n\nA24's ***Warfare*** dropped 52%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $24 million so far.\n\nIn ninth place, the Indian film ***HIT: The Third Case*** earned $955,000 in 950 theaters.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was another Indian film, ***Guru Nanak Jahaz***. Despite playing in just 119 theaters, it earned $685,000 this weekend.\n\nOutside the Top 10, we find Nicolas Cage's new film, ***The Surfer***. Unsurprisingly, it didn't fare well. It made just $698,114 from 884 theaters. It's not gonna last long on theaters, so hurry up.\n\nA24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** fell outside the Top 10. It collapsed a brutal 76% this weekend, earning just $341,951. The film has earned a meager $2.1 million so far.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Thunderbolts*** also topped the overseas box office, debuting with $86.1 million abroad, for a $160.4 million worldwide debut. That's below ***Brave New World*** ($193.4 million), although that had an extra day on Monday. It was a mixed bag all around; some were pretty good, but others were soft. The best markets were China ($10.4M), UK ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.3M), Brazil ($4M), France ($3.8M), Germany ($3.6M), Korea ($3.5M), Australia ($3.4M), Japan ($3.2M) and Spain ($2.8M). Some of these markets were also boosted from local holidays (Labor Day). We'll wait for the second weekend to see if it has a chance of recouping its $180 million budget.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** added $26.6 million, taking its worldwide total to $874.6 million. The best markets are the UK ($69M), Germany ($35.7M), Australia ($33.5M), Mexico ($31.2M) and China ($27.5M). It's still fighting to hit the $1 billion milestone.\n\n***Sinners*** is also holding very well overseas, adding $10.4 million, for a $237.3 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($13.8M), France ($6.7M), Australia ($4.3M), Mexico ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.7M). It's obviously going to skew domestically, but it looks like it could get close to $100 million overseas by the end of its run.\n\n***The Accountant 2*** added $7.2 million overseas, for a $66.3 million worldwide total. Ouch, that's not actually great. Or good at all. It should still hit $100 million worldwide, but it feels like it should've done that without problem.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Black Bag* | Mar/7 | Focus Features | $7,607,250 | $21,474,035 | $39,284,035 | $50M\n*The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* | Mar/14 | Ketchup | $3,158,830 | $8,875,344 | $13,896,775 | $15M\n*The Woman in the Yard* | Mar/28 | Universal | $9,395,255 | $22,405,985 | $23,175,286 | $12M\n\n- \"Make a good original movie and people will watch it.\" Yeah, where were you when ***Black Bag*** played in theaters? Steven Soderbergh's film earned critical acclaim, but it has ended its run with just $39 million worldwide. How frustrating, isn't it? A film that deserved much better. Don't cry for Soderbergh tho; he has just recently said that Focus Features confirmed that the film would eventually be profitable thanks to home media and PVOD. He also recently said that his new film ***The Christophers*** has wrapped filming and could come out this year. Damn, 3 Soderbergh films in a year????\n\n- That's all, folks. ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** has closed with $13 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $15 million budget. But maybe Ketchup Entertainment is content with its performance, considering they just spent $50 million in buying ***Coyote vs. Acme***, which will come out next year. Let's just hope it fares better than this.\n\n- Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** has closed its run with just $23 million worldwide. That's the second flop in a row for Blumhouse, after the unremarkable run of ***Wolf Man*** back in January. Not to mention ***Drop*** is fading quickly. What's going with Blumhouse?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nNothing lol. For some reason, studios avoided releasing anything noteworthy. The only major release is Lionsgate's ***Shadow Force***, but that has no chance of hitting #1. Probably not even Top 5.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
