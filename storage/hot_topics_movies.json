        "content": "Bringing Out the Dead (1999) is a dark psychological drama set at night in New York City, The story follows Frank (Nicolas Cage), a burned-out paramedic working the graveyard shift in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nFrank is exhausted and haunted by the ghosts of patients he couldn\u2019t save\u2014especially a young girl whose death deeply affected him. As he responds to overdoses, heart attacks, violence, and mental health crises, he spirals further into guilt, insomnia, and spiritual confusion.\n\nHe becomes fixated on saving a heart attack patient named Mr. Burke, seeing it as a chance at redemption. Meanwhile, he forms a fragile connection with Burke\u2019s daughter, Mary, who is also struggling.\n\nUnlike Scorsese\u2019s crime films, this one is quieter and more internal \u2014 almost dreamlike. It\u2019s often compared to Taxi Driver, but instead of violence, it\u2019s psychological.\n\nWhat are some thoughts on this film I personally really enjoyed the setting, atmosphere and Frank ",

        "content": "Kaitlyn Dever for me, now yes I know that she's not a movie star, or even mainstream, yet... but I'm very bullish on her. Everything I\u2019ve seen her in, from her small role in Justified, to starring in Booksmart, to the heartbreaking roles of Unbelievable and Dopesick, to frustratingly captivating roles in Apple Cider Vinegar, she's just incredible and sooo underrated, I cannot wait to see her get own storyline in The Last of Us 3rd series. I\u2019m just hoping that she gets that big breakthrough theatrical role(s) that really gets her career going, but man she\u2019s a very underrated stellar actress that I\u2019m always captivated by even if the project she\u2019s in isn\u2019t strongest, she\u2019s always the stand out, love her looks aswell.\n\n",

This could be down to a unique or bizarre score, strange scenes, characters that make you uncomfortable, or something else. I'm also particularly interested in films that have this presence but it's hard to explain exactly why... they just bleed a level of unease.",
