Stitch looks like he isn't even in the scenes in the Lilo &amp; Stitch trailer. The CGI dwarfs in Snow White look creepy and superimposed into every shot. \n\nDon't get me started on the \"live action\" Lion King which was beat for beat the original's script and had no \"live\" elements \u2014 just CGI animated talking \"realistic\" animals. Why would I watch this when I can just watch the original?\n\n*TLDR:* I wish animated films could just be animated films. I'm not into this recent obsession with everything needing a live action remake. \n\nObviously it makes Disney a lot of money. \n\nI'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this phenomenon. \n\n",

It could even be a movie with pre-existing songs as the majority of the soundtrack (Rather than orchestrated/made-for-the-movie music). The catch here is that you can only pick ONE movie soundtrack to post here (please). \n\n  \nThere are so many that I love, but my personal answer would be Lord of the Rings trilogy, and if I had to pick one of the three, The Fellowship of the Ring.

I love how it's silent for a few moments then the Germans shoot back through the wall, hitting the other GI in the neck. \n\nOne sticks his head out and Mellish drops him but the rifle goes empty so he rushes the last German. It's a scrappy, dirty fight which seems to last FOREVER, while the GI is still laying there bleeding to death. It breaks my heart hearing Mellish calling out for Rieben, who had been busy taking out the 20mm cannon. They're fighting for so long that the GI bleeds out.\n\nMellish did have the upper hand - he was on top with the knife but the German reversed and disarmed him. Then it was over for Mellish. I like that they showed humanity and that the German didn't take pleasure in stabbing Mellish.\n\nIt's actually a very accurate portrayal as well - The Fallschirmjager, German paratroopers actually held the most hand-to-hand combat victories in all of WW2. You can tell by his camouflage he's not regular German infantry. ",

In today's political climate I thought I'd re-watch this movie to get a better understanding of what Watergate was all about and how the press played a role in it.  The fact that Woodward and Bernstein had to do so much work to put all the pieces together with the help of \"Deep Throat\" was a real eye opener especially the phone books.  I enjoyed them trying to figure out how to get the information and then verify it.  When they realize towards the end just how big of a deal this is the suspense and paranoia picks up a bit.\n\nOverall great movie!  Great acting by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman!  Great directing by Alan J. Pakula!",

And yet, for some reason, you just never got around to watching them. Maybe you missed it when it came out, maybe you kept putting it off, or maybe you just weren\u2019t that interested.\n\nThen, when you finally admit it, people react like you just confessed to a terrible crime. \u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019ve NEVER seen that?! How is that even possible?!\u201d\n\nFor me, it\u2019s Forrest Gump. Somehow, despite all the hype, all the memes, and all the times people have told me to watch it, I just haven\u2019t.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one movie you\u2019ve shockingly never seen?",

        "title": "Marching Powder has to be worst movie I've seen in the cinema for a long time",
        "content": "Marching Powder, starring Danny Dyer and directed by Nick Love, released in the UK recently. The pair worked on The Football Factory (2004) about football hooliganism which was a commercial and critical success. They also made crime drama The Business, the following year. Love also made The Firm, another film about hooliganism. \n\nThis movie, again about hoolignasm, was seen as a spiritual successor to The Football Factory (TFF) . They put a great trailer together which really convinced me to watch the movie. It was basically Dyer doing his own cockney geezer shtick and I, like many fans, find him very amusing. I respect the fact he's done so well in an industry mired in class disparity and nepotism. \n\nSo, I was convinced to see the movie, in part hoping it was a worthy successor to TFF (wishful thinking) and in a bid to support a lower budget British comedy as I'd like to see more of them in the cinema.\n\nWell, it turns out the trailer had all the best jokes, making the film look like a bombastic romp about Dyer's escapades. The reality of the matter is the film completely pulled its punches and seemed totally confused about its messaging. Thoroughly mismarketed and badly executed. \n\nIt was more of a comedy drama, switching between Dyer's antics and his wife's journey from becoming less of a housewife and taking an art class. The film had real mixed messaging. \n\nHalf the film presented itself as a 'funny' romp following Dyer's antics. The other half seemed to be a melodrama about his mental health issues and his wife's need to regain her identity.\n\nThe film hadn't really been marketed in this way and it's not what I had signed up, I wanted the funny romp. It felt like the film, in a cowardly manner, pulled its punches and tried to make up for the more problematic aspects by throwing on a coat of melodrama and sentimentality.\n\nI found myself checking my watch at all the more dramatic moments which were painful to get through, as the writing was just so poor and it felt so cringey. There's even a Love Actually-esque scene where Dyer and his wife exchange written notes on pads of paper through a restaurant window \ud83e\udd2e. The scenes with Dyer's kid are painful to sit through as well, basically kid says cringey things in an innocent way that a kid usually wouldn't say type of humour. \n\nOn top of this approach, none of the characters appear to learn a thing throughout the movie. So the audience has had to sit through this drama and then there  isn't any character growth.\n\n&gt;!Dyer is back fighting. His wife stays with him, despite the fact the character doesn't have any redeeming qualities and hasn't even tried that hard to change. She stays with him for love but!&lt; I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the leads. So the messaging here that she &gt;!should settle for his behaviour!&lt; is baffling.\n\nAs you'd expect, the humour is the lowest common denominator stuff. Lots of 'shocking' jokes about drugs and sex which feel very dated and easy. To my recollection, the comedy in TFF wasn't anywhere near this crass. Like the writing here is really vulgar. When you get people comparing it to TFF and The Business, that really is an insult to those movies as Marching Powder is just so bad. \n\nI just want to highlight the fact this isn't coming from a prudish mentality on my part. I actually wanted more of the football hooligan side of things and more of Dyer's antics. If you're going to make a movie about it, just go for it. Unfortunately, it failed on every level.",

        "title": "\"Inception\" world building was too good to use in just one movie",
        "content": "Majority of the run time in Inception movie was taken up by exposition and explaining the rules of the world and how it works. 'Inception' itself was apparently a new thing to the protagonists within the universe since they usually did 'extraction'. \n\nNow I totally understand that this maybe an unpopular opinion given how franchises often cheapen the original IP by either not following the original rules or introducing newer characters who are better than original characters etc. However, IMO, there was too much world building in Inception to be used just for this one movie. Too much was left on the table. We didn't get to see the protagonists facing any challenges with extraction and succeeding. We didn't get to see the extents to which reality bending is possible within a dream. We didn't get to explore more about Yusuf's paid dream machine business. We didn't get to see the origin of the machine and how and why it was created (It is mentioned that military used it to train but how did they find this idea in the first place?). Is it just the military that use it to train or do architects and engineers plan their building designs there? Do university students use it to study even while sleeping? Are there corporations trying to commercialize these and put the good stuff behind a paywall? Do mourning people use them to talk to their dead relatives?\n\nI think we should have a franchise from this universe- at least a few more movies or a series. Nolan could direct or at least supervise any efforts to extend this universe to ensure the quality is maintained.",

        "content": "This movie is headed to Shudder soon, but for those who prefer the cinema experience, I recommend catching it while you can. \n\nGeoffrey Rush plays the high-handed, pompous Judge Stefan Mortensen, who suffers a massive and debilitating stroke while sentencing a pedophile to 16 years in prison (and then berating the children's mother for putting them in harm's way). Highly intelligent but moralistic and arrogant, Mortensen's life changes forever in that moment, and he finds himself installed as a resident in a nursing home, largely confined to a wheelchair and suddenly suffering all the indignities of dependence.\n\nMaking matters much worse are the tag team of fellow patient/inmate Dave Crealy (John Lithgow) and his therapy puppet/avatar, an eyeless baby doll named Jenny Pen. Crealy used to work at the nursing home and uses his intimate knowledge of the system (and keen mind plus relatively superior strength and spryness) to covertly terrorize the other residents, forcing them into his sadistic games while role-playing as a harmless dementia patient whenever the staff are around. \n\nThe scene is set for an epic battle of wills and wits pitting the increasingly feeble Judge Mortensen against the seemingly unstoppable Crealy.\n\nBased on a short story by New Zealand author Owen Marshall, *The Rule of Jenny Pen* is seriously creepy, unsettling stuff, masterfully acted by Lithgow and Rush. Worth seeing!",
