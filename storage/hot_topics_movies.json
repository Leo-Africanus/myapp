        "title": "November 28-30 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Zootopia 2' opens with a spectacular $560M worldwide, the biggest ever debut for an animated film, and the fourth biggest debut of all time. 'Wicked: For Good' drops harder than anticipated, but hits $391M worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/2g9pxugqeo4g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20790004811cae857ac003c4be433567c063fa27\n\nThe November box office continued building up some momentum this weekend, closing the month on a strong note.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** delivered the second biggest Thanksgiving debut at the domestic box office. But the real story was overseas, where the film opened with over $560 million worldwide, the largest ever debut for an animated film and the fourth biggest of all time. Meanwhile, ***Wicked: For Good*** had a rough drop, indicating that the word of mouth wasn't quite strong and that ***Zootopia 2*** cut into its business.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $182.8 million over the weekend ($280.5 million five-day). That's down 33.5% from last year, when ***Moana 2*** broke the Thanksgiving debut record.\n\nDebuting at #1, Disney's ***Zootopia 2*** opened with a pretty great $100.2 million ($158.8 million five-day). That ranks as the second best Thanksgiving debut, just behind last year's ***Moana 2*** ($225 million five-day). It's also far above the original ***Zootopia*** ($75 million).\n\nWhile there will be some disappointment that it didn't get close to ***Moana 2***, it should be noted that Thanksgiving has a ceiling to its performance, so a $158 million five-day debut isn't bad at all. Besides, ***Moana*** was one of the most streamed movies in Disney+, which led to a level of hype that ***Zootopia 2*** would struggle to match. But that's not a bad thing.\n\nAfter ***Zootopia*** earned $341 million domestically back in 2016, Disney took quite some time to finally get a sequel rolling. But despite the long wait, it still made a good job in what a sequel should do: bringing back the characters and continue expanding the worldbuilding. They also did a great job with their extensive marketing, and the lack of animated titles in theaters helped build demand for new family films. And while ***Moana 2*** earned a middling response, ***Zootopia 2*** didn't suffer the same fate; it's currently at a great 91% on RT. \n\nAccording to Disney, 60% of the audience was female, and 54% was 25 and under. They gave it a pretty great \"A\" on CinemaScore, on par with the original and better than ***Moana 2***. While ***Moana 2*** had a strong debut, it also had very lukewarm legs, signaling mixed word of mouth. With much stronger reception, ***Zootopia*** should hold better than that. Right now, ***Zootopia 2*** should finish with at least $375 million, but it can get much higher than that.\n\nLast week, ***Wicked: For Good*** opened with a fantastic $147 million. Based on the original film's incredible legs, it was assumed that the film could have a very good run in terms of legs, even if it did not fully replicate them. After this weekend, however, it's clear that the film will be more front-loaded than expected. \n\n***Wicked: For Good*** earned $61.7 million ($91.7 million five-day). That's a rough 58% drop, far worse than the original's 27.9% drop. While it's foolish to expect the film to have a light drop like that, the drop is still steeper than anticipated. Seems that despite the film's \"A\" CinemaScore, word of mouth isn't as strong as the original. Through 10 days, it has amassed $269.2 million domestically. \n\nThe opening weekend was $35 million ahead of ***Wicked***, but now it's just $6 million ahead of it. In fact, since Monday, ***For Good*** has lost every single day to ***Wicked***, and it's unlikely it can overtake it again. As the gap shrinks with each day, it seems ***For Good*** will finish below ***Wicked*** ($474 million). It should still hit $400 million domestically, but its opening weekend suggested it would be higher.\n\nIn third place, ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** eased 23%, adding $6.9 million. That takes its domestic total to $49.6 million.\n\nIn fourth place, ***Predator: Badlands*** dipped just 26% and added $4.8 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $85 million.\n\n***Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery*** was released in 600 theaters (none of which includes big chains like AMC or Regal), ahead of its December 12 debut in Netflix. As Netflix doesn't report box office numbers, there's conflicting numbers circulating. Right now, it seems like it has earned $4 million over its first five days. In contrast, ***Glass Onion*** earned $13.2 million on its first five days in 698 theaters.\n\nParamount's ***The Running Man*** dropped 34%, for a $3.7 million weekend. The film has earned a meager $34.2 million, and it will close with less than $40 million domestically.\n\nA24's ***Eternity*** debuted with $3.1 million in 1,348 theaters ($5.2 million five-day). That's a solid debut, and it was eerily close to the debut of ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** ($3.2 million), another fantasy romance film. The fact that it was just $100K short despite releasing in less than half the theaters is encouraging. Given the solid response so far, it could make its way to $10 million domestically.\n\nSearchlight's ***Rental Family*** dipped 34%, earning $2.1 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $7.4 million, and it should close with a little over $10 million.\n\nFocus Features' ***Hamnet*** debuted in 119 theaters this weekend, earning $932,278 ($1.3 million four-day) and reaching ninth place. That's a fine $7,834 per-theater average, which isn't one of the year's best, but it's still solid given that it opened in over 100 theaters. Focus will expand the film this weekend, before finally hitting wide release on December 12.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Sisu: Road to Revenge***, which clearly shows it will be front-loaded. It collapsed a steep 68% this weekend, earning just $773,175. That's an abysmal $348 per-theater average. It has made just $4 million domestically, and it will lose a lot of screens next week.\n\nNeon released the Brazilian film ***The Secret Agent*** in 2 theaters, and it amassed $72,517 in its first five days. It will continue expanding, as the film has some strong Oscar buzz.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nWhile ***Zootopia 2*** had to settle for the second best Thanksgiving debut, it can find some comfort in the other record it annihilated this weekend.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** debuted with a spectacular $401 million overseas, for a colossal $560 million worldwide debut. Easily better than ***Moana 2***'s worldwide debut ($389M). This is not just the biggest debut of the year, but it's also the best ever debut for an animated film worldwide, overtaking ***Ne Zha 2*** ($431M). In fact, this debut is the fourth best ever, just behind ***Avengers: Endgame*** ($1.2 billion), ***Avengers: Infinity War*** ($640.5M), and ***Spider-Man: No Way Home*** ($600.5M).\n\nMore than half of the overseas numbers came from China, where the film posted an incredible $271.6 million in its first five days. This is the biggest debut for a Hollywood title in the market since ***Avengers: Endgame***. Now, obviously ***Zootopia*** was big there (it made $236 million back in 2016), but considering how the country has rejected a lot of American titles, it's still insane to see a title debut that high. The film also has strong word of mouth in the market, which means it won't fade away like an average blockbuster there.\n\nThe film's biggest markets were China ($271.6M), France ($14.6M), South Korea ($13.7M), Mexico ($10.4M), Germany ($8.8M), UK ($8M), Italy ($6.4M), Taiwan ($4.5M), Australia ($3.8M) and Spain ($3.8M). Not all markets were bigger than ***Moana 2***, but it should be mentioned that the film had underwhelming legs due to mixed word of mouth. ***Zootopia 2*** should hold far better, especially when it has Japan left. A $1 billion is easily locked, and could get there as soon as next week. Which means that after just a little over 2 weekends, it will already be the biggest Hollywood film of 2025. Pure insanity!\n\n***Wicked: For Good*** showed some over-performance last week, but it looks like that was short-lived, both domestically and overseas. The film earned $29.4 million, which is a steep 57% drop from last week, taking its worldwide total to $391 million. While it had some advantage over the first ***Wicked***, it should be noted that that film had a staggered release, while ***For Good*** opened in most of its markets already. That makes the drop even more perplexing, although the arrival of ***Zootopia 2*** only accelerated the drops. The best markets are the UK ($42.7M), Australia ($13.7M), Germany ($6.2M), South Korea ($5.5M) and Mexico ($5.4M). You can see that aside from the UK and Australia, the film is not fully connecting with audiences outside America. It has China and Japan left, but don't expect a crazy performance there. Last weekend, it seemed like $800 million worldwide would be the target, but now it looks like it will miss $700 million worldwide as it doesn't have a lot of support outside.\n\n***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** added $16.1 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $186.9 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*The Conjuring: Last Rites* | Sep/5 | Warner Bros. | $84,006,121 | $177,753,512 | $494,400,469 | $55M\n\n- WB's ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** has closed with a fantastic $177 million domestically and $494 million worldwide. It closed as one of the biggest horror films of all time, despite the mixed reviews and word of mouth. While that led to the film dropping faster than a rock, it didn't really matter in the end; almost half a billion is simply incredible for a film like this. Is this truly the last? Think again.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThe weekend after Thanksgiving is usually a quiet one. With Thanksgiving over, people now mainly focus on the beginning of Christmas season shopping. As such, studios have avoided releasing big stuff in this weekend. In the 21st century, the largest opening debut post-Thanksgiving has been ***The Last Samurai*** with $24.2 million back in 2003. Other than that and ***Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9***, no film has debuted with more than $20 million in the post-Thanksgiving weekend. Until this weekend.\n\nUniversal is releasing ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** this weekend. A very interesting strategy, given that releasing a horror film in December is unusual. Not that it never happens, just that it's quite uncommon. Despite the terrible reviews, the original film earned a gigantic $297 million worldwide, becoming Blumhouse's highest ever grossing film. And it did it despite being released simultaneously in Peacock, which certainly hurts rewatchability. In contrast, this film is exclusively in theaters, so that's a plus. But it still remains to be seen how many audience members are coming back.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "title": "Josh Safdie's 'Marty Supreme' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marty_supreme): 96% (55 reviews) with 9.30 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/marty-supreme/): 89/100 (23 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Not every thread is spun out into something narratively substantive \u2014 Marty\u2019s idea of orange ping pong balls to stand out against white uniforms is a lot of buildup for one admittedly funny sight gag \u2014 but as a kinetic portrait of a life in perpetual motion, Marty Supreme is a wonder. Calling something \u201ca wild ride\u201d is one of the most hackneyed quote-whore favorites \u2014 see also: \u201cWhat a ride!\u201d \u201cThe thrill ride of the summer!\u201d and \u201cA nonstop rollercoaster ride!\u201d \u2014 but for this wraparound sensory experience, it\u2019s a neat fit.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-josh-safdie-1236432539/)\n\n&gt; While \u201cUncut Gems\u201d starts in its hero\u2019s asshole and ends in the back of his head, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a lot more open-ended. Marty Mauser is no less rapacious than Howard Ratner, but he\u2019s gripped by a dream instead of an addiction, and while Safdie obviously gets off on following Marty deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of his own deranged vision quest, the real thrill of this movie \u2014 which accrues an immense emotional undertow by its final scenes \u2014 is in watching Marty tunnel out the other side. In watching him figure out, on his own naive terms, that \u201cevery man for himself\u201d can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In watching him learn first-hand how easily the pursuit of success can become just another recipe for solipsism. The American Dream is just another slogan, and being the best salesman below 14th Street doesn\u2019t protect Safdie\u2019s protagonist from the possibility that he might also be the area\u2019s biggest mark. Marty might like to think of himself as \u201cthe ultimate product of Hitler\u2019s defeat,\u201d but the greatness of this movie is in how Chalamet\u2019s performance gradually sells us on the idea that he doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/marty-supreme-movie-review-timothee-chalamet-a24-1235163722/): A\n\n&gt; The movies have rarely given us such an entitled underdog, and it\u2019s both mesmerizing and maddening to watch this arrogant table-tennis prodigy ricochet from high to low for nearly two and a half hours. In the defining performance of his still-burgeoning career, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2014 aka \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d \u2014 makes you want to believe in this instantly iconic character too \u2026 even if sometimes you also want to strangle him.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-josh-safdie-1236596290/)\n\n&gt; Marty Supreme is an amazing first solo directing credit for Josh Safdie that continues to build on the chaotic vibe that he and his brother have been honing since Heaven Knows What. If you\u2019re a fan of previous Safdie brothers efforts, you won\u2019t be disappointed. But thanks to a career-defining performance from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the charismatic Marty Mauser, Marty Supreme will appeal to more than just the film and sports bros.\n\n-[Michael Calabro, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet) 9.0 \"amazing\"\n\n&gt; This new film from Josh Safdie has the fanatical energy of a 149-minute ping pong rally carried out by a single player running round and round the table. It\u2019s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks \u2013 only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures. It\u2019s a farcical race against time where no one needs to eat or sleep.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/01/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-ping-pong-table-tennis): 5/5\n\n&gt; What Safdie, and his co-writer, co-producer, and co-editor Ronald Bronstein have made is decidedly not a biopic but rather a fictionalized portrait of a \u2018what makes Sammy run\u2019 type of character from the lower east side of NY who scavengers for money \u2013 and yes happiness \u2013 in any way he knows how. With the perfect casting of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as its title star, you go along for this wild ride of a young man in a hurry, but sometimes his own worst enemy.\n\n-[Pete Hammond, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/12/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-triumphs-in-josh-safdies-character-rich-rocky-of-ping-pong-movies-1236631107/)\n\n&gt; A film this bracing and original deserves something much more inventive. But Marty Supreme has such scope, ambition and humour that its flaws, as with those off-screen Timmy exploits, are easy to overlook.\n\n-[Caryn James, BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251128-marty-supreme-review): 4/5\n\n&gt; This all makes for one rip-roaring film, but I suspect none of it would come together as well were it not for Chalamet, who is the main focus of virtually every scene, save for one or two moments. If you met someone like Marty in real life you might want to get as far away from them as possible, and yet Chalamet is so good at making this jerk likable that you're won over by his story \u2014 all of which leads to a shockingly emotional crescendo that packs a real punch. This is unquestionably the best performance of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's career, and \"Marty Supreme\" is one of the best movies of the year. I can't wait to watch it again.\n\n-[Chris Evangelista, Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/2039927/marty-supreme-review/): 10/10\n\n&gt; This makes Marty Supreme great entertainment, and the most convincing case yet that Chalamet is a real-deal star, capable of carrying a movie without the cultural context and memorable supporting turns of something like A Complete Unknown. Yet as the movie sprints through its After Hours-ish gauntlets, it sometimes feels like Safdie is more focused on clearing jaw-dropping hurdles than connecting these obstacle courses into a bigger picture.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/marty-supreme-review): B+\n\n&gt; So self-assured, yet so monstrous to those in his orbit, Marty feels like a nightmare version of the American dream, a suspicion bolstered by the film\u2019s placement in the 1950s at a time when the US was ascendant after the Second World War. The character\u2019s heedless pursuit of what he thinks is owed him represents the worst kind of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d while perverting the familiar cinematic notion of the lovable sports underdog. And yet, we cannot take our eyes off of Chalamet, who makes Marty impossible to like but weirdly easy to follow on his twisted odyssey.\n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-powers-josh-safdies-bracing-spin-on-the-sports-movie/5211372.article)\n\n&gt; A reductive shorthand for \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d will be \u201cUncut Gems with ping pong,\u201d and the two films do share a filmmaking language intended to shake viewers. Still, this movie is no mere echo of Safdie\u2019s former collaboration with his brother. It is unlike anything released this year, a riveting study of a man who fully believes it when he says, \u201cI have a purpose. You don\u2019t.

        "title": "Mission Impossible series: Calculating the percentage of runtime Ethan Hunt actually goes \"rogue\"",
        "content": "While it\u2019s sort of a meme that Ethan Hunt goes rogue all the time, I was interested how it actually breaks down, because it\u2019s not actually all the time.  Ethan gets a certain amount of latitude when trying to achieve his mission, and even if he runs afoul of some authority figure or another, he\u2019s often working with the knowledge of some other authority figure who\u2019s given their approval for the mission.  So let\u2019s do some gross math.\n\nFirst, let's define \u201crogue\u201d.  This is my definition for this purpose.  You are free to define it how you like if you want to do this calculation differently.  In my opinion, Ethan is rogue if and only if he is knowingly and directly disobeying the orders of a superior in the American government without the express permission of some other superior in the American government.  This includes any missions he is explicitly assigned and has chosen to accept.  Achieving the mission is his highest priority, and the independent nature of the IMF means he can exercise discretion when doing so.  Making a dangerous call is not going rogue, but disobeying direct orders solely on his own authority is.\n\nThe first film is pretty straightforward.  The mission goes poorly and Ethan is on the run for a bit, but he's not explicitly rogue until he meets with Kittridge and is accused of being the mole.  Kittridge suggests he come quietly, not explicit orders but pretty definitive.  They trade insults and threats but I don\u2019t think Ethan\u2019s explicitly rogue until 31:41, when he smashes the glasses on the table and throws the gum at the tank.  That\u2019s a clear act of aggression to facilitate his escape and disobey Kittridge\u2019s orders.  This continues for the next hour or so of the film.  Near the end, Ethan lures Kittridge to London and gets him on the train, but I don\u2019t think we can fully say he has Kittridge\u2019s permission until Kittridge sees Jim through the glasses camera and says \u201cGood morning Mr. Phelps.\u201d  That line occurs at 1:36:50, and although he can\u2019t hear it, I\u2019m going to say Ethan\u2019s actions are sanctioned after that point.  This continues until the end of the film.  It\u2019s suggested that Ethan doesn\u2019t work for the IMF at the end of the film since he refuses to \u201cgo back\u201d with Luther, but he seems surprised at the introduction of the tape in the final scene, perhaps meaning he was reinstated without his knowledge.  Regardless, he\u2019s not going against orders here, so we\u2019ll stop the timer at 1:45:58 when credits roll (end credits won\u2019t count, especially as they get longer).\n\n**Total On-mission time: 40:49**,\n**Total Rogue time: 1:05:09**\n\n2 is the simplest one here: Ethan never actually goes rogue here.  He makes some risky plays but everything is sanctioned by the IMF.  Not really any gray areas.  Credits start at 1:58:58.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 1:58:58*, *Movie Rogue Time: 0:00*\n\n**Total On-mission time: 2:39:47**, **Total Rogue time: 1:05:09**\n\n3 gives us an interesting situation.  Ethan\u2019s on-mission throughout the attempted rescue of Lindsey, but he sets up a mission to capture Davian without approval.  While he\u2019s not violating direct orders, the only mission he is assigned is to bring Lindsey in.  While this is meant to aid the hunt for Davian, he has not been told to apprehend him.  Creating his own mission may not be violating direct orders, but the mission he\u2019s actually been assigned has failed and he cannot be said to still be trying to accomplish it.  You could argue that this is something he\u2019s doing in his spare time, but this interferes too much with IMF operations to be considered not rogue.  Rogue clock starts at 35:11 when he tells Benji not to go to Musgrave about the information they found.  The whole mission to capture Davian is rogue until Ethan sends Musgrave a transmission telling him they have Davian.  The rogue clock ends at 57:03 at the start of the scene Musgrave tells Brassell about the mission, since Musgrave has implicitly approved the mission at this point and is vouching for Ethan.  I would argue that Ethan is technically on-mission from this point forward since he is operating with the approval of a superior, even if Brassell outranks Musgrave.  When he lands, Ethan is met by an armored convoy and is not taken into custody, so he\u2019s fine until Davian escapes.  They then send people to arrest Ethan, but he doesn\u2019t know this until he sees them.  Rogue clock will start again at 1:12:54 when he explicitly tries to evade arrest, and since he\u2019s restrained Hannibal Lecter-style while in custody, we\u2019ll continue the clock since he doesn\u2019t appear to be cooperating.  However, we now run into the problem of Musgrave, who is Ethan\u2019s superior but secretly a mole.  Musgrave tells Ethan to go to Shanghai and helps him escape (1:15:37).  Since Ethan still believes Musgrave to be his loyal superior, I\u2019d argue he\u2019s not rogue at this point (I\u2019ll still count his initial arrest and custody as rogue time since he doesn\u2019t seem to know Musgrave is continuing to support him).  However, the second he learns Musgrave is a traitor (1:38:28), I would say he realizes he doesn\u2019t actually have support within the IMF and is going against orders (this is probably not at the front of his mind, but it\u2019s technically accurate).  He\u2019s then technically off-mission until we confirm Brassell isn\u2019t actively arresting him (which we can\u2019t tell until we get back to the states, since Ethan doesn\u2019t communicate with any IMF personnel outside of his team).  This occurs at 1:57:27, and credits roll at 1:59:04.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 1:15:30*, *Movie Rogue Time: 43:34*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 3:55:17**,**Total Rogue Time: 1:48:43**\n\nGhost Protocol is another sticky one.  He\u2019s on a mission in the prison, and he receives a different mission that legitimizes his actions until the Kremlin bombing.  We don\u2019t know exactly when the President activates Ghost Protocol and disbands the IMF, but I'd argue it doesn't matter.  Ethan doesn't actually know he's been disavowed when he leaves the hospital, so he's not knowingly rogue.  Sidorov and Russian authorities chase him from this point forward, but he doesn\u2019t answer to them.  What matters is the American government.  However, it gets complicated when the Secretary gives Ethan a renewed mission to track down Cobalt.  At this point, the IMF is disbanded.  However, the Secretary is on his way to Washington to submit his resignation, which means that, while disgraced, he still technically has authority at this point.  He then dies, but Ethan still has his mission, and in multiple entries of the franchise, I\u2019ve considered the support of a superior and an ongoing mission to override other orders, even if they come from higher up the chain.  However, given the complete dismantling of the IMF I think we have to say that he is rogue from the second he learns about Ghost Protocol and the IMF is disavowed (40:51), since he has no authority and he is actively evading arrest.  This continues until 1:59:23, when we cut to Ethan and Luther in Seattle.  Since he receives a mission at the end, we can assume the IMF has resumed operations (no reason to believe at this point that the Syndicate has begun to fake Ethan\u2019s missions as they do at the beginning of Rogue Nation, since it seems unlikely they would reveal themselves to him at this point). Credits roll at 2:06:25.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 47:53*, *Movie Rogue Time: 1:18:32*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 4:43:10**, **Total Rogue Time: 3:07:15**\n\nRogue Nation, as expected, has a lot of rogue in it.  Although Brandt (who now is able to speak on behalf of the IMF) hasn\u2019t been kept up to speed on what\u2019s happening in the opening and he chastises the team, saying he can\u2019t authorize hijacking a satellite, he seems to know what the mission is.  Getting the package off the plane seems to be his primary goal as well, and he pushes for them to finish the mission even after he learns about the satellite.  Ethan and the team have gone \u201crogue\u201d in a sense by doing something Brandt wouldn\u2019t approve of, but they give him plausible deniability and he seems to accept this.  Therefore, I think this technically falls under Ethan\u2019s normal latitude, even if it is \u201crogue\u201d in spirit, and Brandt\u2019s lack of overt resistance suggests he\u2019ll back Ethan when all is said and done.  However, CIA Director Hunley succeeds in shutting down the agency, meaning Ethan is once again rogue from the moment he learns about it, possessing no authority or latitude even with Brandt\u2019s approval.  He says \u201cWe never had this conversation\u201d to Brandt at 19:09, which is a clear and active step in going rogue.  There\u2019s a bit of a grey area as Brandt seems to be granted some external authority in the search for Ethan (Hunley tells him \u201cWelcome to the CIA\u201d), but I don\u2019t think he can be said to have the authority to approve Ethan\u2019s actions.  However, at 1:46:59, Hunley accepts his role in the mission and gives his tacit approval to Ethan\u2019s actions from that point forward.  I would say he\u2019s on-mission from this point on, ending at 2:04:42.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 36:52*, *Movie Rogue Time: 1:27:50*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 5:20:02**, **Total Rogue Time: 4:35:05**\n\nFallout is another low-rogue entry.  Ethan deviates at the beginning by making a move to save Luther\u2019s life at the cost of the plutonium, but a failed mission isn\u2019t going rogue.  The Wolf Blitzer heist is damage control on the original mission, and there\u2019s nothing that states it wasn\u2019t sanctioned.  Hunley, now IMF Secretary, expresses sympathy for Ethan\u2019s position and doesn\u2019t reprimand him when they first meet.  Sloane, CIA Director, is suspicious and antagonistic of Ethan, and he acts in ways she wouldn\u2019t approve of, but he has Hunley\u2019s tacit approval and doesn\u2019t clearly go past the bounds of his usual leeway.  Even the moment later on, where he seems to go rogue and attacks Hunley, is approved by both Hunley and Sloane.  The only moment where it gets dicey is when Hunley dies and Ethan no longer has a living superior on his side.  Sloane wants everyone detained and brought in, and Ethan hasn\u2019t received a direct order from Hunley to contradict that (only Hunley\u2019s protest at Sloane\u2019s actions).  There\u2019s only an implicit order to continue when Hunley touches Ethan\u2019s chest.  However, I would argue Ethan\u2019s overall mission of recovering the plutonium overrides Sloane\u2019s order (although the Secretary is dead, the IMF is still functional), and since that mission is still active, I\u2019d say everything until the end of the movie is on-mission.  That means we have a second movie where Ethan never goes rogue once, despite accusations and deceptions to the contrary.  Credits at 2:19:51.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 2:19:51*, *Movie Rogue Time: 0:00*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 7:39:53**, **Total Rogue Time: 4:35:05**\n\nDead Reckoning\u2019s going to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.  He does start off on-mission, as Kittridge, now CIA Director, instructs him to track down Ilsa and recover the key.  Since Ethan is explicitly told that what happens to Ilsa is up to him, he\u2019s on-mission until he refuses to come in with the key.  Since this happens offscreen but is mentioned during the briefing, we\u2019ll start the clock when we first cut to the meeting at 15:49.  For the rest of the movie he\u2019s pretty clearly rogue.  Benji and Luther explicitly say the mission is rogue before it even starts.  There\u2019s also no evidence that the secretary or anyone else with authority in the IMF has approved these actions (one could argue that Ethan is the highest authority in the IMF at this point, but the point is that no one superior to him is in his corner).  And since the order to come in never goes away (Kittridge has a monologue that seems to express some begrudging support but it\u2019s unclear how literal it is and based on the next film it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s approving his actions), he\u2019s still rogue at the end credits for the first time, at 2:35:31.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 15:49*, *Movie Rogue Time: 2:19:42*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 7:55:42**, **Total Rogue Time: 6:54:47**\n\nAnd now we come to Final Reckoning, which humorously keeps bringing up the fact that Ethan has \u201cnever once followed orders\u201d despite the fact that we\u2019ve clearly seen this isn't true.  Ethan definitely starts off mission, having been off the grid for two months.  Since this time period occurred offscreen, however, he\u2019s off the hook for most of it.  He continues to be off-mission, explicitly going against Sloane (now president) and violating her direct order to come in.  The IMF is supposed to answer to the president and there\u2019s no one to override that order.  This continues until he willingly surrenders himself to the authorities and meets with Sloane, at which point she approves his mission (secretly and with a ticking clock, but all the same).  However, I would argue that he\u2019s complying with orders the moment he surrenders.  This occurs at 39:03 (had to wait for months to watch the DVD so I could get the exact timestamp).  After this, he\u2019s following the president\u2019s orders, even when Kittridge and Briggs try to stop him.  So he\u2019s locked in for the rest of that very long movie.  Final credits at 2:42:42.\n\n*Movie On-Mission Time: 2:03:39*, *Movie Rogue Time: 39:03*\n\n**Total On-Mission Time: 9:59:21**, **Total Rogue Time: 7:33:50**\n\nIn conclusion, Ethan is actually on-mission for significantly more screen time than he is rogue, by a margin of over two hours.  The ratio of on-mission to rogue is 599.35 minutes to 453.833 minutes, meaning he is on-mission 56.91% of screen time and rogue 43.09% of screen time.  Even if you negotiated some of my more arguable on-mission stretches to rogue, it probably wouldn't change the balance much.  This is mitigated a bit by the fact that two of these rogue stretches go on for months or years and we just don\u2019t see them on screen.  However, the statement that he never follows orders and is usually rogue is demonstrably untrue.",

The cameras start rolling. I'm standing by, and we're all waiting for Patricia to make her entrance. Instead, out struts Brendan dressed like Anck-Su-Namun.

However, it seems to have become a generally accepted bit of BTS trivia. \n\nAnother good example of the same phenomenon would be the frequently repeated 'fact' that Peter Jackson wanted any stunt rider who wanted going to be at the front of the Rohirrim's charge in The Return of the King to prove their love of Tolkien's books by quoting Theoden's speech - obvious horseshit to anyone who knows anything about how film sets work. \n\nAre there any other examples of popular BTS anecdotes which are bullshit?

He killed a \u2018soon to be\u2019 notorious serial killer that was terrorizing LA, like, realistically, would he serve prison time?",

In addition, when the mother opens up the window near the beginning of the movie, you can see Christmas lights on the house across the street.\n\nIt\u2019s a very slim argument, I know. But I think it might just be enough to make The Princess Bride technically count as a Christmas movie, even if it is nowhere near the focus of the story.\ufffc I mean, many people already consider movies like Die Hard to be a Christmas movie even though it\u2019s not the focus, so I can\u2019t see why this one can\u2019t join the list. \n\nYour thoughts?",
