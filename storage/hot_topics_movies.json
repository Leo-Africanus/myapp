        "title": "Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films",
        "content": "When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like \"Title 2\", \"Title II\", \"Title Part 2\", \"Title: The Revenge\", \"Tit2e\", etc.\n\nThis can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.\n\nSometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.\n\nSo what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",

I think I remember reading that Robert Zemeckis achieved this effect by shooting thru a glass floor with that was digitally covered up at the beginning of the shot. So wondering what other shots in movies just made you take a step back and go \" wow that was cool\". ",

        "content": "Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. \n\n  \nIn the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.\n\n  \nThe first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2. \n\n\n\nI think it's such a crazy, bonkers idea that people would eat up, World War 2, based on a true story, Hollywood, celebrities, all in the same movie, I am absolutely shocked that nobody has made a movie about it, it seems like a perfect idea.

I have seen the Jim Carrey animated one and the Disney one with Mickey Mouse that I love but I am interested in a film version. Is the Patrick Stewart version any good? The George C. Scott version? There's a Bill Murray version called Scrooge I may have seen as well. Thank you all!",
