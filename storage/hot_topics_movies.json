        "content": "I saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn't prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.\n\nI watch horror movies and usually don't feel disturbed so it's been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.\n\nYou just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.\n\nIt disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outliers but simply because they were limited by the era and conditions they were born into. I don't like thinking of this powerlessness.\n\nWhile watching I felt like I was grieving for my ancestors for what their \"normal\" was, how harsh those times were, and frankly amazed my ancestors survived things like that. It made me feel grateful to be living in modern times, especially with technology. \n\nWhat's a non horror movie that you found perhaps unexpectedly disturbing?",

Were some type of Suicide Squad?\" or was it woven into the dialogue in a more memorable way like when Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown said, \"We're sending you back to the future!\", or was it just a throwaway line and something completely unexpected when it was uttered? \n\nWhat was it that made you sit up and point at the screen like Leonardo DiCaprio in \"Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood\" and announce \"HE SAID THE THING\"? \n\nEDIT: Just to clarify for the purposes of this question, a title drop is when any character in the movie speaks the literal title of it verbatim for the first (and likely only) time in the film.

And give up and coming directors like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson their breakouts. Heck they manage to greenlight all three Lord of the Rings in one go. \n\nThey were like the equivalent to a punk rebel teenager  doing movies their way \n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s what killed the studio after Return of the King putting whatever out there and most of them were box office failures or absolutely terrible like Son of the Mask or Hoot and  then spending $180 million on The Golden Compass which bombed so hard that Time Warner decided to it was enough  to absorb it into Warner Bros. \n\nAnd now it\u2019s just a small label under WB  that makes some horror movies and 2 or 3  movies in other genres  that\u2019s kind of forgotten about within a couple of months. \n\nBut at least WB still keeps that legacy going but I do have the feeling in 5 years they'll eventually retire the name.\n\nI feel like New Line's spiritual successor is Lionsgate where they still make smaller budgeted quirkier movies that other studios wouldn't dare to do.

So many posts, so many comments, saying how wonderful this movie was.  I gave in and watched it last night.\n\nIt's really good.  Yes, just like you have all been screaming at me.  Good action, good comedy, good SFX, all around a great movie.\n\nI really loved Hugh Grant's performance.  He pulls off smarmy and slimy quite well. \n\nAnd I was leaping out of my seat when I saw [live-action versions](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24550574/80_Kids_Arena.png) of [these guys](https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dungeons-Dragons-cartoon.jpg).

All while making me tear up every 30 minutes lol.\n\nWhat a great flick. One of the better new movies I\u2019ve seen in a while. Definitely recommend with or without children. ",

From the beginning I could tell how it was going to end but MY GOD. Ruined my night. And my day. And possibly my week. Will I recover? Who knows. Cute cozy fun movie suggestions will be appreciated.

        "title": "ASIAN HORROR FILMS AT IT'S FINEST",
        "content": "I heard the name of this movie from reddit. I was searching for some really good asian horrors which would truly terrify me as I was tired of the same stereotypical hollywood horror with stupid jumpscares and gore even though the Wrong Turn series is one of my favourites lol. if someone asked me how I got into films without any hesitation i' would say it's because of horror films the rush of adrenaline I felt with masterclass works like Toby Hooper's Poltergeist David cronenberg's the fly or John Carpenter's 1982 classic the thing was more than enough to pull me into the world of cinematic horror and I watched hundreds if not thousands of horror films over the years of course the more you watch the less you get affected by the repetitive formula horror films tend to have. Fear is a feeling that stays on for a quite some time maybe 1 hour maybe 2 hours but it is not a spike which just comes for a second and goes away. Here what I mean to say is that hollywood horror films mostly hold jumpscares to be their prime subject for horror films while asian horror films tends to create an atmosphere so very terrifying which keeping the viewer's heart to be pumping hard for the whole time. I am a hardcore fan of horror films from my childhood but didn't get to know what true horror is until a few days back when I got recommendation from a friend of mine to watch some Asian horror films. I watched my very first Asian movie called \"Roh\" which is a malaysian film in malay language ( ofc I watched it with subtitles ) and it was terrifying. The atmosphere, the environment, the shots, the cinematography, everything was so much different than that of hollywood and I absolutely loved it and then I watched Ringu (1999) and it totally creeped me out. I couldn't sleep thinking about what if my T.V randomly starts to play the tape and what if I get a call from the very beautiful Miss Sadako. Well jokes aside, the day before yesterday I watched a film called Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum which is a south korean film of 2018. Can't sleep and the movie is 24/7 on my mind. This movie is what totally creeped me out. Can't write more as I have to go and complete my chores. Please suggest me some more Asian Horror films. Peace :3",
