Paddington makes prison nice.

        "content": "Roger Ebert had this great quote about movies and watching them at different points in your life. Presented in full below.\n\n\u201cMovies do not change, but their viewers do. When I saw La Dolce Vita in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \u201cthe sweet life\u201d represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamor, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello\u2019s world; Chicago\u2019s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello\u2019s age.\n\nWhen I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhat are some movies that had this effect on you? Based on a previous discussion, 500 Days of Summer was one for me. When I first watched it, I just got out of a serious relationship, and Tom resonated with me. Rewatching it with some time, I realized Tom was flawed, and he was putting Summer on a pedestal and not seeing her as a person.\n\nDiscuss away!\n\n",

However from what I can tell subtitles outside of foreign titles no longer exist.  It seems like this would be such an easy thing to facilitate with current technology.  Is there a reason for it?",

Fassbender, when he delicately adjusts his glasses or cuffs, evokes the sly, chilled elegance of a Michael Caine or Dirk Bogarde, but with a sliver of vulnerability in the eyes that really begs the question of what exactly is going on in that head of his.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/black-bag-review-fassbender-blanchett-spy-up-a-storm-for-steven-soderbergh/5202447.article)\n\n&gt;Highly entertaining from start to finish, the film benefits from David Koepp\u2019s inventive screenplay and Soderbergh\u2019s storytelling swagger.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/black-bag-review-the-sleek-sexy-spy-thriller-movie-theaters-need/)\n\n&gt;When it comes to sleek, stylish genre movies, Soderbergh remains a maestro at the top of his game. A spy thriller that feels like a cross between John le Carr\u00e9 and Agatha Christie, the director\u2019s latest\u2014written, as was his prior [*Presence*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/presence-review-steven-soderbergh-does-his-own-haunted-house-movie/), by Oscar-winning screenwriter David Koepp\u2014is at once clipped and fluid, as sharp as a dagger and as silky as luxury bedsheets.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett/)\n\n&gt;Human weakness is 'Black Bag\u2019s' greatest strength. It\u2019s an insidiously great spy movie, mature and satisfying. \u201cBlack Bag\u201d digs into the superficially erogenous spy genre and finds inside it a desperate need for therapy. It\u2019s an intricately intertwined tale of sexual strife and political machinations, and a strong reminder at the heart of every drama, personal or political, there\u2019s human weakness.\n\n[TIME - Stephanie Zacharek](https://time.com/7264825/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh/)\n\n&gt;Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George\u2019s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.\n\n[IGN - Siddhant Adlakha ](https://www.ign.com/articles/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-steven-soderbergh)\n\n&gt;Its story of three couples working at the same British agency turns all the right screws with impeccable timing, forcing its characters to examine the flaws in their relationships as its tale of state secrets gradually unravels. A film that projects domestic anxieties onto the espionage genre, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Black Bag is a slick, self-assured, wildly entertaining spy thriller about a husband-wife intelligence duo forced to question their trust.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender-1236329004/)\n\n&gt;Steven Soderbergh dashes off a sleek little genre exercise -- a doodle really, at a stage in his career when he\u2019s clearly just having fun -- that proves to be one of his smartest and sexiest films yet.\n\n[Deadline - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/03/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-spies-steven-soderberghs-stylish-thriller-1236311971/)\n\n&gt;With an A+ cast at the top of their game, a tight 93 minute running time, and dialogue with wit and bite, this finds the director with one of his best opportunities to do what he does so well and give that older audience a reason to go back to the movies.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-and-cate-blanchett-intrigue-in-marital-espionage)\n\n&gt;Steven Soderbergh\u2019s downbeat, affectless tongue-in-cheek spy comedy (\u201ccaper\u201d isn\u2019t quite right) is in this new mode, though taking itself to the edge of self-satire, with a few 007 refugees in the cast, efficiently scripted by David Koepp.",

I honestly didn\u2019t expect to get so emotional over it.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious \u2013 which movie had a similar effect on you? The one that changed your perspective or made you see the world a little differently? Let\u2019s hear those life-altering cinematic experiences! \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\udca5",

        "content": "My dad always does something I've only ever heard of people occasionally doing. No matter what movie or TV show he's watching at home, he will get up in the middle of it and with zero urgency, go to the bathroom, grab food, look out the window, or do any number of random things, all without pausing.  He'll then sit back down having missed 5-20 minutes without saying a word and never asks questions after the movie. \n\nIt used to drive me nuts when I lived at home over a decade ago and recently I stayed over one night and watched him do the same thing.  My mom doesn't even bother asking if she should pause. \n\nQuality doesn't matter either. It could be the greatest movie he's ever seen, but he'll still miss 10 minutes of it doing whatever. I've seen him take out the garbage, cook popcorn on the stovetop, and even fold laundry in another room all while a movie he wanted to watch was playing. \n\nThis is insane right? I understand not being in to a movie and getting bored, but in my 30+ years I've never seen or heard of him sitting through an entire movie.  This is the same guy who can sit on the porch for an hour or two doing nothing. I don't understand. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to change him or anything. I just truly don't understand and want to see if anyone else knows someone like this.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n****EDIT**** People keep saying it's about spending time with others or not wanting to interrupt. It's just my mom and dad at home, and if they disagree on what to watch she'll go upstairs to watch something while he watches what he wants alone....but still gets up without pausing.",

I mean movies that start so slow and uneventful that you have no idea or even a hint at just how batshit insane it gets by the end. ",

        "content": "This was an interesting action movie experience for me. It was good! Something especially notable was how men interacted with each other, being sensitive toward each other and openly expressing their emotions, crying lots of times. It was a refreshing departure from American media where I honestly just don't see anything like it happening. \n\nTypical gender norms sadden me. It's like years of cultural norms have stunted people's growth in so many ways when they otherwise could be processing their emotions in more authentic and likely healthier ways. Here in GMO you see companionship and empathy and it really displays an openness to the way the characters functioned as people. It was almost off-putting, yet their actions would perhaps be true to life, under those circumstances. ",

Kieran received an actual oscar??? has anyone else had a moment where the universe just casually threw a personal plot twist at them like this? do you know if I can somehow talk to Jesse? what is going on?",

I'm located in Australia btw.\nThe funny thing is, I specifically avoid trailers, and was always keen to see this movie. What I don't get is that the advertising spend thrown in my direction must far exceed the revenue of going to the cinema. Has everyone else been seeing the same thing? ",
