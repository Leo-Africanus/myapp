        "content": "Hey, Reddit! I\u2019m Reza Dahya and my feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW 2025), hits digital platforms on 11/21! It features rising star Ashton James as an aspiring rapper seeking his big break in Toronto\u2019s music industry. AMA!\n\nHere's the trailer:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ)\n\n**About Boxcutter:**\n\n&gt;Aspiring rapper Rome has the talent and the vision to break out in Toronto's hip-hop scene but his crippling insecurity is holding him back. When he learns that megastar producer Richie Hill will be making an appearance at a local club, Rome seizes the chance to meet him and get him his album. However, disaster strikes when Rome\u2019s apartment is burglarized and the only copy of his album is stolen. Racing across the city with his friend Jenaya, Rome scrambles to track down his collaborators, and his records, before he misses his one shot. Set against Toronto\u2019s gentrifying streets and its vibrant music scene, BOXCUTTER features an authentic look into Toronto\u2019s creative arts community with fixtures like Rich Kidd (2-time Juno-winning artist, produced songs for Drake, DMX, Jay Electronica and more), Clairmont the Second (Juno, Polaris &amp; Prism-nominated artist), RUSSELL! (R&amp;B singer/producer) and Junia-T (the official DJ for global superstar Jessie Reyez) all making appearances.\n\n**About Director Reza Dahya:**\n\n&gt;Reza Dahya is known for his work as a host and producer of OTA Live on FLOW 93.5 FM in Toronto. He transitioned into filmmaking with his short films, ESHA and the crowd-funded FIVE DOLLARS, which premiered at the TIFF Kids International Film Festival, screened internationally and aired on CBC\u2019s \"Canadian Reflections\". A 2015 alumnus of the CFC Directors\u2019 Lab, Dahya completed his CFC Short Film, CHAMELEON, the independent THE WORST PART and is currently releasing his feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW, 2025).\n\nFor additional information: [https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter](https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter)\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back tomorrow Friday 11/21 at 3 PM ET at to answer any questions.\n\n",

Keep in mind, these children (ages ranging from 8-18) have no formal combat training. But they do have home field advantage and they have the numbers (at least a couple dozen of them vs 1 man). \n\nMy prediction, instead of taking a full day, John Rambo defeats them in less than 2 hours.",

        "content": "There is a trope I've seen at least a few times where there is a diegetic sound (sound effect or musical cue that is part of the movie world) and someone says \"hey, cut that out\" and the camera pans to someone making the noise we thought was part of the score. It's like a fourth wall break of sorts. What are some examples of the rare trope? Is there a name for it? \n\nExample:\nIn Wallace and Gromet there's a scene where they're in the church talking about the were-rabbit and suspenseful organ music starts playing and we assume is the score, until the vicar turns and says \"stop playing that music\". The camera then pans to a woman on the organ who says \"sorry\"\n\n\nEdit: Grammer ",
