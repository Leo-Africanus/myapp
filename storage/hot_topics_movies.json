        "content": "when we talk about movie trilogies, we typically talk about movies that are all part of one series. however, there are trilogies in existence that consist of unrelated movies that are tied by certain things, be them themes, actors, directors, etc.\n\nperhaps the most famous example of this is edgar wright's three flavors cornetto trilogy. it consists of shaun of the dead, hot fuzz, and the world's end. these 3 films are connected by writer/director edgar wright, stars simon pegg and nick frost, and the appearance of cornetto ice cream. however, there are other examples.\n\nmany directors have these. john carpenter has the apocalypse trilogy, ingmar bergman has the silence of god trilogy, wong jing has the colors trilogy, luico fulci has the gates of hell trilogy, terry gilliam has the imagination trilogy, luca guadagnino has the desire trilogy, alejandro G inarritu has the death trilogy, baz luhrmann has the red curtain trilogy, park chan wook has the revenge trilogy, roman polanski has the apartment trilogy, oliver stone has the vietnam war trilogy, and gus van sant has his own death trilogy.\n\nsometimes, unrelated movies form a trilogy due to having the same actor be in similar situations. for example, the weird reality trilogy consists of 3 films where jim carrey's life takes a turn for the strange. this trilogy consists of the truman show, bruce almighty, and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. george clooney considers the first 3 movies he made with the coen brothers to be a trilogy, even dubbing it the idiots trilogy. nic cage has the beige volvo trilogy, which consists of the rock, con air, and face/off. these are 3 action movies starring nic cage and featuring a beige volvo.",

Jackson as Mace Windu\n\nChristopher Lee as Count Dooku\n\nEd Sheeran in Game of Thrones\n\nThese are people who are very well known though considered by many to be miscast.\n\nMany hugely famous musicians succeeded as actors. Cher. Queen Latifa. Bette Midler. Elvis. Barbara Streisand. Dolly Parton. Ice-T. Ice-Cube. Ludacris.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Ariana Grande in Wicked.\n\nI\u2019d love to see more Mick in movies.",

        "content": "For reference The Strangers(2008)/ Taken (2008) is a complete edge of the seat, nail-biter, sweaty palms movie of my choice. I'm a bit rough when choosing movies, I can go in circles for hours trying to choose one. I need a movie that can keep me on the edge of my seat and hold me there throughout the whole movie. I've watched tons of movies in my lifetime and I'm very picky. Your top recommendations are appreciated.",

        "content": "Before anyone jumps in, I\u2019m not saying he was bad. He was solid, and he did exactly what the role asked of him. But \u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t the same as \u201cexceptional,\u201d and I didn\u2019t see anything in the performance that felt truly singular or irreplaceable.\n\nEvery year, the supporting categories are stacked with performances that bring extreme emotional range, transformation, or narrative weight, many of which don\u2019t get recognized at all. Compared to those kinds of turns, Elordi\u2019s role didn\u2019t strike me as particularly demanding or transformative, nor did it feel like something only he could have pulled off.\n\nTo me, it felt like a well-executed performance that a number of capable actors could have delivered at a similar level. That\u2019s where I struggle to see the case for an Oscar nomination, where the bar is (or should be) set much higher than competence.\n\nCurious to hear what others think? What specifically about his performance stood out to you as awards-worthy?",

I can\u2019t recall the last time a movie has made me cry since I\u2019m not nearly as emotional as I was when I was a kid, but HOLY HELL did this movie bring me close to doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie about a father and his son as they traverse a post apocalyptic United States in search of a boat to see if they can find a safer place to live.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear during the movie that humanity is doomed. A worldwide disaster struck the now ash covered planet, and pretty much all plant and animal life is gone. Because of that, it isn\u2019t uncommon for any remaining people to start resorting to cannibalism.\n\nI ended up watching it on my birthday, and it really put a damper on the remainder of it. Is it arguably a good movie? Yes, but I have no desire to watch it again. Not for a very long time at least.",

I normally always sit down and watch it if I see it on or streaming somewhere and have the time. I\u2019ve probably seen it a hundred times. \n\nThe reason it\u2019s my favorite movie isn\u2019t just because the acting is great, the story is great, and the pacing is almost perfect. It\u2019s that it takes me on this complete emotional journey of ups and downs and leaves me feeling happy and uplifted. I always have a smile on my face when credits roll. \n\nI recently just realized not a single other movie in my top 10 leaves me with that same feeling. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have other feel good movies on my watch list, it\u2019s the complete package that those other movies are acting. \n\nSo I figured I\u2019d come here and ask Reddit if you guys got any suggestions of another movie that could maybe make my top 10 that gives me that complete emotional journey with a happy ending.
