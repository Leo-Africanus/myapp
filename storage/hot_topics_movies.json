        "content": "We will be back today Wednesday 4/17 at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\nWe are Andrew Ahn (co-writer/director) and James Schamus (co-writer/producer) of THE WEDDING BANQUET\u2014 a deeply personal, sharply funny, and emotionally rich reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s beloved 1993 classic.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nTogether, we bring decades of filmmaking experience to the table! James is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and producer behind films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, and the original version of The Wedding Banquet. Andrew is a Sundance-winning director whose work like Spa Night, Driveways, and Fire Island explores identity, intimacy, and family, both those we\u2019re born with and those we choose for ourselves, with heart and nuance.\n\nThis new version of The Wedding Banquet reflects the world we live in now \u2014 from universal, evolving ideas of family and tradition, to the complexities of queer Asian American identity. We\u2019ve poured our hearts into this project, and we\u2019re thrilled to share it with you!\n\nWant to know about the making of this film, what it means to update a classic, or how two storytellers came together to collaborate? Ask us anything.\n\nOur credits:\n\nAndrew Ahn \u2013 Director/Co-Writer -\u00a0[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3821224/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3821224/)\n\nJames Schamus \u2013 Producer/Co-Writer -\u00a0[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770005/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770005/)",

I watched it with my 5 year-old this morning and he absolutely loved it!\n\nThe script (by Zemeckis and Gale) is still taught at film schools today as an absolutely brilliant example of Three Act structure and how to set-up/payoff. \n\nSo tell me - were you around in \u201885 to see it theatrically? Did a parent show it to you? How do you think the film plays today? For me it works just as well and I even occasionally find things I\u2019d never noticed before.\n\n\n",

        "title": "Grandma's Boy was way ahead of its time and doesn't get the credit it deserves",
        "content": "It's a good solid comedy about a group of friends who work at a video game company in the mid 2000s. Waaay before nerd culture became popular and mainstream. It shows the lives of actual nerds before being a nerd became cool. Is it a cinematic masterpiece and the most well written comedy film ever? Of course not. Is it also a stoner movie? Yes. But it isn't a stoner movie in the way Half Baked or Harold and Kumar are stoner movies. And I think that aspect has always overshadowed the fact that it's just an overall good buddy comedy set in a time that is very nostalgic for a lot of people who were in the same age range as the characters at the time the movie was released. The reason I say it was ahead of its time is because you can swap out the video game company in Grandma's Boy with any creative media/internet/journalistic venture that groups of nerd friends have launched over the past 20 years, and it could serve as the exact same kind of backdrop for a similar story. And seeing how having such a venture is the norm these days in nerd culture, you can't deny seeing the makings of that kind of thing in the modern era of pop culture as early on as Grandma's Boy. Like I said, overall it's just a good comedy. But too often it gets dismissed as just being a typical stoner movie.\n\nEdit: Nice to see all the love for Grandma's Boy. ",

I\u2019m not looking for jump scares or just good production, I want something that really *messes* with me.\n\nHere are a few I\u2019ve seen recently:\n\nIncantation \u2013 Loved the atmosphere and presentation, especially how it played with curses and audience interaction. It was really well done\u2026 but honestly, not that scary.\n\nLonglegs \u2013 Cinematography and storytelling were top-notch, and I was hooked the whole time. But that ending... when it boiled down to *\"the devil made me do it\"*, it just killed it for me. I\u2019m not into supernatural explanations that feel like a cop-out.\n\nGonjiam: Haunted Asylum \u2013 This one was solid, especially for found footage. Great pacing, great use of the setting. I want more like this. (But it wasn't scary at all)\n\nSo yeah, I'm open to *any* language as long as there are English subtitles. I do have a soft spot for found footage, but I\u2019m happy with any style or subgenre as long as it delivers on the terror.",

        "content": "So, after I see a movie (particularly when I really enjoy the movie) I like to think about it on my drive home and then once I\u2019m home I like to read a couple of reviews. My question is are there any critics out there you guys like to read frequently? Admittedly Reddit has become a pretty solid source for me as far as varying opinions and discussions about new movies. I\u2019ll usually check the reviews on Ebert just because, and maybe a couple of others though no one very regularly. So looking for any suggestions of who you like to read? Could be for their insight, writing style, etc. And not necessarily someone who seems to have your same taste, but someone who\u2019s your go to if you\u2019re the kind of person that enjoys reading reviews. Thanks! ",

        "content": "Hello! Excuse the wording as grammar is not my strong suit, but I've been trying to find a movie that I saw around 10 years ago. Sadly, being a 6 year old when i watched it i remember very little about it, so I'll list every detail i can think of.\nThe movie was about a group of I think saturation divers that got stuck in the deep sea in a malfunctioning submersible. I don't remember how many people were on it, but i remember that there were at least 3 - one that died trying to swim up, one that succeeded in escaping and one that dies of asphyxiation. I remember the third character hallucinating about a mermaid or something that stabs him to death.\nI understand that this is very little information and I wish I could think of more.",

        "content": "I've never seen almost any horror movies before despite pushing 30. I can probably say I've seen less than seven thus far. It's just a genre I've never been interested in before.\n\nI'm trying to get through a backlog of \"must see\" 1930s-2000s horror films, as well as not-so-must-see-but-still-fun 80s and 90s era slashers. It's probably a good 100+ films long.\n\nI tried to get through most of it last October but only saw *Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1*. Nice film, though not nearly as gorey as I expected from its reputation. It's apparently very subversive by modern slasher standards (for example, no \"final girl\").\n\nI feel that's the difference between me and a horror movie fan. A lot of people see horror like any other genre and watch it whenever, though most horror films come out in summer or autumn. I see horror films as seasonal: to be seen in October and maybe November, then ignored the rest of the year.",

        "content": "I'm currently watching Only Lovers Left Alive for the first time. I had a good feeling about it just because of the casting but I honestly did not expect the magnetic chemistry between Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston. \n\nDuring the scenes where they are apart, my mind starts to wander and I become less engaged but when they are in a scene together, my eyes are glued to the screen. And it's not only the romantic scenes that work but also the comedic lines or them just talking casually. They feel real.\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on other unexpected but fantastic pairings. What else am I missing out on?\n\nEdit: Another one that just sprang to mind is Elle Fanning and Peter Dinklage in I Think We're Alone Now. This surprises me not because of the height difference but the age and experience difference. Their relationship seems natural  and I honestly can't imagine another pairing in those roles.",

        "content": "I just watched Zodiac (2007) for the first time, I knew about the case and the details of it before I watched the film, and I gotta say, David Fincher did a fantastic job making a movie based on the case. Because he didn\u2019t try to make things grander than they were, or add a lot of bigger more epic things for dramatic purposes. He stayed completely true to real life even though the case in real life went nowhere. Telling the story through the eyes of Jake Gyllenhaal playing the real life cartoonist was the perfect way to tell the story for the film, because that\u2019s where the letters were being sent, so we slowly learn the case at the same time as everyone else is learning about it reading the sent letters. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always, and this is by far my favorite performance from Mark Ruffalo! I love how the 3 main characters get roughly the same amount of screen time and all 3 have their own story arcs that we follow, great film!",

There's something about these pieces of media that make you want to stop and think about them, instead of saying, \"That was a cool movie\" and moving on rather quickly because you missed the point (I have a bad habit with this) or because there is not much of a point being made.
