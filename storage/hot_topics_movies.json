        "title": "AT&amp;T Lost $47B on This Exact Bundle\u2014Now the Ellisons Are Buying It Back for $111B. Bold Move or Billionaire Ego Trip?",
        "content": "Larry Ellison, one of the richest people alive, just personally guaranteed $45.7 billion so his son David could buy a Hollywood studio. That's about a fifth of his entire fortune, locked in with an irrevocable pledge he can't undo while the deal is open.\n\nTotal price: $111 billion. The Ellison family is putting up the equity, and $57.5 billion in debt is coming from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo. But follow the money trail: AT&amp;T paid almost the exact same price for these same assets in 2018 ($108.7 billion). Four years later, AT&amp;T bailed and sold them for roughly $43 billion, a $47 billion loss for shareholders. So the same HBO, same Warner Bros. studio, same DC Comics, and CNN are being sold for the third time in eight years, at nearly the same price that already wrecked one buyer.\n\nNine months ago, WBD stock was $7.52. Today it's near $29. That 284% run wasn't driven by better business results. It was driven entirely by a bidding war between Netflix and Paramount that kept escalating until Netflix finally walked away. Netflix stock jumped 13% the moment they dropped out. They'll spend $20 billion making their own stuff instead.\n\nThe debt math is something else. WBD already carries about $33.5 billion in debt, mostly inherited from the AT&amp;T era. Paramount is now stacking $57.5 billion more on top. The combined company will be one of the most highly leveraged media companies ever assembled, while the cable TV side of the business (CNN, TNT, Discovery Channel) continues to lose viewers and ad revenue every quarter.\n\nDavid Ellison founded Skydance in 2006. Only five of its films have crossed $200 million at the domestic box office, three of them starring Tom Cruise. He merged Skydance with Paramount last August. Now he's absorbing all of Warner Bros. Hollywood's Big Six studios, which became the Big Five when Disney bought Fox in 2019. Now the Big Five becomes the Big Four.\n\nThe last person who bet $108 billion that they could build a media empire around Warner Bros. was AT&amp;T's CEO. He was off by about $47 billion",

The question it's asking hasn't changed. But I finally have enough relationship history to understand that Joel and Clementine at the end aren't a love story - they're a warning. They know what happens. They've seen the whole movie. And they do it anyway  \nKaufman builds that ambiguity in deliberately. The film is simultaneously the most romantic and the most unsentimental thing about love I've ever seen\n\nWhat film changed completely for you between a first and second viewing - or between seeing it young and seeing it now?",

        "content": "there are lots of movies where the protagonist is morally grey. however, what about movies where the protagonist is just a straight up bad person? movies where the protagonist is just an irredeemable piece of shit from when the movie starts to when it ends.\n\nfor me, the first film that comes to mind is there will be blood. the film is unapologetic in the fact that daniel plainview is an abhorrent human being. and yet, he's one of the most compelling main characters i've ever seen in a film. in fact, i'd argue that it's BECAUSE of his horribleness that he's so compelling to watch, along with the good writing and daniel day lewis giving a performance for the ages.\n\nwhat other movies have a protagonist who is an irredeemable sack of shit? and i mean intentionally.",

        "title": "Robert DeNiro as William Hale in Killers Of The Flower Moon is at the same level of his greatest performances ever.",
        "content": "After two years since its release i rewatched Killers Of The Flower Moon, the Martin Scorsese western crime epic starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow and i have to say this.\n\nRobert De Niro\u2019s performance as William \"King\" Hale in Killers of the Flower Moon is a masterclass in understated menace and psychological complexity. \n\nIn my opinion it's at the same level of his greatest and most iconic work (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Godfather Part II, The King Of Comedy, The Deer Hunter, Once Upon A Time In America, Mean Streets, Awakenings, Cape Fear, etc...).\n\nHe plays Hale as a man who outwardly presents himself as a benevolent patriarch and friend to the Osage Nation, while secretly orchestrating a series of brutal murders for wealth and control.    This duality is central to his performance.\n\nAlso, with warmth and charm, he uses calm, grandfatherly tones, soft eye contact, and controlled body language to create a fa\u00e7ade of trust and affection, especially in scenes with Mollie Kyle and Ernest Burkhart.\nWhen alone or in private conversations, his cold and calculated true nature emerges, methodical, coercive, and ruthless. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t play this with overt malice; instead, it\u2019s conveyed through small shifts, a tightened jaw, a sharper gaze, or a clipped sentence.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s Hale doesn\u2019t rule through loud threats or overt aggression. He manipulates with quiet authority, a masterful example of command throughout subtlety.\n\nAnd hear how he modulates his voice, it remains steady and calm, almost soothing, which makes his manipulations more chilling.\n\nHe\u2019s often seated, relaxed, conveying control through stillness. When he does move, it\u2019s deliberate , a lean forward, a glance, a dismissive gesture, all signal dominance.\n\nOne of the most disturbing dynamics in the film is between William Hale and his nephew Ernest.\n\nIn many ways, he's the mentor and the manipulator.\nDe Niro plays Hale as someone who grooms Ernest under the guise of family loyalty. His guidance feels paternal but is laced with coercion.\n\nIn scenes where Ernest questions the morality of their actions, he subtly reasserts control through patronizing reassurances, guilt, and appeals to family and duty.\n\nBut what makes De Niro\u2019s performance so effective is its restraint:\n\nThere are no villainous cliches, there\u2019s no ranting or overt sadism. \nInstead, he embodies the banality, or better, the ordinariness of evil, a man committing atrocities under the illusion of civility and righteousness.\n\nHe also channels an interesting moral ambiguity at times into this character. \nHale seems to believe in his own lies, convincing himself that he\u2019s protecting the Osage or preserving order. This layered self-deception adds depth to the role.\n\nThough not as physically altered as in some of his past roles, he subtly ages Hale through posture and energy.\n\nThere\u2019s a weariness and weight to the character, reflecting the years of hidden corruption.\n\nMoreover, De Niro shoulders the role with an awareness of the historical gravity and social importance.\n\nHe plays Hale not as a caricature but as a real personification of systemic exploitation. \n\nHis performance emphasizes how figures like Hale didn\u2019t act alone, but were embedded in and enabled by an entire corrupt system.\n\nHale is terrifying because he feels real, he's a soft-spoken man who commits monstrous acts under the guise of respectability.\n\nHis performance is built on control, nuance, and the quiet horror of calculated evil, one of the most quietly chilling roles of his career. \n\nThe film is a powerful reminder of his mastery, it's subtle acting, but deeply layered, showing his ability to do more with less.\n\nHe plays against expectations, portraying evil not through explosive emotion but calm rationality.\n\nDe Niro and Scorsese obviously have collaborated for decades, but i think Hale stands out because it's their first major pairing since Casino where he wasn\u2019t the clear protagonist but still dominated the screen, a richly ambiguous character which lets him showcase the kind of internalized villainy he hasn\u2019t often explored.\n\nUnlike many of his past roles which were physically or emotionally volatile, Hale is terrifying in his restraint.\nI never saw him playing such an affable and charming businessman.\n\nThat departure from his typical intensity makes the performance uniquely chilling, memorable, and quietly monstrous.\n\nWhile it might not eclipse the physical and raw intensity of Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, or The Deer Hunter, William Hale is one of the most mature, refined, and haunting performances of De Niro\u2019s career.\n\nIn terms of subtlety and psychological depth, it\u2019s absolutely among his best, arguably one of the most chilling performances of his career, and his greatest performance of the 21st century.\n\nI'll go further saying it's easily his greatest performance since Heat and his most challenging one since Cape Fear, and the fact that he pulled off all that i said here at almost 80 years old is even more impressive.\n\nAnd needless to say, he should have won an Oscar for it, it's insane he wasn't rightfully rewarded of lots of accolades.\n\n\n",
