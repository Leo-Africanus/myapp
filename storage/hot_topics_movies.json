        "content": "There was criticism back then that the movie wasn't gory but I didn't mind because I feel the movie works so well as a martial arts meets Enter the Dragon kind of movie that it doesn't matter. \n\nSub-Zero is still a cool villain. I thought the fights were well-choregraphed. I thought Robin Shou was a strong male lead as Liu Kang and I'm even surprised MK didn't lead him into being a martial arts movie star. I thought Linden Ashby was pretty good as Johnny Cage: handsome, witty and resourceful. \n\nBridgette Wilson was okay as Sonya Blade. I found her believable in her quest for revenge and her fight scene with Kano worked. I do feel her subplot was quickly rushed out. The one thing I liked about the new MK was that it gave us more Kano and Sonya. \n\nChristophe Lambert was pretty good as Raiden and I loved Cary Hirowuri-Tagawa as Shang Tsung, reverential and evil until he drops the cloak and he's all buffed up and menacing. \n\nI hated HATED Talisa Soto as Kitana. What a waste.",

From start to finish, it had everything: a gripping story, intense emotion, incredible direction, and an atmosphere that pulls you in and doesn\u2019t let go. The final 30 to 40 minutes left me absolutely stunned and deeply bitter. The performances were phenomenal across the board, but Lee Woo-jin, in particular, stood out he\u2019s now cemented himself as one of the most compelling and chilling antagonists I\u2019ve ever seen in fiction. A truly unforgettable experience. 10/10.",

        "content": "There are plenty of big-time movies that has an awesome all-star cast like a lot of the films that were up for awards during awards season but there always seems to be a random film that has an all-star cast. With one of my favorites being Chef. Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. The only person that wasn't a super star was the child actor player the son. It was a great movie.",

Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser's chemistry in the movie really helps it shine. To me, it's one of the better comedy remakes that has been done.\n\nThe movie also has a ton of quotable lines from each of the wishes he has.",

        "title": "The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One",
        "content": "So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&amp;t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light &amp; Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. \n\nDuring quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.\n\nThey went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. \n\nHow do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well. ",

        "content": "Who here has seen this movie, and who here liked it? Although it's very vulgar and bizarre and a lot of people seem to hate it for this reason, I've always loved it, ever since I first watched it at age 13! I've watched it about 20 times since, and I never get tired of it! Besides the excellent musical score written by Pete Townshend of The Who and with musical performances of some of the best rock and roll musicians of all time, like Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, and Elton John, I also really like the story, which was also written by Pete Townshend and I've heard was based on his real life and a lot of the trauma he faced growing up. A big reason I really like it is that I've also experienced lots of similar trauma, which I'd rather not go into in detail, so I've always been able to relate to the story quite well on a personal level.",
