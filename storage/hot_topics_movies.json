Not that I want her to.)\n\n2) Great lines delivered exceptionally well and with perfect timing by Mr. CP.\n\n3) A fat dragon.\n\n4) Above average special effects, with the exception of one potato-throwing scene.\n\n5) Running joke about magic that echoes what I always think, but doesn\u2019t drag on past its usefulness.\n\n6) A complex plot that\u2019s clear enough not to feel complicated.\n\n7) An ending I should have seen coming but still made me cry. YES it\u2019s okay to cry over a fat dragon movie, although the fat dragon didn\u2019t make me cry and only featured in one of the quests.\n\nI look forward to all the comments agreeing with me.\n\n",

But I don't think hanging off cliffs or holding his breath for 10 mintues are his true forte. \n\nFor me, Cruise's best roles have always been men who are deeply broken and fight vigorously and belligerently to deny that reality. Collateral, Magnolia, Minority Report, Eyes Wide Shut, War of the Worlds, all of these performances, I find to be the most compelling in his career, because they all carry that contradiction of an emotionally and psychologically broken and stunted man, fighting vigorously to maintain a facade of having it together.\n\nIf Cruise is hanging up the parachutes and helicopters for good, now, I think he should look past Xenu and revive that Seminarian guilt, and maybe finally get that Oscar.",

        "title": "Should voting members of award shows be banned if they don't watch all the movies?",
        "content": "As usual around this time of the year, there's a bunch of anonymous Oscar voters being interviewed about their picks and, sadly, every year we get a massive number of members missing out on most films. I don't get it. They're in a highly privileged position, they're able to see and vote on literally every single movie nominated for an Oscar, and they don't even watch all Best Picture nominees? How? Why?\n\nPersonally, I don't believe an awards voter should be obligated to watch \\*every\\* film nominated across \\*all\\* categories, even though that should be their aim. But the bare minimum should be to watch \\*all\\* Best Picture nominees and, if they're actual artists, \\*all\\* nominees from their respective area - e.g. if they're an actor, they should watch \\*all\\* movies with people nominated for the acting categories. Ideally, they would watch everything in the categories they're voting on, that should be the base rule. Is this asking too much? Am I being too \"I love movies, these people should too\" sort of guy?\n\nI don't know, I find it extremely weird reading an interview of an Oscars voter saying stuff like \"I didn't watch DUNE: PART TWO because I could barely sit through the first one\", \"I watched half of THE BRUTALIST, it's very long\", \"I don't like music as a whole, so I skipped Wicked and Emilia Perez\"... like, this is all from the same voter. People saying they didn't vote for Ralph Fiennes because they thought he had already won an Oscar - as if that qualifies as valid criteria or reason to not vote for an actor - when he never won one. Each interview is worse than the previous one.\n\nLike, I belong to some critic societies, but we don't have a platform like the Oscars with every single film for people to watch. There are access issues that simply affect some people more than others which may lead to, for example, myself not being able to catch up with I'm Still Here because I couldn't get a screener and it didn't premiere where I live. But Oscars voters have access to them all, there's no excuse. Should there be an evaluation of the voting body at the Oscars so they clean up a bit? At least ban this type of people who clearly don't value the art as much as everyone else.",

It was the best animation I\u2019ve ever seen, and it was quite a journey.\n\nThe reason I am glad we didn\u2019t watch that at the last sleepover, is that it wouldn\u2019t have been the right setting, right time, or most importantly, right place. Just me and mom, crying like full grown adults, at this movie. If you want to watch it, you can, but brace yourself, it has a safer end then you would expect.\n\nThe thumbnail and the trailer throws you off guard. You think it\u2019ll be a movie that, this cat makes friends, figures out how to drain the flood; happy ending. YOU WOULD BE WRONG\n\nI won\u2019t spoil unless you want me to, but holy.\n\n(Sorry I vented a little lol)",

        "content": "I just finished watching *Up in the Air*, and I\u2019m completely overwhelmed. I initially thought the film was glorifying corporate culture, but as it unfolded, it revealed a much deeper commentary on its toxicity\u2014both for those who enforce it and those who suffer from it. I loved how it emphasized the importance of human connection.  \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the contrast between Clooney\u2019s and Kendrick\u2019s characters. He\u2019s a loner who avoids attachment yet insists on conducting layoffs face-to-face (perhaps because it allows him to keep traveling). Meanwhile, she values connection but prefers to handle things remotely, through a screen. It almost feels like the movie is making contradictory points.  \n\nAnd Vera\u2019s character\u2014that completely took me out. I still don\u2019t know how to process that revelation.\n\nIdk if anyone else has seen this movie. It was released in 2009, and Im just seeing it NOW! How\u2019d I miss it? What do you guys think?",
