You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

        "title": "'Apocalypse Now' is one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - cinematic experiences I've ever had",
        "content": "An ever-degrading fever dream. That's what watching Apocalypse Now I felt like. It probably didn't help that I watched it while coming down from a fever, sweating and a little uncomfortable, with an overcast, drizzling sky outside - but damn, the *atmosphere* this movie creates is second to none.\n\nIt's a bad trip that gets worse and worse, as Willard and his crew undertake their hellish odyssey down the river to find Kurtz. I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I was aware that Apocalypse Now is loosely based on that story. It's a masterful interpretation of that story, widening the scope and scale and making it feel somehow even more sinister.\n\nA lot of this is due to how the movie *looks.* Apocalypse Now might be the most visually stunning movie I've ever watched. It's frankly insane to me that it came out almost *50* years ago because it would still blow away pretty much anything released by even the best directors today. It looks so bold, lush and vibrant, with incredible shot composition and lighting. A sickly orange-yellow glow suffuses the landscape, and mist and fog always shrouds the horizon. It's like the characters are traversing through hell, and it adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie.\n\nIt also has one of my favourite cinematic interpretations of war in a movie. Sure, it shows war as bad, and Americans as imperialists and all of that. But more than that, in Apocalypse Now, war is much more abstract, a dark, primordial force that acts as both catalyst and conduit for humanity's darkest urges. It affects everyone. Killgore, Kurtz, the boys on the boat, Willard. Everyone becomes a beast prowling through the jungle. \n\nMarlon Brando's limited screen time is as impressive as advertised - both the writing and his performance, along with how he's shot - portray him as almost a mythical figure out of a twisted fairy tale. Kurtz is more a concept and an idea than a man. Martin Sheen is more restrained, but you can always see the madness just under the surface.\n\nAnd there's that steadily escalating nightmare-feel of the movie, and what makes it so damn incredible. Each sequence and set piece feels more surreal, bleak and unhinged than the last, culminating with the ritual slaughter/assassination at the temple that's one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I've seen in a long time. Honestly, even if you choose not to overanalyze the movie or interpret what it's trying to say, I think it would still be a 5-star watch based simply on the power of its audiovisual presentation alone. It's such a staggering achievement in filmmaking, I can't say enough about it.\n\nNote: I watched the 2 hr 27 min. theatrical cut. At some point in the future I'll probably check out Redux or The Final Cut",

        "content": "Just saw K-PAX (2001) for the first time and I'm honestly not sure what to think. Prot acts and talks like he really could be from another planet, but the stuff about Robert Porter's past makes the trauma angle pretty convincing too.\n\nSo what do you think? \nWas Prot truly an alien, or was it all a coping mechanism for something terrible he went through?\n\nWould love to hear how others interpreted it.",

        "content": "What films are notable for having incredibly difficult and tough shoots? With things like weather conditions, cast or crew not getting along, special effects not working properly, delays, just a generally unpleasant experience, etc.\n\nThe original Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind right away. That film's Hellish shoot has practically become the stuff of legends. [The Shocking Truth documentary](https://tubitv.com/movies/559826/texas-chain-saw-massacre-the-shocking-truth) goes into tremendous detail about it. It's incredible what the crew put up with during the shoot, but at least an important and influential film came out of it.\n\nJaws is another that's well-known for it's incredibly tough shoot. Especially in regards to shooting the Orca scenes in the ocean, and the frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark. Which of course led to one of the film's greatest strengths as the shark's presence was instead psychologically suggested rather than shown, which made the shark's more numerous appearances during the third act that much more impactful when you hadn't seen too much of it up to that point and by then were so invested in the story and characters. Another film that despite the difficult production, the end result speaks for itself.",

We were just on the fifth day with [Brunei](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lyj2x8/favorite_movie_by_asian_country_brunei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Today is Cambodia.\n\nOur fifth day winner, from Brunei, is **Travellers and Magicians (2003) directed by Khyentse Norbu.** It was the first feature film shot entirely in Bhutan. \n\nOkay let's do **Cambodia.**\n\nIt is located in southeast Asia. With such an ancient and rich history of Buddhism, as well as, being notable for adopting full communism in he 70s under the brutal Pol Pot regime. With as much history as Cambodia, I am hoping for some great film suggestions that capture the rich culture and identity of this country. I can also imagine there's plenty of great English language movies set in the jungles of Cambodia.\n\nThe rules:\n\nI) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I\u2019m looking for where it\u2019s rooted.\n\nII) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.\n\nIII) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.\n\nIV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.\n\nDay 5: Brunei- Travellers and Magicians (2003) directed by Khyentse Norbu \n\nDay 4: Bhutan - Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom (2019) directed by Pawo Choyning Dorji\n\nDay 3: Bangladesh- The Clay Bird (2002) directed by Tareque Masud\n\nDay 2: Bahrain- Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford\n\nDay 1: Afghanistan- Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak",

Xander Berkeley is great during the Thanksgiving dinner scene and Alyssa Milano was pretty damn good herself. I watched the Trilogy(not the cheesy made-for-tv fourth one) and the first one was good all around.. the third one was dogsh**.. but the second one just had the best ending of the three. ",
