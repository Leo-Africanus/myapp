As for comedy/drama, there's Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal. \n\nHe's said himself that he's not very good with comedy, yet his every one of his movies are filled with humorous scenes. \n\nEven his straight dramatic ones have funny moments. Schindler's List, with its dark and serious subject matter, had a few funny bits in there. \n\nBut what are the funniest scenes in a Steven Spielberg movie? There are so many to choose from. \n\nOne of my picks is the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Indiana Jones, instead of fighting the swordsman, he just shoots him dead. One of the funniest scenes in any of his movies.\n\nHow about everyone else? What are your favorite funny scenes?",

        "title": "\"The Grey\" is a timeless classic on survival and acceptance",
        "content": "\"One must imagine sisyphus happy\"\n\nThe film itself is incredibly nihilistic with all the characters dying without much meaning to their death. But it is a realistic portrayal of death of how sudden it strikes. It is in contrast to heroic death scenes of profound meaning in the majority of other films.\n\nThe first death scene is a cinematic masterpiece, arguably one of the most intimate portrayals of death in film history and I do not know of many other movies that have reached that level of intimacy with death. People also did not like it for its use of tropes-but I personally think a movie can use all the tropes they want as long as the execution is excellent enough to have us fully invested in each scene, forgetting about tropes. The whispers of comfort, the stages of grief and the score in the background. It was such a tender and raw scene.\n\nI understand many people do not like the movie for their depiction of wolves (they also do not like it because of the false advertising of an ending scene but I will not fault the movie itself for its bad marketing strategy). Its like another \"Jaws\" misrepresentation of an animal for allegorical effect. The shark being alcoholism. The wolves being death.\n\nThe wolves are not just wild animals; they function as a metaphor for death itself. Death is not depicted as a peaceful or calm transition but as a relentless, angry force. The wolves are hungry, aggressive, and invasive, much like the way death often feels\u2014unpredictable and overwhelming. We either fight it in the end or let ourselves accept our eventual oblivion. It is an embrace of the chaos and brutality of simply being alive in the first place. It shows nature's indifference to whatever meaning any of the characters had, because it in the end everyone dies. There is no encore, there might be a struggle and fight but we return the dust no matter what. It shows nature, and death within it, remains indifferent to any meaning we try to impose on our lives. Regardless of the struggles, aspirations, or dreams the characters had before the crash, in the end, they are all reduced to the same fate.\n\nIn the end it represents moving forward for the sake of moving forward. The other characters had something to get back but Liam Neeson didn't. Meaning is flexible, it has no inherent meaning until we reach out for the illusion of life and find grace in our brutal survival. It is an acceptance of it and so the movie is very stoic. It is what it is, go with the flow with nature's chaos.\n\nWhich brings me to the music, it is somber/euphoric/calm which is in direct contrast to the suicidality of the main character, and the utter violence of the rest of the film. It seems like even with all the brutality, there is beauty and tranquility in the chaos. It could also be a representation of the calming of his wife, lamenting her soothing existence over the deaths. It also has an epic factor as we brace ourselves for the worst. The music is deep and has memory in its notes, memories of our life before we finally perish.\n\nThe brutality of the film serves as a great equalizer, stripping the characters of their identities and reducing them to their basic, primal instincts. The wolves\u2019 aggression and the harsh environment strip away everything but the will to survive. This return to the raw, animalistic side of human nature is where the film\u2019s true power lies.\n\nIt feels refreshing to see how raw the movie portrays its theme of community in hardship, and the finalization of death.",

        "content": "CW: discussion of eating disorders\n\nI don't think I've ever felt more called out by a movie.\n\nI'm a 19y/o woman and have never seen a movie perfectly encapsulates the HATRED from body dysmorphia and low self-esteem. I've seen so many movies romanticize it and make it look \"'pretty\", but it's violent, disgusting, and often embarrassing. I've seen so many conventionally gorgeous women (like Elisabeth) be ASHAMED to admit they hate how they look because it can come off as attention-seeking and as if they're compliment-fishing.\n\nI hate body horror and can't handle it, but I found myself SOBBING at some of the most violent scenes. I had a very severe eating disorder a couple years ago and often ENVY who I was before I recovered. I can't even look at photos from then- because a \"trigger\" for me isn't sadness or trauma, it's a DEEP resentment towards myself for recovering. I feel that I was \"better\" before I recovered, like that version was &gt;!\"the most lovable part of me\". !&lt;\n\nI hated that I, at 19, identified more with Elisabeth than Sue. I hated that I related to almost every second of the movie, and realized that I live my life a lot like Elizabeth. I speak to myself like her, treat myself like she does, and realized I should probably go back to therapy lol. This was a wake-up call in every way.\n\nFantastic movie... prob would not recommend to anyone lol\n\n\\*\\*\\*Edited acronym ED to \"eating disorder\" to clear up confusion",

        "content": "Earlier this year, I watched Gladiator from Sir Ridley Scott for the very first time. I thought it would be a good idea to utilize the longest version available for that occasion. Now, to prepare for Gladiator II, I decided to re-watch the original movie and give the theatrical cut a shot.\n\nAs it turns out, that one works better for me. A tight cut with a fast pace, a steady flow and the ability to know when to use Commodus and when to stop digging into his character. Yes, Commodus is an interesting villain, that develops very fluidly in his behaviour throughout the movie. No, that does not mean I need additional footage of him to gain more, mostly not very notable, details about his descent into madness. \n\nThe theatrical cut does not forget that, while being a movie of epic and visually spectacular proportions, it's a revenge tale and at its core not much more. A tale busy with keeping the social aspect of Maximus' success very much alive, without kneeling into it so deep that the next scene has to dig it outta the void of needless dialogues.\n\nWith everything more concentrated, tight and back-to-back, I, surprisingly, found myself much more invested into the ending. I think it's because the theatrical cut is more about Maximus, the  warrior and less about Maximus, the human. \n\nAt the end of the day, I guess both cuts of Gladiator have their right to exist. But for me, the theatrical one felt way better. 150 minutes just flew by.",

        "content": "I was a huge World War I nerd in high school, spurred by our teacher showing us films like Gallipoli, Legends of the Fall, and A Very Long Engagement. Leading up to the 2014 centennial of the outbreak of World War I, I was very excited to get a whole new crop of films about the war, especially internationally.\n\nBut I ended up surprised and disappointed at the paltry number of films we did get. The biggest to be released in the US, *1917*, wasn't even released until after the centennial was over; ditto the recent *All Quiet On The Western Front*. Wikipedia's [list of World War I films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_I_films?wprov=sfla1) has only about a dozen titles worldwide for the whole 2014-2018 period.\n\nWhy do you think we didn't see more World War I films released during the centennial years? Is the war simply too remote now? Are war films not as popular or financially successful as they used to be? Is it even that there are so many conflicts and so much instability worldwide these days that audiences would rather not see that in their films as well?",

        "content": "What do you like or don't like about it? I know it's divisive.\n\nI'm a big Star Trek fan. I enjoy every series and I like and can enjoy every movie from the slow paced motion picture and seeking god in V to the highs of Khan and First Contact and the rebooted Kelvin timeline but I have a tough time with Generations.\n\nIMO every decision and choice was just a big mistake from\n\n* Getting a TV director who never made a movie before to direct.\n* Insulting cameos for the original cast (Nichelle Nichols and Nimoy said no) and their absence was hidden from the TNG cast who were understanding the full original cast would participate. (\\*my friend worked on it , he's in opening credits, and said Paramount didn't want to pay Nichelle enough that's why she said no and said that Paramount was cheap about everything)\n* The ultimate crazy mistake being Kirk's fantasy life in the Nexus is not reuniting with his dead son or having another chance at raising him with Carol (his personal arc in the original movies but studio execs said NO to this)... but instead some romp with a girl named Antonia on a horse.\n* Plus killing Kirk. The studio told Shatner they were doing it with or without him. So even though famously in Khan he says he knows he's going to die alone... he instead dies stupidly under a bridge collapse looking at Picard.\n* The writers were the same as First Contact and Ron Moore created Battlestar Galactica but him and Brannon Braga were under Paramount's strict thumb and weren't free to make anything they wanted. Plus they had a timetable they were on.\n\nIf you see a theme here it's that Paramount and execs were the true villains ultimately...\n\nBut letting all that go, I usually like to focus on the good. So here it goes:\n\n* The nexus is actually a cool idea. An alternate universe (that's akin to addiction) that creates a reality of anything you want.\n* The Klingon bosommy Duras sisters. (needed more to do though)\n* The crash of the Enterprise looked nice.\n* Using Data's emotion chip another good idea though executed badly.\n* Malcolm Mcdowell plays a descent obsessed villain.\n* Cameron from Ferris Bueller is in it.\n* Shatner's final line is kinda haunting... \"Oh my\"\n* BEST THING: to this day when toast pops up I point and grunt \"mmm\"\n\nMy what's bad about it list is much longer but I'm trying to be positive.",

        "content": "I am soon to dive into the book series the movie is based off of and decided to give the movie a re-watch. To my surprise it is actually good, surprisingly good compared to what we are served now. I remembered when it did come out and how it was ~~basically~~ a flop grossing only $73 mill vs the $250 mill that it cost to make.\n\nIt is a beloved SciFi classic and often considered the template that most SciFi films/books are based off of. Not bad for something written in 1912. I can't help be see modern hits like Dune taking some inspiration from the books. It has all the elements that most audiences like and has CGI that holds its own.\n\nMy only critique is the characters lack depth. Aside from John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) himself, but the Sab Than (Dominic West) and Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) lack any depth beyond the obviously stated motivations throughout the film. Even Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) has more depth than the other two combined. But beyond this, the movie itself was good and I'd recommend a re-watch from anyone",

        "content": "I\u2019m taking a film class right now (nothing very serious or academic), so I got to see it in a theater. I was completely mesmerized by the beautiful camera work and the performances. I\u2019m from a similar background, so the characters immediately felt familiar to me, but more than that, I was completely along for the ride. I was never bored or uninterested. On the whole, I\u2019m not one for neo-realism (although my professor thinks Winter\u2019s Bone shouldn\u2019t be called neo-realist), so I was surprised by how much I loved it. \n\nIt\u2019s not a 2010s film I see discussed very often, which is particularly surprising given how many glowing reviews it got when it came out. Nowadays, it seems like it\u2019s usually mentioned in reference to Lawrence\u2019s (admittedly excellent) breakout performance. On Letterboxd, reviews are largely mediocre to mixed. \n\nMostly, I\u2019m really surprised that its director, Granik, hasn\u2019t had a lot of projects since. Do you think it\u2019s just a personal choice? Or that she isn\u2019t a good  director? \n\nSo, have you seen \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone\u201d? Do you think that it\u2019s overrated/underrated/appropriately rated? Why do you think it\u2019s fallen into semi-obscurity? And why do you think that Granik hasn\u2019t directed many things since then? ",

        "title": "The End of Evangelion - A layered Japanese animation that addresses social isolation and the fear of interacting with other people.",
        "content": "In the world of Neon Genesis Evangelion, humans are descendants of a super-being called Lilith. Both the original series finale and the film revolve around an apocalyptic event called the Human Instrumentality, which merges all humans with Lilith into a single consciousness. Different factions in Evangelion want to bring about the Human Instrumentality for different reasons throughout the series. In short, at both the series finale and the end of Evangelion, the Human Instrumentality begins, and at its center is the protagonist Shinji Ikari.\n\nThe first part of the film takes an intense turn, with Rei rejecting Gendo's plan and merging with Lilith, while the Seele organization initiates Third Impact. Shinji, still inside Unit-01, is confronted with the hybrid form of Rei and Lilith, and the vision leaves him in despair. Eventually, he is pierced by the Spear of Longinus, transforming Unit-01 into the Tree of Life.\n\nMeanwhile, Shinji begins to hallucinate, and the audience is taken inside his mind, where he deals with his emotional self-destruction and memories of past rejections. The series of visions culminates with Shinji asking why reality is so painful, and Rei responds that fantasy does not solve his problems. Here, the film explores the central theme of escaping reality and accepting that, despite its hardships, reality is something that must be faced.\n\nOne of the most talked-about sequences in the film is when the animation gives way to live-action footage, showing a movie theater and a Japanese city. In this scene, Shinji reflects on his inability to understand reality, and Rei suggests that he is using fantasy as a form of escape. This scene highlights the idea that, while other worlds are possible, losing oneself in fantasy does not solve real-life problems. Interestingly, this sequence also includes images of Rei dolls in theater seats, alluding to the fine line that many anime fans walk between reality and fantasy. By the end of the film, Shinji rejects the idea of \u200b\u200bmerging with all human souls and decides that, despite the pain and suffering, it is worth continuing to exist as an individual. This decision culminates in the iconic scene in which he wakes up on a beach next to Asuka. In one of the most debated moments in anime history, Shinji strangles Asuka, seeking confirmation that he is truly back in reality. When she touches his face, he realizes that she is real, and begins to cry, as she calls him \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nThis scene reflects Shinji\u2019s desire to exist in the real world, even at the risk of rejection. Metaphorically, it is also a reminder that human interactions, with all their complexities and difficulties, are what give life meaning, reinforcing the message that isolation and escaping into fantasy are empty paths.\n\nIn the end, The End of Evangelion shows that change is difficult and painful, but necessary. Although Shinji has rejected Instrumentality and saved the souls of humanity, he is still a broken person, and the road to recovery will be long. Asuka\u2019s decision to offer compassion instead of condemnation suggests that despite all the hardships, there is a chance for redemption and building a new status quo, if everyone keeps trying.\n\nThe film's conclusion is deliberately dark and uncertain, reflecting the creators' intention to show that there are not always easy happy endings, and that personal growth is a long and often painful process.\n\nLife has pain, life has suffering, life has disappointment, but it also has its moments of joy.\n\nHomer in the Iliad reminds us that life alternates between good and bad times.\n\n\"On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.\"\n\nShinji can, even if slowly, open up to other people. It's good that the film doesn't have that typical happy ending, but it can show us that there can be hope.\n\nShinji is more similar to Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment than being a shounen hero like Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho.\n\nI didn't like the ending of the manga written by Sadamoto, because the world restarts, no one remembers anything and learns from the lessons of the past to evolve.",

I get that Don \"the voice\" LaFontaine has since passed and that style of trailer has become satirized to death, but I am so sick of contemporary trailers. Don't even get me started on the pre-trailer, trailer that seems to be the industry standard now.\n\nI just think that certain genres and certain movies could REALLY benefit from giving us a classic voice-over trailer. Instead, we live in a wasteland of slow piano renditions of the theme, mimicked Hans Zimmer \"bwahs,\" excessive strobing or fading to black, and outright spoilers at times. \n\nPeople like Percy Rodriguez could give something an immediate flavor or style with such minimal effort. I'm sure those kinds of trailers became equally stale to a point, but I sure miss them now.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/skeogtwb6k1e1.jpg?width=312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b580fe6ce5512c0481fa262cdaccb9b90e56b2\n\nI always thought the title of this kitschy western about cowboys &amp; girls duels was cool. But I didn't realise it's a word play on the olde English meaning.\n\nI was watching an episode of 'Wolf Hall' on the BBC. A drama about 16th century English king Henry the 8th.  \nIn the drama, Thomas Cromwell laments that he has wronged people who are no longer alive. He talks about how you can change the mind of someone who is alive but not someone who is dead. But he uses odd middle English phrasing.  \n  \nHe says, \"*You can persuade the quick, but how do you remake your reputation with the dead*?\"  \n  \nInstead of 'alive' he uses the phrase 'quick'. Which made me think of The Gene Hackman, Russel Crow, Sharon Stone, Leonardo Decaprio movie 'The Quick and the Dead'. A title which obviously refers to those who are a quick draw surviving and those who are not quick being killed.  \n  \nUpon researching how a phrase 'quick and dead' made it into medieval dialogue, I found that the movie title is actually inspired by the Apostles' Creed used in some Catholic and Protestant church services \"*He shall come to judge the quick and the dead*\"  \n  \nIn this case, \u2018quick\u2019 is derived from the Olde English \u2018cwic\u2019 to mean, \u2018alive\u2019 or \u2018moving\u2019 or \u2018animated\u2019.  \n  \nSo the movie title of \u2018The Quick and the Dead\u2019 literally just means \u2018The living and the dead\u2019. But of course, it\u2019s also a clever wordplay about quick draw gunfighters.",
