I haven't seen much discussion of it but it's a great surreal comedy in the vein of Quentin Dupieux. It's doesn't have a great score on Letterboxd, so I understand it's not for everyone, but it's my first encounter with filmmaker Guy Maddin and I loved it. \n\nI'll also mention: Orion and the Dark (2024) written by Charlie Kaufman who manages to apply his meta sensibilities to a kids movie perfectly. \n\nI'd love to hear some recommendations for a chance to catch up on some interesting titles I might have missed.

        "content": "So this movie is about as far removed from what I would normally watch as could be, but it was in a group setting and that's what was decided on so I was like alright, not my cup of tea but whatever.\n\nFor the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect a Netflix original comedy with a single-digit RT score to be; not overly offensive, just a complete waste of time that feels like it was made in a laboratory. That being said, there's one plot point towards the end of this that I cannot stop thinking about because it's so *weird*, and I feel like I must either be missing something or the people making this are really as out of touch as I think they are. \n\nBasically, one of the plot points throughout the movie is that Mark Wahlberg's character owes a ton of money, which at the end Kevin Hart agrees to pay him for, but then it's revealed that Seal (who had shown up at the birthday party) didn't actually just appear as a favor, he did so because Mark Wahlberg paid him $12.5K or something to appear at the party.\n\nThis isn't really played as overtly farcical, and the rest of the movie is very much about establishing Kevin hart as \"just a regular suburban dad\". If this was a satire about out-of-touch Hollywood elitists, it would make FAR more sense for this to be a plot point rather than being in the same movie where another plot point is having to replace a minivan. \n\nI can't help but feel like the bubble of Hollywood has gotten so thick that the people creating these types of totally soulless Netflix originals genuinely think that paying a musician 12.5 grand for a birthday appearance is just as relatable to people as Clark Griswold getting the new family pool. I know I'm overanalyzing a movie that was literally just made to farm watch-minutes and it isn't that deep, but this in particular was one of the most baffling things I've seen in any movie in a long time.

How it takes people out of it and there needs to be some explanation why an actor is different. Or some meta-reference (i.e., \"I'm here, deal with it\" from Iron Man 2).\n\nI feel like people these days are less willing to suspend their disbelief. Or think they aren't able to. They want their work of fiction to be 100% canon-perfect or they are being pulled out of it.\n\nWith the Penguin recently, I never questioned the younger actor playing Francis Cob. There was never a disconnect between Emily Meade and Deirdre O'Connell. All it takes is just two good actors, good costuming, and good makeup for me to believe that they were the same character.I tend to find it more distracting when the de-aging hits that uncanny valley. \n\nWhat is your stance on this topic?\n",

Instead of just carbon copies of identical opinions, they are each their own person who enjoys the company of the other, and it makes it so much more realistic than normal movie friendships, which barely even let you see *why* they\u2019re friends, let alone seeing how strong the friendship is by showing disagreements between them. It\u2019s yet another one of the things that make it such a perfect movie, and I really wish movies would explore it more.",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\neveryday since more than a month I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. While the search for the best movie set in Ireland probably has been the most fruitful so far, since then, things have become a little more difficult. So far, this week has been particularly tough here and this trend continued yesterday with Moldova. Nevertheless, I am sure that with ***Carbon*** we have found a worthy entry for [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).\n\nI'm following an alphabetical order here (before anyone asks: England is still to come, just wait and see) and we're sticking with the letter M for a bit, because today it's all about **Monaco**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein -Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

The way he loses color as he progressively bleeds out has always had me wonder how they did it as the film is done as one tracking shot.",
