        "content": "Usually, winning an Oscar is seen as a huge boost for ones career and that actor/director/whatever tends to have an easier time finding good movies to work on. However, presumably if someone continues to have box office fail after box office fail afterwards, they would start to lose that success and slowly stop appearing in big movies. Who are some people like this? It doesn't have to be an actor or actress, it can be a writer, cinematographer, etc. I'm curious on what the outlier cases look like.",

        "title": "I genuinely believe short IMAX release windows are a large contributor to cinema's decline",
        "content": "I almost missed out on Sinners in 70mm, so if this post comes off as a little petty, I admittedly am.\n\nI work in film myself, I love and live for the artform. Unfortunately, my unpredictable work schedule means I actually miss out on watching some good movies in theatres. My girlfriend and I have to coordinate our work schedules, and sometimes we're able to go on the third week. We both only got to see Sinners on the week of its return engagement in 70mm because IMAX agreed to it.\n\nLately, IMAX has been screening a lot of new releases for only a week or two, and rereleases for maybe 1-3 days. Michael B Jordan himself complained about the small 3 day window which he couldn't attend the screening of the 4K Princess Mononoke restoration. This is occuring quite often because IMAX has been adamant about signing contracts for as many films and experiences as possible. Sinners was not only kicked out of theatres to make way for Thunderbolts*, but also to make way for Fortnite Championship Series (which I can't understand how the audience would benefit from the extra pixels compared to a standard screen). Interstellar's infamously limited rerelease had advance tickets offered on eBay for hundreds.\n\nFurthermore, tickets are so hard to buy for the first week and sometimes even the second week. IMAX has unintentionally curated a toxic collecting culture around collecting different film strips every week (the artificial scarcity of those same strips selling for hundreds online). It has contributed to a toxic rewatch culture that takes away seats from potential first-time viewers. And IMAX only has so many screens available, which makes rewatch culture even more unfair when a second viewing could be on a standard screen instead.\n\nIMAX's greed is why a lot of cinemagoers who usually show up the second or third week have become jaded with movie theatres and just wait for the home release. Who can blame them when they're being marketed the best cinema experience only to be blocked out of attending because it's so hard to find good tickets for the entire IMAX run? IMAX has close to a monopoly on Premium Large Format where I live here in Canada (if they don't have one already). Again, I love cinema, but this is the reason I'm falling out of love with watching films in a theatre.\n\nWhat can IMAX do to fix this? Sign less contracts, IMAX should only screen 11 or 12 new releases each year, in 3-4 week runs. The extra weeks left over can be filled with rereleases that stay for 1-2 weeks. Make only one type of film strip  so that viewers aren't coming back to collect them all, and increase the supply so that everyone who wants to get one can get one.\n\nWhere will the other films go if they can't screen in IMAX? They can go to competing Premium Large Formats or standard screens (romcoms aren't made for IMAX, to be quite fair). There aren't enough IMAX screens to properly meet demand for the biggest films out there, so some films have to be pushed out to make way for longer engagements for other films.\n\nIf IMAX cannot change their ways and allow their screenings to stay an extra week or two so they can be more accessible, I think it's time to bet on another horse in the race. Maybe Dolby Cinema once they can open up enough screens worldwide. But preferably a format that can keep a film in theatres for roughly a month, as it used to be back in the old days. I'm speaking as someone who didn't have to worry about choosing between Spider-Man 2 or Shrek 2, because I could see them both in theatres on different days.",

        "content": "I'm still going through the Star Trek movies, now I've finished the third one. Everbody told me this one isn't that good, you guys lied. This one was good too. But honestly the highlight for me was Commander Kruge played by Christopher Lloyd. He's playing a crazy, bloodthirsty Klingon commander. And he's playing it so fucking large and terrifying that it makes me wonder how the Federation ends up having a treaty with Klingons in later Star Treks, cause these guys hate eachother.\n\n\nI think people know Lloyd can play a scary villain because of his Performance as Judge Doom in Roger Rabbit. But I felt way more evil radiating from Kruge as the megalomaniac commander.\n\n\nEnough gushing about Lloyd, I thought this movie was adorable. They really spend a long time &gt;!mourning the loss of Spock, the initial intro monoluge by Kirk about the Enterprise feeling like an empty home where the children have moved on was so sweet!&lt; I kinda love how the first 30 minutes are just spent adjusting to that grief.\n\n\n\nAnd the ending is also quite emotional. I wish I had a best friend like Spock. Fucking friendship goals.\n\n\nJust a side observation but Spock's dad, Sarek reminds me of a Minecraft villager for some reason.\n\n\n\nThe only downside to this movie would be sequences with David and Savvik on Genesis if I had to point out a flaw. It just didn't really feel that emotionally connected to the rest of the story. It just felt like they had to resolve the revelation from the prior movie that &gt;!Kirk had a secret son!&lt;.\n\n\nP.s.: I'm watching the Space Seed episode of the TOS since you guys recommended it so hard.",

Here is how they did it.\n\n\t\u2022\tCarbon footprint calculation: The production team first measured the estimated carbon emissions the film would generate (including transportation, energy use, construction, etc.).\n\tTree Planting Initiatives: Director Tom Shadyac required crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge in California.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tRecycling and Sustainable Practices: The production emphasized recycling, provided bicycles for crew members to reduce vehicle use, and used double-sided scripts to minimize paper waste.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSet Material Donations: the ark in the movie was a real fully built ark! When production was over the are was deconstructed and materials from the ark set were donated to Habitat for Humanity instead of being discarded. \n\t\u2022\tUse of hybrid vehicles: The production used hybrid cars for transportation during filming to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n\t\u2022\tEco-friendly power: Efforts were made to reduce on-set energy use, including turning off equipment when not in use and optimizing energy efficiency.\n\t\u2022\tRecycling and waste reduction: On set, recycling programs and waste reduction initiatives were implemented, including composting and limiting single-use plastics.\n\nAll in all, I feel like these practices could be adopted more often. Thought it was a really cool story and wanted to share!\n",

        "content": "I have watched this movie at least 2 dozen times in full and countless times through rewatching my favorite clips. I can quote this movie in my sleep.\n\nOn this rewatch, I noticed something.\n\nWhenever he's in control, or in a dominant or comfortable position, or victory, he is framed in the left looking towards the right.\n\nWhenever he's in danger, or undertaking a difficult task, or generally uncomfortable, or defeat, he's framed in the right looking to the left.\n\nHe's positioned in the centre when he's in a state of ambivalence, being not quite sure where he'd be, what he'd do.\n\nBe it the beginning of the movie where he's reading his bike, or him leading into the desert, with his guide Tafas. Or him admonishing Sherif Ali for killing his guide, him reaching Faisal's camp, talking to the prince privately, formulating the attack on Aqaba, crossing the nefud desert, rescuing Gasim, attacking Aqaba, walking with Allenby after convincing him to take Jerusalem, bombing the Turkish railways, agreeing to take Damascus, riding with his men towards Damascus, sitting in the aftermath of a brutal battle with a turkish brigade. In all these situations, he's framed in the left looking rightwards.\n\nWhenever he's expressing displeasure or vulnerability, or conceding defeat, like being unhappy in the cartography room, being commanded to do something by his superiors, trying to convince Colonel Brighton and Prince Faisal to fight the right way, and later on trying to defend himself and convince Allenby to continue blowing up the Turkish strongholds, talking about how he was born out of wedlock riding into the anvil to save Gasim, later executing Gasim, leaving Aqaba to ride into Sinai, trying in vain to save Farraj from quicksand, trying to pass off as Arab when getting caught, suffering torture from the Turks, getting shot at by that turkish soldier. Him getting smacked by the british officer in the military hospital in Damascus and him finally leaving Arabia. In all those instances, he's framed in the right looking leftward.\n\nWhenever he's in center, like him deciding to put Daud out of his misery, him talking about how he enjoyed the execution, him weighing the options between a job back home or go back to the Arabs, him pausing  before joining in the slaughter of the Turkish brigade.\n\nI wonder if it's a cheeky in joke about Peter O'Toole being left handed.\n\nOr a psychological trick, being that the Earth spins from west to east, a direction we associate with left to right. Him going towards the left from the right is him essentially going against what is written according to him.\n\nOr a deeper commentary about how Lawrence is powerful when he embraces the contradictions of an Englishman going 'native', buying into his own hype, deciding for himself. He's weakened when he has to defend himself, his authority is questioned, he denies the contradiction and he starts to doubt himself.\n\n\n\nAll I know is, this film never ceases to amaze me\n\n",

It\u2019s such a dark, bleak film, but so beautiful at the same time. The whole idea of how war just destroys innocence and the group of friends just gets completely destroyed is heartbreaking. I also love the metaphor in how they think war will be vs how it actually is. They think war will be like deer hunting (a meticulous and precise skill) but in reality, war is just like Russian roulette (a random game of chance) it\u2019s an absolutely brilliant film and De Niro is fucking fantastic in it!",

Wonderful angles and lighting, it absolutely sold me on the movie being 5 stars. Also the opening scene in Gone Girl, very good decisions made there. Also can't post this without mentioning the aspect ratio changing during Catching Fire when Katniss enters the arena. Gives me chills still. ",
