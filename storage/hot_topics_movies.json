I have no problem in saying this. She just so happened to not have had the best material but even so, she was headed to movie stardom in the early 80s but her mental health prevented her from going further. She went back to TV, did EMPTY NEST for 5 years and then quit the business. \n\nI wish more movie buffs knew about Kristy McNichol. She was that good.",

        "content": "It\u2019s so much dumb fun! It\u2019s ridiculous and over-the-top but in absolutely the best way. To me it\u2019s the pinnacle of the dumb 2000s action movie, with all the ridiculous tropes, style and zany performance that one could ask for.\n\nJames McAvoy is so much fun in this movie - the way he throws himself into the role, and constantly looks like he is about to have some sort of breakdown is absolutely hilarious. You also got Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and Chris Pratt, which is just a killer combination.\n\nThe story is for the most part laughable, but honestly I think the movie is aware of it. And there is a still a little bit of heart there, in the sense that it is about a person struggling with anxiety attacks and depression, who manages to escape his crushing life and actualise himself. For what it is, it\u2019s actually nicely done and McAvoy really sells it.",
