Seth Brundle, a good man by all accounts, finalized his life's work. An invention that will change the world. He also meets the love of his life at the same time. \n\nHe seemed to be peaking in all facets of life, but he ruined everything by carelessly putting himself through the telepods and turning himself into a monster. \n\nA good person, reaching the apex of life only for everything to end so tragically (for everyone involved).\n\nI cry almost everytime I really think about what happened to Seth in that movie.

        "content": "When I think of movies from the 1970's, the first thing that pops into my head is that brown, film grained, dirty look that everything had, especially films like Rocky, The Jerk, and Taxi Driver. That sleazy, 1970's look of adult theatres, liquor stores, litter, exhaust fumes, and LOTS of brown/wood everything. Ironically enough, the movie that I think encapsulates that specific style the best is a film that almost wasn't even released during the 1970's at all.\n\nBlues Brothers is a pretty obvious parody/homage of a lot of the tropes that went on with a lot of 1970's action films, specifically the over-the top car chases, and it got me wondering if that also carried over into the visual style of the movie as well? There's so many shots in this movie that nail the look that if someone asked me \"what do movies from the 1970's look like?\" I could just show them stills from Blues Brothers and they'd understand what I meant immediately, like when Elwood is parking the Bluesmobile at Jake's in that dirty alley with that red light. Such a cool shot. But it got me wondering if it was done on purpose to pay homage to the style (and take it over the top) like how someone like Tarantino would do years later, or if it was just a product of its' time?",

        "content": "Preface- I\u2019ve spent over twenty years {early teens to thirties) in addiction, had two years clean here and there, and then recently went on a year long run, finally getting clean and my life back. Once home I decided to watch my two favorite drug movies over the past couple days I.e Drugstore Cowboy and Trainspotting.  \n\ni feel like these two movies are the best representation of drug abuse (other than Requiem which I believe is in a different realm).\n\nDrugstore Cowboy is an amazing film. The protagonist Bob is smart beyond all means, probably too smart for his own good, and he holds himself together extremely well. Him nor his body looks like hes a junkie because he holds himself together, and strictly uses synthetic pharmaceutical heroin. At the end, in the ambulance, he realizes sobriety isn\u2019t right for him and while he\u2019s going into the ambulance he seems excited to go to back to the biggest pharmacy in the world, and he knows that going to take him back out to the life he loves. After meeting Burroughs he realizes he can do this into his old age, and I believe those factors made up his mind. he felt his debt to the hat has been paid, and after the hospital I believe it\u2019s implied he\u2019s going back out. \n\n\n\nTrainspotting is also an e film, but I feel it\u2019s a more accurate description of an addict. it\u2019s a difficult watch. Mark doesn\u2019t want what other people want, you can see that in his beginning monologue, but Mark is stuck. He goes through the fazes of being trapped in addiction but wanting to get clean periodically. He tries, but when the sickness comes so does his desperation (digging through the dirtiest bathroom toilet after he had withdrawal shits to get his suppository dope out of the toilet), boarding his door shut while withdrawing, etc. It was always one last hit with Mark, but in addiction, especially heroin, there is no one last hit. You can feel his struggle, his pain, his convictions, and his ambivalence. It\u2019s a deeper film that portrays Exactly what addiction is. Almost to spot on.\n\nWhile Drugstore Cowboy is a phenomenal film, I feel it\u2019s a more phantasy portrayal of drug addiction which does hit on the downfalls throughout.\n\nTrainspotting is a gritty film, and nails down heroin addiction to a tee. The ups, the downs, the struggles, and the desperation. So in my personal opinion, I think Trainspotting is a better film. \n\nbut I\u2019d like to know what other people think, people who have been through it or haven\u2019t.   \nlet\u2019s discuss.",

        "content": "I just re-watched small soldiers for the first time in probably 25 years and the first thing I wanna say is how great it still looks. Occasionally, the CGI is a bit wonky, but they use so much practical effects that it really sells . \n\nIf they did do a reboot or a legacy sequel, my guess is the first way they would screw it up is by abandoning the practical effects.\n\nthe premise was also avery ahead of its time and our current AI and machine learning world actually works really well with it. \n\nI know the idea of rebooting old media never letting anything die is a very real criticism, and a lot of us are getting kind of exhausted by it\u2026 but I feel with this movie it kind of works because it\u2019s not a beloved classic that holds a lot of importance\u2026 it\u2019s a barely considered cult, classic that got mediocre reviews, and is mostly forgotten by the general public. I think these types of movies are the best ones to revisit since it\u2019s not really going to tarnish any kind of legacy.\n\n \n\nRegardless of all of this, if you hadn\u2019t seen this movie in a while, I suggest giving it a rewatch. I think it holds up really well.\n\nDid anyone else really enjoy this as a kid for those of you who are adults in 1998? What were your opinions on it?  It definitely feels a bit torn like it wants to be for teens and kids and doesn\u2019t quite know where to land.",

I hadn\u2019t been keeping up with new releases for a while, so I decided to give it a chance\u2026 and it turned out to be completely different!\n\nThunderbolts felt very refreshing.\n\nI loved the use of camera work and that combination of shots where memories are revisited, it really reminded me of Inception. I thought it was an incredible movie. I\u2019ve always been a fan of Marvel movies, and watching this one felt nostalgic in a way, because even without the original superheroes, it managed to give a different tone to what Marvel has been presenting over the last few years.",
