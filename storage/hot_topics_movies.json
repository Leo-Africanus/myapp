He\u2019ll also appear in the horror film MCCURDY POINT, which he produced and starred in alongside fellow Groundling and other great bud, Ryan Gaul. Kiel earned an Emmy nomination for his work on ROBOT CHICKEN, where he also became an expert at picking up Hot Wheels that he launched off ramps. (It\u2019s a thing at Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.) His other credits include SUPERSTORE, NOBODIES, LAZY SUSAN, THE MISADVENTURES OF VINCE AND HICK and THE BINGE 2.\n\n**Kenneth Mosley** is an actor, singer, writer, producer, and host.

In addition to writing and directing DON\u2019T TELL LARRY, Porper served as the film\u2019s lead producer, strategically crafting, pitching, and executing the film's business plan, securing all of the financing from over three dozen investors, and managing daily operations overseeing a team of more than 100 people throughout the film's lifecycle. Working as a development executive and freelance producer for over ten years, Porper has also developed and produced shows for Netflix, Fox, ESPN, MTV, truTV, Viceland, Discovery+, and more.

I debated between this, the shotgun shovel scene, and the scene where the sheriffs hat keeps getting bigger lol. This is definitely one of the best comedies of the early 2000s and imo, the last good scary movie in the franchise. Everything after just didn\u2019t have the same magic as the first 3, and especially this one. There are tons of  hilarious moments in this film it\u2019s hard to pick just one. Which other scenes from this movie stand out to you? ",

Honestly I don\u2019t think it paints the south gloriously - it paints them as hubristic machismos who destroy themselves, and the story is about a woman living through the collapse of everything she knows and how she builds herself back up. Also Scarlett is not a person I like - what you\u2019re supposed to respect is her gumption.",
