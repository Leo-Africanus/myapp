        "title": "Erin Brokovich is a great movie, but Erin herself is kind of awful",
        "content": "I\u2019m not commenting on the \\*real\\* Erin Brokovich, but on the character in the film.\n\nObviously, the character cares deeply about the evils being perpetrated by PG&amp;E and she wants justice for those affected. That\u2019s an admirable trait and it makes her easy to root for, because of course we want her to succeed and we want this major corporation to be held accountable.\n\nBut throughout the entire movie, Erin is awful to just about everyone else in her life except the plaintiffs.\n\n\u2022 She shows no appreciation toward the lady next door who had apparently been taking care of her kids for free.\n\n\u2022 She blames Ed Masry for losing her car accident case despite the fact that she\u2019s the one who blew up in court, and then she basically guilts/bullies him into giving her a job. Even after he does so (which he\u2019s under no obligation to do) and even gives her an advance on her paycheck on what seems like her first day, she continues to insult, disrespect, and degrade him throughout the entire film.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to all of her coworkers. Granted, some of them are very mean to her as well, but frankly I don\u2019t blame them. She makes fun of their weight, yells at them, and calls them bitches to their faces.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to George, who she basically treats as a free live-in nanny. When he confronts her about the way she treats him, she doesn\u2019t apologize or even acknowledge that she\u2019s done anything wrong. She also seemingly doesn\u2019t give a second thought to how her kids feel, since they spend most of their time with George at that point and would obviously be devastated by him leaving.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to the other legal team that Masry brings in to assist with the case, despite the fact that they\u2019re just doing their jobs and even bankrolled the whole thing. Theresa is definitely condescending toward her, but it\u2019s not in an intentional way. Erin never shows them even the slightest modicum of respect and acts from the beginning like they\u2019re incompetent and don\u2019t care about the plaintiffs.\n\nDoes this aspect of the movie bother anyone else? I kind of expected there to be a scene at some point where Erin apologized to\u2026 well, anyone. But in the film, she\u2019s always treated like she\u2019s in the right and like her behavior toward everyone is justified because of how much she cares about the case. I find this to be a really off-putting element in an otherwise great film.",

        "content": "For starters, Animal Logic's animation alone is simply brilliant and takes direct inspiration from the early \"brick films\" you'd see on YouTube merged with the trippy insanity of The Matrix. The stereoscopic 3D does wonders for it.\n\nSecondly, Phil Lord and Chris Miller's script/ direction strikes that perfect balance between chaos, silliness, biting commentary and human pathos; the kind of stuff that directly mocks the Hollywood system while still honoring it in its own strange way. Some of the themes feel especially (and unfortunately) relevant in 2026.\n\nAnd as overexposed/controversial as he is today, Chris Pratt puts in a wonderful performance as Emmet, the everyman who doesn't really know how to do anything but also has the biggest heart in the world. Heck, pretty much everyone in the cast puts in a great performance, even the ones doing a brief cameo.\n\nWhat a film man\u2026",

I buy that. But I realized the Groundhog Day myth itself lines up almost too perfectly:\n\nThe groundhog \u201cseeing its shadow\u201d is literally seeing itself \u2014 and when that happens, winter continues. Spring only comes when it doesn\u2019t see itself.\n\nThat feels like exactly Phil\u2019s problem. As long as he only sees Phil \u2014 his ego, his desires, his boredom, even his despair \u2014 the loop keeps going. Time only moves forward when he stops being self-referential and actually looks outward.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just \u201cbe nice and you\u2019re free,\u201d but \u201cstop seeing yourself as the center of meaning.\u201d The holiday myth ends up mirroring the character arc.\n\nCurious if anyone\u2019s seen this connection made explicitly before, or if I\u2019m just late to the party.",

The premise is typical YA nonsense, but by YA standards, this was entertaining enough.\n\nThe 1st film was just \"meh\". The 2nd Scotch Trials is a zombie movie.\n\nThe 3rd film The Death Cure really stands out in non-stop action during the its half. Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario give strong performances as well. Good old Barry Pepper and Rosa Salazar show up in the 2nd and 3rd films.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't too bad.",

        "content": "Think about it. There are movies that rush too fast past the character development or world building and just try to cram as much plot in an allotted run time. Or there are just movies that drag on where nothing seems to happen.\n\nBetween acts, they can be uneven. It can start as a slow burn until in gets interesting later on. Or start out high and energetic but anti climatic in the end.\n\nIf I have to define a movie that is perfectly paced, it has these bullet points.\n\n\\- A clear beginning, middle and end.\n\n\\- None of the dialogue feels rushed as everything feels open spaced.\n\n\\- You are getting the plot beats and character development down well.\n\n\\- Most of all, you have slow scenes that allows the audience and characters to take a breather/moment.\n\n\\- The choice of shots and average shot length.\n\n\\- Every moment feels earned and awarded.\n\nAnything from the Golden Age classics like Citizen Kane or Casablanca, or even any modern day classic within the last 50 years. What are some of your favorites films that are perfectly paced?",

        "content": "I\u2019m talkin\u2019 \u2019bout the little moment before the movie even begins. The MGM lion, the Paramount mountain, the old Orion constellation, the grainy Cannon globe, even the scratchy early New Line logo.\n\nSome of them immediately set a mood, not just because of the name, but the design itself. The  Orion logo always felt mysterious and slightly melancholy to me. The TriStar Pegasus had that late-80s prestige vibe. The color palette, the music, even how long the logo lingers can quietly tell you what kind of movie you\u2019re about to watch.\n\nAnd when a director tweaks the logo or vanity card to match the film, it feels like a quiet promise that you\u2019re in good hands.\n\nAs for indie cards, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a below-average A24 or Focus Features production. Their logos are so clean and intentional that even when I see the card before a trailer, I know it\u2019s gonna be top notch. On the other hand, when I\u2019d see the Cannon/ Golan-Globus card back in the day, I knew it was gonna be a cheesy, low-budget B-effort( sometimes solidly entertaining though).\n\nWhich other logos do people love or instantly associate with great movies? Also interested in any that give you a weird sense of dread or excitement before the first scene even starts.",

        "content": "Convinced of his irresistible appeal to women, Texas dishwasher Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job and heads for New York City, thinking he'll latch on to some rich dowager. New York, however, is not as hospitable as he imagined, and Joe soon finds himself living in an abandoned building with a Dickensian layabout named Enrico Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). The two form a rough alliance, and together they kick-start Joe's hustling career just as Ratso's health begins to deteriorate. While I enjoyed the film and think it\u2019s good I find it a little overrated. Great performances from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman they have kind of a love/hate friendship from time to time but the writing for these two characters are great. The film also has it\u2019s weird moments as well. The film was controversial at the time and was given a X rating when it came out due to its depiction of sex work, prostitution, and explicit homosexuality. The film is also well shot and it also was the first X rated film to win Best Picture at the Oscars, it also won for Best Director for John Schlesinger. The film is worth checking out.",
