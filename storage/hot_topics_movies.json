        "content": "Is the implication that Woody's character has molested his daughters? The film seems to drop oblique hints, but does not address it directly:\n\n- In the opening scene, he has an uncomfortable conversation with the lady cop asking if her daddy ever \"disciplined\" her.\n\n- He has a very weird family dynamic where he has fathered each daughter by two sisters, and they all live together. The younger daughter is even a bit confused by this and ask if she's the product of incest.\n\n- The older daughter despises him and becomes very upset whenever he touches her.\n\n- There's a scene where he invites the younger daughter to watch TV with him instead of doing homework, and says \"we won't yell mom.\" He sits on the couch with his arm around her, and the camera lingers on him as he looks at her.\n\n- In the scene where the daughters visit him in the hotel room, he says \"I've never hurt you\" and the you ger daughter becomes upset to the point where she can't even speak and the older daughter rushes her out.\n\nIs this what the film was implying?",

Everything depicted in terms of a job in this film has happened to me, the traffic in the morning, the annoying co workers, the passive aggressive boss who you can clearly tell is trying to be sarcastic and piss you off, the annoying soul sucking phrases (\u201csounds like a case of the Monday\u2019s\u201d) and if you screw up, you have 3 different people telling you the same shit within the span of 10 minutes and you have to just suck it up and take it, unfortunately as long as these jobs exist, this film will remain timeless. The second half of this film is just as great at the first because it shows all the things that YOU WANT to do but can\u2019t because you\u2019ll get fired, Mike Judge really nailed the realism of jobs, and it\u2019s one of my all time favorite comedies, however it can also be called a documentary\ud83d\ude02",

        "content": "It would be easy to assume that *The Day the Earth Blew Up* is the movie Warner Bros. chose to support while *Coyote vs. Acme* was the one they tossed aside. That narrative would almost make sense\u2014one was buried for a tax write-off, and the other actually made it to theaters. But that\u2019s not the real story.\n\n[It\u2019s not an either-or situation, it\u2019s a \u2018WB screwed over both, but one got out situation.](https://preview.redd.it/ulcjmuo6zroe1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674172cb353bf0ae70941c17a6762cf12424eb6b)\n\nThe truth is, WB abandoned **both** movies. They didn\u2019t choose The Day the Earth Blew Up over Coyote vs. Acme\u2014they just happened to **sell this one off to Ketchup Entertainment like a piece of scrap they had no use for.** If Ketchup hadn\u2019t stepped in to save it, WB wouldn\u2019t have cared whether it ever saw the light of day. This isn\u2019t a case of Warner Bros. picking one Looney Tunes project over another. It\u2019s a case of an independent distributor **giving a damn when WB didn\u2019t**.\n\nYou can still be angry about what happened to *Coyote vs. Acme*. You can still hate that WB is gutting its animation division and treating finished films like tax loopholes. But here\u2019s what makes *The Day the Earth Blew Up* different: **it got out.** And because it got out, we have a rare chance to show WB that selling off Looney Tunes was a mistake.\n\n**Warner Bros. doesn\u2019t make a single dime from this movie\u2014they sold it off and walked away.**\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another nostalgia cash-in. It\u2019s a full-length, **hand-drawn, theatrical Looney Tunes feature**, something we haven\u2019t seen in decades. And on top of that, it\u2019s weird in the best way\u2014a mix of slapstick, sci-fi horror, and classic comedy, with Daffy and Porky thrown into a surreal alien invasion. Critics are loving it, and audiences who\u2019ve actually seen it are too. But because WB threw it away, **Ketchup doesn\u2019t have a marketing budget to let people know what it even is.** If you haven\u2019t heard much about it, that\u2019s not the movie\u2019s fault\u2014that\u2019s just the reality of being saved at the last minute by a distributor that doesn\u2019t have billions to spend on ads.\n\n**Because this movie didn\u2019t get the massive marketing push of a major studio release, strong word of mouth is the only way it can reach the audience that would truly appreciate it.**\n\nSupporting this movie doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re \u201cpicking\u201d it over *Coyote vs. Acme*. It just means you\u2019re giving a discarded Looney Tunes movie a chance to prove that WB was wrong to sell it off in the first place. Theaters are where we get to make that statement. Streaming will come later, and people will eventually discover it there\u2014but if this movie succeeds in theaters, it sends a clear message that Looney Tunes *still belongs on the big screen*.\n\nIf you were looking for the fastest way to tell David Zaslav to go screw himself, this is it.\n\n",

We've all complained about Hollywood's over-reliance on adaptations, remakes, and sequels instead of original ideas, but all of us have at some point gone to see a movie solely because it was part of an IP we liked. So with that in mind, what are some movie franchises that have been dormant for a while that you'd actually be excited to go see if they got a new installment?\n\nI'd personally like a new National Treasure movie with Nicolas Cage (I know there was a TV show, I didn't like it).

        "title": "The Devil Wears Prada: Andy's Boyfriend and Friends Still Suck. (Except Emily, I love Emily)",
        "content": "I decided to re-watch the movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\" as I was bored, and needed something to do. I watched it with my fianc\u00e9, kind of. (He was playing a videogame while occasionally listening in).\n\nSo, going into the movie again, I thought 'Maybe, just maybe Andy's friends and boyfriend aren't as bad as I remember.\" I thought this was a possibility as the last time I watched the movie was when I was like, 13. So I thought maybe some of the details my teenage girl brain jumbled up, but nope. They were still bad.\n\nI mean, first of all... they do originally come off as somewhat supportive. But then Andy begins putting a bit too much time in at work. And then, she slowly begins changing. Changing her clothes, wearing makeup, and seemingly just taking care of herself. (I mean, her hair looks healthier and well-taken care of after she begins changing.)\n\nSo, to me, it's obvious that she likes, and actively enjoys her job. It may be high stress, and high pressure, but she quite obviously enjoys it.\n\nSo the first time I got the ick was when they somewhat blasted her for working at a fashion magazine. Like, so what? I'm pretty sure he works as a line-cook, and their hours and work is TERRIBLE. (I know, I was one.) So I don't really understand why he's letting their friends blast her for being at the bottom of the chain. (Yeah, I know, he gets a job as a sous chef at the end of the movie, so what?)\n\nThen, when Andy begins excelling at her job, she brings them expensive gifts that Miranda discarded. (A $1100 telephone, products (I'm assuming expensive shampoos, or conditioners), and most importantly, a designer bag that she offers to her friend, Lily. (Isn't it funny how Anne Hathaway keeps playing characters with shitty friends named Lily? xD) Lily then informs Andy that she 'couldn't possibly' take the bag, WHILE SHOVELLING HER SHIT INTO THE BAG. Then, directly after that, Miranda begins calling her... and like the WONDERFUL friends they are, they proceed to play Monkey In the Middle with her phone. RIGHT AFTER SHE GAVE THEM EXPENSIVE GIFTS. (Honestly, Andy should've sold the gifts to pay rent, or put into savings, because considering Andy's father wrote her a check to do so, I doubt Nate is bringing in the big bucks.)\n\nThen, Andy is tasked with accompanying Miranda and Emily to a party. And ends up missing Nate's birthday party because of this. I get it, I understand being upset, but he proceeds to act like a child who's father didn't come back with the milk. He sulks the whole night, undoubtably expecting Andy to try to apologize to him/make it up to him. And then proceeds to seem angrier when she doesn't. SHE DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING BUT HER JOB. (Throughout this scene, my fianc\u00e9 kept rolling his eyes at Nate. xD) \n\nFinally, I understand why Lily got upset when she saw Christian kiss Andy's cheek, but come on. A simple conversation would've cleared up any misunderstandings. She acts as if she's upset that Andy was with another guy, and said guy kissed her, but when Nate does come around, she doesn't even tell him about it! So it's clear she didn't give a hoot about him, so why was she so upset? (Oh, because she's jealous).\n\nI don't even want to explain how HORRIBLE I think the ending is. (I already know about the book ending, it's even worse.) But Andy ends up quitting, and I could understand that IF she didn't apologize to her awful boyfriend. (I mean, I didn't really like Christian that much, but at least he seemed supportive of her job, y'know... until he was trying to replace Miranda.) I mean, Nate was an awful, annoying, needy, and unsupportive boyfriend throughout the entire movie. That is MONTHS of it. (My fianc\u00e9 was in total shock and this, and was legitimately angry at the ending. Which, I did find hilarious.) \n\nI just personally believe Andy should've kept working for Miranda, I'm pretty sure she worked only a few months, and was excelling even more than Emily did. (I genuinely felt bad for Emily in this movie though, especially when she got hit by the car.)\n\nOverall, I think Andy is just lucky Miranda was so fond of her. Because she was, and I don't know why everyone glosses over that fact. I mean, Miranda had every right to give Andy a bad review. (She works hard, is adaptive, but quit suddenly during a work event. She's unreliable.) Despite this, she doesn't, and in turn helps Andy get her dream job. (Or, at least the start of her dream job.)",

The film has a certain level of camp from Meg Ryan playing 3 different characters to Joe having to throw himself into a volcano to appease the gods of islanders who love orange soda.\n\nStart to finish one of my favorite films, insanely infectious dialogue, goofy playful absurdity, a very defined aesthetic. I can't even begin to truly express how much this movie means to me.\n\nNot looking for straight romance movies, Joe Versus The Volcano isn't really your typical romance. It's more of a fantasy adventure with romance on the side imo.\n\n\"This is one of those typical conversations where we're all open and sharing our innermost thoughts and it's all bullshit and a lie and it doesn't cost\u00a0*you*\u00a0anything!\"",
