It\u2019s one of the few movies where I genuinely needed a moment of silence after the credits rolled.

But that\u2019s what makes it stand out. Love it or hate it, you have to admit it takes guts to go there.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those films that sticks with you, whether you want it to or not.",

The gritty realism and bleach bypass filter beautifully gives the sharp, cool angles that are consistently present in the glittery landscape a grounded, but dreamlike quality that does not feel its age in the slightest.\n\nSure, a lot of the CGI doesn't hold up - but a lot of it does, since so much of the film is practical in terms of sets and stunts.\n\nIt's very hard to believe this film is more than two decades old.\n\nBut it's the futuristic minimalism that still gets me until this day. A lot of credit was given to the film's plausible depiction of the future even back then. But today, it feels even more inevitable (outside the Precog stuff, of course). It almost feels like people were underselling it.\n\nOr maybe I'm overselling it.\n\nWith the strangulating rise of techo-corporate oligarchy; does anyone really believe that with modern advancements in algorithms, data analytics, and neural networks that we won't be getting personalized ads in walkable spaces and biometric surveillance?\n\nDespite the snags; AI automobiles aren't sci-fi anymore. Display tech is getting cheaper to produce, but is currently being hamstrung by supply chain issues and demand  - still, I can easily see animated cereal boxes in my lifetime.\n\nGod, this film is brilliant.",

        "content": "The 1988 classic die hard features a wide array of 13 (13 not 12, 13) villains for Bruce Willis to take out but how do they rank aganist each other\n\n13 - Heinrich - he is incharge of - spoiler - putting the C4 on the top of the building and is killed in a fairly boring way by McClane, plus he has no screentime so, here he goes\n\n12 - Alexander - he is the ordinarg looking missle guy who blew up the SWAT RV.\n\n11 - Kristof - does absolutley nothing but he does get the honour of being spared by McClane and being one of two terrorists to survive the night. He is Theo's assistant\n\n10 - Fritiz is Karls long-haired bodygaurd. He appears a bit throughout the movie and is killed when McClane fires wildly into the lift. \n\n9 - Tony - Karls brother places low because the action scene he dies in is the worst in the movie\n\n8 - James - he is the strong missle guy, he is Alexanders assistant, he along with Alexander are killed when McClane blow them up.\n\n7. Franco - getting shot in the kneecaps and landing on glass got him here\n\n6. Uli - he is the person who loves chocolate so much he eats some when preparing for a shootout.\n\n5. Marco - \"next time you have the chance to kill someone, don't hessitate\" shoots him \"thanks for the advice.\" This is one of my favourite action scene in the movie and the franchise. such a fun sequence from the shoot out to the police car escaping the gunfire from the other terrorists. Very cool, very fun. Not sure who shot at the car so i am mentioning it here.\n\n4. Eddie - all right, its just the main 4 left (A.K.A the ones with any plot relevance) so we know the ranking but lets continue anyway. Eddie is pretending to be the secetary for the first half of the movie, hangs around by the vault for the second and has a laugh off with Hans and McClane before he is shot in the head. His actor does a good job, the slight akwardness with the laugh is good, everything is good... but everything can be even more good.\n\n3. Theo - he is the 2nd terrorist to survive the events that took place in nakatomi plaza on christmas eve 1988. It would of been cool if they acknowleged they're survival. Anyway he is pretty darn great, but he has little screentime and like Hans and Eddie, isn't very physical as he never fights McClane.\n\n2. Karl - finally the proper good stuff. Karl is so fun. The way his only goal is to kill McClane, for killing his brother. I mean they didn't need to add that to the movie but they did and his actor gives a pretty good performance, plus his fight with McClane is cool, double plus the way he could get away but doesn't want McClane to survive is pretty cool too. \n\n1. Hans Gruber - go read an article on why he works as a villain, that exists. In short, he is perfect. Top five villains of all time.\n\n\n",

There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we\u2019re hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",

The animations also leave nothing to be desired. The colours are wonderfully chosen.

I think that could cause some interesting dialogues with kids, right?\n\nRegarding the remake: even with the relatively decent trailer released some time ago, I have problems seeing that work out. The colours. The stilistic choices. The final battle. How are they gonna translate this into a realistic environment?\n\nWe will see. What's left so far is watching the next two movies. ",

        "content": "Seriously, these are the first seven films Reiner directed:\n\n1984: \"This is Spinal Tap\"\n\n1985: \"The Sure Thing\"\n\n1986: \"Stand By Me\n\n1987: \"The Princess Bride\"\n\n1989: \"When Harry Met Sally\"\n\n1990: \"Misery\"\n\n1992: \"A Few Good Men\"\n\nThat is an INSANE streak of excellent films, several of which are classics. The least of them is probably \"The Sure Thing\" and that's a charming, funny 80s teen spin on \"It Happened One Night\" that made John Cusack a leading man. And especially impressive is how diverse they are, ranging from the best music mockumentary ever to one of the greatest coming of age films ever to a gold standard romantic coming of age film to one of the most beloved fantasy/family films of all time. Reiner really seemed like he could do no wrong...\n\n...and then he made \"North\" and that streak ended in a crashing halt that promptly exploded. \"North\" was the kind of disaster made by a director on an insane hot streak who thought he could not miss and thus had a blank check to make his pet project which he clearly thought was going to be a modern \"Wizard of Oz.\" Instead, it became a massive bomb that is now best known for being the subject of one of Siskel and Ebert's greatest reviews. And regrettably, Reiner's never been the same as a director since. (He did rebound with \"The American President\" as his next film, but Aaron Sorkin was much more the driving creative force on that one and his directing career since has been scattershot at best.) But at least he'll always have that awesome directoral decade to look back on with well-deserved pride.",

        "content": "The most fun B movie of 1979. This film put The Ramones on the map. Vince Lombardi High School keeps losing principals to nervous breakdowns because of the students' love of rock 'n' roll and their disregard for education. The leader of the students, Riff Randell (P.J. Soles), is the biggest Ramones fan at the school and also the worst behavioral problem. When the new principal of the school Principal Togar (Mary Woronov) shows her hatred of The Ramones the students start to take over the school. If you are a fan of The Ramones this film is worth checking out. Also aside from The Ramones music the film does have a great soundtrack.",

        "content": "The original Bad Santa is one of my favorite Christmas movies, it just hits that raunchy rated R Christmas movie itch perfectly for me, rewatching it again this year I saw that the sequel they made years ago that I never saw was also available, since I had never seen it and to be completely honest had totally forgotten that it existed I figured I\u2019d finally give it a try and wow I was honestly pleasantly surprised! Of course it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the original but I thought it was cool to see these characters interact again after all these years and I love the addition of Kathy Bates who I thought was hilarious in this one. I still love the interactions between Willie and Thurman although of course it\u2019s not gonna hit quite the same notes as the first time around due to the actor who plays Thurman is much older this time around. I feel that with all the comedy movies that got sequel\u2019s a significant time after the original was released that have fallen flat (Zoolander being the perfect example of this). I found Bad Santa 2 to be quite enjoyable and fun, although I know this opinion might be more in the minority given its ratings and reviews online, it seemed not to do very well, perhaps my expectations were just quite low. What do you guys think of it? ",

        "title": "Ghostbusters: Afterlife...Egon's exile doesn't make sense",
        "content": "Finally got around to watching *Ghostbusters: Afterlife* recently, and one of the main plot points isn't making sense to me: Egon's estrangement and self-imposed exile from the rest of the team. \n\nRay tells Phoebe that Egon called him and told him everything he'd discovered in the mine, but gives no reasons at all why he didn't believe him. Maybe Winston and Venkman had moved on to other things and thought Egon was just trying to relive the glory days, but Ray's the most enthusiastic of all of them about the paranormal. Egon's quirky but we never see him being anything other than levelheaded and methodical. When Egon tells him he discovered a Gozer-worship temple in an old mine Ivo Shandor used to mine the materials for the NYC building (not like it's a secret who owned it, his name's on the thing as well as half the buildings in the town), and *Ivo Shandor himself* is in a sarcophagus there, and it appears it's being used as another attempt to bring Gozer back into our world, why wouldn't Ray at least go have a look? \n\nThe reasoning that he was sore at Egon for taking off abruptly with most of their equipment seems weak. At most that might explain why Ray *initially* hung up on him, but Egon was out in Oklahoma for years. In all that time someone as intensely curious about the paranormal as Ray wouldn't have second thoughts and decide to go out and see if his old friend and long-standing academic and business partner who he know extremely well might be telling the truth? At the very least, since Janine obviously knows exactly where Egon is and is in direct contact with him, Ray couldn't have reached out to her and asked what's going on with him?\n\nI know the 'real' reason is that the plot required it to happen, obviously. I liked the movie quite a lot overall and thought it was a very worthy sequel to the original (I did find it funny they pretended *Ghostbusters 2* never happened). Just seemed like an oddly weak spot in an otherwise good movie. ",

We're looking for something with a positive message or ending, preferably one we haven't seen before.\n\nOur tastes: I'll watch basically any genre, he will occasionally watch romcoms/musicals with me. Some that he has liked: LaLa Land, 500 Days of Summer, To All the Boys I've Loved Before, The Proposal. He did not like 10 Things I Hate About You or You've Got Mail. \ud83d\ude02 I haven't seen many romantic movies beyond those other than the ones \"everyone\" has seen like The Notebook and Titanic.\n\nI'm thinking of maybe trying Love Actually, or something older like Roman Holiday? We've been watching a lot of classics this past year (Apocalypse Now, Casablanca, Hot Fuzz, Bill &amp; Ted, Close Encounters, Citizen Kane etc) and have really enjoyed all of them.\n\nAny other suggestions for us?

But I think this movie would've been more brave, if it taught kids a more valuable lesson that you should always put your self-respect first and that a person who doesn't appreciate you enough, needs to live with the consequences of their mistake!
