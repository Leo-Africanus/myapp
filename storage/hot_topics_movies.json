I knew that Paul Giamatti was in this film and I knew it took place somewhere between the 70s and the 80s. And let me tell you from the minute it started I was hooked on the performances the characters the overall feeling of just not being with your loved ones during Christmas time and spending it with strangers really touched me that I never knew a Christmas movie could before. There will always be the classic Christmas movies that we all can fall on, but there isn\u2019t too many that I can recall within this current decade that has hits me as much as the holdovers. From the sentimental moments Da vine Joy, to the hilarious back-and-forth with Dominic and Paul , to the heartbreaking moments with Dominic\u2018s parents. I will now watch this film every Christmas time.\n\n",

I couldn\u2019t find anything anywhere. Not online, not in print shops, not even after trying to reach out directly to the film\u2019s production team (I actually tried\u2026 zero response \ud83d\ude05).\n\nSince so many fans seem to have the same struggle, I finally decided I\u2019d just recreate it myself, staying as true to the \u201890s look as possible.\n\nSame black-and-white vibe with that subtle blue tint\u2026 Alyssa\u2019s face framed the same way\u2026 the serif title in the exact spot\u2026 even the quote under the red censor bar rebuilt accurately. I matched the typography, the shadows, the contrast, everything. And it\u2019s clean enough for an 18\" \u00d7 36\" print.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this here because I know how many people love this movie and how impossible it is to get a proper poster.\n\nIf anyone wants the full printable files (only if it\u2019s allowed by the mods, not trying to break rules), just drop a comment, I\u2019ll directly reach out to you or DM.\n\nHope this makes at least a few Chasing Amy fans smile today. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "content": "JCVD is one of my favorite 80's action stars. He's bi-polar and may have taken too much coke at one time, but his genuine care for his fans make me love him.\n\nMy favorite films of his are Hard Target, Knock Off, Kickboxer, The Quest and Legionaire. I haven't seen the ones he did with Ringo Lam though (forgot the titles).\n\nAnother confession, STREET FIGHTER has slowly grown on me over the years. It's a terrible film but I think it falls into \"So Bad It's Good\" category now.",

        "content": "I just looked on YouTube and forgot that it had a ton of free ad-supported movies. Some of the movies are really good like Blade Runner, The Thing, Hercules (Disney), Silence of the Lambs, and the Godfather. There are also some deep cuts that I have had trouble finding on streaming such as The Last Action Hero and The Lost Boys. I would highly reccomend looking on YouTube to see if there are any movies you would enjoy. ",

Boxing, kickboxing, MMA, Judo, Jiu Jitsu, Wrestling, Pro Wrestling - even though it's actually performance art I'm counting it for practical purposes - any of it.\n\nMovies I've seen in this genre: Rocky Series of course and Karate Kid, Warrior, Red Belt, Never Back Down, The Fighter, Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, Kickboxer, Bloodsport\n\nSo any sort of movies of this type that aren't in this list I haven't yet thought of would be great if they exist. I realize I may have already covered all the good ones in the list but perhaps there is a particular standout I haven't been made aware of yet. Perhaps a Netflix movie even.",

They also aired theatrical films edited for tv but that\u2019s a different discussion to be had. \n\nWhat are some of the best made-for-tv movies? I used to love watching them back in the 90s. I remember one starring Candace Cameron and Fred Savage I loved, based on a true story. He killed her. \n\nI remember another one based on a true story, starring Tiffani Thiesen, where her friends killed her. \n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to rewatch some tv films from the 70s through 90s. \n\n",
