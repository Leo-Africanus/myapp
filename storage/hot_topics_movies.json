        "title": "\"The Rock\" (1996) had such a well-written, well-acted, &amp; well-directed (Michael Bay) switch up of the main antagonists/bad guys.",
        "content": "General Hummel (Ed Harris) was portrayed as the main antagonist, obviously along with the other 17 marines that went rouge with him. But he wasn't a normal \"bad guy\". We dont find out until way later that his true intentions were to bluff the Pentagon (with the threat of those 15 VX-gas warheads aimed at the heart of San Fransisco + the tourists they were holding hostage) into paying out $100 million dollars (from a shady slush fund full of proceeds from illegal arms sales that the pentagon makes) so he could distribute $1 million dollars to each one of the 83 marines families that had died under his command over the years, and then pay the other rogue marines a mil each. Pretty noble agenda, but at the same time, not so much.\n\nOur first inkling of who the REAL bad guys are was revealed when the Navy Seals entered the shower room, got surrounded, and then slaughtered.\u00a0[Captains Frye and Darrow](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCHteEFvEum8Xu7sQZGIP8Waow1OLitqJfweF-Pq3Ods3oCPKD2bNjsRZGtW2gWr1rlTMu9Q_S94br0FqDhH8Fa40gaT-nsI_YmE0MjWqzMcQ2meV8m6HpYNqfQV8ZQPLmKPuEo3DtQO0/s1600/vlcsnap-2014-03-10-16h04m01s12.png)\u00a0(Gregory Sporleder and Tony Todd) both have a moment during\u00a0[that scene](https://youtu.be/-PNJ5e8Qq3g)\u00a0where they are both shown, how do I put this, to be enjoying slaughtering those navy seals a little too much???\n\nAs the movie progresses, it still kind of feels like Hummel is the bad guy. But then after he gives the ok to launch the first VX-gas rocket bc the pentagon missed the deadline, and then changes the landing coordinates of the rockets mid-flight, shifting it from heading right for the football stadium full of people out to the open ocean, his true intentions are finally revealed. He was just trying to bluff the pentagon.\n\n[And then we get one of the most intense scenes from all 90's action movies.](https://youtu.be/hiJUZjv7xP4)\u00a0(In my opinion). \"This mission was based on the threat of force. I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I am out of my fucking mind? We bluffed. They called it. The mission is over.\" And then Captain Frye busts out such a creepy reply, revealing that HE is the true antagonist of the movie (Captain Darrow as well); \"Who ever said anything about bluffing General?\" That was such an eerie scene. He also was the last rouge marine to go down (I think??), suffering\u00a0[probably the most gruesome death](https://clip.cafe/the-rock-1996/im-gonna-choke-million-bucks-out-of-youre-gonna-die/)\u00a0of them all. (Well,\u00a0[Captain Darrow becoming \"The Rocket Man\"](https://youtu.be/DNg8OCIMZgI?t=31)\u00a0was pretty freaking brutal too, fitting for the movie's 2nd leading antagonist.) I love this movie, and the very well-written switch up of the main antagonists.",

My daughter absolutely loves the Christmas aesthetic, and the train but once the elves  and Santa show up in the movie it was like being a little kid again hearing and seeing her so excited I could not help but cry a bit. Which the soundtrack, and hints of Christmas music in the back I genuinely felt such a connection to my childhood and having that wonderful Christmas feeling again of like being at my parents and grandparents house where everything felt so alive and happy. I feel like as a young teen this movie doesn\u2019t hit, and it\u2019s really just another film, but as an adult with children I really feel like it\u2019s worth the time with your little ones. I know it\u2019s old prolly not worth the read but I just wanted to have my thoughts out there. ",

        "content": "I'm watching this movie now for the first time after seeing bits and pieces of it on TV over the years around Christmas time. I'm in my 30s and I really like movies of all genres and time periods but movies before the 80s I have not seen many besides the Bond movies and some of the classics Godfather, Jaws, Alien etc. and yet this movie is very very good. Couple of times it got me choked, made me laugh a little and smile quite a few times.\n\nI can't say it feels very Christmasy, it does have a cozy feeling probably because of the black and white and always seeing it associated with the Christmas season on TV. It has a lot of heart (I haven't finished it yet), feel for George Bailey missing out on life, Id say many of my generation probably feel similar, shit I can't even get a job or build a future.\n\nThe only real critique I have is that the warmness, kindness in this film does not exist in the world today if it ever did. Potter and his cruel and cutthroat ideals are really what society is like today.\n\nHave younger people watched and or liked this film? Like under 30? I would expect this movie to be largely forgotten for most under 40.\n\nUpdate.\\*\\* I just finished the second half. it's a very good movie but it really isn't a Christmas movie. the Christmas tone wasn't only really squeezed in at the very end. The gratefulness of George at the end was satisfying and you can see he really is the richest man once he sees his family and friends. he's actually happy at the possibility I'm of being arrested because he is grateful for all the people in his life. If I had been drinking I may have teared up towards the end. I'm surprised how many small moments in this film made me laugh out loud. a great movie that somehow is about a sad man with a depressing life but with some small happy moments and a very happy ending makes up for it. it's weird. this movie is not a Christmas movie, it's not a happy movie, it's not particularly exciting yet everything comes together to create a classic. I'll definitely be watching this again around Christmas or a cold, cozy, snowy night. The only regret is I knew the plot of the movie from seeing so many pieces over the years. This is a great movie to go in cold, no trailer, just go in thinking it's a holiday movie.",

The scene after he corners Dre in the alleyway is especially brutal.

This kid wanted the smoke with Jackie Chan (Mr. Han), a grown man, and treated a tournament with twelve year olds like this was his audition for the next Street Fighter role! \n\nIt was entertaining and all for a bad guy but the sudden switch as soon as he was defeated with that flip kick just didn\u2019t feel believable to me.
