        "title": "The Fall Guy was much better than I had expected",
        "content": "The Fall Guy is available right now on Netflix, at least here in Sweden, so I watched it yesterday with my SO. We were not looking for it specifically, it was just shown on the home page, and we thought, why not? Our two small kids are asleep, it had been a long day, we were tired, it was late, so an easy-to-follow, action movie seemed like a good idea. When it finished we just looked at each other and we both said the exact same thing: 'it was much better than I had expected'.\n\nI had heard about the movie before, but it just looked like the typical action/comedy movie with two very well known faces to pull people into the cinema, so it didn't catch my attention. And in a way it was indeed an action-filled film with plenty of very funny moments, so even if it were just that it would had already fulfilled its duty. But it's also a love letter to stuntmen and women and their craft and skill, showing a lot of their work in front and behind the cameras in a realistic way (or at least that's what I thought as someone that has nothing to do with the cinema business). The choreographies are superbly done, for example the one at the club, when Ryan Gosling's character is under the influence. It also has some very neat scenes that would be worth of mention even in a more \"serious\" movie (I'm talking specifically about the split-screen specular shot of the phone-call; if you have seen the movie I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).\n\nSo why don't I hear about it more often than I do? I think that it deserves more mentions than it gets.",

        "content": "Was watching the Spielberg documentary last night and during it they talk about the various directors who took over Hollywood in the 70s (Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese, DePalma and obviously Spielberg among others) they mention that it was like crashing a party. Some people were on their way out, they were on their way in. And I thought, \"who was on their way out?\"\n\nIt makes sense, when one era starts it means another is over, but it would be interesting to think some actors or directors careers ended because they couldn't adapt to the \"New Hollywood\", especially since that era is considered a Golden era of films but to some it was the end. \n\nAt first I thought Audrey Hepburn would be the obvious candidate, she was huge in the 60s but then disappeared almost in the 70s. However, looking at her wiki page, it seems she voluntarily left Hollywood to be with her family, not because she couldn't get work. \n\nJust a random thought.",

        "content": "For me, I love the visuals, the score, the way John Boorman handled the story. It's dark and disturbing like fantasy Horror and I appreciate that eerie, mythgological tone about the legend. \n\nBut it's also episodic and not a lot is thoroughly developed like the reintroduction of Morgana into Arthur's life. She just shows up halfway into the movie without any explanation as to how she and Arthur reconnected. And it takes pretty long for Helen Mirren to show up. Thankfully, Mirren is spectacular, a incestuous manipulative monster whose drive for power and beauty becomes her undoing. Her reparte with Nicol Williamson's Merlin (who's superb as the wizard) worked because both actors hated each other in real life.  I still wish the film hadn't made Morgana so underdeveloped. She comes into the movie too late. And a few of the casting choices were not that good: Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi as Lancelot and Guinevere.",

        "content": "I just wrapped up the 2024 Count of Monte Cristo series, and I genuinely appreciated how faithful it was to the book. You can tell there was real respect for the source material, especially in how much time it takes to let the story breathe and unfold.\n\nThat said, it also ended up solidifying something for me: I still think the 2002 film is the stronger adaptation overall. Even though it takes more liberties, the changes it makes actually serve the medium better. The pacing is tighter, the emotional beats land faster, and the story feels more cohesive as a film rather than a strict translation of the novel.\n\nThe series is probably the better choice if you want accuracy and depth. But if you\u2019re looking for a version that moves the story along in a way that works best on screen, I still give the edge to the 2002 movie.\n\nCurious how others feel, especially fans of the book.",

        "title": "Cop Land (1997) - What's with Rose dumping the trash bags?",
        "content": "Can anyone chime in here about the movie Cop Land (1097) with Sylvester Stallone?  This is one of my favorite movies but one part has always irked me and I've never figured it out, nor have I found anywhere online where this plot point was discussed or explained.\n\nEarly in the movie, Sheriff Freddy drops a stuffed animal off and his unrequited love's house (Liz).  She tells him someone is dumping garbage bags.  It's revealed that Rose, the wife of Harvey Keitel's character Ray is the one who does it.  She says something to the effect \"If Joey Randone thinks I got no right, you should tell him to stop soiling my sheets\".   \n\nThis line (and the action it refers to) confuses the hell out of me.  Other evidence in the movie suggests Joey is sleeping with Rose.  But if that were the case, why would Rose dump her trash at Joey's house?  For one, it seems she is afraid of Ray finding out she's cheating, but this action contradicts that from every logical standpoint.  It would make more WAY more sense if the scorned spouse (Ray) dumped the trash.  But his 'mob boss of the cops' persona makes it seem unlikely he would take such petty action against Joey.   The whole bit with Rose would make more sense if Joey and Ray were shacking up, but there doesn't seem to be any other evidence in the movie to support this. Or if Ray and Liz were shacking up, Rose would be the scorned wife and the trash would make sense.  But once again no evidence in the movie supports that.\n\nNow, I remember that Ray fumbles with the key and delays helping Joey, and he later dies.  But still, the trash dumping thing and Rose's words just make the whole situation muddy in my mind. \n\nCan anyone provide some insight?  For the record, I've also seen the Director's Cut of this film and I don't think it explains anything else regarding this.",

You can add an underrated actor as well.\n\nI'm just adding this last line to fill the quota. Haha.",

        "title": "Best movie fights with a \"Sacrificial Lion\" turning a two-on-one into a one-on-one",
        "content": "For those who don't know, the \"sacrificial lion\" is a trope wherein a good/powerful character is killed to prove to the audience that the villain is a threat or the situation is genuinely dire. I wanted to get more specific though and find the best examples of this trope happening all within one fight - specifically, where the heroes were already struggling together against the villain, placing more emphasis on how screwed the remaining hero is. Two examples (spoilers for Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Mission Impossible: Fallout):\n\n1. [Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo__6MZIg6U) \\- Bolstered by John William's insane soundtrack and some of the best choreography in the series, this might be the best fight in Star Wars. Specifically though, I like how the tone of the fight completely shifts when Qui-Gon dies - Obi-Wan is alone but pissed off, and the audience both fears for him (if the master couldn't do it, what chance does the student have) and roots for him to get revenge.\n2. [Fake John Lark vs. Ethan Hunt and Real John Lark](https://youtu.be/z83IyEgxPrk?si=mlnVYzgvVTRWU8AW&amp;t=210) \\- This whole fight is awesome, but the best moment (besides Henry Cavill reloading his fists) happens near the end, when Fake John Lark grabs Real John Lark by the hair, takes a moment to stare down Ethan Hunt, then knocks him out and readjusts his suit jacket. Ethan has always been shown to be a skilled combatant, so the fact that he couldn't even beat this guy *with* help is pretty intimidating. I love that this random henchman gives our main hero such a challenge, as well as Tom Cruise's \"I really don't want to be doing this\" look right before he charges him. \n\n \n\nWhat's the best example of this trope that you can think of?
