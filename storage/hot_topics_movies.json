        "title": "Two years late but finally got around watching They Cloned Tyrone and to me, it's the best racial satire to come out since Get Out.",
        "content": "\n\nThe whole premise is bonkers but so clever it how it serves as a metaphor for how ethnic minorities, black people in this case, are utilized as drones of consumption and how this perpetuates negative stereotypes (e.g. Fried chicken, obsession with hair products, selling drugs, etc.). It shows how to be critical of those consumer goods we're obsessed with. What makes us feel good or \"look cool\" to others isn't necessarily good for us. \n\nI also love the point it made when Fontaine almost gave up and accepted his fate as a mere clone living in a vicious cycle. Even after people figure out the trap, that knowledge alone won't keep you from falling into it again and again. We might be products of our environment and even our genetics, but at the end of the day, we have free will, and it's up to us to break free from the cycle we are stuck in.\n\n\nI myself am Latino (Puerto Rican to be exact) and I feel like many points made in the film apply to my culture as well. In recent years, Puerto Rican culture has become a bit more known internationally, thanks to things like Bad Bunny and the Despacito song. While there is nothing wrong with people being curious of and being entertained by the culture, there is also a concerted effort to perpetuate pretty offensive and harmful stereotypes about my people: From sexual promiscuity thanks to reggaeton music to the idea that we all live in slums next to the beach. And many fellow Puerto Ricans end up internalizing these stereotypes and thinking it makes us \"cool\". \n\nThe film just really spoke to me this way, and feel it even applies to other ethnicities or minority groups. Great film. It was like Us, but actually good. Also had no idea Boyega had such range in acting. He was phenomenal.",

Films now seem to patronize viewers by relying on overly explicit metaphors and heavy-handed commentary. For instance, The Substance shows Demi Moore literally giving birth to her younger self through her back. She points out The Brutalist for visualizing its metaphors too explicitly: immigrants' lives being depicted as literally turned upside down and showing the American Dream as something that, \"literally fucks you.\" Did anyone else read it and just curious about thoughts about whether they feel that movies are spelling out symbolism instead of trusting the audience's intelligence.",

All the sacrifices she's made (and dad) raising and protecting us, all that time passed and how fleeting it all is. Made me think of how tired they look now, how proud they are of us that we've made it. And I know that will be me in time, like passing the torch. I can't handle it. Suckerpunched right in the heart. \n\nThat movie moved me in ways nothing else ever has. I can't stop thinking about it and I'm listening and crying to the score on repeat now.

Definitely the best villain whose surname isn't Gruber in this franchise. \n\nSo over all this movie is like a 7/10. ",

        "content": "I think Elvira didn't know what love was, even if she tried to. Let's be honest, she left Tony because she could see the writing on the wall, he was headed to a tragic end and she wasn't going to stay and end up made into swiss cheese alongside the self destructive Tony.\n\nEvery relationship she had was a business exchange with the purpose of leaving her protected and safe. That was her arrangement with Frank and it was now Tony and Tony knew that and that's why he treated her like crap because he wanted her to be like Gina but she was just a tramp looking to be a kept woman. \n\nThe sad thing is that Tony ended up losing the two people who loved him for who he was: Manny, his best friend, whom he killed out of a sense of betrayal, and Gina, who hated his guts before dying. \n\nElvira was the smart one because she got off the bus before the crash but not before telling Tony off for how he treated her.",

        "content": "Question, Do you wish Peter Jackson's Halo got made?\n\nIn the 2000s, Peter Jackson attempted to make a Halo film with him as Producer and Neil Blomkamp was going to direct it &amp; Alex Garland was going to write the script. However, the film wasn't made due to several reasons. 1 was that Microsoft had very strict terms, demanding $10\u00a0million against 15\u00a0percent of gross. 20th Century Fox &amp; Universal both decided to partner on the film. However after awhile, 20th Century Fox threaten to pull, &amp; Universal demanded Jackson to reduced his first dollar revenue deal, which he refused, thus, Halo was cancelled. Another was that the production was plagued with problems with pre-production being re-started multiple times.\n\nI kinda wish the film got made, but one thing that came out of this was that Peter Jackson decided to help Blomkamp make District 9, which I enjoyed. However, I do think if the film did get made, if probably would of been a disaster given that Microsoft was micro-managing the hell out of the project and that fact the production was really on shaky ground with the multiple studios teaming up.\n\nOverall, Do you wish Peter Jackson's Halo got made?",

        "content": "I remember watching \"Wolf Creek\", a movie I had seen years ago. It's really great for the first hour\u2014slowgoing, ominous, suspenseful, believable acting. Three backpackers in Australia unwittingly end up at an abandoned mining camp in the outback with a loon who tortures and kills people. However, around the hour mark, when shit goes south, one of the girls tries to save her friend who is being assaulted by the maniac, and ends up shooting him and grazing his neck. He falls apparently unconscious, but rather than ensuring he is actually dead, she hits him in the back with the butt end of the rifle twice, and the two drive off in one of his vehicles. This in and of itself is absurd.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the two women soon reach a cliff, and instead of trying to steer a different direction and avert their tormentor (he is now pursuing them in another car), they end up getting out and pushing the fucking car over the cliff\u2014mind you, it is the middle of the night, they are hundreds if not thousands of miles away from civilization, and will inevitably die of heat exhaustion/dehydration because it's the fucking outback.\n\nIt is maybe the most egregious \"bad choice\" I've ever seen in a horror movie. Both of the characters end up dying, and in a way, they kind of deserve it. What is particularly frustrating about it is that this is not a popcorn horror flick by any means. It's serious in tone, and really uncompromising, but that stroke of bad writing derails the whole damn thing.",

It shows the pressure, secrets, and power struggles that happen behind closed doors during an important religious event.\n\nSome people might say the ending is easy to guess, but that did not bother me. The journey is more important than the surprise. The movie does a good job showing the weight of each choice the characters make.\n\nRalph Fiennes was amazing in this movie. He did not need big speeches or action scenes. His face, his voice, and his small movements said a lot. He made his character feel real and thoughtful.\n\nThis film may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy serious stories and good acting, I think you will enjoy The Conclave.\n\nCan anyone recommend some similar movies ?",

The movie was not very long but still had great character development. \n\nIt kept you intrigued and made you need to see the ending. The sheriff was a great leader and selfless man. The way he treated the old man with respect and trusted his experience and skills even though he had clear deficiencies was amazing. \n\nThe way he said goodbye to the old man in the end was emotional for a horror movie as well. \n\nI think overall this movie was better than its reviews. \n\nWhat is everyone's opinion about it? \n\nAlso, I like how it gives some insight to the old man's past, leaving it ambiguous to the viewer to make up in their minds what the old\nMan has seen. \nIt also doesn't give much back story about Bright Hope or the people who live there or how it was established. \n\nAlso, what do you guys think about the ending when the old\nMan throws the rock? Does the sheriff survive? All good things to think about. ",
