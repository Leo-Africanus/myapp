        "content": "I recently watched Lawrence of Arabia, and was surprised to see that the shot of Lawrence blowing the matchstick fire out, which transitions into the shot of the sunrise, is considered an iconic cinematic moment and a defining moment for film editing. Perhaps I\u2019m a huge idiot, but I genuinely don\u2019t get why this shot is special. To me, it\u2019s just a regular (if well timed) cut between two unrelated shots. A character blows out a match, and then we get a timeskip. Why is this cut so special?",
