        "content": "You ever notice how some actors are in everything for a few years and then just disappear? One day they\u2019re headlining big movies, and the next, it\u2019s like Hollywood pretends they never existed. No big scandal, no retirement announcement, just gone.\n\nTaylor Kitsch is a perfect example. After Friday Night Lights, it felt like every studio was pushing him as the next big star. He got John Carter, Battleship, and True Detective, but after a few flops, he just stopped getting those lead roles. Same thing happened with Josh Hartnett. In the early 2000s, he was in Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Sin City, and then he just kind of faded away. I heard he turned down playing Batman in The Dark Knight, which probably didn\u2019t help. Who else do you remember being everywhere and then suddenly gone?\n",

        "content": "Many years ago, me and my wife were on a late honeymoon trip to a cold mountain town. Sadly she got a fever-cold on the second day and we were confined to the hotel room (She pressed me to go out and enjoy, but the cold weather and the cosy room was making me stay put). TV was showing a movie Birdcage, and I found it utterly hilarious. I was laughing out loud, and she was laughing at me laughing. I was laughing at the movie, and she was laughing at me laughing. It was a great evening.\n\nWith a lot of nostalgic feeligns, I decided to watch this movie again recently. But it was a very different experience. \n\nIf you don't know the plot it goes like this: Robbin Williams and Nathan lane are a gay couple running a drag show/gay club where Nathan is the star. Robbin's son is in love with the daughter of a very conservative senator.\nThe gay couple disguise themselves as a heterosexual couple in order to meet and impress the conservative family \n\nI guess when I watched it the first time around, I was young and naive, and I watched from the pov of the young couple who just want to get married somehow, and all troubles Armand and Albert go through made me laugh. \n\nNow I watch it from the pov of the parents (I myself a parent now) and it feels very sad in parts. To pretend to be someone who you are not, for someone else's convenience feels like a sad sacrifice you are making. One speech from Nathan almost broke me.",

All I ever knew was how supposedly scary it was, and that\u2019s not necessarily wrong. But between all of the darker material there\u2019s a real sense of whimsy there, and it\u2019s all delivered with such *confidence.* The movie just throws all of these insane ideas out there and expects you to keep up, and I was enthralled the whole time. The main actress has to be one of the best displays of young acting I\u2019ve ever seen in the genre and she\u2019s working against *nothing.* Just props and a chicken for most of the thing. I couldn\u2019t believe when I looked it up and found that it was the director\u2019s only movie. What a wild ride. ",

Birmans. Seal point Birmans, to be precise. I would wake and be surrounded by cats and all that the cat life entailed. Kitten cats, male cats, female cats. Cat cages, cat shows, cat breeding. Always the breeding, the eternal lifecycle of the cat burned into my retinas. The yowling, the prowling, the fucking.\n\n&gt;When I was 25, I hung out with some Furries in Hamilton. Charming folk, I really liked them. Loved Disney films. Adored My Little Pony. They got turned on by putting on dog suits, fox suits, cat suits. Adults - all yowling, prowling, fucking.\n\n&gt;I'm 37 now, I've just seen Cats the movie. I've never seen the stage show, but I know the songs. I get the gist. Big songs, big numbers. This film is something else. I am 13 again, I am 25 again. I'm at my parents house, hearing cats fuck. I'm watching a Furry put on a catsuit.\n\n&gt;This is the worst thing I've ever seen. This is what death feels like. This is the worst ketamine trip. This is the CGI from Scorpion King. I don't know if I'm five minutes in or five hours. Nothing matters anymore. This is the death of all things. Fuck it.\n",

She told me it\u2019s supposed to be bitter sweet but I don\u2019t get it.

Their characters are so raw and believable, making the story frightening yet deeply human. It\u2019s the end of the world, but in a way that\u2019s quintessentially British - all mud, grime, and desperation.\n\nAnd there's hope too. We're treated to luvly little ambient numbers as they drive up to Manchester. Little bits of respite as they huddle around a campfire.\n\nAnd the infected. The running, frantic frothing monsters may seem old hat now, but they redefined the zombie genre. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a zombie film since that\u2019s scared me as much as 28 Days. The church scene at the start of the movie is so chilling and upsetting.\n\nCant wait to check out the true sequel to this British masterpiece. Thank God for directors like Danny Boyle, stamping his muddy footprint over cinema.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve searched high and low for references to this scene and what others took from it, but it seems no one else in the entire universe has picked up on it (at least not anyone that feels the need to share every waking thought online, anyway).\n\nThere is a scene where Mary walks over to Dr Mierzwiak\u2019s car to chat with him. Shot from Stan\u2019s perspective, they both look back at him and laugh amongst themselves, with Stan and the viewer unaware exactly what it is they\u2019re laughing about. At some point in the film (it\u2019s been a while), Stan confesses his love for Mary. In my mind, the clear implication from the conversation between Mary and Dr Mierzwiak is that Stan has at some point had Mary erased, and is now unknowingly falling for her again, something Mary and Dr Mierzwiak find to be comical.",

Sam Neill, Peter Firth, Tim Curry, Courtney B. Vance, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Fred Thompson and others to round out Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin and James Earl Jones. What other older movies have loaded casts like this?",

        "content": "I was rewatching Heat (for like the 50th time in my life at this point).  I was having fun laughing at some of the stuff that I now see as overly dramatic but I found cool when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, once it got to the hospital (filmed at St Mary's in Long Beach) scene where Lauren is taken after Pacino finds her in the tub, I was very impressed by the actors in that scene - they seemed to really memorize their hospital lingo and make it believable.  But as I watched more, I kinda felt like the main doctor had to have been someone they just found at the hospital they filmed at and told him to \"pretend this just happened\".\n\nSo I wound up doing some quick research on imdb and got his name, but he's not credited in any other movie.  Some google searching led me to his profile, and everything seems to line up and definitely looks like he was a real doctor, pretty cool:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8buza1izazoe1.png?width=2080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1e96c63c1d057eb2e7ec47a521cec51c3f5e27\n\nAlso, I think the blonde nurse is also a real nurse too, she seems way to natural in her actions in that scene.",

        "content": "Mine was \"A Perfect World\" starring Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood. It came out in 1993, and I'm pretty sure I was closer to 7-8 when I watched it. The reason my mother let me pick it out (from a VHS RENTAL STORE, GASP HOW ANTIQUATED) was because it had a kid in a ghost face costume on it walking with a guy she must have assumed was his father (Costner).\n\n  \nNah, this was about a pair of murderers who break out of prison and kidnap said kid, kind of a road movie with Eastwood as the Texas Ranger chief who is chasing them. It's worth a watch, it's a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first \"anti-hero\" sad movies. \n\nAnyway, anybody else got stories like this?",
