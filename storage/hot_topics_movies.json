        "content": "We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. \n\nBut as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. \n\nOh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (\"I'm a Vegetarian!!!\").\n\nAnd I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. \n\nPeople bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. \n\nHarrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once.",

There\u2019s early critique, Ellie\u2019s speech, Malcolm\u2019s warning, but by the end, he\u2019s grieving a lost dream, not facing consequences.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needed to be the villain. But it\u2019s fascinating how the story wraps systemic failure in nostalgia, and leaves us mourning *with* him.\n\nIs that emotional sleight of hand? Or just good character work?\n\nCurious what others think.",

        "title": "\"Eyes Without a Face\" (1960) is one of the greatest horror films of its era.",
        "content": "If you haven't seen *Eyes Without a Face* (1960), you're missing out on one of the most haunting and poetic horror films ever made. Directed by Georges Franju, this French classic isn't just a chilling story of obsession and identity. It\u2019s a surreal, atmospheric masterpiece that was ahead of its time in nearly every way.\n\nThe plot centers around a brilliant but deranged surgeon who is willing to commit horrific crimes in order to restore his daughter's disfigured face. That premise alone is disturbing, but what sets *Eyes Without a Face* apart is how beautifully it's executed. The cinematography is stark and dreamlike, creating an eerie tone that lingers long after the credits roll. The black-and-white visuals enhance the haunting quality, especially during the now-infamous face transplant scene\u2014shocking for its time and still unsettling today.\n\nEdith Scob's performance as the daughter, Christiane, is mesmerizing. She wears a blank, porcelain-like mask for much of the film, and yet conveys deep emotion through her eyes and body language. It's tragic, unsettling, and oddly ethereal.\n\nWhat really makes this film remarkable is how it balances horror with lyricism. It\u2019s grotesque, yes, but also strangely beautiful. There\u2019s a sense of sadness and humanity beneath the horror that you rarely see in films of this genre or era.\n\n*Eyes Without a Face* paved the way for body horror auteurs like Cronenberg and influenced countless filmmakers. It's the kind of movie that crawls under your skin. Not with jump scares, but with quiet, creeping dread.\n\nIf you\u2019re into psychological horror, art-house cinema, or just want to see something totally unique from the 1960s, give this film a watch. It\u2019s disturbing, elegant, and unforgettable.",

Although I did not watched Star Wars series (which I am intended to) or The Lord of the Rings, I am super into dnd or other fantastic fictions or, you know, magical things in general. So I would gladly act the scripts from them. Any recommendations?\n\nEdit: I need something suitable for class environment \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nSecond edit: Thank you all for your precious answers \u2764\ufe0f\nI wanted to do something intresting but I did not had enough self-confidence so I ended up picking Mia's speech from Princess Diaries since she talks anxiously, very similar to mine in real life. But your advices were much more impressive. I am just low when it comes to confidence \ud83d\udc94",
