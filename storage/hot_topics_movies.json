        "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t complain about this, so here\u2019s me complaining about this.\n\nAgainst my better judgement I decided to watch The Gorge on Apple\u2018s streaming platform, and boy it turns out even an ending as trite as that can be [further undercut by Ted Lasso\u2019s beaming face.](https://i.imgur.com/mB9Z1D6.jpeg)\n\nI remember the story about how George Lucas had to go non-union or pay fines to the director\u2019s guild because he refused to open Star Wars with credits. They cared about them that much. Now, in space year 2026, apparently every professional association of filmmakers give not one solitary shit about credits, allowing as they do every single streaming platform to shrink them to Borrower size so they can Run Some Fucken Adverts. \u201cYes you just watched Schindler's List for three hours and change, but stop processing it there\u2019s not a moment to lose, have you heard about *House MD*? We're gonna play it in 5 seconds unless you tell us not to.\" \n\nThis is Apple\u2019s own movie, these are their people, and they couldn\u2019t even wait for the animations to stop. Like the disrespect afforded to the standard white on black scroll is bad enough, but there are visual effects going on in that little box. You paid vfx artists real human money to make this look good, not enough, granted, but you paid them, and then you made it two inches tall. Morality obviously doesn\u2019t sway these people but how are their shareholders not beating down the door at the sheer waste of it?\n\nNetflix is particularly bad now too, some people will say \"hey you can just make it bigger again\" (as if ruining the vibe alone were not sin enough) but on both Smart TVs and Xbox, the only two places I've bothered testing, going over the \"back\" arrow to get to the tiny credits crashes them all together, like they're punishing you for even questioning their wisdom. How *dare* you try to find out who the best boy is.\n\nAnd just so Disney+ doesn't escape here, when I was watching season 2 of Andor last year their title images for next episodes which pop up unprompted over the credits \\*included spoilers\\*. If anyone has the address for the person who did that, stick it in the comments, I just wanna talk.\n\nI am quite unreasonably mad about this and I don't expect them to change how they do it, but boy I\u2019d sure take an option in the settings, off by default no doubt, that just says \u201crespect the goddamn films you dorks\u201d with a little checkbox.",

        "title": "I watched Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, my first ever production of the legendary play",
        "content": "Oh my God, I'm finally free. The longest movie of my life. Literally, this has beaten Lawrence of Arabia by 20 odd minutes for longest movie I've ever seen.\n\nThe only Shakespeare thing that I've ever sat through fully with the intention of paying attention to it (and not because it was my assignment in school), was the 2015 Macbeth film with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. I must admit, while I understood that Shakespeare was the progenitor to many narrative tropes and archetypes (or at the very least refined them to near perfection), I never GOT Shakespeare, or understood why every adaptation always preserved the language without updating it. It was that version of Macbeth that made me GET Shakespeare, but it wouldn't be until I saw Hamnet, yet another movie I love, that made me want to dive into Shakespeare proper, and what better way to dive in than with his magnum opus, and what better version than the only fully complete film edition, helmed by and starring SIR Kenneth Branagh (um akshually Branagh's isn't the complete version, it's taking the two existing versions that have different bits and pieces each and combining them in two to say that this is a complete edition is a misnomer ANYWAY)\n\nAs someone who is hardly a Shakespeare or Hamlet scholar, but who is familiar with the overarching story and moments, I guess the biggest compliment I can pay to this movie is that I was rarely bored. Despite it's gargantuan length and dense wordplay, I was able to keep up with what was happening and genuinely eager to see how certain moments would be executed.\n\nFar and away my favorite thing about this movie is the setting and production design. Many Shakespeare adaptations have that question to answer: what time period do we set this in? Do we set in in a reasonably accurate time period of it's day, risking a stale aesthetic? Do we set it in modern day, risking accusations of anachronism? Do we set it in no particular time at all, and risk confusion? All versions have merit, but this one chooses to set it in a late 18th century period, drenched in the late aesthetic of European royal monarchies, like the Hapsburgs and the Romanovs. Aside from just being flat out gorgeous to look at, this period manages to perfectly toe the line between the old and new, between nostalgic and modern. It never once felt anachronistic, but neither did it ever feel basic. While there were times where the sets could feel a bit \"stagey\" with large expanses of empty space, most of the time they felt rich, lavish, and full of life. Special mention must be made of the copious use of mirrors and secret passageways, which could've been gimmicky but instead smartly serve dual purposes: serving as reasons for the constant uses of both soliloquies and character exits/entrances, respectively, and speaking to the text's themes of duality, secrets, and facades. It's such an inspired choice and execution that whenever I go to read the text now, it'll be difficult to NOT imagine it in the palace and snowy landscapes as portrayed here.\n\nWhere to set it is just one part of the equation. The other part: how do we direct the actors? Such wordy and dense language on the stage is the mount Everest of most actor's journeys. Thankfully, the vast majority of the actors manage to \"suit the action to the word, and the word to the action,\" although they all get their big showy moments as well. Probably Derek Jacobi as Claudius is the most consistent across the board, decades of experience preparing him to deliver his lines with equal parts subtlety and weight. Kate Winslet pleasantly surprised me the most, helping us feel genuinely heartbroken towards what is usually a thankless role. There's many a celebrity cameos in here, and everyone will have different pet favorites and pet hates. Charlton Heston as the Player King was a standout for me, while Robin Williams, while good in the role, was just too distracting, ESPECIALLY since he shows up in the last 30 minutes or so. The actor I feel most torn on, funnily enough, is the main one: Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet.\n\nI'm REALLY torn on wondering whether Branagh's forceful screams and \"antic dispositions\" make him either really compelling or unintentionally funny. I can't help but feel that whenever Hamlet has to do a big speech, he massively overdoes it, with the only exception being his rendition of \"Alas, Yorick,\" (although for what is otherwise an inspired movie, Branagh's execution of arguably the most famous image from the play is sadly very safe and familiar). And yet, whenever it's a scene of \"normal\" dialogue, he comes across as not just believable, but genuinely charming and even likeable. I think my favorite scenes of his are when he's talking to the acting troupe, probably because Branagh's own adoration of the craft pours through his every word. Ultimately, he does manage to carry the movie through it's gargantuan length, and even if he goes too big at times, he's always engaging.\n\nBranagh carries the film not just with his performance but his direction as well. While some scenes are stately and elegant, others are mad with energy, the camera spinning around to capture it all, this film's signature technique, it would seem. There's almost a swashbuckling element to Hamlet here, as his emotions run wild with his actions. At the same time, he's constantly taking the piss out of almost everyone around him. The big thing about the play is the main question of if Hamlet ever goes truly mad at any point, and if so, when, how long, and to what extent. Here, I don't think Hamlet EVER goes crazy: he can be angry and let his emotions get the best of him, but he's always in his right state of mind. That's certainly a choice, one might even call it a safe or mainstream choice, but it does make certain moments of the movie all the more lively, from greeting his old friends to staging a play to him evading the guards after hiding a body.\n\nOutside of a few acting choices, my only real issues is with this film's biggest claim to fame: it's length. Again, I wasn't usually bored, but yeah, this shit did NOT need to be close to 4 hours long. Not to criticize Shakespeare himself (although again, this version is a Frankenstein version, not a complete one), but so many scenes just go on and on, and certain characters feel completely superfluous to be spending so much undue time on them, let alone to get such big name actors to play them (#justiceforrichardattenburough). By the time we get to the Gravedigger and Osric, it's like, can we please just get to the point and move on? Expository scenes suffer the most, as not only are they extremely long, they're oftentimes supplanted with jarring flashbacks that just get in the way of the scene. In fact, while most of the film is often done in very long takes (and done quite well), other scenes have these jarring cuts that genuinely feel like they're put there not for the sake of the scene, but to hide flubs and mistakes. It's a stain on what's otherwise a pretty ambitious production.\n\nOh God, this review ended up feeling as long as the movie. But that just goes to show that it inspired a strong reaction in me. There's still so much more to talk about, but I'll have to save it for another day. I don't know if Id recommend this as anyone's first foray into Hamlet. I definitely would NOT recommend this be someone's first ever Shakespeare unless they're good with words and/or willing to sit down for 4 hours or split it up into several viewings. And yet, I am glad I saw it, mostly for it's setting and performances. While I still feel there's more to dig into with the text, Branagh made a version that is both accessible and almost manages to live up to such an enormous legacy. And whatever this film's faults, that's a hell of an achievement.",

But as he stated in the scene, he knows her well enough to know (or just assumes the worst outcome from his own end) that she would get mad that he doesn\u2019t want her to be apart of the things he does alone. Also she calls him wanting to hangout with his friends more than spending time with his family is worse than cheating, and that him not doing things with her like going to see a Spider-Man movie together is \u201cmean\u201d.\n\nWhen we have so much stuff going on in our lives that we need to tackle like with work, family along with other responsibilities on our plate.

His desire for alone time is relatable, but the way he handled it was wrong, so no I\u2019m not defending his lying! Communicating your values with your partner and making sure you\u2019re on the same page is very important.\n\nIt\u2019s wild to me how people on the internet seem to think that understanding where someone is coming from, is equivalent to thinking they\u2019re also in the right.",
