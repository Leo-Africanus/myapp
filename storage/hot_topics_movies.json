        "content": "Hi Reddit. I'm Eric Lin. I directed ROSEMEAD, which stars Lucy Liu, Lawrence Shou, Orion Lee, Jennifer Lim, Madison Hu, and James Chen. It opens nationwide and in Canada this weekend 1/9.\n\nROSEMEAD is the first feature I've directed though I've shot many films as a cinematographer. Some of those films include HEARTS BEAT LOUD, THE SOUND OF SILENCE, I SMILE BACK, EQUITY, and THE EXPLODING GIRL.\n\n**ROSEMEAD's synopsis:**\n\nInspired by the harrowing true story, Lucy Liu transforms in a riveting, career-redefining performance as an ailing woman who takes drastic measures to protect her troubled teenage son (Lawrence Shou). As his dark obsessions grow and time runs out, she is forced to make impossible choices: how far will she go and what is she willing to sacrifice? Set against the simmering tensions of a Chinese American community, ROSEMEAD is a gripping portrait of a family pushed to the edge.\n\n**Watch the trailer here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD](https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD)\n\nIt's a story about the desperate need for connection and it's a film that was meant to be seen and shared with other people. Please check it out in theaters this weekend.\n\nI'll be back on Tuesday 1/13 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to chat.\n\nAsk me anything! Talk to you all on Tuesday.",

Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna are literal mirror images ,both hyper professional, both lonely as hell, both living by impossible codes. By the coffee shop scene you're like \"wait, I want Neil to escape with Eady , but I ALSO want Vincent to finally catch the one guy who matches him.\" \n\nIt's strangely uncomfortable and thrilling , like the film is forcing you to hold two opposing desires in your head simultaneously. The tragic ending lands so hard precisely because you've been emotionally invested in both men. There's no clean victory; whoever \"wins,\" something valuable is lost.\n\n",

The doors on the floor, walls and ceiling lead to other identical rooms, some of which have deadly traps in them.\n\nThe first one is the classic. Characters named after the prisons that reflect their personalities (Leaven, Worth, Quentin, etc.) explore the question of the responsibility of the individual as a cog in the machine of society and how one can become free. It\u2019s as though French philosopher Guy Debord had moved to Canada and wrote a screenplay based on his life\u2019s work while stoned; rather than shooting himself three years earlier like he actually did.\n\nCube 2: Hypercube tells the same story again but adds time-bending into the mix.\n\nCube Zero is the prequel which takes a Monsters Inc. type view of the people who work behind the scenes and manage the bizarre cube prison/experiment/thing.\n\nCube (2021) is the Japanese remake of the original that I just recently discovered. It\u2019s a pretty faithful copy of the first one, but the scenes that differ are incredible. No spoilers, but this is the only Cube movie to make me cry. See it if you can.",

I gotta say I think Menace is far better technical film and far more visceral movie from start to finish, but Boyz is a more polished script for the message they're going for",
        "content": "I think the entire point of Boyz N the Hood is to juxtapose the three characters and their ;ace in the hood. You have Ricky who is the overachieve but ultimately I the victim of being from the projects and that kills his dreams. Tre who doesn't fit into the environment and is trying to find himself as a man now coming up there. And Doughboy who despite having a brother who is a star athlete and star student and growing up in the same household he's shunned by his parents due to him succumbing to the streets and he's jow caught up in the system of the inner city gang banging culture. Ricky's demise and then the revenge for Ricky's demise to me encapsulates the entire movie. Ricky not being able to fulfill his potential, Tre being  scared to jump off the porch and is given a second chance at life, and Doughboy sealing his fate knowing he's caught in the cycle. I think as an overarching story its more fulfilling.\n\nMenace II society to me is a hoo movie if Martin Scorsese directed a hood movie. The Hughes brothers are very underrated technical directors and you can tell they were hugely influenced by Martin Scorsese. The movie is shot immaculately and I think it's just an overall stronger movie. The performances are more visceral and I think by the end it feels like more of an adventure so I agree with Ben in his assessment. I think if you're judging them purely as movies, Menace is the better movie, but Boyz has the more iconic message and was more important of a movie imo.  \n\n",

        "title": "How far would $187 dollars go in New York in 1988 [question based off the movie Big]",
        "content": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask or if discussions on old movies are allowed? (If not mods, I apologise and would be grateful for any suggestions as to a better sub) but I\u2019ve been rewatching this movie a lot lately and I\u2019m curious.\n\nI was born in \u201888 in north England which is when (I think, give or take a year) was when Big was set and filmed. My mum was a single parent then, before I was 2, surviving on disability benefits in a small north wales town with absolute sod all in it so certainly didn\u2019t benefit from the employment opportunities, transport, nightlife, status New York City does. I recently asked her, in the context of Baskin\u2019s pay (it\u2019s never said how often he gets paid) how far his wage would go, assuming it was weekly, when she was a single parent on benefits in 1988, and I assumed a weekly pay and rounded up Baskin\u2019s pay for the month to 4.3 weeks to get roughly $800/\u00a3800 per calendar month (which is how we get paid in the UK, usually).\n\nMy mum then told me that rent alone, for a one bedroomed, in disrepair flat in a poverty-stricken north wales desolate town was \u00a3299 a month alone.\n\nWhich got me thinking - how did Baskin survive on $187? Either he gets paid multiple times a week, taking his spoken wage to potentially double what we\u2019re told in the movie, or his wages don\u2019t make sense. Or I\u2019m ignorant (highly possible).\n\nSo, for those who were working age adults in 88, living in or near New York City, does Baskin\u2019s wage make sense or was it just a number they pulled out their arse?\n\nI know he was paying $17.50 a night for a room in the hotel which even by north Wales standards was cheap, and which alone comes to $122 a week or $526 a month, hence my confusion. Could you live off $55 a week after housing in New York of all places? Enough to even afford take out? (Luxury apartment he later upgraded to not included as I assume a hefty pay rise with his promotion in that).\n\nSo I\u2019m just curious if anyone can make the maths work for me or if it can be debunked as poetic licence.\n\nI know it\u2019s a very involved and somewhat silly question but the continuity geek in me really wants to know :)",

        "title": "Every Wuthering Heights adaptation gets one big thing wrong. Will this one break the pattern?",
        "content": "Whenever a new Wuthering Heights movie is announced, the same conversation starts again about casting, accents, age, or whether Heathcliff will be brooding or angry this time. All of that matters, but there is a bigger problem that almost every version trips over.\n\nThey turn the story into a tragic romance.\n\nIn the book, the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is ugly, obsessive and destructive to everyone around them, including themselves. It is not soft nor tender. It is two people feeding each other\u2019s worst impulses for years. That discomfort is the point. The novel feels like a slow emotional disaster where no one learns in time and no one comes out clean.\n\nMost adaptations sands that down. They frame it as doomed love, add swelling music, give the characters prettier motives and suddenly the story becomes something easier to sit with. You get longing instead of cruelty. You get passion instead of damage. The result is watchable, but it is no longer the same story.\n\nThat choice is understandable. A straight adaptation of the book would be bleak, repetitive in its bitterness and hard to sell as a date-night movie. But once you remove that harsh core, Wuthering Heights turns into just another period drama with nice clothes and sad eyes.\n\nI am genuinely curious what this new version will do. A version that stays honest to the book would probably divide viewers and annoy a lot of people. A safer version will likely look good and be easy to market, but forgettable in the long run.\n\nEither way, it feels like this story keeps getting remade because filmmakers love the mood and the setting, but struggle to live with what the story is actually saying.",
