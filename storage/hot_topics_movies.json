        "content": "Hey r/movies! We're Freddie Gibbs and Ryan Prows, here to answer your questions. \n\nSome info about us:\n\n&gt;Freddie Gibbs is an American rapper who has made a name for himself with a series of self-released mixtapes throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. Following his first properly distributed release, the Str8 Killa EP (2010), he began releasing proper studio albums, including the well-received Madlib collaboration Pi\u00f1ata (2014), Shadow of a Doubt (2015), and You Only Live 2wice (2017). After he issued the commercial mixtape Freddie (2018), he reunited with Madlib for Bandana (2019), and with the Alchemist cooked up Alfredo (2020). The latter became his first LP to crack the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and subsequently earned a Grammy Award nomination.\n\n\n\n&gt;Ryan Prows is an American filmmaker. He won a Student Academy Award for his AFI thesis film NARCOCORRIDO, and his cult debut feature film LOWLIFE (2017) was hailed by audiences and critics alike as \"a seriously nasty treat\". He also directed a segment for \"V/H/S/94\" (2021).\n\nWe worked together on NIGHT PATROL. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J\\_pMGZScB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J_pMGZScB8)\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nAn LAPD officer discovers a police task force is harbouring a horrific secret that endangers residents of the housing projects he grew up in.\n\n**Cast:** \n\nJermaine Fowler, Justin Long, Freddie Gibbs, RJ Cyler, YG, Nicki Micheaux, Flying Lotus, CM Punk, and Dermot Mulroney.\n\nIt's out in theaters starting this weekend via Shudder!\n\nAsk us anything.

I am kicking myself for not watching it in 1994 when it came out but I cant decide if I would have enjoyed it as much or its looking back at that 90s summer smogginess that has made me fall so hard and fast in love with it. I know Luc Besson's creepy reasons for the Mathilda/Leon relationship but Jean Reno's playing of it captured so much that feeling a pubescent girl might have for an adult man and how the adult can respect that while not tainting it and therefore keep it as the beautiful first love dream of a young girl. Just every scene including Gary Oldman's every sniff and movement as crazy DEA officer was amazing.\n\nUtterly utterly blown away. ",

Going to Blockbuster every weekend was a tradition in my family as I'm sure it was for many. I also remember in my teens going to Blockbuster with friends, and sometimes just hanging out and chatting about movies with the people working there. Was a lot of fun and met some cool people in the process. \n\nIt sucks that video rental stores are a rare thing these days. Last I heard there was just one Blockbuster left, but I don't even know if they are still around. I can't imagine there are many others still around. ",
