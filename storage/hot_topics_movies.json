Jack Black had to make a video begging them for the rights to use Immigrant Song in School of Rock.\n\nTo expand the topic, another filmmaking aspect that is well known in the industry, but underappreciated by the general public is filming during golden hour and how incredibly difficult it is to pull off. Setting up all the equipment for such a short period of time means you have to be extremely well prepared beforehand.",

I think it\u2019s a simple enough father and son movie, but its main message is a really important one for life in general and particularly parent-child relationships: if you love someone and want to be closer to them you don\u2019t make it all about trying to make them do things you want to do, you go and do stuff with them that they enjoy to do. And while it goes both ways, it\u2019s especially true for a parent to take the lead on this with their child. You\u2019re the adult. Your kid needs to know that the things they like are ok and a source of bonding, not separation or judgment from their parents whose approval they desperately seek.\n\nDon\u2019t know many other movies that convey the point as well as A Goofy Movie does.",

        "title": "October 10-12 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Tron: Ares' flops with just $33.2M domestically and $59.9M worldwide, against a $180M budget. 'Roofman' opens in second place, with a solid $8.1M. A24's 'The Smashing Machine' collapses a steep 69% on its second weekend.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/egqb42j5jyuf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2215a8d9293f221e2811a3e6058d338a7e22f45d\n\nThird time's not the charm.\n\nDisney tried again in making the ***Tron*** franchise happen, and the result was one of the year's biggest flops. Paramount's ***Roofman*** also debuted with solid numbers, although it also shows the difficulty of selling original comedies. And Jennifer Lopez had one of her worst debuts as lead star with ***Kiss of the Spider Woman***.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $64.0 million this weekend. That's slightly down from last year, when ***Terrifier 3*** opened with an impressive debut, and ***Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux*** collapsed a steep 81.4%.\n\nDebuting at #1, Disney's ***Tron: Ares*** flopped with just $33.2 million in 4,000 theaters. That's below ***Tron: Legacy***'s debut ($44.0 million), which is crazy considering this had so much inflation on its side. There's no point comparing it to the 1982 in terms of opening weekend.\n\nGiven that this cost $180 million ($10 million more than ***Legacy***), it's absolutely disappointing that ***Ares*** opened below it. In fact, the performance is eerily similar to the box office failure of ***Blade Runner 2049***: a sci-fi sequel released in October with a $180 million budget, but it could only open to $32.7 million. \n\nThere was a time for a ***Tron*** film, and it seems like Disney just waited too long to capitalize on it, and also took multiple wrong decisions. First, 15 years is way too long to release a sequel. Yes, ***Legacy*** released 28 years later, but Disney effectively sold the film as an original piece that would intrigue newcomers and also attract old fans. For many, this was probably the first ***Tron***, so ***Ares*** lacked the novelty aspect.\n\nBut there's a bigger problem, and it's that ***Tron*** is just not a very successful franchise in terms of box office. The original ***Tron*** made over $50 million worldwide back in 1982, but Disney was reportedly disappointed with its performance, which is why they didn't pursue a sequel. It wasn't until 2005, when Sean Bailey advocated for the film after it garnered a cult following. The result was ***Tron: Legacy*** in 2010, but even though it made $409 million worldwide, the high costs once again disappointed Disney. So you can see that the franchise has performed the studio's expectations twice.\n\nWhile ***Legacy*** also grew on to earn a cult following, Disney didn't really chase the audience. In March 2015, they finally greenlit a ***Legacy*** sequel, with Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde reprising their roles, and Joseph Kosinski returning as director. But just two months later, they scrapped the film after the failure of ***Tomorrowland***. And so everyone involved moved to different projects.\n\nUntil in 2017, Jared Leto began circling a new ***Tron*** film. It didn't fully gain traction until 2023, when Joachim R\u00f8nning signed as director, with Leto serving as producer. But the film's lack of connection to ***Legacy*** ended up hurting the film; while it could help a newcomer join the film without watching the prior films, it also lost fans of the previous film. Hell, even Jeff Bridges' presence was limited in the marketing and in the final product. \n\nThe film was also hurt by its Leto connection; he's not really well-regarded by audiences, and sexual misconduct accusations from a few months ago also signaled problem. Double-edged sword though; if Leto didn't advocate and produce, the film wouldn't exist. The marketing was also a mixed bag; they highlighted that the Grid was coming to the real world, when the appeal of ***Tron*** is staying in the Grid. And the film's mediocre reception (56% on RT) was the nail in the coffin. It lost ***Legacy*** fans, and it didn't really intrigue non-fans.\n\nAccording to Disney, 68% of the audience was male. Gen Z and Millennials were its biggest audience; 52% was 18-34. No interest in the people who watched the original back in 1982 though; only 25% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, the exact same score as the previous films. It has no holiday legs to hold well like ***Legacy***, and it's unlikely it adds new fans in the next few weeks when it loses IMAX and PLF. For now, a $85 million domestic total for ***Ares*** is likely. Very, very poor numbers. It means it will have less attendance than the original ***Tron*** ($110 million adjusted).\n\nIn second place, Paramount's ***Roofman*** debuted with $8.1 million in 3,362 theaters. This is director Derek Cianfrance's biggest debut, overtaking ***The Place Beyond the Pines*** ($4.9 million), although in fairness, he never had a single film playing in more than 1,600 theaters. The debut was above Channing Tatum's previous film ***Blink Twice*** ($7.3 million), but below ***Fly Me to the Moon*** ($9.4 million).\n\nThe budget was kept low at $19 million, so this is a solid debut. It simply shows how difficult it can be to sell comedies, especially when it also involves crime. Even with its crazy real-life story, which was plastered all over the marketing, the audience was very limited in giving it a chance. Even though Paramount tried to build buzz by sending it to Toronto, it was still a challenge even with great reviews on its side (85% on RT).\n\nAccording to Paramount, 53% of the audience was male, and its biggest audience was women over 25 at 38%, thanks to Tatum's presence. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is solid for a film like this. These kinds of films are noted for holding well, and with a weak October ahead, perhaps it could have a decent run. For now, ***Roofman*** should hit close to $30 million domestically.\n\nEven though it lost IMAX and PLF screens, ***One Battle After Another*** had a better drop than last week. It eased just 38%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $54.6 million, and it should continue holding well for the rest of the month.\n\nAfter its steep drop last week, ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** recovered by dropping 35%, for a $3.5 million weekend. The film has earned $26.5 million domestically, and it should finish with a little above $35 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped just 25% this weekend, for a $3.1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $172.6 million.\n\nSony released ***Soul on Fire*** in 1,720 theaters, earning an okay $2.8 million this weekend. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it'd be a surprise if it reached $10 million.\n\n***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** dropped 36%, for a $2.2 million weekend. With $128.6 million, it has officially passed ***Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*** ($128.5 million) to become the biggest non-English film domestically.\n\nA24's ***The Smashing Machine*** had a very poor debut last week, and its second weekend reflects that audiences are abandoning the ship as soon as possible. The film collapsed all the way to eighth place with a horrible 69%, which is a pathetic $1.7 million weekend. That translates to a very weak $541 per-theater average. A drop like this is not surprising, considering the film's divisive word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned an abysmal $9.8 million. With such a poor per-theater average, it's gonna lose tons of theaters this week. The film is now guaranteed to miss $15 million domestically, and could even miss $12 million depending on its drop next week. It's gonna be Dwayne Johnson's worst ever wide release. It's crazy that despite its high $50 million budget, the film is not gonna be in A24's top 25 highest grossing films.\n\n***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** dropped 42%, adding $1.6 million this weekend. Its domestic total stands at $13.5 million, and it doesn't have much left in the tank.\n\nRounding out the top 10 was IFC's ***Good Boy***. It dropped a pretty good 40%, for a $1.4 million weekend. Through 10 days, the film has made $4.9 million so far.\n\n***The Long Walk*** continues holding well. It eased just 39%, grossing $1 million. That took its domestic total to $33.9 million.\n\nIn 12th place, Roadside Attractions' ***Kiss of the Spider Woman*** flopped with an abysmal $891,046 in 1,331 theaters. That's Jennifer Lopez's worst ever wide debut, and it translates to a meager $669 per-theater average. Unsurprisingly, the film just couldn't connect with audiences. With little award buzz, the film is going to disappear quickly from theaters. Needless to say, it won't come anywhere close to the 1985 original's domestic gross ($17 million).\n\nAmazon MGM released Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** in 6 theaters. It earned $158,679, which is a solid $26,447 per-theater average. It's set to expand into around 1,200 theaters this weekend.\n\nA24 also released ***If I Had Legs I'd Kick You*** in 4 theaters. It earned $89,164, averaging $22,291 in each theater. It will continue adding theaters in the next few weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Tron: Ares*** also got off to a very weak start outside America. It opened with just $26.7 million overseas, for a very poor $59.9 million worldwide debut. It had very soft to mediocre debuts in Mexico ($2.9M), the UK ($2.4M), France ($1.9M), Australia ($1.5M) and Germany ($1.4M). Given its massive $180 million budget, the film's path to profitability is going to be insanely hard. Nowhere close to ***Legacy***'s $409 million worldwide finish. We'd like to say that this is the nail in the coffin for the franchise, but let's face it, we'll probably see another one in 15-20 years.\n\n***One Battle After Another*** added $15 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $138.1 million. The best markets are the UK ($11.2M), France ($8.5M), Germany ($6.4M), Italy ($4.4M) and Australia ($4M). It reaches its final market, China, this week.\n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** added $7 million, for a $46.3 million worldwide total. Its best markets are Australia ($2.9M), Mexico ($2M), Italy ($1.7M), France ($1.1M) and Poland ($1.1M).\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** has crossed $300 million overseas, and its worldwide total is now $473 million. Best markets are Mexico ($30.5M), the UK ($24.1M), France ($22.3M), Brazil ($17.5M) and Germany ($16.4M).\n\nWith $648 million worldwide, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** is now officially the fifth biggest film of the year.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* | Sep/19 | Sony | $3,252,578 | $6,671,082 | $20,171,082 | $45M\n\n- There's nothing beautiful about this. Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** has closed after just 3 weeks with an abysmal $6 million domestically and $20 million worldwide. A big failure, even considering its mid $45 million budget. A huge, huge stain in the careers of Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell, and director Kogonada. Even with the talent, poor reviews and word of mouth sank the film. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nUniversal is releasing Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2***. Despite the original's ending, Ethan Hawke is back, going full Freddy Krueger mode. Given that it surprised everyone by grossing $161 million worldwide, a sequel felt inevitable. But there's still questions over whether the audience is on board with a sequel, and Blumhouse's brand has taken a massive dive in the past year with so many failures. Will this save them?\n\nLionsgate is releasing Aziz Ansari's directorial debut ***Good Fortune***, starring Ansari, Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves. It seeks to bring comedy into theaters, with a fantasy angle (a guardian angel causes a body swap and shenanigans ensue). It had a solid response in Toronto (83% on RT), but it remains to be seen if audiences will show up.\n\nIn limited release, Sony Pictures Classics is releasing Richard Linklater's ***Blue Moon***, starring Ethan Hawke, Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott. With high acclaim (97% on RT, 78 on Metacritic), look for this to have one of the year's strongest per-theater averages.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Hey all - I recently rewatched one of my faves from 1997 and wrote a little review. Hope you enjoy it and if you haven't seen it, I recommend it! Thanks!\n\n[https://substack.com/home/post/p-176154732](https://substack.com/home/post/p-176154732)\n\n\n\nThis is one of my all-time favourite movies. Steve Buscemi plays a kind of loveable drunk, think Bukowski. Full of charisma, both in this world and not of it. There\u2019s a kind of Zen aspect to the liminal space occupied by drunks. So much charisma at times (as shown in the scene where he pulls a trick on a girl to down drinks, or on the bartender to get a ten-dollar note), but these flights of fancy go nowhere. He gets a free shot. The girl passes out.\n\nBeing a drunk always gives a feeling that life is about to come together, but the very thing that creates that sensation (the drink) also eradicates the chance of anything meaningful actually happening. So it\u2019s one big sensation. The downtrodden can exist in this liminal space potentially forever, as depicted by the old man who opens the movie standing transfixed. Eventually, this lifestyle takes away everything.\n\nFor other locals at Trees Lounge, they still have families, jobs, some connection and potential way out of the labyrinth, hanging by a thread they perhaps don\u2019t realise they are cutting away as they slowly descend into the abyss.\n\nWhere the movie shines is in showing the humanity, character, and humour that remain before all goes to hell. We root for Buscemi, who can never be anything but charming even as he drifts unemployed and chases women who don\u2019t make sense for him. We know he had a shot at a wife and a kid, but he blew it. There is always sadness in potential. We do not want to see him become the old man at the bar alone, even if we\u2019re aware that\u2019s what he\u2019ll one day be if he continues.\n\nEven Buscemi himself, in his dialogue, maintains the permanent-now detachment ever preferred by the alcoholic. He can see so clearly the flaws of others when he says he\u2019d never be doing this if he had a wife and kids, sidestepping the fact he possibly could have had those things had he taken a more measured approach to life.\n\nThis movie does not critique the dwellers of Trees Lounge or present it as pure tragedy. It\u2019s just a place in between life. There is a sadness in humanity, in the life unactualized and the potential unexplored. We could lament that, or we could feel grateful that hideouts like Trees Lounge exist for people to duck out of life for a time. The movie doesn\u2019t take a hard stance either way. In its lack of patronization, it achieves a realism unmatched in the alcoholism genre. One of my favourites.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve seen the entire movie again, I have a few other considerations. Firstly, the whole plot point of Steve making out with the 17-year-old, visiting his pregnant ex in hospital, and then ending at the bar stool in the exact seat of the old man who has been taken into the hospital and whose regulars say they will visit him soon all tie the film\u2019s themes together.\n\nThere\u2019s the illusion that bar life can go on forever. That one can evade consequences. That it\u2019s this permanent escapist thing, and there\u2019s comfort in knowing others are there and there\u2019s at least the familiarity of the regulars. Someone dropping out for health reasons creates unease because it forces a confrontation with the fact there are consequences.\n\nThe movie does not end on a hopeful note. Buscemi has a raw monologue, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel... except lost,\u201d but ends up on the barstool all the same. There\u2019s a cathartic release to his speech, but no change in his actions. We come away from the movie thinking that Steve most likely will remain on the barstool. Hopeless. Lost.\n\nBut the movie isn\u2019t purely depressing. It\u2019s a kind of celebration of Buscemi himself as a maverick. We\u2019re glad figures like him exist in the corners of life, because they have such potential, even if it isn\u2019t fulfilled and only exists in the dim corners of a place like Trees Lounge.",
