While it starts out promisingly, it seriously devolves in its second half into a surreal phantasmagoria that\u2019s more gonzo than chilling. If you\u2019re looking for a truly disturbing film about the dehumanizing effects of professional football in the corporate age, the one to see is still 1979\u2019s *North Dallas Forty*. \u00a0\n\n[The Direct](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100010147) \\- [Jeff Ewing](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jeff-ewing) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Marlon Wayans is exceptional, and well supported overall by the film's other players. Some moments do add confusion, but it ultimately comes together well enough to be a laudable experimental effort.",

        "content": "My vote would be Walter Harper. This guy was a total bad ass. He was the first person to ever summit Denali. After that he followed his passion and was accepted to medical school in Philadelphia. This is made more impressive because as an Alaska Native he was breaking racial stereotypes and barriers of the time (1920s.)\n\nAdd the horrific and harrowing tale of his passing it would make a summer blockbuster. He and his wife, just married, were on a ship traveling from Skagway to Seattle to begin their journey to med school in Philadelphia. Their ship, the SS Princess Sophia, hit a reef and was grounded during a storm at night. Although several other ships came to their rescue they couldn\u2019t help due to the weather, darkness and danger of the reef. The other ships watched helplessly as the SS Sophia slipped off the reef after a night of terror killing all 364 (to this day the PNW\u2019s worst maritime disaster) people onboard. The only survivor was a dog that swam to shore. \n\nHarper\u2019s life has a bunch of crazy things that each one could be a movie. The first to summit North America\u2019s tallest mountain, getting in to med school at a time when racial prejudice was rampant and normal and dying in such a dramatic fashion. But most of all, he died at just 25. His whole life in front of him. A massive loss of potential. \n\nWho else has a life story that would make a fantastic movie?",
