        "content": "Firstly, it is by far my favorite movie ever. The entire series. All three. I love every moment and every scene, and can pretty much recite every movie line by line.\n\nJust watching the movies, literally every single line is pretty much connected to the bigger story, and looking away/not paying attention for a split second can cause you to miss an Easter egg, a foreshadowing line, or important information. I love how engaging it keeps the watcher. The way that the series finish complete full circle, and ends on such a good note to \u201cclose\u201d time is amazing. Regardless of the obvious paradoxes that are in the movie, I think that every little thing is important to pay attention to. Even the little things. The recycled lines, the same locations, and same characters, all just fall into place.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any other movie that I have seen or can think of that does it like these movies do.\n\nEdit: just wanted to give a fun example of a little detail- in the beginning of the first movie, Marty met doc at *Twin* pines mall, and when he goes back to 1955 on Mr. Peabody\u2019s pine farm, he drives away and hits one of the pine trees. When Marty returns to 1985, the mall is then called *Lone* pine mall. Some people might have caught that, some others may have not.",

He really nails the part in this movie. I just remember him from 3 company\u2019s two, problem child, and bad Santa I guess. Anyone else have any recs for films of his where he played a more serious part?",

        "title": "Movies in which the protagonist clearly looks different than the script says?",
        "content": "I was watching parts of the Bradley Cooper movie *Burnt* the other day, and there's a scene in which he's speaking to a rival chef with whom he used to work, and the other chef asks Cooper's character (named Adam Jones) something to the effect of \"what happened to your angelic face?\" and Jones basically responds that hard living has taken its toll.  \n\nNow, setting aside whether anyone wishes to describe Bradley Cooper or anyone else as \"angelic\"-looking, in the scene itself there was actually nothing visibly wrong with Bradley Cooper's face!  The chef looked just like Bradley Cooper looks in nearly all of his movies, which is a handsome movie star.  (Later in *Burnt*, he is beaten up, and his face is cut and bruised, but that hadn't yet happened in this scene.)  Doesn't the director or anyone else make this connection?  I know that they don't want to make their pretty-boy movie star *too* ugly, but then couldn't they just tweak the script to say something else?  \n\nAnother example is *The Devil Wears Prada*, in which Ann Hathaway's character is repeatedly described as being overweight or outright fat.  Now, yes, she was working in the fashion industry, where body standards can be unrealistic, but the character at one point describes *herself* as being \"not skinny.\"  Even by fashion industry standards, there's no way anyone would reasonably call her \"fat,\" as Meryl Streep's character does at one point.  The character looked just like Ann Hathaway looks in nearly all of her movies, which is a fit, pretty movie star.  She and Emily Blunt even commiserated on set over how hungry they both were, because she *and* Hathaway *lost weight to play the role*.  ",
