The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said \"do you want to go to burger king?\"\n\n\"No Burbank\"\n\n\"Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?\"\n\n\"No Burbank!\" \n\n\"Destination set for baja mexico\"\n\nWow, so funny/s. I've seen this joke so many times but it just doesn't do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it's been so overused by this point that it's overstayed it's welcome.\n\nAre there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?",

        "content": "Despite the historical inaccuracies and Gibson's offscreen horribleness and dodgy accent, Braveheart is still a fantastic movie. There aren't any lacking performances and a ton of stand out performances especially from Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce and Patrick McGoohan as King Edward I.\n\nThe real star of the movie is the score. James Horner composed beautiful music to accompany the movie and every time I sit down to watch it I'm immediately hooked simply because of the musical score. \n\nThe film is filled with amazing scenes. My personal favorite moment is the ending when The Bruce has Murron's token and the camera pans to Hamish and Stephen...the look on their faces is just heartbreaking.\n\nit's a 8/10 as a movie...historical accuracy? like a 4/10 lol. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",
