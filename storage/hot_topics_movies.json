[98% Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lola_2023).\n\n1941, sisters Thom and Mars have built a machine, LOLA, that can intercept radio and TV broadcasts from the future. Legge assembles the movie from b&amp;w footage recorded by the sisters, piecing together an unstoppable documentary of how the world would change. There's a satisfying final twist.\n\nGreat Saturday matinee movie. I seldom gush about a movie, thanks for reading.",

Do you know any films like that? Doesn\u2019t have to be full on surreal like Lynch, any stories that almost feel real, but where the tone and sound and pacing slowly make you uneasy.",
