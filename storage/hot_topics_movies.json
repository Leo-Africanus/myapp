I had to pause and google it right then, after randomly choosing it to begin with, because the setup to the film was just too bizarre to be someone unrecognizable.\n\nBut what follows is just this entire, surreal, hellish adventure film with practical effects that blew my mind. Roy Schneider\u2019s performance is transformative. It\u2019s up there with Jaws for me.\n\nOff the top of my head, easily one of my favorite adventure films and as a Friedkin film, I like it as much as The Exorcist. Massive horror elements too, very genre-fluid. \n\nAnytime I consider a film a 10/10 I\u2019m so curious why others don\u2019t, just out of curiosity. To see that the exposition was everyone\u2019s least favorite part felt almost warm and personal to me, because it\u2019s so strange and really what drew me in. \n",

To give Sophie Marceau something to do besides crying and wearing pretty dresses? \n\nIt even makes William Wallace look bad because his whole motivation is about avenging his wife  and how he yearns to go back to her but then is quick to jump into bed with Isabella. I found it so contrived but then this is the same movie that had Edward II's gay lover, Piers Gaveston, being thrown off a Tower for giggles (that also never happened). \n\nNot every movie needs a love story. It's unfortunate Marceau, a fine actress, was tagged with such a thankless part. They should have just called Judith Godreche and called it a day.",

There are not nearly enough words that can explain how amazing this movie is.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s such a BEAUTIFUL film visually, just absolutely gorgeous! Great cinematography.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP), probably have this movie to thank for being arguably each of their greatest performances of both their careers. Hoffman was a wonderful treasure of an actor and a person, and he will be forever missed, but I MUST single out Phoenix\u2019s performance in particular, he is nothing short of perfect when it comes to playing characters who deal with mental issues, trauma and identity issues, such as the Joker for example. \n\nObviously I still have more movies to see from PTA, but I wanted to shout this movie out on here and share how much of an incredible movie this one is!",

Marvelous characters, biting political themes, haunting musical score, bizarre and interesting creature effects and design, and a clear disregard for genre conventions help to make it among the best monster movies I've personally ever seen and helped introduced a teenage me to Korean cinema. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/zdNqos19xSU?si=0440lMtkRsqSKauz",
