        "title": "Movies that were only made so that the studio could keep the rights to an IP",
        "content": "Licensed movies have been a thing for over a century, studios or producers make a contract with the owner of an IP to make a movie based on their property. As time went on, things got more complicated, especially since movies based on established IPs became more valuable. Sometimes, a studio would get the rights to a movie, but then not actually make the movie by the time the rights would revert back to the owner according to the contract. As such, sometimes a studio would make a rushed movie it otherwise wouldn't want to make just so that they can keep the rights, either so that they can make a better and more profitable movie later, so that they can then renegotiate or sell the rights to someone else, or just out of spite because they don't want another studio to get the rights.\n\nOne of the most infamous cases of this is with the Fantastic Four, it happened to it twice. In the 90s, Constantin Films made a rushed Fantastic Four movie just so that they could keep the rights, but never had any real intention of promoting it or even releasing it, because the contract only said the movie had to get made, not that that it had to be released. Over 20 years later, Fox would similarly make a bad Fantastic Four movie solely so that they could keep the rights and prevent Disney/Marvel Studios from using the property. Not that it mattered since a few years later Disney would simply buy Fox.\n\nA much older case is The Hobbit. A producer had the film rights to Tolkien's work, but couldn't get a proper movie made in time before the contract expired. As such, they made 12-minute \"animated\" film (actually just picture book drawings with minimal movement and narration) based on The Hobbit and showed it once in a small theatre in Manhattan, thus preserving the rights. Tolkien would have to pay him 100,000 dollars to get the rights back. It has to be [seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnVL1Y2src) to be believed.\n\nAnd then there's Dick Tracy. Ever since the 1990 film, Warren Beatty has kept the film rights to Dick Tracy. Every few years, he releases a short \"film\" or TV special that's basically just him dressed up as Dick Tracy talking in order to meet the minimum requirements to keeping the rights to the IP. He just doesn't want anyone else to have the rights as long as he lives it seems.\n\nSo what other movies were made solely so that someone could keep the rights to an IP longer?",

It reminded me a bit of Eighth Grade, Kids (to a small extent), Mid 90s, and even Pen15 at times. The soundtrack was on point worked very well. The AIM scenes, especially cursing at Smarter Child, are pretty much everyone who used AIM as a teen/kid. \n\n  \n",

Swinton and Stormare give great off-kilter performances and even Keanus acting wasn\u2019t distracting. And he had more dialogue in this one than most of his movies. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading the comics and if you ignore relocating from the UK, it\u2019s pretty true to the character for a Hollywood adaptation. Looking forward to part 2 now. ",

Last weekend I showed my 11 year old Erroll Flynn as Robin Hood and he talked about it all week!\n\nSo Reddit: movies, from any era, with unambiguously heroic good guys - does the right thing, is charming, fights for what's good.

        "content": "I think the character needed to be played that way. Theatrical, mannered, self-absorbed. This was a woman who lived in the past and was a star in the Silent era where expression was everything so she was constantly \"acting\" to keep going. \n\nOne scene did strike me as showing Norma has a bit of self-awareness. When she breaks down in her visit to her old studio and everybody compliments her. She almost can't believe they acknowledge her but we also see how much she yearns for her glory days. Deep down, she knows she's a has-been. \n\nNorma gets a bad rep for what she does but I think Joe Gillis is the bad guy. He purposefully uses a clearly mentally unstable woman in the hope she'll help him out in the end and when he realizes she is of no use, he falls for Betty and tries to dump Norma, throwing in her face she's too old for him. \n\nIt doesn't excuse Norma killing Joe but this is not a sane woman and he poked the bear. He could have left when he wanted to. He just didn't want to lose his comforts.",

Still, Christoph Waltz is always a win in my book, so there's that.\n\nWhat has me stumped ever since yesterday is a music fragment from the last scene of the movie, right before the credits. It's an instrumental piece that sounds pretty much like a slow-paced acoustic rendition of Erasure's 'Oh L'amour'. But neither on the IMDb page (which completely lacks the soundtrack/score part), nor the Wikipedia entry for the movie are of any help. Even using an LLM chat bot and throwing the same question in different phrasing at it for the better part of an hour didn't get a result. So to any movie and 80s music afficionados in this subreddit: Did I hear that sound bit somewhat correctly or no?\n\nI watched it on Amazon Prime, time code for the musical cue is 1:27:38. It's about 50 seconds long.",
