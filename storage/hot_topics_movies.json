        "content": "I just haven't seen this mentioned in discussions.   \n  \nIn this film, humans are killer bees.\n\nMichelle says that modified humans were created in a lab, and they were stronger but also more violent. These modified humans escaped the lab and interbred with other humans, spreading their violent genes.   \n  \nThis is what happened in real life with killer bees. Killer bees were created in a lab by hybridizing african and european bees, hoping to make a more productive, heat tolerant bee. Instead they created an extremely aggressive bee that escaped the lab and interbred with other bees (and replaced other bees).   \n  \nKiller bees sting easily and aggressively, but they still lose their stinger and die when they do. So they are more aggressive, but they kill themselves with their aggression. Their aggression also leads people to euthanize whole hives if they think hybridization is occurring, and it leads people in general to be more afraid of bees. \n\nTeddy is a killer bee. He is unusually aggressive and violent, and through his violence he has doomed himself and his whole hive (earth).   \nTeddy is a literal beekeeper as well as being a bee. He cares for his real bees and maintains their living space, but he is also their master.   \nMichelle is a metaphorical bee (queen bee) and a metaphorical beekeeper as well, and humans are her bees.   \nTeddy stung his beekeeper (Michelle) and was harming other bees, so she euthanized the hive. \n\nObviously, Teddy is depicted as a worker bee in the film. Michelle's company is vast, and she is the queen. Meanwhile, Teddy just works in packaging / shipping and has never even seen her in person before.   \nMichelle said that she admires that bees that do their duty and fulfill their roles no matter the adversity facing them. Teddy has suffered great adversity, but he is not fulfilling his duty / role in society.  \n  \nTeddy is relatively respectful to Michelle when he learns she is royalty, showing that he values this kind of hive hierarchy, maybe the way a bee would. However, he never recognizes her as *the* queen. The film mentions that in colony collapse disorder, bees reject or abandon the queen, and it leads to the colony collapsing. He abandoned his duties and attacked the queen, leading to the colony to collapse. \n\nIn this film, earth is also a literal colony, since andromedans came from elsewhere and created humans to populate the earth. They are not native, and are colonizing it. ",

It may have been the first R-rated movie I watched so maybe I'm a bit biased, but is there anything this movie gets wrong? I know the rest of the franchise didn't review as well, although I remember really liking 4. Maybe I'm posting something universally understood and I'm just late the game lol, but hot damn if this movie isn't good.",

        "title": "Burn After Reading: probably the funniest deconstruction of ego and self importance",
        "content": "I\u2019m a massive Coen brothers fan so even I\u2019m surprised how long it took me to actually watch Burn After Reading. Unfortunately sandwiched between the cynically incredible No Country for Old Men and the Job like epic of A Serious Man, BAR is even by the Coens standards a bit odd. \n\nIt\u2019s also fucking hilarious \n\nThe story of a volatile low level CIA analyst who after being faced with a demotion due to a (not at all well hidden) drinking problem decides to quit and start writing his memoirs only to find his wife is divorcing him whilst she\u2019s having an affair with a paranoid Treasury department officer, only to THEN have his memoirs unintentionally stolen by two dimwitted gym employees who believe the disc it\u2019s on contains government secrets after sed wife decided to copy his financial records and the disc was accidentally left at sed gym, it\u2019s definitely a twisting narrative with a lot of important characters that play a role. \n\nBut what makes it hilarious is that, though in a conventional espionage this would make for a taut, tense, even dark thriller of multiple secretive players trying to double cross each other (not saying that doesn\u2019t happen here but still), in Burn After Reading it ultimately doesn\u2019t mean anything, literally. \n\nWhilst the macguffin of the CD containing the information is important to several of the characters for varying reasons, the key is that it actually isn\u2019t important to pretty much everyone else. Osborne (the analyst) is in fact so so low down the totem pole of the CIA that even the director of the organisation barely cares that the supposed \u201cclassified information\u201d is attempting to be sold to the Russian embassy (an extra joke is that Osborne was an analyst for the Balkan region so the Russians additionally wouldn\u2019t care even if it was meaningful).\n\nHowever because, with the possible exception of Osbornes wife who was only using it for divorce leverage, everyone else is placing high importance on the disk, namely, THEY think it\u2019s so valuable, it shows just how badly their own egos play against them. It leads to several somewhat unexpected deaths, multiple profanity laden tirades and a very curious chair. \n\nThe added elements of a tradition spy thriller score at points (pointedly when they\u2019re doing something insanely stupid) also helps to really sell the joke, because they\u2019re so much trying to fill the importance of this thing when really none exists. \n\nI think Burn After Reading is a great example of deflating humour really nailing it. Whilst the setups and the situations are themselves hilarious, what makes it funny is how high stakes and important the situation seemingly are to the central players, only to realise that no one else actually cares. It\u2019s the style of humour that the Coens have perfected and is well worth a watch.\n\nAlso Brad Pitt steals the show ",
