        "content": "We all know that historical movies are rarely entirely accurate to history, creative liberties are taken to make the story more streamlined and interesting, or to just make things look cool. And sometimes the creators didn't bother doing the research about everything so mistakes happened. But sometimes, the reason why the the movie isn't historically accurate is because the creators are deliberately trying to tell a specific narrative of history that doesn't correspond with the facts, it wants audiences to believe the revisionist narrative being told, basically propaganda.\n\nProbably the most infamous example of this would be The Birth of a Nation, a movie that tells a very biased and very racist narrative about reconstruction after the American Civil War, and was one of many movies that helped spread the \"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\" myth. Specific narratives about the American Old West were also spread by old Westerns, telling a sanatized version of history of \"noble pioneers\" against \"savage indians\". \n\nSo what movies were historically inaccurate not because of story reasons or mistakes, but because the creators deliberately got history wrong for the sake of spreading a narrative?",

I've probably seen it at least 5 times, which feels kind of strange, given that it's not exactly the cheeriest movie in the world.",

People thought the movies were going to be awful. Problems with special effects and editing. Conflicts with the producers. Directors having a heart attack because of the stress. But those movies became huge box office success\n\nHas there been any recent movie that went through this? Production hell, but turned into a huge box office success? Or do the hollywood directors get whatever they want nowadays? Or are movies nowadays not as ambitious that would have production hell?",

        "content": "one of the movies that i watched all the time when i was a little tike was 1999's the adventures of elmo in grouchland. i watched it at least twice a week when i was super little.\n\nin 2019, while i was at my local goodwill with my father to pick out some clothes for my senior pictures, i was browsing the home video section and came across a DVD for the adventures of elmo in grouchland. out of nostalgia, i decided to buy it and pop it into my blu ray player to see how it holds up.\n\nit was ok. of the two sesame street movies, i prefer follow that bird. however, elmo in grouchland is still not a terrible movie. the muppeteers are great as always, there's some good songs, mandy patankin is clearly having the absolute time of his life playing huxley, and there are some funny jokes within it. however, like most movies, there are some problems. and, in my opinion, one of the big ones is who it completely botches it's moral.\n\nthe moral of elmo in grouchland is that being selfish is bad. this is a typical moral in children's media. however, the way the movie goes about teaching it sucks.\n\nfor starters, the inciting incident is elmo demanding that zoe give him his blanket back which results in a bunch of shit happening that leads to elmo going to grouchland to retrieve his precious blanket. now, the movie clearly wants us to see elmo as in the wrong and zoe as in the right. however, zoe took elmo's blanket without asking after elmo went through the trouble of cheering her up because her father couldn't take her to the zoo, and then refused to give it back after elmo asked for it back and even pulled it away, resulting in the blanket tearing. did elmo overreact by yelling at zoe and telling her that she's not his friend anymore? sure. but that doesn't change the fact that zoe is hardly blameless here and elmo is more then justified in being upset.\n\nand then, there's the clear parallel that the movie is trying to draw between elmo and huxley. huxley is a douchebag who takes the property of grouchland's citizens. and the movie is very clearly trying to make elmo and huxley mirrors for each other. the most obvious example of this is when elmo encounters the queen of trash. she thinks that elmo is huxley and, after elmo rants about how he's not and how he wants his blanket back, the queen of trash says \"well, you sure sound like huxley\". this causes elmo to have a heel realization that causes his to realize that he was wrong. here's the thing though. huxley was taking other people's property. meanwhile, elmo's blanket legitimately WAS his and he's justified in wanting it back. to quote the show that this movie is spun off from \"one of these things is not like the other\".\n\nlook, i understand what this movie was trying to do. teaching kids not to be selfish is a very important lesson. however, the way this movie does it is all wrong.

Which terrible films could be saved by being rewritten with another genre's hallmarks? \n\nMaybe some of these twisted premises already exist?\n\n",
