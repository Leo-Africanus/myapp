        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for moments in movies where a random, unnamed background character - a soldier, bystander, worker, etc. - suddenly does something heroic or deeply human.\n\nNot the clich\u00e9 \u201credshirt\u201d stuff where they die for shock value or a quick joke, but when the film actually treats them as real people, even if it\u2019s just for a few seconds. Maybe they stand up when everyone else hesitates, or stay behind to hold a line, or help someone escape - even though we\u2019ll never learn their name.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about them dying, really. Sometimes the best ones are when they don\u2019t: they just make a choice to act bravely and keep going. Like they step out of the background, do something meaningful, and then quietly fade back into the world.\n\nI also love when a main character is struggling alone, and a few strangers step up to help - not in a way that turns them into new sidekicks or \u201cimportant\u201d characters, but just people who decide to stand alongside them for a bit. Those moments of shared courage between strangers hit really deep for me.\n\nI can\u2019t fully explain why, but these little glimpses of anonymous heroism often hit me way harder than the big \u201cmain hero saves the day\u201d scenes. Maybe because it feels truer - like the movie suddenly remembers that everyone in its world has their own story and potential for bravery.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? And what are your favorite examples of these kinds of moments? I would love to find new movies/shows with these premises (obviously, not just to watch one scene but to me I feel like the writers really know what they're doing if they include this)",

She sank into that role.\n\nKeith Williams Richards, one of the goons from Uncut Gems is intimidating as shit too, and the casting department found him on the NY subway. Hell, you could even consider Julia Fox at that time a non-actor.\n\nNikki Reed in Thirteen is pretty exceptional as well. Co-starring with an Oscar winner in a semi-autobiographical film she wrote - knocked it out of the park, \n\nEdit: Equally interested in people who started off as non-actors and parlayed it into a career, like the cast of KIDS.

        "content": "People often complain that people are \"too sensitive\" and you can't get away with certain things these days, but I see the opposite. In more recent times, movies get to do and say things that movies of yesteryear could never dream of due to censorship, in particular the Hays Code. The MPPA ratings system also used to be a lot stricter on certain things.\n\nA long time ago, you couldn't get away with showing an interracial relationship out of fear of offending bigots, now you can. You couldn't get away with two gay characters kissing out of fear of offending bigots and/or getting an R-rating or even an X/NC-17 rating, now you can. You couldn't depict gay characters even existing in a kid's movie out of fear of offending bigots and/or getting a rating not suitable for kids, now you can.\n\nSo what other things would get censored in older movies that are now commonly accepted?",

It features Jeff Daniels reprising his role of \"Harry Dunne\" from Dumb and Dumber. In the video, Harry falls and gets a Jack-o'-lantern stuck on his head. In his struggle to get it off, he foils a bank robbery and becomes a media sensation. However, he is unfairly found guilty of the bank robbery and narrowly avoids being hanged (he is saved by the pumpkin, which is placed on his head before he's put in the noose).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nLt60MUv7AU?si=IgQQmgRIgA9mNfWL\n\nJeff Daniels was a gem for reprising his role for this slice of Canadian Music. Great actor, great character, great movie, great music video.\n",
