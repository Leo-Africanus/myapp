        "content": "#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K.

The costumes were great, and any scene involving the Coneheads' house were packed with details. This wasn't some low effort spin off, the production team put effort into the movie and the dialog. There are so many little gags, from Jason Alexander's toupee to Beldar's weird naked body, it's a movie you can watch multiple times and appreciate something new. And nowadays, it's fun to see all the cameos from a very successful SNL cast at the time. Dan Aykroyd holds nothing back. And when they arrive at Remulak, scene of them flying into the atmosphere still looks good today (unlike most movies today using lazy CGI).\n\nI still don't know why it was panned at the time. I know critics hate comedies, since comedy is much harder to pull off than drama, but the movie is much more than its contemporary reputation.",

This year, fans of all ages will experience the heart-warming sights and sing-along sounds of the classic film in a beautifully restored and remastered version to be released in 4K image resolution, courtesy of the precise work endeavored by the Walt Disney Film Restoration team.

I\u2019ve enjoyed them since I was a kid, and my love for the genre has only grown over the years. My mom introduced me to romance movies when I was young, especially Nicholas Sparks films, and over time, I developed a real appreciation for them. I genuinely enjoy watching the dynamic between two people falling in love, seeing their connection grow, and admiring the emotions and chemistry between them.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had a strong idea of what romance should be. Even when I was 8, I saw something beautiful in how two people could love each other, and that perspective hasn\u2019t changed. Romance movies give me that feeling of admiration, both for the relationship itself and for the way different characters evolve emotionally.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people, especially other men, tend to call me \u201cgay\u201d for liking romance movies. I\u2019m not, but it\u2019s frustrating that people assume that just because I enjoy love stories. It makes me wonder if a lot of guys out there secretly enjoy romance movies but just don\u2019t admit it because of how others might perceive them.\n\nSo I wanted to ask\u2014are there any other men here who genuinely love romance movies? If so, what got you into them, and what do you love about them? Would be great to hear from others who feel the same way!",

They talk. They sing. They even have their own secret cockroach TV channels complete with public access shows and cockroach porn. They decide to help Joe with his love life.\n\nI remember watching Roger Ebert review this movie and slowly lose his mind talking about how much he hated it.",

        "content": "Suspension of Disbelief is when we ignore logical thought to enjoy superhero movies, superhuman assassins, romantic comedies, animatronic serial killers, aliens, and the like.\n\nMost recently Ridley Scott's Gladiator II took me right outta the game.\n\nDid Riddley Scott really ask himself, what was the first Gladiator missing and come up with &gt;!SHARKS! Fucking Sharks. He really said we need great white sharks in the Colosseum! I have never jumped back into reality so fast.!&lt;\n\nMe and my husband paused the movie because we just had to take the time to digest what we were watching. We even tried to Mythbuster this to see if it's even plausible and all we could come up with was &gt;!that someone had to raise baby great white sharks. But everyone knows great whites don't survive in captivity. Was ancient Rome even capable of building a tank big enough to support multiple sharks. what about one shark? And if they weren't in captivity then fishermen caught them? and then transported them to the Colosseum? Nah. Not to mention, the next day the arena was bone dry.!&lt;\n\nI really can't remember when a movie irked me this much. I am very for suspension of disbelief; I WANT to enjoy the story. But that was just too much for me. So what whacky scene took you right outta the movie.",
