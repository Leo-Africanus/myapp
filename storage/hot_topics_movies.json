Joe Hisaishi's score just soars, it truly is perfect. \n\nIf you have any opportunity to catch this limited showing this weekend - don't miss this. It's a true work of art.",

This one still holds up imo.\n\nIt's no Jaws or Jurassic Park (This and Congo were movies based on novels by Michael Crichton) but still entertaining in its own right notably it's camp factor and the brutality we see at times. Kinda surprised they got away with a PG rating tbh.",

        "content": "This movie is perfect, to me.\u00a0\n\nThe movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth.\u00a0\n\nThe dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert.\u00a0\n\nTo be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming.\u00a0\n\nOverall, 10/10. I watch it every time I get sick, and it always feels like a privilege. I have seen this movie 50+ times.\u00a0",

It looked so good in on the IMAX screen, with the added bonus of 4k and don\u2019t even get me started on the sound and music with all the extra speakers, with them being higher quality.\n\nWhat are y\u2019all thoughts on it, is this experience universal with the IMAX screening of this movie?\n",

On first viewing, I thought it was a stunning send off for this era of the MCU and cried tears during Stark\u2019s death. On rewatch, I found the majority of the movie to be vapid, oddly paced fan service, and I hate how they watered the character of Thanos down to a generic, alternate version of himself. What movie did you have a similar experience with?",

It was about a loser who wrote poetry no one cared about until he wrote an extremely long erotic story that spread around the internet. People had it printed out on dot matrix paper and couldn\u2019t stop reading it.\n\nThe main character liked a girl whose boyfriend made him kiss her ass which he threw up on inside a convenience store.\n\nEventually he had a kid that he\u2019d take to a bar and force to drink whisky.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t think it was a good movie, but I watched it with a friend who was into watching independent film, and now I can\u2019t get it out of my head.",

We have our legal organisation called [stichtingBrein.nl](http://stichtingBrein.nl) they protect the law of Netherlands according to creative works like movies, music, etc\n\na few days ago, I asked them 2 direct questions:\n\n1. is it allowed to backup my own movies? They answered by e-mail back : Allowed. if for myself. Not allowed to distribute, with or without selling.\n2. If it is allowed to have a copy, then ofcourse it is also allowed to sell my original DVD/Bluray with the digital copy right? I said: \"the medium like DVD proofs I own the movie legally. They never answered me back. It is an area they don't dare to go into. I find this a pity. I have my proof. I have the right. I can understand why Brein does not dare to answer, because then big companies might sue them for lost income etc. So, they stand in between but don't make a black or white choice.\n\nWith other words, in the Netherlands it is \"allowed\" to backup the movie. It is a grey area.\n\n[stichtingBrein.nl](http://stichtingBrein.nl) has stopped a few companies who hoard up digital material from others to train A.I. online. So, to protect your own data, please open your data online for anyone but yourselves. Any NAS with data, that you open can be the victum of illigal usage. protect your investments carefully. Know how to update your computer software, set your firewall, router, and computer correctly.\n\nIf your country is allowing making personal backups of movies, music for archiving and self usage only, post a message, so everyone knows. Digital creative protecttion should be allowed, it is part of our human history.",
