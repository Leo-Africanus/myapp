        "content": "The Movie itself is pretty good. Not without some issues, but I really appreciate this thing swinging for the fences. One of the most legitimately beautiful films I've seen in some time with some strange editing choices that can't all be easily explained away as stylistic.\n\nIt's divisive for a reason.\n\nThat said... the ending should be one of the least controversial aspects of the film and online criticisms in spaces like this have me wondering if my whole face should be wrapped in a strait jacket.\n\nVAGUE SPOILERS\n\nIf you didn't know that there's supposed to be a follow up film... *maybe* I could understand having pure tonal whiplash. But even then... it's clear the Power Rangers montage wasn't the ending. This was more of a post-credits scene further expanding the world.\n\nBut even in the context of the film alone; it earns this supposedly hysterical idea. It's evident from the film itself that there are disperse communities in this post-apocalyptic UK and segregation would engender sociological differences in how they adapt to this hostile world.\n\nThis is Mad Max, post-apocalyptic world-building 101.\n\nThis particular band of roving, Sentai-simulating crazies isn't any more outlandish than an isolated doctor making a tower of babel out of human skulls.\n\nFinding the tone off-putting is one thing (it would likely have worked better as a post-credits scene overall) but I've seen many occasions of people stating that the scene put them off the film and the sequel completely, which I find to be mental.\n\nBut maybe it's just me. \n\nDownvote away.",

The screenplay and cinematography are fantastic, the performances are great (though I think Robert Pattinson might have been a miscast), and it\u2019s Timothee Chalamet\u2019s best role to date in my opinion.",

It is one of the most stylistically interesting and entertaining movies I have seen a while - and I\u2019m not just talking about Shakespeare adaptations here, I mean literally out of all movies.\n\nIt oozes phrenetic energy, swagger and sheer style in every single frame. The costumes, the sets, the lighting, the editing - you feel like watching an explosion of overconfident late 90s aura that\u2019s injected directly into your eyeballs.\n\nAnd the acting? I\u2019m just gonna say every single actor knew exactly what kind of film they were in and they deliver appropriately scene chewing performances. With young Leo dicaprio at the height of his twink fame, as well as Claire Danes as Juliet (who we all know has insane chops from her TV outings) - their chemistry is just fantastic. Everyone else in this movie is fantastic too (shout out to Mercurio).\n\nLike this movie might have been seen as over the top when it first came out, but I\u2019m not gonna lie it aged like a fine wine. I feel like it is probably more in tune with pop culture nowadays than it was even in the 90s (I literally wanna wear every single outfit from this movie).\n\nNot to say it\u2019s all just bombastic silliness - some scenes, like the balcony scene, feel genuinely sweet, and oddly ethereal. This movie has such a unique vibe (I honestly feel that euphoria was kinda inspired by it in terms of the atmosphere it manages to create).",

        "content": "With Scott's upcoming film, **The Dog Stars**, set to be released in theaters on March 2026, it will be the 30th film of his illustrious 49 year career, going all the way back to 1977. Ever since his directorial debut with **The Duelist**, he has directed some of the most memorable films in history. From the ambitious **Blade Runner** to the terrifying **Alien** to the Oscar-winning **Gladiator**, he has some truly great films in his belt. But ever since the Oscar-winning success of Gladiator, his filmography has been up-and-down. He has directed 18 films in 25 years since Gladiator, which is honestly really impressive, and while some have been good, others have not. **The Martian**, **Kingdom of Heaven** (director's cut), **The Last Duel**, and **Prometheus** (despite fans being divided of the movie) have been some of his best work, showing he has no intention of slowing down, even if he's reaching 90. But throughout that great work, there have been some divisive films at best and downright awful films at worst. **Exodus Gods and Kings** was a whitewashed, historically innacurate mess which fumbles its massive potential of retelling one of the most important stories in history. Same with **Napoleon**, and while it's miles better than Exodus, in terms of basically everything lol (expect accuracy, which Napoleon does a bit better, but it isn't saying much), it really didn't live up to expectations as an epic historical biopic about the French commander. And some others like **Robin Hood**, **The House of Gucci**, ect.\n\nI'm a big fan of his work, and I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well, and there will always be his critics. And the criticism he receives is valid, because every filmmaker isn't perfect. That being said, his legacy is undeniable, having redefined the sci-fi genre with Alien and Blade Runner and the attention to detail in his visual style being influential to a new generation of filmmakers who want to approach that same visual style as Scott. But what do you think? ",

Nic Cage is suitably unhinged, and the action scenes and production design are manic and over-the-top in a fun way. Directed by the people who brought the Crank movies, if you watched the behind the scenes they put their lives on the line to pull off the stunts.

She purposefully made David into a self-aware sentient being instead of the dutiful robot he was which then led him to become attached to her. And then, when her son revived and the brat started bullying David and then causing him to \"misbehave\", the dad was quick to decide in deactivating David. \n\nI'm of the belief David should have been deactivated all along. It was of no use to keep David \"alive\". For what? So he could spend years and years by himself, looking for a mother who never really loved him. Oh sure, she cared enough about David to not have him go to the factory but it was her conscience because she knew it was her own fault, not because she loved this android boy. \n\nIt's such a sad, tragic movie. I felt bad for David but it was a hopeless endeavor. The dream of him playing with Monica comforted him but it was all for nothing. \n\nThe brat human son had the family David never had.",

        "title": "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and how old comedies differ from newer ones",
        "content": "So I recently watched Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein for the first time as part of a Universal Monster movie watch party, and was surprised that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a spoof that made a bunch of jokes at the monsters' expense similar to modern horror comedy movies, instead I noticed that the scenes with the monsters were all treated seriously and played completely straight like they were from any of the previous Universal Monster movies. Only Abbott and Costello's scenes had any comedy, if they weren't on screen there were no jokes, and even when they were on screen, the monsters and other characters were still meant to be serious and/or scary. \n\nThis got me thinking, I admittedly haven't seen that many old comedy movies, but most of the ones I've seen (especially Marx Brothers movies) are similar in that regard. They feel like most of the characters are acting like they're in a normal movie, but then these comedic actors come in and make a lot of jokes. Basically, it seems to me that what sets apart old comedy movies to modern comedy movies, is that in older comedies only a few characters were meant to be funny, while in modern comedies everyone is meant to be funny.\n\nWhy were older comedies like this? What changed? When did this change happen? Or am I completely wrong and making assumptions and the old comedies I've seen aren't representative of everything?",

I think it\u2019s fun to look at this old article from my very old website, and I thought anyone interested in that landmark year of film might enjoy it too.\n\nDid I miss any legends?\n\nhttps://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_161in1999.html\n\np.s. please enjoy my circa 2000 edgelord website design which is still live and working because it\u2019s nothing but static HTML files.",

That makes sense as it gives more credence to universal derision. \n\nBut for this discussion I would use 5 reviews as a minimum. ",
