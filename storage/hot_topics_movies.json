        "title": "There are some wild entries on this list of obscure box office bombs",
        "content": "I thought I'd share this video because I thought this guy did a fascinating take on the biggest bombs in Hollywood. He broke it down by year and I've never heard of a ton of these movies, even though I'm fascinated by box office bombs (which makes sense because, you know, they bomb when nobody sees them so there's nobody who remembers them). \n\nHis description and the footage he shows makes me want to watch a lot of these.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZK8irOr5A0\n\nHere are the crazier-sounding ones I'd never heard of before:\n\nSEXTETTE - 1978 - famous sexpot Mae West's last picture. She was 85, deaf and disoriented. People had to hold cue cards really close to her and she seemed to have no idea who her co-actors were in what seems to be a plot where a young Timothy Dalton is trying to seduce her.\n\nHONKEY TONK FREEWAY - 1981 - at the time, the most expensive comedy ever made. Apparently it made no sense, but they painted a real town pink, blew up a real bridge and put a real elephant on water skis.\n\nKRULL - 1983 - apparently meant to be the next Star Wars, this bomb had a young Liam Neeson. This one stands out to me because I had a Krull comic when I was a kid and I loved it. I had no idea it was based on a movie. I kind of want to see this *and* read the comic again.\n\nTHE COTTON CLUB - 1984 - Coppola's first bomb? The studio took it away to recut it, someone was murdered, the entire thing was derailed by a FBI investigation and it took 36 years for Coppola to do his intended cut of it.\n\nREVOLUTION - 1985 - I feel like I'm having a stroke writing this one out. Al Pacino was cast in a period piece, but he refused to wear period-appropriate footwear so they had to shoot him from the knees up to hide his modern boots. \n\nNORTH - 1994 - kid Elijah Wood in a bomb that had the director asking critics to go easy on it. I'm pretty sure I saw Bruce Willis, Julia Louise Dreyfuss and Jason Alexander in the footage.\n\nMARY REILLY - 1996 - I kind of remember this one, a movie about Dr. Jekyl's housekeeper, which turned out to be a pretty boring story.\n\nLEGENDS OF OZ: DOROTHY'S RETURN - 2014 - I had never heard about this, but I'm just going to quote the video, \"A disaster on every possible level. Legend of Oz pulled in just three point seven million on it's opening weekend... It wasn't just a flop, it was a scam. The shady studio behind it strong-armed pension funds into investing.\"\n \nPAN - 2015 - \"Another year, another reboot that tanked. Studio execs pitched this one as a dark reboot with a Moulin Rouge vibe. What they delivered was Hugh Jackman, in eyeliner, singing Nirvana with a children's choir.\"\n\nPLAYMOBIL: THE MOVIE - 2019 - I can't believe I never heard of this Lego rip-off starring Daniel Radcliffe. Narrator: \"Critics called it the biggest box office flop of all time, but they just didn't know what was going to happen next.\" (Covid happened next.)\n\nCHAOS WALKING- 2021 - I have no memory of this. It was filmed in 2017 and sat on a shelf for 4 years. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley starred in this bomb that had the studio reshoot major parts of it (without the director) because test audiences had no idea what was going on.\n\nSTRANGE WORLD - 2022 - nothing noteworthy about this bomb except I'm shocked at how many recent films I'd never heard of. I expected to be pretty clueless about the ones from when I was a kid, not the ones from the most recent years of my life.\n\nLand Of The Lost was on this list and I genuinely like it. I'd heard about most of the other movies on the list because they're such famous bombs and you probably have, too.\n\nI'm not connected to the youtube channel, I'm just bored and needed something to pass the time.",

        "content": "Anyone who saw this movie as a kid, especially in the 80s, can probably remember how shocked they were when this movie ruthlessly killed off the bulk of the cast from the TV series within the first act, including having Optimus Prime, the main hero and symbol of the franchise, getting shot in the gut and perishing on an operating table. This is an insane and seemingly ballsy creative decision (imagine if \"Avengers: Infinity War\" had Thanos killing all the main Avengers in the first act), until you realize why it was done; to sell more toys. The film is a feature-length toy commercial and they were simply clearing out the old line to make room for the new toys. They just did it in the most upsetting way possible.\n\n\"Hey, kids, guess what? Remember all those toys you love and cherish? They're all DEAD! WE KILLED THEM ALL!!!...so how about buying some new ones? We got them right here!\"\n\nOf course, the joke is, they played themselves and not only made what was intended as nothing more than a toy commercial a memorable film, they also were hit with a backlash to Optimus Prime's demise that was so fierce, they eventually ordered the character brought back to life. (The backlash even spilled over to other projects; the similar \"G.I. Joe\" animated movie hastily rewrote a major character death to just going into a coma to avoid a repeat reaction.) Sometimes, the craziest movies can be made for the most cynical of reasons.\n\n",

        "content": "The Terminator (1984) has one of the best examples of a contrivance hidden in plain sight. Take two separate pieces of exposition from Kyle Reese. \n\n1) The machines had begun making humanoid infiltration units to sneak into human bases. The first of these had rubber skin and so were easy to spot. Later versions like Arnold were given real skin and other attributes to make them practically undetectable as machines (except to dogs).\n\n2) The time travel machine can only send back organic matter, so no laser guns and no naked robots. \n\nSo when Skynet first learned of the Time Machine and its limitations it must have thought it was Christmas! \u201cI just so happen to have a line of robots that are already covered in living human skin! This isn\u2019t what they were created for, but darned if they aren\u2019t perfect for this very particular situation.\u201d\n\nHad the delivery of that exposition been less skillful I would have probably thought it was silly for the clearly-superior machine forces to make a unit with human skin and bone teeth. But no, it took me decades to realize how lucky Skynet was that it already had units that were perfectly compatible with a technology that should have been completely unavailable to it.\n\nDoes anyone have any similar examples?",

As a lover of film, I always appreciate how a good film takes you on a journey for a couple of hours and makes you forget your real life problems for a brief period of time.\n\nAlong the way you experience great visuals, engaging stories, connect with characters, hear gorgeous music, and often times learn a thing or two about the world or human emotions. Sometimes there are themes that make you reflect and ponder over.\n\nThere is a lot written about the future of movies and there is increasing competition from various forms of entertainment for people's time. There are also reports that newer gens are not that much interested in movies as previous gens were.\n\nBut I feel movies have a place in the world and is a beautiful form of art and entertainment.",
