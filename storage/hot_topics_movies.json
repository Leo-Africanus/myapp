So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.\"\n\n\"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out the types of visual effects made with Unreal aren't necessarily bad. \"It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don't think it takes light the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface, scattering, and how light hits skin and reflects in the same way,\" he said. \"So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand.\"",

But a confusing plot, mediocre visual effects, and over-the-top acting might make director Christophe Gans' newest Silent Hill adaptation just as divisive as his first attempt 20 years ago.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-review) (50):\n\n&gt;Return to Silent Hill isn\u2019t the worst entry in this video game movie series, but it fails to accomplish anything that the source material doesn\u2019t do better.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/21/return-to-silent-hill-movie-review) (2/5):\n\n&gt;20 years later, Gans still can\u2019t figure out how to escape the open-ended confinement of gameplay, or even give it the forward momentum of a game with a mission.\n\n[Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/return-to-silent-hill-review-christophe-gans/) (12):\n\n&gt;Christophe Gans\u2019s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of Silent Hill 2.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/return-to-silent-hill-review/) (3/10):\n\n&gt;It makes all the sense in the world that fourteen years after\u00a0*Silent Hill: Revelation*, the best way to make this movie series relevant again would be to retell the game\u2019s best story, and with the director of the original film. But\u00a0with bad direction, terrible acting, and a world that has no weight behind it (especially since most of it was clearly made in a computer), this isn\u2019t the way to bring\u00a0*Silent Hill 2*\u00a0to the big screen. This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an\u00a0ugly, laughable adaptation\u00a0that proves that maybe we should\u2019ve never gone back to Silent Hill.\n\n[The Gamer](https://www.thegamer.com/return-to-silent-hill-review-opinions-silent-hill-2-plot-complex/):\n\n&gt;Return to Silent Hill isn\u2019t a bad movie. There are still some entertaining moments and scenes of great tension waiting for you. However, this nature of making things more complicated for the sake of it and the lack of nuance left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth: this should have been a great return for the series to the big screen, and it ended up feeling lukewarm.\n\n[AwardsWatch](https://awardswatch.com/return-to-silent-hill-review-christophe-ganss-belated-sequel-gets-lost-in-the-fog-of-lackluster-video-game-movies-c/) (C-):\n\n&gt;Return to Silent Hill never captures the smothering, oppressive dread of the game, mainly because it\u2019s a property with a premise built on immersion.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nDirected by Christophe Ganz:\n\n&gt;James\u00a0is devastated after being separated from his soulmate and receives a mysterious letter that leads him back to a town called Silent Hill, where he hopes to find her. However, he discovers that the town has been changed by some unknown malevolent force and as he delves deeper into the town, he finds terrifying figures, both familiar and unfamiliar. Doubting his mental stability, he tries to comprehend reality and hopes to stay strong enough to rescue his beloved.",

        "content": "Reviews are starting to come out for Amazon's 'Mercy'. Lot of people expecting this to be a dud but let's see... I'll update this post with reviews I keep finding.\n\nRotten Tomatoes - [21%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mercy_2026/reviews)\n\nMetacritic - [39/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mercy-2026/)\n\nReviews:\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mercy-review-chris-pratt-b2904577.html) - 1 / 5\n\n&gt;A baffling piece of work that happily swipes the mood and aesthetics of Hollywood\u2019s police state dystopias (Minority Report, RoboCop, Blade Runner etc), while presenting such horrors as an agreeable norm.\n\n[ThePragueReporter](https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2026/1/20/mercy-movie-review-chris-pratt-pleads-before-an-ai-algorithm-in-the-trial-of-his-life/)\n\n[TheGeekTyrant](https://geektyrant.com/news/mercy-is-a-tense-surprisingly-effective-ai-thriller-that-kept-me-hooked) \n\n&gt;I walked away feeling genuinely entertained and a little impressed. It is not a movie that completely reinvents sci-fi thrillers, but it delivers a tight, engaging ride with strong performances and a concept that keeps your brain busy the entire time.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2026/01/mercy-review-chris-pratt-rebecca-ferguson-ai-judge-thriller-1236691222/)\n\n&gt;All the technical production elements are first rate, and I guarantee this one will have you on the edge of your seat in its compact running time. It was shot for IMAX, and in a movie all about screens dominating our lives, this one is ideal to be seen on the biggest one of all if you have a chance like I did.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/mercy-review-chris-pratt-rebecca-ferguson-ai-thriller-1236477844/)\n\n&gt;Taking place in real time, Mercy mercifully moves along fairly briskly. But after it\u2019s over you\u2019ll definitely feel the need for a digital detox. While Pratt can be effective in the right vehicle (Jurassic World, Guardians of the Galaxy), he\u2019s very dependent on his athletic physicality. Watching him as he sits motionless in a chair for nearly 90 minutes, not able to resort to the humor with which he often peppers his performances, mainly serves as a demonstration of his limitations as an actor. Ferguson comes off much better, especially when she subtly reveals the hints of emotionality that begin to seep into her character\u2019s data-driven persona.",

There\u2019s plenty more but those are just some examples. (Btw these examples may be bias because I do love all those movies beyond just the title, but hopefully you get the point).\n\nAnyone else have a movie in mind with a title just simply draws you in or encapsulates an inexplicable feeling? Unfortunately not every movie with a good title is actually good (and vice versa) but I thought I would pose the question :) ",

        "content": "Always felt Ghostbusters II was a great sequel to an all-time classic like the original and I never got the hate some have for it, though in more recent times people have somewhat softened on it considerably. I've always enjoyed it as much as the first and consider it an excellent sequel. Equal parts scary and funny with a lot of iconic and memorable setpieces (especially moments like the courtroom and river of slime). Vigo is a terrifying villain and no doubt resulted in many scarred childhoods back in the day. It's at times arguably darker and scarier than the first and feels more like a full-blown Horror movie at times. Especially the impaled heads scene, which puts to shame a lot of R-rated Horror films in terms of sheer fright. But perhaps arguably the best thing about this is how the main cast from the first film all returned with nobody recasted. It really helps to give this film a nice sense of unity with the original.\n\nThe first Ghostbusters is an all-time classic and a tough act to live up to, but the second is also a great and memorable film in it's own right with a lot to like and enjoy, and feels like it nicely expands the lore. It always pairs perfectly with the original and both are still so endlessly entertaining and rewatchable for me. I'm happy to see in more recent times it's gotten something of a re-appraisal and is recognized as a good film in it's own right, and isn't maligned quite as much. I feel without a doubt the original classic 80s films are perfect gateway Horror and played an enormous role in me being a major Horror fan to this day.",

Does Wikus ever talk about how he is able to understand the prawns? After he starts to turn it makes sense that he\u2019s able to understand them but he was communicating with the prawns and seemed to understand them when serving the eviction papers.",

I always wondered about  the behind the scenes on how they were able to get the shots they did and what was improvised rain and what wasnt. Whats your favorite rainy movie that you felt they nailed?

My dad had recorded this film from the TV and said, hey, want to see a good movie?\n\nHe came in just as the credits were starting to roll, and as I started to sob. Patted me on the shoulder and said, \"Yes, awful isn't it?\" Then went away again.\n\nCan't fault him, I love this movie. It prompted me to read the book a few years later, and of course I cried all over again.",
