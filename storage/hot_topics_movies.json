From start to finish, it had everything: a gripping story, intense emotion, incredible direction, and an atmosphere that pulls you in and doesn\u2019t let go. The final 30 to 40 minutes left me absolutely stunned and deeply bitter. The performances were phenomenal across the board, but Lee Woo-jin, in particular, stood out he\u2019s now cemented himself as one of the most compelling and chilling antagonists I\u2019ve ever seen in fiction.

Also......DAMN did the second movie double down on drama and emotional moments!\n\nI'm pretty glad this movie is getting a part 3.........I just hope Carter won't be Babyface in this one \ud83e\udd23",

        "content": "There was criticism back then that the movie wasn't gory but I didn't mind because I feel the movie works so well as a martial arts meets Enter the Dragon kind of movie that it doesn't matter. \n\nSub-Zero is still a cool villain. I thought the fights were well-choregraphed. I thought Robin Shou was a strong male lead as Liu Kang and I'm even surprised MK didn't lead him into being a martial arts movie star. I thought Linden Ashby was pretty good as Johnny Cage: handsome, witty and resourceful. \n\nBridgette Wilson was okay as Sonya Blade. I found her believable in her quest for revenge and her fight scene with Kano worked. I do feel her subplot was quickly rushed out. The one thing I liked about the new MK was that it gave us more Kano and Sonya. \n\nChristophe Lambert was pretty good as Raiden and I loved Cary Hirowuri-Tagawa as Shang Tsung, reverential and evil until he drops the cloak and he's all buffed up and menacing. \n\nI hated HATED Talisa Soto as Kitana. What a waste.",

        "content": "I suspect it came from both parties. Gomer Pyle was already odd when he was introduced. He came across as infantile, didn't know how to behave within the norms he was in and ended up not being able to withstand the psychological and physical inflicted on his seemingly innocent mind. \n\nJoker (Matthew Modine) turning on Pyle was sad, yet, I could understand Joker's anger and frustation. He did his best in helping Pyle out, offering assistance, and yet, Pyle continually messed up, made mistakes, and Joker and his friends paid the price for it. Joker didn't have the foresight of understanding Pyle didn't have the tools in understand what was wrong and what was correct. Even after Joker beat Pyle, you could see he instantly felt guilty about it as he listened to Pyle wailing through the night. \n\nFull Metal Jacket is a classic, arguably my favorite Vietnam film, however it's mostly because of the 1st act. The 2nd act is still good, just not as effective as the 1st act.",

Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser's chemistry in the movie really helps it shine. To me, it's one of the better comedy remakes that has been done.\n\nThe movie also has a ton of quotable lines from each of the wishes he has.",

        "content": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. It was a relatively normal experience throughout the film until it reached the part where all the parties found the Fountain of Youth. I was excited for a big fight but for some reason, the power went out in the theater for several minutes. You can imagine the countless HUH and WHAT from the moviegoers. When the screen finally came back on, it was already on the part where Black Beard dies. As for my thoughts on the movie when rewatching it on Blue-ray with no technical issues, it was an enjoyable yet weak sequel of the franchise. Ian McShane was a badass Black Beard though and Penelope Cruz was a hot pirate.",

        "content": "There are plenty of big-time movies that has an awesome all-star cast like a lot of the films that were up for awards during awards season but there always seems to be a random film that has an all-star cast. With one of my favorites being Chef. Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. The only person that wasn't a super star was the child actor player the son. It was a great movie.",
