The camera pans to show the surroundings and all of sudden you see the poster that\u2019s still pinned to the log that his friend pinned up.\n\nI realized last night that it\u2019s the exact same trench that they charged out of half way though the movie and the same trench that they charged to get into at the end of the war. It basically went to show that during the war, neither side actually made true gains but rather fought from and fought to win, again and again. They fought over the same small piece of land repeatedly. Insane.",

        "content": "I had to pause District 9 as I was watching it, I was thrilled during the final mech fight scene. Invested so fully and realizing the stakes. Edge of my seat; if we're gonna get lame about it. I had to stop myself and the movie at that moment and realize there's been nothing quite like this since then and Blomkamp wasn't some schmuck.\n\nElysium came and went and no one really seemed to care much about it. I thought it was tightly constructed, had a great villain and a pulsive narrative that kept me excited. I'm biased on this one, I like it and I think it's overlooked. But again, I don't think there's any denying the energy of the directing.\n\nThen we come to Chappie, which was a truly odd screw up of a movie. Everyone seemed to get makeup done by different studios and show up to shoot this movie at different times. It is awkward and Die Antwoord are truly terrible. The sad thing is, Copley gives a strong vocal performance and there is a shell of a really great movie here but it's fumbled by baffling decisions.\n\nMy opinion is that he deserves at least one more shot. When he was up for bat for the Alien and Robocop franchises, I was I excited! Specifically because they aren't based on his homegrown ideas. Elysium was diet-Halo and Chappie was....just not great, both of those are pretty much based off his written ideas. District 9 was more of a leftover idea from the defunct Halo film, COMBINED with Blomkamp's vague futurism ideas.\n\nTo make a long story short; I think he's a great director and a lousy writer. In that sense, I almost thought of him as the next Ridley Scott. Think there's lots of wasted potential with him.",

        "title": "The feature directing debut of TV maestro John Wells (currently riding high off \"The Pitt\"), 2010's layoff drama \"The Company Men\" is unfortunately as relevant today as it was when released in the wake of the Great Recession.",
        "content": "This film didn't do much business when it came out (probably because it came out in the wake of the much more successful \"Up in the Air\" which covered much of the same ground), but Wells's story of white collar types dealing with the perils of unemployment after their company lets them go is a rather sobering watch at a time when high profile mass layoffs are all the rage now. Ben Affleck gets main focus as the hotshot exec whose life is completely upended by losing his job and eventually is forced to take a construction job with his blue collar brother-in-law (Kevin Costner). But Chris Cooper's subplot is the one that really hits home when viewed today; a company veteran who worked his way up from the floor to the boardroom and then is let go to find out there is no place for him in the modern workforce. It's hard not to watch him struggle and fail to find anything (a deleted scene even has him fail to get a pizza delivery job because that's for high schoolers and not a 50-something) and not think of those facing obsolescence in the age of AI. It's a well-acted drama (you also get Tommy Lee Jones as the top ranking exec who fights a losing battle to save the jobs of others), but it's very sobering to view in a time when so much is unsettled for so many people.",

The colors the acting the RAW ACTION, the cinematography,  the simple story, the minnimal dialogue.
