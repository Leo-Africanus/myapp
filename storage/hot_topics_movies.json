I'll be back at 3 PM ET today to answer your questions.\n\n**Bio and more information:**\n\nFrom Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy Award-winning writer/producer/director Larry Charles, COMEDY SAMURAI: 40 YEARS OF BLOOD, GUTS, AND LAUGHTER is a rollicking journey through modern American comedy, as he shares behind-the-scenes stories from his life\\&amp;#39;s work.\n\nGrand Central will publish Charles\u2019s memoir on June 17, 2025. To tell Larry Charles\u2019s life story is to tell the story of modern American comedy. Over the last 40 years, few comedians have been a part of so many iconic, beloved projects. Larry was one of the original writers and producers on the first five seasons of Seinfeld, executive produced both Curb Your\n\nEnthusiasm and Entourage while directing 18 episodes of Curb and served as the showrunner for Mad About You. His film directing credits include Borat, Bruno, and The Dictator, the comic documentary Religulous (starring Bill Maher), and Masked and Anonymous (which he co-wrote with Bob Dylan who stars).\n\nIn\u00a0Comedy Samurai, Charles pulls back the curtain on the making of his successful projects, offering sharp, never-before-told anecdotes about Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Bill Maher, Bob Dylan, Nic Cage, Mel Brooks, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, and Larry David, among many others.\n\nLarry Charles\u00a0rose from the mean streets of Brooklyn and the working-class housing projects of Donald Trump\u2019s nefarious father Fred, to become the director of\u00a0Borat,\u00a0Bruno, The Dictator\u00a0and\u00a0Religulous\u00a0amongst others. He directed Bob Dylan and an all-star cast (Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Penelope Cruz among others) in the film,\u00a0Masked an Anonymous\u00a0which he and Dylan wrote together. He has also directed numerous episodes of\u00a0Curb Your Enthusiasm\u00a0and was one of the original writers and producers of\u00a0Seinfeld. Larry is a Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy-award winner. Since the Malibu fires, he, and his wife and two dogs are vagabonds.\n\nBack at 3 PM ET to answer your questions!\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025) **87% (135 Reviews) -**  ***Certified Fresh***\n\n* **Critics Consensus**: Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this\u00a0Superman\u00a0flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.\n\n[**Metacritic**:](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/superman-2025/) **71 (42 Reviews) -** ***Generally Favorable***\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety (80)](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/)\n\n&gt;The super-busy quality of \u201cSuperman\u201d works for it and, at times, against it. The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That\u2019s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cSuperman II,\u201d \u201cThe Batman,\u201d \u201cGuardians\u201d). I\u2019d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cThor,\u201d \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d \u201cCaptain America,\u201d and the hugely underrated \u201cIron Man 3\u201d). Yet watching \u201cSuperman,\u201d we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we\u2019re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that\u2019s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)\n\n&gt;What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times\u00a0*Superman*\u00a0suffers from overload, much like Gunns\u2019\u00a0*Guardians of the Galaxy*\u00a0trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the\u00a0*Babe: Pig in the City*\u00a0treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran\u2019s) more hopeful vision.\n\n[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)\n\n&gt;Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman\u2019s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you\u2019re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it\u2019s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it\u2019s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn\u2019t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+\n\n[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)\n\n&gt;Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.\n\n[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)\n\n&gt;The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.\n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)\n\n&gt;Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.\n\n[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we\u2019ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world\u2019s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it\u2019s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.\n\n[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)\n\n&gt;From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.\n\n[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard\u2026 which are the best flaws a film can have.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)\n\n&gt;Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film \u2014 if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first.\u00a0**Grade: B-**\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)\n\n&gt;It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast \u2013 he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent \u2013 but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.\n\n[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn\u2019s signature sense of fun shine through \u2014 but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn\u2019t work.\n\n[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He\u2019s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.\n\n[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Yes, \"Superman\" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.\n\n[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn\u2019t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.\n\n[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)\n\n&gt;As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we\u2019ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.\n\n[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film\u2019s approach isn\u2019t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.\n\n[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)\n\n&gt;This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood\u2019s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush\n\n[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)\n\n&gt;The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.\n\n\\---\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n&gt;Follows Superman as he reconciles his heritage with his human upbringing. He is the embodiment of truth, justice and a brighter tomorrow in a world that views kindness as old-fashioned.\n\n**STARRING**:\n\n* David Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman\n* Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane\n* Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor\n* Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mister Terrific\n* Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho\n* Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern\n* Isabela Merced as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl\n* Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen\n* Wendell Pierce as Perry White\n* Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard\n* Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant\n* Alan Tudyk as Superman Robot #4\n* Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher\n* Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as Angela Spica / The Engineer\n* Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan 'Pa' Kent\n* Neva Howell as Martha 'Ma' Kent\n\n**DIRECTED BY:** James Gunn\n\n**WRITTEN BY:** James Gunn\n\n**PRODUCED BY:** Peter Safran, James Gunn\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY:** Henry Braham\n\n**EDITED BY:** William Hoy, Craig Alpert\n\n**MUSIC BY:** John Murphy, David Fleming\n\n**RELEASE DATE:** July\u00a011,\u00a02025\n\n**RUNTIME:** 2h 9m\n\n**BUDGET:** $225 Million",

For example, William Friedkin's \"Sorcerer\" had the miserable luck of being released in the wake of the unexpected phenomenon that was \"Star Wars\", but it wasn't helped either by a title that many found quite misleading. People who expected a fantasy film with that title were surprised to find it was actually a new adaptation of \"The Wages of Fear\" and that \"Sorcerer\" actually referred to the name of a truck. (Friedkin later said he got the title from the Miles Davis album and that the \"sorcerer\" in question was the hand of fate.) So while \"Sorcerer\" had a bad hand dealt to it already, the title didn't help matters any.",

To give you an idea of what I\u2019ve already seen, I watched Fractured a couple of years ago and thought it was really good, but I didn\u2019t expect it to mess with my head the way it did. Recently, I watched Straw, and somehow I walked right into the same kind of twist again, still completely unprepared lmao. I guess enough time had passed for me to fall for it all over again which made it even better, honestly.. Would appreciate it if there's no spoilers tho! Just simply the title, genre, or maybe how you felt about it will do. Thank you!",

Really, everyone in the book is terrible.\n\nAnyone else want to share?",

Next up was this one, Better off Dead. Which I thought would be another romcom.\n\nBro, what was this movie. It was unhinged in an incredible way, from the Airplane style jokes to the relentless paper boys, to the \"testicles all over me\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Lane killed at least like 3 people in this movie lol, and what was with the skiing obsession?! \n\nI need to look into the making/background of this movie because yeah wow, what the heck was that. And of course, endlessly quotable...\n\nEdit: while folks are commenting, any other Cusack recommendations? I'm definitely watching \"One Crazy Summer\", but I'm open to pretty much anything he's in that's also a good movie lol",

The ones that aren't massive blockbusters but just stick with you because of the story or the way they were made.",

You usually don't associate Robert De Niro with sensitive roles or parts which demand a lot of emotional gravitas yet he did play those parts and always accomplished those demands. \n\nIn \"Awakenings\", he plays a longtime patient, Leonard, victim of encephalitis lethargica, which placed himself in a catatonic state for most of his life. When he gets a (temporary) cure which takes Leonard back into a state of rationality, he's faced with being \"normal\" again however with the realization of the years he lost and worse, with the possibility he might go back into being how he was. \n\nThe cast is excellent. Everybody delivers a stirring turn: De Niro, Robin Williams (a brilliant comedian who could surprise you as a wonderful dramatic actor), Julie Kavner (solid support for Williams), Penelope Ann Miller (underrated actress who shares with De Niro the saddest scene of the film) and Ruth Nelson (fabulous as a elderly parent whose personal identity is unraveled when her son gets well and she doesn't know how to cope). \n\nA beautiful and engrossing \"based on a true story\" drama which will keep you interested from beginning to end.",
