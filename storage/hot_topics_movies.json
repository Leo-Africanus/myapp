        "content": "Just rewatched Whiplash and that ending hit different this time. Everyone talks about how epic the final scene is and it is but TBH it kind of cemented how much Andrew completely lost the plot by then.\n\nThe whole movie builds up this toxic cycle between him and Fletcher, and yeah, it looks like Fletcher is the manipulative villain while Andrew is just this ambitious underdog. But by the end, it\u2019s not that simple. Andrew needs Fletcher\u2019s validation. He\u2019s been so brainwashed that he\u2019ll go to any length for that one moment of acknowledgment.\n\nAnd Fletcher.. well he\u2019s a wreck too. He loses his job, his respect, everything but still clings to this idea that greatness only comes from suffering. In that final scene, he basically traps Andrew, tries to humiliate him and Andrew still gives him what he wants. It\u2019s messed up. They\u2019re not enemies, they\u2019re enablers.\n\nThere\u2019s no real \u201cwinner\u201d here. They both pushed each other past the edge. And while it ends with that incredible solo, it\u2019s not triumphant. It\u2019s tragic. Andrew isn\u2019t free..he\u2019s all in, and there\u2019s no coming back. He\u2019s chasing this impossible standard that\u2019ll probably destroy him.",

        "title": "'Havoc' - Review Thread",
        "content": "Director: Gareth Evans\n\nCast: Tom Hardy,  Jessie Mei Li, Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker, Justin Cornwell\n\nLogline: *After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/havoc_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [59/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/havoc/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-netflix-1236198216/)\n\n&gt;With Hardy in fine form at the wheel, *Havoc* knows what its audience wants. It also looks great, with regular Evans DP Matt Flannery\u2019s dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors. The setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night. The fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in Cardiff suggests there\u2019s lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in Wales.\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1842207/havoc-movie-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;To be clear: I love a good, violent action movie as much as the next dude, but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another. Perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better. Instead, it's just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion. By the time \"Havoc\" ended, I felt as exhausted as Hardy's beaten and bruised character. I suppose Evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality, but there's only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-1236375320/)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a reason big-studio producers looked to Sundance darlings like Colin Trevorrow, Rian Johnson and Jon Watts to handle their tentpoles: not because those guys are great at action, but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting. That\u2019s precisely where Evans wreaks the most havoc, ignoring (or simply not understanding) what connects us to such characters in the first place \u2014 and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy Netflix vehicle is dead on arrival.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/havoc/) \\- 6/10\n\n&gt;After years of waiting, it feels like \u201cHavoc\u201d was never going to reach the pre-conceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to. It\u2019s clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography (mainly due to Hardy\u2019s more than apparent changes in beard thickness), there\u2019s doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that Evans envisioned. Still, when \u201cHavoc\u201d hits, it only reminds us how awesome it feels when Evans gets to do his own thing. Even a flawed Gareth Evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today.\n\n[Empire - Beth Webb](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/havoc/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;There\u2019s also something refreshingly egoless to it; Hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head. Around him Evans utilities his full cast, throwing greener actors like Quelin Sepulveda, who plays Charlie\u2019s partner Mia, into the eye of the storm, armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive. The result is a throbbing, bone-crunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying, glorious flourish (you\u2019ll never want to see a fishing harpoon again).\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;Instead of elaborate exchanges of close-quarters strikes and counters, the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second. Despite the advanced choreography that Evans and Flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the *Raid* movies, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic.\n\n[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tom-hardys-havoc-review-the-action-extravaganza-of-the-year/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* is such relentless, hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist. Nonetheless, those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga, whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat. Disappointingly, Evans (who wrote the script) shortchanges Olyphant in a role that\u2019s barely one-dimensional and receives no stand-out moments\u2014to a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with Hardy. The director makes up for it, however, with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpses\u2014and set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass, splinter, and bodily debris\u2014that tips the material into sensory-overload territory.\n\n[Collider - Tania Hussain](https://collider.com/havoc-movie-review-netflix-tom-hardy/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* might deliver on its promise of blood, guts, and glory, but it\u2019s these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its self-induced chaos. While the vision by Evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler, it rarely lands with meaning, which also feels like an injustice to the filmmaker\u2019s incredible past work. Despite a top-tier cast and bone-rattling action to keep you engaged, the Netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution. It\u2019s watchable, even entertaining in bursts \u2014 but beneath all the bruises and broken bones, there\u2019s not much else to hold onto.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/havoc-review-netflix-tom-hardy-1235117850/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter) \\- B-\n\n&gt;Rote as Evans\u2019 plot might be, and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters *definitely* is (pour one out for Jessie Mei Li, whose screen time as Walker\u2019s new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story), he has a well-developed ear for ice-cold gangster speak, and he isn\u2019t afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance. It\u2019s enough to forgive him \u2014 and/or the movie gods \u2014 for making us wait so long to see him do it again.\u00a0",

        "content": "At the beginning of Casino, there's a voiceover of Ace where he says, \"When you love someone, you gotta trust them, there's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, that's the kind of love I believed I had\". \n\nHow did Ace ever trust Ginger as much as he did? He's a smart guy, and suspicious of everyone. He knew she was a hustler/grifter. And there are moments pretty early on where she blatantly lies to him or cheats him--when she takes money for a drink and doesn't give him change and says she spent it on some tables on the way back; when she calls Lester after their wedding. \n\nI don't get why he was so blind to her being untrustworthy to the point he gives her the only key to the money that might need to be used to get him out of trouble. (And I'm surprised she didn't take any of it before the end of things.)\n\nAm I missing something--why did Ace think he had the kind of love where he could trust her with everything when she never showed herself to be worthy of that trust in the first place?

Instead of chastising her daughter, Mrs. Phelan tells Hilly to \u201cGet your raggedy ass off my porch\u201d, as well as a few other choice words. \n\nAllison Janney\u2019s delivery (Mrs. Phelan) is stone-cold. Bryce Dallas Howard (Hilly) does a phenomenal job of playing such a repulsive character. \n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite scene where the protagonist or another character goes off on someone well deserved?

        "content": "*One year after her sister disappeared, Clover and her friends head to the remote valley where she vanished to search for answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they soon encounter a masked killer who murders them one by one. However, when they mysteriously wake up at the beginning of the same night, they're forced to relive the terror over and over again.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [61%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/until_dawn_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [53/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \\- D+\n\n&gt;Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.\n\n[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)\n\n&gt;Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \\[Using\\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \\- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop &amp; raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling &amp; dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\\*\\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\\*\\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \\- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. \"Until Dawn\" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, \"Until Dawn\" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.\n\n[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \\- [Manuel S\u00e3o Bento](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/manuel-sao-bento) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.\n\n[IGN Movies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/811) \\- [Chase Hutchinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson) \\- 5/10\n\n&gt;Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing \u2013\u00a0to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension \u2013\u00a0particularly in the way he shoots darkness \u2013 the lackluster script he\u2019s working with isn\u2019t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn\u2019t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema\u2019s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;Given that the game was co-penned by indie-horror icon Larry Fessenden (*Wendigo*), it\u2019s somewhat baffling that *Until Dawn* ditches his story in favor of something this run-of-the-mill and half-baked. Despite an under-30 cast that\u2019s perfectly capable of running and screaming when necessary (which is often), there\u2019s no personality to this pandemonium, its evil beasts generic and its relive-the-night structure under-exploited.",

She then proceeded to get excited about the \"new\" twilight movie with all the original cast. She showed this trailer to my wife and myself and it was blatantly fake so we informed her. \nWith that context in mind of both my wife and me being able to spot it, my wife today sent me a trailer for \"The Conjuring: Last Rites\" and she was convinced it was real. There are tell tell signs like clips from previous movies, completely unrelated movies such as \"The Woman in the Yard\" and most egregiously, shots of the cast, alone, just kinda motionless or the camera panning slowly. \n\nMy main issue is the people posting these having no indication it's fake, or a concept trailer or anything, just very misleading. \n\nI don't necessarily have a problem with their existence, creative liberty and all that, and with AI it give people a chance to easily put ideas out there, however, is preface that fake trailers, regardless of intention, should give the watcher the knowledge, easily accessible, to know it is indeed not real.\n\nAm I alone on this?",
