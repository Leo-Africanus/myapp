Martial arts expert Leroy Green (Taimak) seeks to achieve the 'final level' in his craft - the level beyond the dragon, beyond excellence. On his quest, Leroy falls in love with a beautiful singer and video disc jockey, Laura Charles (Vanity). Together, they confront a power-hungry record producer bent on revenge against the young singer, as well as a bloodthirsty egomaniac determined to fight and permanently defeat Leroy. This romantic story centers on the life and death struggle between the love of power and the power of love. Leroy must ascend to the final level, but can he protect Laura's life at the same time?\n\n**Secure your tickets here:** \n\n[https://www.iconicreleasing.com/events/the-last-dragon/tickets/](https://www.iconicreleasing.com/events/the-last-dragon/tickets/)\n\n**Trailer for the re-release here:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d\\_k36pNExKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_k36pNExKg)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAsk me anything!

It documents the role of costumed heroes from the highs and the lows, and on a meta level it matches how they were portrayed in real life around the time period\n\nThe minutemen are from the 40s, intentionally cheesy and from the golden age. They are introduced in a triumphant way at first, but the intro progressively gets darker, in a way that I find more effective from the goofy costumes\n\nDollar Bill is gunned down because his cape got stuck in the revolving door of a bank he was hired to protect, Silhouette is killed in a hate crime after publicly showing her sexuality, and mothman is dragged off to a mental hospital ranting and biting.\n\nThere\u2019s a really great in universe documentary the crew made called under the hood that adds to a lot of this backstory",

        "content": "I just watched Gladiator II, and there were quite a lot of things in that movie's story that just didn't make a lot of sense. For example, why did Lucilla feel the need to send Lucius away and abandon him after Maximus died? She said she was worried for Lucius's safety, but it didn't really feel like there was any immediate threat to his life. Then Lucilla just moves on and doesn't even give Lucius a single thought. Like really?! She spent the whole first movie protecting Lucius and worrying herself to death over his safety, then she just decides to abandon him for no apparent reason, and forget about him and get on with her life as if he never existed?! It just doesn't make any sense...",
