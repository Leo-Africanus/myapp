The Long Walk hits theaters on September 12. Ask me anything about the book or movie. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAtUHeMQ1F8)\n\n&gt;In a dystopian United States ruled by a totalitarian regime, a group of young men enter an annual walking contest in which they must maintain a speed of at least three miles per hour or risk execution. The contest ends when only one walker remains alive.\n\nIt stars Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Ben Wang, Charlie Plummer, Roman Griffin Davis, Garrett Wareing, Joshua Odjick, Tut Nyuot, Mark Hamill, Judy Greer, and Josh Hamilton. \n\nI'll be back on Wednesday 8/27 at 12:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\n",

She blew up with the original The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movies and then starred in Prometheus which was the first true alien prequel and now anytime a new alien movie or show (Alien Earth) premieres, every recap starts at the beginning and her character, Elizabeth Shaw, will forever be brought up. Alien was one of the best sci fi horror movies of all time with probably THE BEST creature design of all time and Aliens was one of the best action movies of all time and now Rapace is forever tied to this franchise. \n\nThe franchise is experiencing a bit of a revival with Alien: Romulus last year and the Alien: Earth tv show so her character feels even more relevant than ever ",

        "content": "I recently watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for like the fifth time and I never can get over Frances McDormands performance. It\u2019s spectacular and it never fails to make me emotional.\n\nOne line in particular always sticks out for me.\nIn a scene her and her son Robbie find the Billboards on fire. She goes to extinguish them but almost in a pissed off game on way. As Robbie tries to stop her mother she screams his name and the quick emotion always gives me that ache in my throat.\n\nLink below it\u2019s near the end of the clip.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/m9mVSET01g0?si=0b-cMuWUKjRirq2D \n\nHonorable mentions are\n\nThat\u2019s my boy from Harry Potter. If you know you know, I fear rewatching this once I have kids will make this very hard to watch\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FjoemE6QvxU?si=UUyjDSwjct7Gz31e\n\nAnd of course the GOAT of it all hereditary\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M2101AvCGd8?si=Bg9wW_2OzMbA2HWu\n\nHow she found a way to channel that feeling I\u2019ll never know.\n\nAnyways would love to hear some of your answers, and watch after I\u2019m done cleaning. \n\nHave a good Sunday.",

        "content": "This is kind of a weird question but when my kid is having a sad day, or in moments when something makes him really sad he often asks for a \"sad movie\". This is a normal way to process emotions, most adults do this but the problem is he is only 4. Most of the sad movies out there are not appropriate for kids and most kids movies aren't really sad, or at least sad for kids. The opening scene in 'UP' breaks my heart every time but it doesn't really register for a kid. \n\nWe often use 'Song of the Sea'. It's great animated movie but we need something new. Does anyone have any suggestions for kids friendly movies that have a meloncholic theme that don't have a lot of violence, scary scenes or mature content. ",

Seems like he gets down. If it isn't him then it's got to be Owen Wilson. ",

        "title": "Other examples of director's cut being so different than theatrical releases (and better ideally)",
        "content": "I just finished watching Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League for the first time, and I have to admit, I was blown away by how different it felt compared to the 2017 theatrical cut. It wasn\u2019t just longer\u2014it felt like a completely different movie in tone, pacing, and even character development. I went into it curious, but I came out impressed by how much the director\u2019s vision can transform a story once it\u2019s freed from the constraints of studio mandates, runtime pressures, or test-screening compromises.\n\nIt really got me thinking: the idea of a \u201cdirector\u2019s cut\u201d isn\u2019t new, but Snyder\u2019s version of Justice League might be one of the most extreme examples in recent memory where the alternate cut not only diverged massively from the theatrical release, but also (in the eyes of many fans, myself included) turned out to be the far superior version. Seeing it made me reflect on the strange history of movies where a director\u2019s original intentions were sidelined\u2014sometimes for commercial reasons, sometimes because of studio interference, and sometimes because of production problems\u2014and how later releases can completely reshape how a film is remembered.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question for you all: what are some other notable examples of movies where the director\u2019s cut (or extended cut, or whatever alternate version was eventually released) ended up being significantly different from the theatrical release? And ideally, I\u2019m curious about cases where the director\u2019s cut is widely considered to be better.\n\nI know a few classics get brought up\u2014Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner and James Cameron\u2019s Aliens come to mind\u2014but I\u2019d love to hear about deeper cuts or films I might not have heard of. Are there hidden gems where the director\u2019s cut transforms the movie into something entirely new, in the same way Snyder\u2019s Cut did?",
