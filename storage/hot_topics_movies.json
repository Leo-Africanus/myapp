        "content": "So I want to talk a bit about creature design in movies, TV shows and even games. I get that it is and was often a budget and technical thing, but I am kinda sad that movies and TV shows are hardly ever very creative, when it comes to creature design.\n\nLike most are actually very humanoid, have two arms, two legs, eyes, ears etc. They often even move in very \"normal\" ways, some are different but still like creatures that we know, spiders, horses, dogs. You could do so much already if you just changed up how creatures move, have It very smooth or very abrupt.. \n\nI read once that that also has psychological reasons, that if a thing that looks relatable to us humans is easier to be afraid of, or even easier, if we are already afraid of spiders, we come already pre-afraid of spider like aliens, which sounds kinda cheap to me. But I'd say if you managed to make something so alien we don't understand it and then terrify/or fascinate (doesn't need to be horror) us with its actions, it would be even better. \n\nThere are very few exceptions like the creature from nope! comes to mind first that was at least so alien, that it made me come up with this topic in the first place, even though it also has similarities with some deep sea creatures and it's behaviors. Or the things from arrival that still basically are octopus-adjacent.. \n\n**So what are the most alien designs out there? Why aren't there more of them, at least now in the age of cgi? Does the human mind have trouble coming up with something truly original?**\n\nAlso for games it's weird, since you have to create the creature from the start anyway, so why not go wild? But I guess it's easier to animate and rig if it's animal like. Respect to mass effect for trying at least a little bit.",

I really would like to introduce him to those, but I'm sure, he wouldn't like that. I'm just mentioning it because I want to make clear that I lost the feeling for mild horror. I watched it all.\nMy boyfriend doesn't like horror at all but we want to celebrate Halloween in a mild manner. He seems to not struggle with Zombies, as we watched World War Z together. I guess he wouldn't like \"Lights out\" or any movies of \"The Grudge\"-franchise. Do you have any suggestions which would be suitable for us both? \n\n\nEdit: I received a lot of great suggestions for movies that aren't too scary. I want to thank all of you! There were some titles I don't know about already, so I gained even more as what I was asking for. The more titles to add to my watchlist, the better. \n",

        "content": "Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been loving lately: 50 first dates, Blended, Legally Blonde, Ponyo, Princess Diaries, Because of Winn Dixie, The Lorax, Big Fish, Silver Linings Playbook, 500 Days of Summer, La La Land\n\nI\u2019m not into dark, scary, stressful things lately. Not big into comedy. But I don\u2019t mind a tear jerker. I do really love a touching and inspiring twist on a light hearted film. I\u2019ll even watch documentaries like Martha Stewart or Taylor Swift!\n\nMovies that came out in the 2000s preferred",
