        "content": "*A woman's obsessive search for her missing sister leads her into a terrifying mystery at the hands of an unknown evil.*\n\nCast: Camille Sullivan, Keith David, Michael Bleach\n\nRelease Date: October 24, 2025 (Distributor - NEON)\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [83%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shelby_oaks/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shelby-oaks/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1626527/shelby-oaks-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;It's clear that Chris Stuckmann loves horror and has taken his years of determining what he likes and what he thinks \"works\" by reviewing films on YouTube to shape his craft. At no point does it feel like \"Shelby Oaks\" is anything other than the very best version of what he intended to make, as opposed to the numerous films by first-time feature filmmakers who spend too much time trying to make something they *think* they're supposed to make. The result is a deeply unsettling view that never loses its sense of heart or humanity. With Sullivan's phenomenal performance and Stuckmann's keen eye, \"Shelby Oaks\" allows us to witness the start of one of the most promising new voices in horror.\n\n[Gizmodo - German Lussier](https://gizmodo.com/shelby-oaks-puts-a-satisfying-scary-spin-on-the-found-footage-genre-2000661720)\n\n&gt;This is a horror film for and by the YouTube generation: one that\u2019s inspired by many horror films of the past, with little regard for when or how to borrow from them. As long as it\u2019s cool and scary. Which *Shelby Oaks* is.\n\n[Polygon - Jake Kleinman](https://www.polygon.com/shelby-oaks-review-chris-stuckmann/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Stuckmann\u2019s directorial debut is a sturdy horror movie from a lover of film who clearly understands the genre. While the involvement of indie distributor Neon and producer Mike Flanagan must have gone a long way (For a sense of what the original version of *Shelby Oaks* was like, you can read the mostly positive reviews from its initial premiere at 2024\u2019s Fantasia International Film Festival), there\u2019s strong evidence of talent \u2014 and cinematic depravity \u2014 to be seen.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shelby-oaks-chris-stuckmann-fantastic-fest-movie-review-2025) \\- 2 / 4\n\n&gt;Stuckmann is a smart dude, and one has to admire the commitment to getting this film made. He\u2019ll bounce back, especially given he\u2019s now been given a thumbs-up by Neon. He was also smart enough to give character actor Keith David a movie-stealing scene as the former prison warden who tells Mia about how his facility went to shit and how one of his inmates might have been possessed. A movie about a guy trying to run a haunted prison might have felt more original than this retread. Maybe they can explore that idea in the sequel. At least it\u2019s a new one.",

        "content": "Just rewatched American History X after a few years. The thing that struck me the most, is how well it's aged. Everything about it is carefully and artfully crafted. The two most powerful bits, in my opinion, are the dinner table discussions. The first with the mother's boyfriend, and the second with her late husband. Showing how racism and hate is often twisted and packaged behind pseudo-economic and perceived inequality tinged hatred, and then, how it begins. Learned at home. And throughout the film, you see where that gets you: absolutely nowhere. And the ending is just heart wrenching, the cycle never ends. Highly encourage a rewatch. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the use of monochrome, it's all funneled into an ugly look of America's dark side. And it's more poignant in these times that it's ever been.",

Andrew Garfield is an awesome actor, put his soul and heart in the role. I know the movie follows all the clich\u00e9 tropes of  a struggling artist film but the movie feels so personal and takes you in so well that you want them to make it.\n\nYour work is alive Jonathan Larson...",

        "content": "My absolute favorites have probably got to be The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Se7en, and Spider-Man 2(2004). The best part about them is they are not merely a way to credit the cast and crew, but they actually propel the story in different ways.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly has a title sequence that is more or less a teaser for what\u2019s the come in the film. The illustrations are great, the use of the airbrush to reveal the principal actors is extremely creative, and the theme song needs no introduction. One of the most iconic of all time and some of Ennio Morricone\u2019s best work.\n\nSe7en might be the most visually creative opening sequence of all time. The combination of the dark, disturbing imagery, the visceral editing, and the use of the song Closer by NIN is absolute perfection. They could not have set the tone any better. \n\nSpider-Man 2 thrives in simplicity. A quick recap of the first film with the theme song playing over it, while introducing the musical motif of the film\u2019s villain. Again, this credit sequence has great illustrations. They are incredible to look at and it very effectively recaps the first film in a short amount of time. Another key element is the great musical score by Danny Elfman. \n\nWhich title/credits sequence would you say is your favorite or the best?\n\nEdit: After some thought I\u2019d also like to add Casino Royale and The Devil\u2019s Rejects on here as honorable mentions. Great opening credits and music from both films. ",
