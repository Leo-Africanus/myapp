        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

Whether taken as a whole seperate work or as the culmination of several of the darker heroes storylines, this movie was a treat. The main character Yelena narrates the opening with a realization \u201cthere is something wrong with me\u201d and the direction of the movie explores the idea of inner reflection with gusto. Every character in this film has something they are dealing with. Some dark regret they have to deal with, and it culminates in a shared realization of the method by which to deal with one\u2019s pain: friends. The movie implicitly prescribes friends as the cure for depression. It\u2019s heartwarming in every sense and also gives the team an unshakeable bond that was both fun to watch form as well as believable. This was a good movie. It doesn\u2019t have the best storyline in marvel, that honor still belongs to Nebula, but it does tell a coherent and touching story about why we all need friends.",

It\u2019s darkly funny watching him try to get it right and failing in ridiculous ways, yet slowly improving. \n\nThat experience made me realize how many films I might dismiss too quickly based on trailers or hype.

I was with a friend and he whispers to me \u201cdude she\u2019s like perfect\u201d and I just nodded in agreement. Totally forgot about the movie for like a minute or two.\n\nI still say her face game in that movie is unmatched in the history of cinema. ",

Like a cat is licking its paw and there\u2019s a \u2018meow\u2019 sound. Or they show a dog and play a whining sound even though the dog VISIBLY ISN\u2019T WHINING. \n\nAnd breathe. Obviously not at all important but it drives me potty. Anyone got similar pedantic peeves? (Despite the title they do not need to be pet related \ud83d\ude09) ",
