        "content": "I was just watching Death Becomes Her for the bazillionth time and thinking that it may be my favorite ever Bruce Willis performance simply because of how ...not Brucey it is.\n\nHis character is flaaaaaaacid, neurotic, cowardly, fickle for most of the film - so unlike the usually steely or cocky Bruce we're used to.\n\nAnother \"overlooked performance\" I love is RDJ as Wayne Gayle in Natural Born Killers.\n\nIt's not necessarily a stretch for him but it's rarely mentioned when people think about iconic Robert Downey Jr roles, even though he was one of the most quotable parts of the film!!\n\nThat got me thinking...\n\nWhat are some other \"overlooked\" or \"under appreciated\" performances that are somehow not often mentioned when discussing an actors body of work but are your fave?",

These women\u2019s voices should be praised. They hold a huge part of our childhood and we never even knew their names or faces.  So a big shout to (and I\u2019m absolutely copying and pasting this to get it right) Lillias White (Calliope), Cheryl Freeman (Melpomene), LaChanze (Terpsichore), Roz Ryan (Thalia), and Van\u00e9ese Y. Thomas (Clio).\n",

If I recall correctly, Clive Cussler wasn't overly happy with how the movie turned out. A great side-kick with Steve Zahn and I'm sure they could have had Penelope Cruz return somehow (I think the books had different female leads?). Thoughts?",
