        "content": "I personally, can't stand Elf. I find Will Ferrell's constantly yelling manchild schtick to never have been funny, and it's really amplified in Elf.\n\nHowever, a lot of people really seem to love it. James Caan was awesome, as he always is, but I just didn't find it funny. Also, I guess it doesn't help that I can't stand Zoey Deschanel either. \n\nWhat're your holiday movies beloved by many, but not by you?",

        "content": "About half way through the movie one of Paul\u2019s friends finds and takes a poster of a woman while searching through a town. Before a massive charge towards the enemy lines he pins the poster to a log in the trench he\u2019s about to exit.\n\nAt the very end of the movie in which Paul and the German army are instructed to charge enemy lines one last time before the armistice was signed at 11am, he\u2019s fatally stabbed.\n\nHe stumbles out sits down and passes away. The camera pans to show the surroundings and all of sudden you see the poster that\u2019s still pinned to the log that his friend pinned up.\n\nI realized last night that it\u2019s the exact same trench that they charged out of half way though the movie and the same trench that they charged to get into at the end of the war. It basically went to show that during the war, neither side actually made true gains but rather fought from and fought to win, again and again. They fought over the same small piece of land repeatedly. Insane.",

        "content": "Long story short, I recently watched the whole film for the first time, until now I had only seen a few short bits as a kid. My dad loves both the film and the music, and now I finally understand why. I just can\u2019t shake the feeling of heartbreak, because the final scene still makes me cry even days later.\n\nI specifically remember standing in the living room when I was in preschool, watching the deaths of Uncas and Alice. Back then it didn\u2019t affect me at all, I even asked my dad why she would jump off the cliff. But now, as I\u2019m writing this, tears are coming to my eyes and I feel such a heaviness in my chest. It\u2019s honestly comparable to heartbreak. I\u2019m literally mourning for Alice and Uncas.\n\nI just wanted to share this and was curious how you felt about the film, either as a whole or specific scenes like the ending.\n\nLet me know in the comments, and thank you in advance for reading my thoughts and for your insights!",

        "content": "I\u2019m really wondering what animated film visually impresses you the most. Currently watching the Polar Express in 3D and it\u2019s impressive. There\u2019s also stuff like Zootopia and the Bad Guys 2.\n\nPerhaps you find the traditional animation of Studio Ghibli films to be superb.\n\nFrozen is a stupendous achievement of course.\n\nTMNT Mutant Mayhem looked sick imo. There\u2019s also stuff like A Scanner Darkly.\n\nwhat\u2019s your pick for the most visually stunning animated film of all time?\n\nIt can even be a video game honestly. It can be the current standards of animation or something like Toy Story which was groundbreaking for it\u2019s time.\n\nSome of mine off the top of my head: The Secret of Nihm, Alita Battle Angel, Batman Mask of the Phantasm, Frozen, Animal Farm (1954). Recently saw Stitchead and liked it a lot.",
