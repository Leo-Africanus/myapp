First of all one would expect that an order from the UK would be a European compatible product not an American compatible product.... Second of all what is the point of region locking DVD's, it results in situations like this where people end up buying a product they can't even use which is no fault of their own.\n\nRant over, what a waste of money! Even if this gets deleted by the mods I'll feel a little better ranting a little bit... I better get my refund.",

Obviously, I came to know him through Zorro and The Shrek films which are great. But I rewatched Ruby Sparks again years ago, and he has like 3 min screentime in that, and yet it made such an impact on me, he has so much charisma. I watched a few of his direct to dvd type action films. Security which was a ton of fun, he\u2019s such a capable action lead. And Acts Of Vengeance which was more middling. \n\nI hate seeing him constantly get wasted in stuff like Uncharted &amp; Indiana Jones and I\u2019m not sure why he is always doing direct to dvd stuff now, not to shame it, it\u2019s a market that has its purpose, but how in the world people don\u2019t see Pain &amp; Glory or Official Competition and not want to go out of their way to work with him. He\u2019s got such a range. He was genuinely heartbreaking in Babygirl too, another characters that\u2019s a side character but his performance makes him feel more present in the film. \n\nI am yet to see a lot of his earlier work, drop some Antonio recommendations in the comments and your thoughts on him.

        "content": "Beyond just \u201cgood music,\u201d some films use soundtracks and scores as a narrative device or emotional guide, almost like a character. Think of scores that define the atmosphere, or soundtracks that advance the plot in place of dialogue.  \n\n\nExamples:\u00a0\n\n*Baby Driver*\u00a0(music syncs with action)\n\n*The Social Network*\u00a0(score mirrors anxiety)\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy*\u00a0(mixtape as emotional backbone)\n\nHow does the music do more than just accompany scenes? Could the film have worked without it?",

        "content": "Just finished The Prestige and damn my brain is spinning. I went in thinking it\u2019s just two rival magicians trying to outsmart each other. But nah, this movie is way twisty..  \n\n\nThe biggest shock for me was Borden being two people. Alfred and Fallon were twins the whole time, living one life as one man. That\u2019s why sometimes he is loving and sometimes cold. Sometimes he cares for his wife and sometimes he feels like a stranger. They literally destroyed their personal lives just to protect one magic trick. That\u2019s crazy dedication.\nThen Angier\u2026 this part really messed me up. I thought he finally used a double. But no, Tesla\u2019s machine was real. It was cloning him. Every single show, one Angier survives and the other one dies in the tank. He never even knows if he will be the man who lives or the man who drowns. He keeps killing himself again and again just to win. That is straight up disturbing.\n\nThen I realized the opening murder wasn\u2019t even normal murder. Angier planned his own death to frame Borden. He sacrificed himself just to destroy his enemy. That\u2019s how deep his obsession went.\nThe ending hurt. One Angier is drowning in the tank and the other is bleeding on the floor. No winners at all. Just two broken men who ruined their lives for obsession.",

        "title": "Examples of anti-Chekhov's guns?",
        "content": "A rule of thumb for playwrights is that any significant story element introduced early in the play should have some sort of payoff before the play ends. If you introduce a gun in act one of a three act play, it better go off in act three or it was an extraneous detail that should be excised from the script. The same rule is often applied to movies as well.\n\nMy question is what examples of an anti-Chekhov gun are there: not just a plot device that has no payoff but a plot device that is introduced and subsequently works in a way antithetical to the way the movie explains. Basically how many movies lie to the audience.\n\nTwo examples come to mind: in Jurassic Park, it's shown early on that the t-rexes are so massive that their footsteps can be heard from far away and shake the ground but later in the climax, a T-Rex seemingly appears out of nowhere with no warning. In Ant Man, it's explained that items that are shrunk down maintain their mass, that's why a punch from a microscopic Ant Man packs the punch of a full grown adult yet we see later in the movie that Hank Pym is carrying around a shrunk down tank that should way thousands of pounds on a keychain.",

Mostly because he\u2019s the kind of guy who doesn't use swear words, and that movie is basically 99% profanity. I get the feeling it sort of expanded his vocabulary a little.\n\nHe asked me what the first R-rated movie I ever watched was, and I can\u2019t remember for sure, but it was probably The Terminator. I definitely wasn\u2019t old enough when I watched it. I have these really vivid memories of watching it with friends in some dark room, feeling both exhilarated and deeply anxious the entire time. That eye surgery scene was freaky, and the factory scene at the end when the Terminator is just a metal skeleton gave me nightmares.\n\nStill, I remember being so glad I\u2019d seen it. I didn\u2019t know movies could do that, could make you feel such intense fear, excitement, and awe. Just felt like some of a revelation. It was probably the first time I realized how powerful movies could be.\n\nHow about yoU?",

I was just at the movie theater seeing Hamnet (it's AMAZING, highly recommend), and my little Cinemark was PACKED. idk if it's just MLK weekend or what, but my theater in the middle of nowhere Texas was absolutely TEEMING with life. Like I could barely get popcorn the lines were so long, and they had every single bloody cash register staffed with people. The theater itself for Hamnet was sold out. I've been to the theater nearly five times in the last two months, and each time, it only gets busier. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share something really positive, because it made me nearly cry I was so happy. art never does die, even when we're worried it will :)",
