I think I'd put it in the same \"vibes\" folder as Animatrix, A Scanner Darkly, Metropolis, Repo: Genetic Opera, Aeon Flux (the cartoon, not the movie), and Moebius' Metabarons comics.\n\nCould anyone recommend movies that feel like this? I'm not just looking for interesting depictions of sci-fi dystopias, but mainly very ambitious (for better or for worse) visuals - from the designs to the techniques used, e.g. the rotoscoping in Scanner Darkly or how Immortal used cgi so extensively for its time.",

Every single joke is clever, the plot is well paced, all the characters are unique and interact well with each other. \n\nAnd the premise, outright hillarious. I wont spoil anything but its a tightly interwoven set of threads that recontextualize each other; which all get expertly revealed in the correct order to maximize impact. Not to mention that despite the fairy tale aestetics, it delivers emotional moments and covers interpersonal relationships with light hearted respect. Also there is mystery and foreshaddowing for those paying attention and trying to piece the puzzle together before the characters do. ",

        "content": "This is sort of a strange (and dark) ask, but recently I have been thinking about a news story that happened some time ago where I live. Some mob members killed a relative of a politician by mistake, and a few days later were killed by the mob in turn as punishment - at the time I thought, man, I don't even think they have a name for the emotion these guys were feeling when they realized how badly they fucked up.\n\n  \nSo then I thought, are there any good movies or scenes that capture really well that feeling of \"I fucked up, I'm going to die, and there's nothing I can do about it?\" It doesn't count if the person thinks there's a chance to fight it, it's gotta be realizing they are powerless to stop it.\n\n  \nThat famous scene in the Goodfellas is more or less that, but it was for a split second. The Death of Stalin has a big one towards the end too, but the character was kicking and screaming the entire time.",

Even in My Left Foot he plays an incredibly talented paraplegic person. I'd love to see him in a roll where he is more subversive. \n\n",

But when I search for it, I just get lists of movies that involve any tyoe of time travel. I don't want people from present time traveling back in time or forward into the future, or people from the future traveling to today... I'm looking for the amusement of characters from the past being fascinated or surprised about basic modern technology and lifestyles.\n\nThink Hocus Pocus and the witches being surprised by the fire sprinkler systems, a paved road, or a car.\n\nOthers I can think of that I've seen: Blast From The Past, Bill &amp; Ted's, \n\nBut throw more recommendations at me!  I don't mind cheesy TV movies as well.",
