Personally, I found it perfect, and here\u2019s why.\n\nThe finale shows that even in the most extreme scenario, where everything the two abductors believed turned out to be true, their lives would still be failures. All the conspiracy theories, all the paranoia, all the supposed \u201cawakening,\u201d none of it changes the fact that they wasted their lives, stagnated and underachieved.\n\nI think that\u2019s a powerful message. It enables the movie to be a subtle dissentive against spending your life spiraling down conspiracy rabbit holes and using \u201csecret truths\u201d as a substitute for actual living. Even if the world really were the way they imagined, it wouldn\u2019t make them any less miserable or unsuccessful.\n\nIn that sense, Bugonia lands the same kind of emotional blow as Requiem for a Dream or Trainspotting.

Yes, you could argue that it could've been Palmer as well because Norris and Palmer had similar haircuts, but the shadow showed that the person was wearing a turtleneck shirt, which is what Norris wore and Palmer did not.\n\nBennings: Going back to the beginning, the dog rushed towards him and attempted to lick his face and a little later in the movie, the dog walked by his legs while he was playing cards with the gang and he startled, so I assumed the dog probably bit him.\n\nBlair (not fully certain): Since he was locked in the toolshed, he could've become an easy prey for the thing, but he also could've used tools such as a hammer or axe to defend himself.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "What Weapons is About to Me",
        "content": "Weapons is first and foremost a story about childhood abuse and the indescribable guilt and isolation that results from it. The core of Weapons is the boy, Alex Lilly.\n\nAlex is made to feel guilty for his parents being harmed if he doesn\u2019t obey Aunt Gladys\u2019 orders for silence and must shoulder additional guilt for forced complicity in his classmates falling under her spell. Alex is profoundly isolated, walking by himself almost every time we see him on screen, keeping a tight lip to maintain the illusion of normalcy, and even sitting entirely alone in a classroom at the beginning of the film.\n\nI grew up in a household where everything moved and halted at the discretion of a psychologically and emotionally abusive parent. It was a household that seemed perfect to the outside world. I was trained from a young age to maintain this illusion through silence, and I felt guilt if I ever mentioned my mother\u2019s abusive behavior outside the household. I was trained to believe that my mother\u2019s treatment of my sister and I was our fault. That we just didn\u2019t truly appreciate her for all she did for us.\n\nThis left me feeling alienated from my classmates in a way that I don\u2019t think can really be described if you didn\u2019t grow up in a similar environment. Weapons captured the feelings of guilt and isolation I felt as a child in a way no other movie in recent memory has.\n\nAnd the ending captures how the effects of childhood abuse can, and typically do, long outlast the abuse itself.\n\nI\u2019m mainly curious to hear what people who grew up in family situations like mine have to say. But of course, I\u2019m happy to hear the thoughts of people who grew up in healthy home environments as well.",

        "content": "Oki so, some of the movies land at the wrong time. They clash with audience expectations, trends, or marketing and get dismissed, only to be re evaluated years later. Films like **Blade Runner** or **The Thing were criticized** or ignored on release, but today yet they\u2019re seen as genre defining. Even **Eyes Wide Shut** and **Jennifer\u2019s Body** feel more appreciated now than when they premiered.\n\nTime gives certain movies room to breathe. Cultural context shifts and what once felt OFF suddenly makes a sense. It makes me wonder how many films we write off too quickly just because they don\u2019t fit the moment they arrive in.\n\nWhich movie you think history was kinder to than its original audience?",
