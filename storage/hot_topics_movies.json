If the Queen dies, the future extinction event is cancelled. Even if the males wake up, they can\u2019t reproduce. They chose the only path that led to a chaotic shootout.\n\nAlso, back on the oil rig - the \"we don't have enough poison\" line is legendary. She\u2019s a biological creature. She has eyes and a brain. You have high-caliber rifles and explosives. Just... end it? The plot armor on that alien was thicker than its scales.",

It felt like satire pushed too far, made to shock people back then. I enjoyed it, but I did not take it seriously. \n\nWatching it again now feels completely different. What hits me is not the famous speeches. It is the system behind them. \n\nAttention matters more than truth. Anger gets rewarded. Calm voices get ignored. People slowly turn into content through small compromises, not evil plans. \n\nEveryone is just doing their job too well. That mindset feels normal now, and that is the scary part. That is why it feels so accurate today.\n\nWhat movie feels way more real now than it did when you first watched it?\n\nThank you.",

By the end practically no one is satisfied or happy, despite their efforts to find it. There really isn\u2019t a magical or uplifting moment in life. It almost always ends in disappointment. Some others I found were: \n\nA Simple Plan. A few people have a get rich quick scheme they think will be perfect, but ends horribly with everyone either dead or traumatized forever. Captures greed well. \n\nThe Fly. A lonely scientist falls in love and thinks he has the breakthrough experiment that will make him famous and impress the girl he\u2019s just met but fallen head over heelsfor. And instead it ruins his life and hers. Captures that feeling of love that doesn\u2019t work out despite their best efforts. \n\nThe Thing.

I know in the original release and on VHS and old DVD releases, Yoda was still a puppet until Episode 2, where the puppet was replaced with CGI for then on and also with the 2011 re-release\n\nBut it got me thinking on whether it would've been possible for Yoda to remain a puppet for the rest of the prequel trilogy? I know it would have been a challenge and yes, for some of the fight scenes, CGI would have to been use, but I wish George still went with the puppet for scenes to do not involved fighting. I just like the practical stuff. Though, I think George really wanted Yoda to be CGI for the Prequels.\n\nRegardless, Do you think Yoda should've still been a puppet for Episode 2 and 3 or Star Wars? Would it have been Possible?",

Excellent performances, smooth writing and dialogues, pacing as required, and great emotional arcs for characters. He's probably my favorite Director-turned-Actor since I'm not familiar with many in that category.\n\nI'm curious to know what others think of him and his directorial films. What's your favorite?",

I know it\u2019s a film people interpret very differently, so instead of posting a single theory, I wanted to ask a few questions to those who feel they understand it well.\n\n\nDo you see the movie as following one character throughout, or as two identities that are both \u201creal\u201d within the film?\nIs the identity shift closer to a mental escape from guilt, or something more literal inside the story?\nHow do you personally interpret the Mystery Man \u2014 conscience, truth, death, or something else?\nDo you think the later events are meant to be taken as fully real, or as reality breaking down under psychological pressure?\nThe film looping back to its opening \u2014 do you read that as a literal loop, a mental loop, or just a thematic choice?\nOn a rewatch, did the film become clearer, or did it remain intentionally unresolved for you?\n\nNot looking for a single correct answer \u2014 just curious how different people connect the pieces after spending time with the film.",
