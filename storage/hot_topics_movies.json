        "title": "Hey /r/movies! I'm filmmaker Curry Barker (MILK &amp; SERIAL). My new film, OBSESSION, is premiering this Friday 9/5 at the Toronto International Film Festival as a Midnight Madness selection. Ask me anything!",
        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

        "title": "What About Bob is a psychological horror movie told from the perspective of the psycho",
        "content": "Spoilers for a 34 year old movie, I guess.\n\nSo, What About Bob is a classic Bill Murray comedy and I always loved it growing up. Bob, Bill Murray's character, is endearing, silly, and a great vehicle for Bill Murray's brand of comedy. The interplay with Richard Dreyfuss's character Dr. Leo Marvin as Bob's psychiatrist and Bob is great. The dynamic is fun and their character arcs are a fun reversal of one another where Bob learns to function and thrive despite his many mental disorders (which were somewhat problematic but portrayed pretty well for a comedy in the 90's) while Dr. Marvin descends into madness trying to get rid of Bob from his life. A delightful film and still watch it sometimes when I'm craving something lighthearted and fun.\n\nHowever, the actual events of the plot are the events of a horror story. Bob enters Dr. Marvin's life at Marvin's triumphant moment; he's a successful psychoanalyst/psychiatrist, his book got published and he's getting serious acclaim for it, his colleagues respect him, and he's about to go on a lovely vacation with his family. Bob gets foisted on him from a colleague who Bob literally convinced to give up his career to get away from, but Dr. Marvin is confident he can help him after he gets back from vacation.\n\nThen Bob calls him on vacation using a fake suicide and police investigation as a premise. Shook up, Dr. Marvin sets a very clear professional boundary: \"don't call me or approach me when I'm on vacation and we'll get to your mental health care when I'm back in the office.\" He figures that'd be the end of it; a clingy patient is annoying but he's probably dealt with that before even if the whole fake suicide approach to get his number was a bit extreme. Then Bob shows up in person. He's not even supposed to know what *town* Marvin is in, but now he knows where he and his family live. He tries to dissuade him again but then Bob shows up to his house and approaches his family. \n\nHe starts befriending Marvin's kids, going sailing with his daughter and diving with his son. His wife finds him charming and cute. He stays over for dinner and sleeps in his son's room overnight. He hijacks his once-in-a-lifetime interview that could have made him a celebrity psychiatrist, his ultimate career goal. Every step of the way Dr. Marvin sees these major boundaries being crossed and the unhinged nature of his nightmare patient *and nobody will listen to him.* \n\nHe doesn't know what to do; no reasonable options seem to work. He's scared. His family is more and more siding with Bob over him and he feels like he's being replaced as a father. Bob is even comforting his wife *about him, her husband.* He's getting more and more frustrated and desperate, and in so doing is more and more making himself look like the bad guy. He goes to colleagues who respect him for help and they act like he's the one who's crazy.\n\nHe's acting like he doesn't usually act; sure he was a bit smug before and maybe a little full of himself, but this can't really be *him,* could it? He's not seriously contemplating killing this patient of his, *is he?* He's a healer, a person who helps those suffering from mental illness; he's not a guy who breaks into a store at night to steal a gun and explosives, *right?*\n\nThen he does it. He kidnaps Bob at gunpoint and takes him out in the woods, straps bombs to him, and sets a timer for the detonator. He's using the language of his career of healing to kill. He even starts talking to himself, imagining cannibalizing Bob's fish in his triumph. He's long past the point of caring whether he sounds crazy now, but at least. he's. gone.\n\nThen he sees him. Bob is standing next to his beloved sister. He's still here. He's...never going away. It finally breaks him. He descends into catatonia and psychosis. He's one of them now; a broken mind who can't be fixed. He summons the will to scream one last protest of Bob marrying his sister at their wedding in a futile attempt to stop this final grafting of this man into his life forever. In that last moment of failure the comfort of catatonia leaves him and he knows this is his eternal damnation.\n\nSo, yeah. Horror movie.",

        "content": "Just watched the Thunderbolts* on Disney+ and I have completely loved it. Whether taken as a whole seperate work or as the culmination of several of the darker heroes storylines, this movie was a treat. The main character Yelena narrates the opening with a realization \u201cthere is something wrong with me\u201d and the direction of the movie explores the idea of inner reflection with gusto. Every character in this film has something they are dealing with. Some dark regret they have to deal with, and it culminates in a shared realization of the method by which to deal with one\u2019s pain: friends. The movie implicitly prescribes friends as the cure for depression. It\u2019s heartwarming in every sense and also gives the team an unshakeable bond that was both fun to watch form as well as believable. This was a good movie. It doesn\u2019t have the best storyline in marvel, that honor still belongs to Nebula, but it does tell a coherent and touching story about why we all need friends.",

The dad (Jim Carey because no one remembers the character's name) is douche. The would be step dad is earnestly trying his best to connect with his would be step son and gets tossed out like all step dads (do Hollywood types have parental issues or what, that's rhetorical). The idea that someone's entire life can be turned around and they're suddenly not an ass just because they have to tell the truth for a day is just kind of dumb. The director ended up with a few successful movies solely because Jim Carey liked him and he let Jim Carey do his thing, his other movies include such hits as \"The Nutty Professor\". The writers never wrote anything close to noteworthy before nor after.\n\nBut damnit Jim Carey turns the whole thing into the Jim Carey show, that's hilarious. Him freaking out over the pen or in the bathroom IS the movie and is funny as hell, regardless of what else there is.",

        "content": "I remember when the speed racer movie came out I was so excited initially because I loved all the iterations of speed racer, all the cartoons, the manga, the comics, I found the story interesting and the world so different from any other series. Then the reviews came out, and it was panned, even today on rotten tomatoes has a 42% critic and a 60% viewer score. Disappointed I didn't see it until years later when it was available on streaming and I cannot believe I denied myself that long. I don't know why people seem to hate when a movie is heavily stylized or just trying to be fun but it's EXACTLY what it should have been. It captured the feeling of the cartoon and manga very well, all the cheeseyness included. The story was fine if predictable, but who doesn't know the story of speed racer to some extent. The actors who were part of it were very clearly giving 110% to it. The world, as I said before, was EXTREMELY stylized. Beyond even that they had some crazy interesting shots. All while managing to keep the tone of the movie fun BUT serious to the characters even if we would find it ridiculous.\n\nI'm not gonna sit here and say it's a need to watch movie, it's not telling some crazy story that everyone needs to experience. It's not ground breaking in effects, or visuals, or acting. That being said the fact this movie was PANNED on release is criminal. So if you're looking for a movie where the people who made it cared 100% and the actors were giving everything they had and is such a fun time you'll wonder where the time went you should watch it.",
