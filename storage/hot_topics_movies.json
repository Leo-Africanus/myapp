I don't think Zombie Strippers qualifies because it's just stupid, but Killer Klowns from Outer Space is right on the cusp.\n\nThe Craft is almost perfect.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is as well.\n\nThe Great Wall is kinda there.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Since WW2, Hollywood had been making movies that we can call so called propaganda or morale boosters. I do enjoy most of them and I'm not from the US and never served in any army. Some (not Vietnam) movies I enjoyed were Lone Survivor (2013), The Kingdom (2007), American Sniper (2014), Black Hawk Down (2001), Zero Dark Thirty (2012). Jarhead (2005), The Hurt Locker (2008)\n\nMove that I watched recently that I disliked greatly is Taking Chance (2009). It shows us the process of how a body of a dead soldier from the field in Iraq is making it back home to a small town in the US. It painted us this emotional picture on how much care is put into every single step of the process and how much care the army and everyone around is putting into remembrance of the single fallen soldier. I almost felt insulted that they take care of the dead more than they take care of the living ones.\n\nWhat are your favorite and non-favorite US army \"propaganda\" movies.",
