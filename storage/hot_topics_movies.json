Perhaps I\u2019m a huge idiot, but I genuinely don\u2019t get why this shot is special. To me, it\u2019s just a regular (if well timed) cut between two unrelated shots.

HE JUST SAYS \"I'm obsessive\" ?!?\n\nIsn't that like, Day 1 of film school, do-not-ever-do-this type of shit? How did that pass the writing room, and why did the director include this scene, whose entire purpose is to deliver that one line, and immediately end it, with no relevance to the broader plot at all.\n\nI watched them days ago and this is still pissing me off.",

I\u2019m not sure when the filmmakers realized that animating Petunia Pig with a flamethrower like she\u2019s Chow Yun-fat in \u201cHard Boiled\u201d was pure cinematic gold, but I\u2019m glad they did, and they sure did do it a lot. This movie did not, as they say, need to go/boil that hard, but hard indeed they did go/boil.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Though the film\u2019s animation style is modern, with sharper linework and smoother movement than the work from the studio\u2019s 1930s-to-\u201950s heyday, there are nods to those classics, from the montage of Porky and Daffy working odd jobs drawn in Academy ratio to the softer colors redolent of the original *Merrie Melodies* and *Looney Tunes* shorts. But this nostalgia never overrides the immediate pleasures of the film\u2019s jokes and heart, and it\u2019s the strength of its new ideas that places this among the best latter-day works in the *Looney Tunes* canon.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie-review-1236033911/)\n\n&gt;Daffy (whose greatest desire is to smash things with his wooden mallet) wears on the nerves after a while, but the entire project -- including a handful of fun fourth-wall-shattering asides -- is crafted with love and a genuine respect for the franchise.\n\n[IGN - Rafael Motamayor](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie-review)\n\n&gt;The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie has enough gags per minute to leave audiences short of breath with laughter, but also a big heart that shows why these characters are so beloved even after nearly 90 years. With crisp animation, some truly hilarious and bizarre gags, and a\u00a0 plot that hearkens back to 1950s sci-fi, this is the Looney Tunes movie fans have been waiting for.\n\n[Boston Globe - Odie Henderson](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/12/arts/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie/)\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up\u201d puts three Looney Tunes characters at the center of the story. They\u2019re the heroes, and their personalities are recognizable from all the old cartoon shorts they appeared in back in the day.\n\n[San Jose Mercury News - Randy Myers](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/12/what-to-watch-this-week-6/)\n\n&gt;There is something wholly endearing, nostalgic and just plain sweet about seeing Warner Bros. cartoon stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck in a full-length feature. And rather than spice it all up and make it ultra-contemporary (OK, the team of 12 writers toss in a few \u201cnow\u201d references). They stick with the kooky storylines of yore as Porky and Daffy try to get some cash to fix the rundown house they live in that\u2019s proving to be a community eyesore. It\u2019s all daffy as that duck and more amusing than funny, but it\u2019s amusing and animated in the style that will make you feel like a kid gleefully watching Saturday morning cartoons. And sometimes all you need for about 90 minutes to become that kid again, even if it took 12 writers to help bring back that feeling again.",
