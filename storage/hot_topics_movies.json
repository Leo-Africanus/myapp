They can be mundane but sometimes they reveal a gem of insight.\n\nI recall listening to the commentary for \"As Good As it Gets\" and the cast pointing out that Melvin has artwork that celebrates black culture in his apartment.\n\nIt demonstrated that he is not racist, despite some of the comments he made to Cuba Gooding Jr's character.  He was simply trying to repel him and get him to leave him alone.",

Primal Fear\n\nInteresting that The Usual Suspects and Primal Fear both had the deceiver acting with a disability to throw everyone off, including the audience.    They also had a little more of a diabolical nature to them compared to Sixth Sense.\n\nWhat are yours?\n\n  \nEdit:  apologies for weird formatting of this post; tried to correct.  Didn't work.

Every character felt so real and grounded that I was captivated the whole time in pure awe of everything going down.\n\nAnd lastly, the ending man\u2026 I won\u2019t spoil anything but what a note to leave off on\u2026\n\nAmazing movie, no doubt one of my favorite foreign films ever",

It's one of my favorite movies of all time and there are some absolutely fantastic lines in there. \"I'm your huckleberry.\" \"Are you gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed.\" \"You tell em I'm coming, and Hell's coming with me.\"\n\nWhether it's a comedy or drama or really anything, it seems like the more quotable the movie, the better it makes the movie for me. Maybe it's because it's more memorable. Idk. I have seen some very funny comedies that I don't think to go back to because they're not quotable. But things like SuperBad or Step Brothers or Tommy Boy or Monty Python's The Holy Grail keep drawing me back over and over again.\n\nMy kids have even started to quote the Princess Bride - another one of my all time favorites for this reason - in our house almost daily.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite quotable movies from any genre?",

I love how raw and unfiltered they are, I love how gritty and dirty they are, I just love that grainy low budget look they have. They really have a certain charm that you can\u2019t find anywhere else. Movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House On The Left etc. I just love how the 70s weren\u2019t afraid to go as dark and gritty as you could get, even more mainstream 70s films had that vibe, like Taxi Driver, Deliverance, A Clockwork Orange etc. the 70s are hands down my favorite decade for films, I love all of that stuff and you don\u2019t see movies that push the envelope as much anymore.",
