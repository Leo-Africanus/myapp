We're Steve Hudson (director/writer) and Guy Bass (author of the bestselling children's book) of STITCH HEAD, an animated feature about a forgotten creature living in a long-abandoned castle. It's now in theaters everywhere. Ask us anything!\n\nSTITCH HEAD tells the story of a small, forgotten creature awoken by a Mad Professor to (Almost-)Life. Terrified the suspicious townsfolk of the village below will form an Angry Mob and burn the Professor's Castle to the ground, Stitch Head desperately indoctrinates his fellow creations to NOT be monstrous. But then a clapped-out old Freak Show comes to town, and it\u2019s down-at-heel ringmaster promises Stitch Head the one thing he\u2019s always longed for\u2026. Love.\n\nIt's out in theaters everywhere via Briarcliff.\n\n**Here's the trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JrJtrGMrEw&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JrJtrGMrEw&amp;t=)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n**Steve's credits:**\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1362496/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1362496/)\n\n**Guy's bio:**\n\nHi!

In 2010 Dinkin Dings and the Frightening Things won the Blue Peter Award for Most Fun Book with Pictures.\n\nI have also written plays for both adults and children. I've previously been a theatre producer, illustrator, temp, gerbil whisperer and have acted my way out of several paper bags.

        "title": "When did Male Characters being Ripped(regardless of genre) become a norm in movies.",
        "content": "So I just recently watched The Long Walk. And among many other things one thing I really appreciated about the movie was how average everyone looked.\nOutside of McVries and Stebbins most characters were super jacked or ripped with 6% Body fat. They were just average looking guys.\n\nAnd this raised a question in my mind. When exactly did it become a norm for leading men to be super jacked or ripped in films.\n\nI remember watching older films where the Leading Men were just average looking guys. Even in movies that had action in them.\n\nSean Connery's Bond had a fairly average build. Gene Hackman's Detective character in The French Connection looked like an average Middle Aged Guy.\nHarrison Ford's Deckard had an average man build too.\n\nBut today. If you see a horror movie the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou see a Sci Fi film the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou make a Detective movie, the main 40 year old Family man detective is going to be ripped as fuck.\n\nIf it's a teen he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a doctor he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a lawyer he's going to be ripped.\n\nSo when did this become a norm and why?\n\nI initially thought it might have started with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester stallone who brought the jacked look to the American Hero.\n\nBut even in the era of of Schwarzenegger and Stallone you had average guy Action heroes like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Michael Beihn in Terminator and Ford in Witness and The Fugitive.\nLet alone in non action leading roles.\n\nSo I really am confounded as to when this trend properly started where any lead character regardless of the genre or role has to be ripped.

        "content": "*Cast out from its clan, an alien hunter and an unlikely ally embark on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.*\n\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\n\nCast: Elle Fanning, Dimitrius Koloamatangi\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [87%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/predator_badlands)\n\n**Metacritic:** [69 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-badlands/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/predator-badlands/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;Trachtenberg's approach this time around gradually builds to a more underwhelming outing, even if his vision finds itself at its most grand. Not every set piece is effective despite some wonderful below-the-line work to help elevate the experience. The inevitable steering towards a more franchise-heavy focus is all but worrisome.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning\u2019s imperishable star quality can\u2019t save it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Richard Lawson](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dan-trachtenberg-1236417477/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a perspective shift that mostly works, so thoughtful is the film\u2019s construction. Trachtenberg is generous but also careful with detail; his film remembers what it has previously introduced us to, satisfyingly referencing back to plants and animals passingly encountered an hour prior. *Badlands* is a decidedly B-movie that thoroughly utilizes and enjoys the freedoms allowed when any prestige ambition is eschewed. The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth *Predator* installment that it can be. If it has to complicate \u2014 and, yes, soften \u2014 the branding to do that, so be it.\u00a0\n\n[David Ehrlich - IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/predator-badlands-movie-review-1235158691/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;The least \u201cPredator\u201d-like moments in this standalone sequel are rooted in Trachtenberg\u2019s love for the property, and all help \u201cBadlands\u201d to make a uniquely compelling argument that \u201cPredator\u201d deserves to be higher on the Hollywood food chain than anyone thought to place it over the last 40 years. By reckoning with the series\u2019 fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it\u2019s the series\u2019 greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. No, this isn\u2019t your daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d and it *definitely* isn\u2019t *Dek\u2019s* daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d but as a wise synthetic once said, \u201cWe can be more than what they ask of us.\u201d How rare \u2014 and extremely refreshing \u2014\u00a0to see a big studio movie recognize that the same can be true of itself.\u00a0\n\n[IGN - Clint Gage](https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-review) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg is heading in an interesting direction with this franchise and he gets bonus points for that. The Predator as a mysterious murder monster is getting some of his backstory filled in, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Badlands, in shifting the perspective to a Yautja main character, actually highlights what\u2019s been great about this franchise in its better moments. Dek and Thia are an unexpectedly fun pairing that bring a new energy to the franchise and an altogether different kind of hunt. It might not be pulling the skull and spine out of us and screaming in bloody victory, but it gets close.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/11/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dimitrius-schuster-koloamatangi-1236606321/)\n\n&gt;Returning director Dan Trachtenberg is clearly in a groove here, and his enthusiasm helps, notably in the film\u2019s impeccable world-building. But the action scenes never seem to galvanize, and somewhere along the line the predator, once a ruthless, unstoppable killing machine, has simply lost its menacing mojo. It all seems a bit, well, *silly* \u2014 like a long episode of *Succession* starring John Travolta\u2019s character in *Battlefield Earth*, or the adventures of Eric Trump in space \u2014 and that surely can\u2019t bode well for the inevitable next instalment.\n\n[Slash Film - Jeremy Mathai](https://www.slashfilm.com/2016872/predator-badlands-movie-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;If there are any negatives to point out, they're mostly a byproduct of blockbuster issues as a whole. The brisk pacing that keeps things moving at a breezy clip also means any semblance of character depth and nuance is either left as subtext or outright explained in exposition, though Trachtenberg still manages to find quiet grace notes for both Dek and Thia (and perhaps others too spoilery to give away here) amid all the carnage. And even as the action rivals anything in the franchise, the much larger sense of scale might have some yearning for the contained, stripped-down joys of \"Prey.\" All of those nitpicks pale in comparison to what the filmmakers accomplish here, however. By far the funniest, most heartfelt, and boldest \"Predator\" movie of them all, \"Badlands\" etches its place in franchise history \u2014 right alongside the classic that started it all and the three worthy follow-ups that\u00a0Trachtenberg has delivered so far. Let's hope there are many more to come.\n\n",

        "title": "\"Ladyhawke\" (1985) is the medieval romantic fantasy epic which should be a beloved triumph but has to settle for a small cult following. Michelle Pfeiffer was never more beautiful than in this.",
        "content": "I even enjoyed Matthew Broderick's bumbling Phillippe Gaston with the American accent because Broderick always had that appealing boy next door aura that made him easy to root in everything he's in. We know his character doesn't stand a chance with the otherworldy Isabeau, enchantingly played by Michelle Pfeiffer, but I don't know, I think every dorky kid saw themselves in Phillipe as he and Isabeau playfully flirted. \n\nI love this movie to bits. The concept of two soulmates separated by a curse which prevented them to see each other as humans is quite lovey-dovey in the right way and while Rutger Hauer mostly played complex bad guys, I think that actually enhanced his turn as Navarre, who's a heroic while still tough and almost unapproachable figure. He can be stern and rough because he's unhappy that his loyal hawk is actually the love of his life, a woman cursed to live as a hawk during the day, but when he warms up to Phillippe and he gives us a monologue, Hauer shines and reminds us of the brilliance of his big scene in Blade Runner. Such an incredibly underrated actor. \n\nThe movie didn't do well in the 80s, cuz people have no taste, and I don't get the constant bitching about the Alan Parsons Project score. I actually like the use of the synthethizers mixed with that romantic, conventional melody. It's unique and fantastic. \n\nI wish more people knew about it.",

He's even dead in the future he's shown.\n\n  \nHaving been shown his future, he returns to the present, reconciles with his father, and takes steps to ensure the future he saw doesn't come to pass.\n\n  \nThe alien apocalypse is just window dressing.\n\n  \nThe movie is no great masterpiece of fiction, but I found the parallels entertaining.",

        "content": "I was just randomly thinking about this, it\u2019s a common refrain in storytelling of all sorts that you should ideally [\u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell?wprov=sfti1), meaning to convey information and story using relatively little exposition. \n\nAnd there\u2019s generally good reason for that, exposition can bog a story down or feel like you\u2019re lecturing the audience or something. It can come across as unnatural, with for example two characters having a discussion and delivering information that both of them should already know and have no reason to bring up, except to inform the audience. That sort is very common. \n\nBut what are some good movies (or shows) that do the exact opposite: they do \u201ctell, don\u2019t show\u201d superbly well?\n\nMy pick is Unforgiven, where there is constant reference to William Munny\u2019s pitch-black past as an exceptionally violent and indiscriminate murderer, but we never actually see him doing any of it, in flashback or anything. You only get a very small taste, deliberately, at the end when he does his revenge and the old Munny returns. \n\nHis past is otherwise communicated almost entirely through lines said by both Munny and Little Bill, with the latter especially going into a rage about how Munny used to slaughter women and children. Which Munny openly admits with the famous line, \u201cI\u2019ve killed just about everything that walked or crawled at one point or another.\u201d\n\nBut outside of those lines, Munny\u2019s despondency and deep remorse throughout the entire movie and Bill\u2019s anger at his perceived hypocrisy are all you need to \u201cshow.\u201d You believe it completely.
