No, James Bond is the man's actual name and in fact, the events of OHMSS are referenced throughout the Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan Bond movies.",

Dune Part 2  - No doubt the greatest movie of the year and a perfect balance between  spectacle and detailed world building .\n\n\n2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.\n\n\n\n3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )\n\n\n\n4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .\n\n\n\n5. Smile 2      - A fresh engaging horror flick which lives up to the hype.\n",

Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.\n\nClassics of the genre:\n\nBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.\n\nA Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).\n\nThe Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.\n\nHonorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.\n\nWhat others?",

The reliable Vincent Cassel is \u201cAthos\u201d.\n\nThey went for the dirty and gritty look for this one, no colorful costumes for our heroes.   Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  \n\nWe all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.\nSo I wonder\u2026 Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   \n\nI can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale\u2026. But I found this rather jarring. \n\nI have to admit, my favorite is still the 1973 Lester-directed version with Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, etc. ",

        "content": "Today is World AIDS Day. \n\nThis is just one of many great films that came out in the height of the AIDS epidemic.\n\nI remember how hard it hit me. It provided a in depth picture of what was happening at that time. How people were being ostracized for simply being themselves.\n\nThere are other movies that tackled this subject, but this is the one I think about when I am jolted by the memory of what was back then.\n\nPlus, this had a freaking All Star cast.",

        "content": "Saw it last night at  midnight screening in a really great palace theater in LA called the Vista owned by Tarantino so it was an original 35mm print. He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. \n\nA few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  \n\n* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. \n* The jaws guy was hilarious. \n* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.\n* Holly Goodhead... great name.\n* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. \n* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. \n* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.\n\nLoved it.  Though I suspect people who like a more serious bond are not fans? ",

We use them in our day to day life, often without remembering even where these are from, however these are part of us nonetheless.\n\nWould be nice to share and see which ones trigger nostalgia the most and whether we have some moments in common.",

While social media movies are on my list, I need some about other aspects of digital technology. So like surveillance, drones/war, algorithms, security, marketing etc. I already have a fairly robust list of documentaries, so ideally not documentaries. Bonus points for non-Hollywood movies (basically movies in languages other than English).",
