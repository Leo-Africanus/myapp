        "content": "Hi reddit.\n\nWe are the team responsible for bringing the megafauna of Apple TV\u2019s **Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age** to life. We're Russell Dodgson (Production VFX Supervisor), Dorothy Ballarini (Framestore Creature Supervisor) and Darren Naish (Lead Scientific Consultant). We're here to answer your questions.\n\nIf you want to know more about us, here are our credentials:\n\n* Russell Dodgson (**His Dark Materials**, **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2**) : [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4203233/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4203233/)\n* Dorothy Ballarini (**Wicked: For Good**, **Guardians of the Galaxy**): [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4809197/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4809197/)\n* Darren Naish (**Alien Worlds**, **Prehistoric Planet**): [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4595065/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4595065/)\n\nOur mission was to create the illusion that a modern natural history crew traveled back in time. This meant adhering to strict \"blue chip\" documentary standards\u2014using long-lens photography, camera jitter, and heat haze to ground our CGI in reality.\n\nFrom an artistic and technical standpoint, we delivered over 1,250 4K shots featuring 69 scientifically accurate hero animals. This required intense collaboration to ensure every skeletal structure was fossil-accurate, alongside complex bi-directional simulations for fur interacting with deep snow, mud, and tar.\n\nWhether you\u2019re interested in the bi-directional FX sims, the on-set puppeteering in extreme climates, or the paleontology behind the designs, Ask Us Anything!\n\nWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow Tuesday, December 9th, at 1 PM ET/6 PM GMT to answer your questions.\n\nAsk away, we\u2019re excited to talk all things prehistoric, icy and wonderfully complex!\n\n",

        "title": "The X-Men movies may have the craziest chronology and arc of quality of any franchise",
        "content": "Many franchises start off with a couple of good entries before slowly declining over time.  Additionally, the franchises that go on a while sometimes get desperate and throw prequels, spinoffs, and reboots into the mix.  Sometimes they get super convoluted.  Halloween is a good example, with an unrelated spinoff for the 3rd film, two reboot movies, and three separate chains of installments that get retconned out of existence by the following installments.  Usually not many of these sequels or tangential films are good.  But putting all of these franchises to shame is X-Men, which has the wildest timeline and a completely unpredictable journey from good to bad. Going off of general consensus of how each film was received, we have:\n\nX-Men (1st film): Good\n\nX2 (Sequel): Good\n\nThe Last Stand (3rd film): Bad\n\nX-Men Origins Wolverine (Spinoff Solo Prequel): Real bad\n\nFirst Class (Prequel/Reboot): Good\n\nThe Wolverine (Loose Sequel to Spinoff Solo Prequel): Starts off good, becomes eh\n\nDays of Future Past (Sequel to Prequel/Reboot but also Time Travel Crossover with Original Trilogy): Real good\n\nDeadpool (Tangentially Related Spinoff Whose Place in the Continuity Is \"Whatever Is Funniest at the Moment\"): Good\n\nApocalypse (3rd Prequel/Reboot): Eh\n\nLogan (3rd Film of Loose Spinoff Solo Trilogy): The best one\n\nDeadpool 2 (Sequel to Tangentially Related Spinoff Whose Place in the Continuity Is \"Whatever Is Funniest at the Moment\"): Good\n\nDark Phoenix (4th Prequel/Reboot): Bad\n\nNew Mutants (Different Tangentially Related Spinoff/Reboot/Whatever This One was Supposed to Be): Real bad\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine (3rd film of Tangentially Related Spinoff Whose Place in the Continuity Is \"Whatever Is Funniest at the Moment\"/Multiverse Crossover with Protagonist of the Other Spinoff Solo Films Even Though He Died in the 3rd Film of Loose Spinoff Solo Trilogy and the Hugh Jackman Said He Was Done/Technically a Sequel to 3rd Film of Loose Spinoff Solo Trilogy Anyway/Multiverse Crossover and Continuity Merge with the Superhero Franchise that Will Be Taking Over this Franchise/Meta Post-Mortem and Emotional Closure of Not Only This Franchise but Other Superhero Movies from This Studio and Others, Including One that Never Got Made): Good\n\nThis doesn't even take into account the MCU crossovers (particularly the upcoming Doomsday) and the question of whether we ever actually return to the original trilogy's timeline at all due to continuity differences and the fact that Professor X keeps coming back to life between movies without explanation.\n\nIs there any other franchise that comes close?",

Sphere was one of those movies. Add to the premise a stacked cast and it was a fun watch. I love movies that keep you guessing the entire time. Another one I think of is Oculus. I remember being pleasantly confused while watching it, but that's about it. Gonna have to rewatch it soon. Give me some recommendations if you know of any.",

Mel Brooks shines in this one as he does in most of his movies, with his usual sense of off-the-wall satirical humor. Star Wars deserved a spoof for some time when this one came out, and this was the perfect vehicle to do so! My favorite scene is when they rent a copy of Spaceballs: The Movie to find Lone Star and his gang. \"When does this happen in the movie? Right now, sir!\"",
