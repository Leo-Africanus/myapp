There\u2019s so much I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate in my first viewings. Every frame is so carefully curated and layered, the attention to detail in this movie is astounding. Every shot is so meticulously crafted, and expertly captured, there isn\u2019t a single shot in this movie that doesn\u2019t look like a painting. The cinematography and directing are absolutely top notch. As far as directing goes, it doesn\u2019t get better than this. George Miller is a master of the craft and such a brilliant artist. He really created such a monumental film. Watching the action sequences I have no idea how he did most of that, especially knowing the vast majority of the action in the film was done with practical effects. I love everything about this movie, every time I watch it I appreciate new things about it. George Miller really caught lightning in a bottle with this. So grateful for this movie.",

I honestly did not expect this.\n\nI remember being so salty back in the day that Casey Affleck won the Oscar over Ryan Gosling for La La Land. La La Land was my favorite movie that year and I was fully in the \u201chow did Gosling lose??\u201d camp. I was shocked then, and I stayed convinced I was right.\n\nTen years later, watching Manchester by the Sea for the first time\u2026 yeah. I was wrong. Completely.\n\nCasey Affleck gives one of the most devastating, restrained, soul-crushing performances I\u2019ve ever seen. No big speeches, no flashy moments, just grief sitting quietly in every look, every pause, every line. It sneaks up on you and refuses to let go.\n\nAnd that scene with Michelle Williams, the one where she asks if they can get lunch sometime absolutely destroyed me. It\u2019s unbearably sad, painfully real, and acted with such raw honesty that it feels almost intrusive to watch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.\n\nThis movie lingers. It sits with you. It hurts in a way that feels earned. I genuinely can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nWhat a film. What a performance. This is one of those movies that stays with you forever.",

A normal R rating would have sufficed. Or maybe this would have been NC-17 when it came out, but would score an R or even a PG-13 if it was released today.\n\nFilms like that?\n\nWhen I think of films like this, the first one I think of is A Clockwork Orange. It is a bit intense and isn\u2019t non controversial, but even the uncut version is pretty much just a Hard R today.",

I wasn\u2019t super against cartoons but at a time where live action marvel was dominating I had no interest in seeing a cartoon Spider-Man film.\n\nHappened to see it on a whim when me and the family were out of town, trying to figure out which movie we wanted to see that weekend. I see ITSV just came out and I\u2019m astonished by the 90%\u2019s and praise it\u2019s getting. I say fuck it, why not?\n\nBest decision ever. The visuals, the humor, the music, I loved everything about this movie. It went from a film I was a little reluctant to see to one of my favorite animated movies of all time. I\u2019ll even go as far as to say it was revolutionary for it\u2019s style. These days you see a lot of animated films taking inspiration from that 2D/3D hybrid style the Spiderverse films were known for.\n\nAlso I can\u2019t lie, hearing Hypnotize by the notorious B.I.G. In the theater almost made me lose my shit.\n\nI may sound like a walking ad for this movie but I don\u2019t care. Anyone else have a similar experience seeing that movie in theaters?",

        "title": "Re-watching Jean Claude Van Damme movies.",
        "content": "I grew up in the 80's and 90's watching all the big action movies. Introducing my sons (8 &amp; 10) to some of my own childhood favorites can be hit or miss. I even find myself groaning at times and feeling like they haven't aged so well. I am aware some parts of action movies are not appropriate for younger viewers, and I do monitor what my kids watch. I also realize I cannot shelter them from everything and try to use questionable content as teaching opportunities, which is much more than adults cared to do for me when I was a child watching these movies. That said, they recently came across JCVD movies and really enjoyed them. They even liked them over more populare movies by more popular action stars. My kids are very observant and we noticed some aspects of his *on screen* persona in contrast with other characters portrayed by other actors. \n\nIn his roles, generally:\n\n- He usually plays an everyman type of character that is relatable to a wider audience.\n\n- He doesn't typically want to fight or go looking for trouble, but fights back to defend himself when attacked, driven by honor, or protecting those less capable. \n\n- He is usually fighting or crusading on behalf of a family member or loved one that he feels morally obliged to stand up for.\n\n- He doesn't immediately resort to using guns or other weapons and more often than not fights hand to hand, rather than killing. \n\n- He prefers a fair fight or being the underdog against a bigger and stronger opponent over dominating others. \n\n- He places a large amount of emphasis on the training, mental focus, and traditional aspects of being a martial artist instead simply an agent of destruction. \n\n- He is respectful and protective toward female characters and doesn't go out of his way to be overtly misogynistic or objectifying.\n\n- He is playful, warm, and caring toward children when he encounters them, often speaking softly at eye level or engaging in fun with them. \n\n- He is rarely boastful or conceited, and shows a righteous indignation toward authority figures he feels have wronged him or held him back from his pursuit of an honorable cause. \n\nThese are some things we discussed about his movies and why my sons have chosen him as their favorite action star of the \"old school\" movies. Is there anything missing here, or are we totally off base? \n",

Maybe forgettable is a better word. A movie that didn't do anything special, but didn't do anything wrong either. Bonus points if it's not a sequel.\n\nSo one that comes to mind is _The Man from U.N.C.L.E_. I didn't think it was a bad movie, but it definitely wasn't good either. The action scenes were okay, the acting was fine. I didn't dislike the film, or regret watching it, but after it was over, I just thought... meh, it was a movie.",

        "title": "Cliffhanger (1993) - Stallone\u2019s most Pyrrhic victory?",
        "content": "One of the things I can\u2019t shake with Cliffhanger is how hollow the victory feels. It\u2019s great that Gabe, Hal and Jessie survive, but let\u2019s recap their \u2018adventure\u2019 - Gabe fails to rescue Hal\u2019s gf and she plunges horribly to her death, Hal now hates Gabe.\n\nGabe is racked with guilt and returns for Jessie, who berates him for feeling guilty. At that exact moment, a team of psychotic criminals crash land above them and fake a distress call. Jessie guilt-trips Gabe into helping Hal get them down, only for them to have guns shoved in their faces on arrival, and forced to help the villains find their money, with the implication they\u2019ll be \u2018discarded\u2019 once they cease to be of use. As if these poor mountain folk aren\u2019t already dealing with enough tragedy.\n\nGabe\u2019s misfortune gets worse as he is relentlessly shot at, beaten, bombed, frozen, almost yanked off a mountain ledge. Meanwhile Hal is beaten, strangled, threatened and insulted.\n\nWorst of all though, he is made to watch his friends, Brett, Evan and even old Frank, get needlessly gunned down by the villains. Renny Harlin loves doing this - create some loveable characters and then murder them - like those passengers of Windsor 114 in Die Hard 2, including naughty kid, his parents, anxious old lady and (in the workprint) very young girl and her doll.\n\nIn the case of Frank, they hold down Hal as Frank approaches in the helicopter, knowing that its blades will drown out Hal\u2019s screams trying to warn him. Krystal shoves her gun in Frank\u2019s face, confusing the poor old geezer (\u2018but, I was trying to help you..?\u2019)\n\nThen they release Hal, teasing him with \u2018better run Tucker, a friend in need!\u2019 so they can relish gunning down Frank before Hal can save him. This is all done in slow motion of course (and was even gorier in the workprint). Hal comforts Frank in his dying moments (\u2018why?\u2019) as the villains make jokes. Krystel yells at Delmar \u2018you stupid maniac! No one told you to shoot!\u2019 but she only seems perturbed because she got Frank\u2019s blood on her pretty face. Delmar lightheartedly shrugs \u2018we\u2019ve wasted enough time\u2019.\n\nAll this stuff is rather traumatic and doesn\u2019t really fit the fun-action-movie mould, but listening to Renny\u2019s commentaries he likes to have his villains slaughter innocent people so that \u2018the audience will want Sylvester/Bruce to kill the villains\u2019.\n\nHe\u2019s right, but whereas Die Hard limits how much innocent life is taken to preserve the fun tone, Renny goes all in. It would be nice to have some requiem for Frank but we don\u2019t even see Hal tell Gabe about his death in the final cut This feels \u2018off\u2019 because the film rightly spent plenty of time processing Sarah\u2019s death, yet Frank - who is a more developed character and dies not from an accident, but cold-blooded murder - is swiftly forgotten about.\n\nSo yeah, Gabe, Hal and Jessie are stuck at the top of the mountain. Most of their friends are dead and they\u2019ve had the ever living sh\\*t beaten out of them, yet they\u2019re cracking jokes and laughing as credits role. Emotional congruence doesn\u2019t seem to be Harlin\u2019s forte.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting the that French title of the film translates as \u2018Only The Strong Survive\u2019 - that\u2019s certainly the disturbing thought I\u2019m left with as the upbeat score swells over the credits.",
