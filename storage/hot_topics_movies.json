The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze. The rat was a former pet of a ninja master and therefore uses his skills to train the four turtles in martial arts. They befriend a local journalist and with her help attempt to find the group behind a crime wave in New York City.\n\nAdapted from the early \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics\u201d with characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the movie achieved the then-seemingly impossible feat of bringing its reptilian heroes to full live-action with a team of puppeteers and a voice cast led by Brian Tochi (Revenge of the Nerds, Police Academy 3: Back in Training) as Leonardo, Corey Feldman (Stand By Me, The Goonies) as Donatello, Josh Pais (The Station Agent, A Beautiful Mind), as Raphael, Robbie Rist (Balto, \u201cDoc McStuffins\u201d) as Michelangelo and Kevin Clash (\u201cSesame Street,\u201d Muppet Treasure Island) as Splinter, the Turtles' master. The film also features Judith Hoag (Zodiac, Fallen) and Elias Koteas (Armageddon, Cadillac Man).\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* \u2022 Judith Hoag\n* \u2022 Elias Koteas\n* \u2022 Brian Tochi\n* \u2022 Corey Feldman\n* \u2022 Josh Pais\n* \u2022 Robbie Rist\n* \u2022 Kevin Clash\n* \u2022 James Saito\n* \u2022 David McCharen\n* \u2022 Michelan Sisti\n* \u2022 Leif Tilden\n* \u2022 David Forman\n* \u2022 Sam Rockwell\n* \u2022 Scott Wolf\n* \u2022 Skeet Ulrich\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAsk us anything!

Is it remotely \u201cbelievable\u201d? No. But \u201cNobody 2,\u201d like \u201cNobody\u201d before it, unfolds in its own weirdly grounded action-fantasy universe. Odenkirk has the ability to make behaving glumly fretful seem like a form of slyness; he\u2019s really creating a conspiracy with the audience.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-sharon-stone-1236342504/) (80):\n\n&gt;The filmmakers keep things moving at such a brisk pace (the film clocks in at a mercifully brief 89 minutes) that you go along for the ride, and there are so many terrific action sequences and injections of mordant, deadpan humor that it proves wildly entertaining.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk/) (79):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s like a National Lampoon movie where Chevy Chase is a mass murderer. That\u2019s a great pitch, dang it, and Timo Tjahjanto throws it at 105 miles per hour.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/nobody-2-review/v) (70):\n\n&gt;So while the familiarity is felt throughout, it's hard not to cheer, chuckle, and cringe at all the chaotic mayhem that unfolds in Nobody 2. It's not trying to be anything other than an ultra-violent late summer action flick, and if you go in expecting to watch some gnarly kills, brutal fist-fights, and gun-fu, you'd have to think pretty hard to feel disappointed.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-2-review) (70):\n\n&gt;Though not quite as strong as the first, Nobody 2 still consistently reminds us of how much fun it is to watch Bob Odenkirk unleash the action hero few expected he had within him. \u00a0\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1938864/nobody-2-movie-review/)(70):\n\n&gt;Will Nobody 2 set hearts aflame? No. If this had been the first \"Nobody,\" no one would have been clamoring for a sequel. But it is a glorious Saturday matin\u00e9e, a brisk trifle for the waning days of summer. It's the kind of movie that you'll remember better for the friends you saw it with than the movie itself. And that can be one of cinema's most important functions.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nobody-2-review-bob-odenkirk-1235144840/) (C-):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s really no sense of any particular care or passion in the sequel, which frequently feels like the hurried Wikipedia plot summary of a more fleshed-out film that doesn\u2019t actually exist.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDirected by Timo Tjahjanto:\n\n&gt;Workaholic assassin Hutch Mansell takes his family on a much-needed vacation to the small tourist town of Plummerville. However, he soon finds himself in the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator, a shady sheriff, and a bloodthirsty crime boss.\n\nCast:\n\n* Bob Odenkirk\u00a0as Hutch Mansell\n* Connie Nielsen\u00a0as Becca Mansell\n* John Ortiz\u00a0as Henry\n* RZA\u00a0as Harry Mansell\n* Colin Hanks\u00a0as Abel\n* Christopher Lloyd\u00a0as David Mansell\n* Sharon Stone\u00a0as Lendina",

        "content": "While exploring TMDB's dataset through their API, I discovered something amazing buried in the data. While analyzing film entries from different eras, I found movies from the **1870s-1880s** that I thought were data errors... turns out they're legit!\n\nSome highlights from cinema's infancy:\n\n**1874**: \"Passage of Venus\" - One of the earliest photographic sequences  \n**1878**: \"The Horse in Motion\" - Muybridge's famous study that proved horses lift all hooves when galloping  \n**1888**: \"Roundhay Garden Scene\" (Oct 14) - Often considered the world's first surviving film  \n**1888**: \"Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge\" (Oct 15) - Another Louis Le Prince masterpiece  \n\nThe decade breakdown from my research is wild:\n- 1870s: 6 films  \n- 1880s: 8 films  \n- 1890s: 2,021 films (cinema takes off!)  \n- 2010s: 269,645 films (peak modern production)  \n\nIt's incredible that TMDB goes this deep into film history. These aren't just \"movies\" - they're the actual birth moments of the entire medium we love.\n\nAnyone else dive this deep into TMDB's historical data? What other gems are hiding in there?",

        "content": "You know those movies you catch once and afterwards you\u2019re left wondering: *Did that actually happen, or did I dream it?* You tell a friend about them and they just stare at you like you\u2019re making the whole thing up.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s a very specific vibe: surreal, absurd, unsettling, sometimes just *weirdly specific* in their execution. They stick in my head for years, but they also feel like they\u2019ve slipped through the cracks of pop culture.\n\nHere are a few examples that live rent-free in my brain:\n\n1. Downsizing (2017)\n2. A Scanner Darkly (2006)\n3. Dreamcatcher (2003)\n4. The Road to Wellville (1994)\n5. Smokin Aces (2006)\n\nAnd these are pretty heavily stacked on the casting too. I know that Smokin' Aces and Downsizing are Reddit famous; But all regular folks I talk don't remember either; The other three are incredibly rare for me to find anyone that have seen it too.",

It's very of the time but what's really great is that there really isn't that usual trope of Jocks vs Nerds at Vince Lombardi High --- rather... you have Todd who IS a jock but not cool at all!  You have Engelbauer who is very nerdy, but he's basically running the school.  There is ONE \"nerd\" but someone needs to be the foil for all the students.  It's really about kids versus adults (with the exception of Mr. McGree)... rather than ramble on about this.  What say all of you?!",
