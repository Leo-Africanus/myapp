        "content": "Hey Reddit! I'm Clint Bentley, director of films like Jockey and co-writer of Sing Sing. I most recently adapted the novella Train Dreams by Denis Johnson with my longtime collaborator, Greg Kwedar. Looking forward to answering your questions! Check out the trailer here: [https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSYNOPSIS: Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th-century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation\u2019s railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality, and newfound meaning in the forests and trees he has felled. An ode to a vanishing way of life, an ever-evolving world, and to the extraordinary possibilities that exist within even the most simple of existences, Train Dreams captures a time and place that are now long gone, and the people who built a bridge to a future they could only dream of. Directed by Academy Award nominee Clint Bentley with a screenplay by Bentley and Academy Award nominee Greg Kwedar, the writing team behind Sing Sing, the film also stars Academy Award nominees William H. Macy and Kerry Condon.\n\n  \nStreaming on Netflix November 21",

        "content": "MILD SPOILERS BELOW:\n\nHow does Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro), who is shown throughout the film to be utterly meticulous and deeply cautious, allow Waingro (Kevin Gage), who is shown to be a serial rapist and murderer (not to mention a loose cannon, literally), to join his crew for the heist at the beginning of the movie? \n\nSince Waingro's actions are the inciting incident for much of the plot, including the critical denouement at the film's climax, this feels like a major issue that you can't just handwave away. It's an unmotivated/inexplicable action by McCauley, and it feels a bit sheisty that Mann starts the script only *after* Waingro has already joined the crew. It's not like he does some critical, irreplaceable job for them that it would be reasonable to take a risk with. Without some additional reasoning, such as when the crew takes a risk with driver Don Breenan (Dennis Haysbert) when under extreme time pressure, the whole thing with Waingro, and therefore much of the film's core narrative, seems totally out of character for McCauley.\n\nI've watched Heat dozens of times, I can quote the screenplay title to title from memory and, as I said, I think this is one of the best crime films ever made... but it may be built on a paper-thin foundation, unless I've missed something. \n\nPlease share your thoughts; I'm happy to be disabused of my misconceptions!",

I love Pedro Pascal but I\u2019m not really a romance/romcom fan so I waited to watch it on streaming and boy I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay the cost of a movie ticket. \n\nWhy was every character and shot so flat and lifeless and one-dimensional? Why couldn\u2019t this movie pick a tone? Did they think we wouldn\u2019t get the moral of the story after seventeen different monologues about how \u201clove isn\u2019t about checking boxes\u201d? Who thought it was a good idea to have a poorly handled SA-themed plot twist 2/3 into the movie that seems only to serve as a \u201clesson\u201d for the deeply unlikeable protagonist? \n\nThe editing was also so bizarre. There was no reason for this movie to be two hours long and a lot of the scenes felt like there was some kind of time quota they were trying to reach. And in that time, most of the characters don\u2019t go through any meaningful development and in some cases even end up going right back to making choices that the movie already made a point to show didn\u2019t work the first time. \n\nWhat\u2019s wild to me is that the press tour for this movie was delightful and proved these people absolutely can have chemistry together but none of that was present in the actual film. \n\nI haven\u2019t watched Past Lives so I don\u2019t know if this is a director problem or a this movie problem but\u2026yikes.

        "content": "I introduced this movie to my son last night. This is only the second time I\u2019ve rewatched it, but I remember enjoying the movie the first time in the early 2000s. Here are some observations:\n\n1. Tom Hanks can play a bad guy \u2014 albeit a principled bad guy. But the prosthetic nose seemed unnecessary to me. \n\n2. The actor who played Michael did a credible job and looks like a young Ray Liotta (minus the blue eyes; RIP). \n\n3. Paul Newman was still bringing the heat, just a few years before his death. I liked his choice of a vague Irish brogue \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been living in America for many years presumably. His piano duet with Hanks was incredible, setting up the triangle with Newman\u2019s bio son without any dialogue.\n\nWhen he chastises his son in front of his mob captains, he bangs his hand HARD on the table. At his advanced age! \n\n4. Daniel Craig epitomized the entitled, soft brat of a son. \n\n5. Jennifer Jason Leigh was underutilized. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the performance that stole the film\u2026\n\n6. Jude Law was the original Night Crawler, right? On my second viewing, I noticed he was styled like Nosferatu (balding, disgusting teeth with long, dirty nails). He was absolutely ghoulish. \n\nLaw\u2019s diner performance with Tom Hanks was some really fine acting. Memorably fine. \n\nHonorable mention to Stanley Tucci as the put-upon mob mercenary. \n\nOverall, this movie is really good, although the pacing could have been better because it dragged in sections The wrap-up was predictable, but very satisfying.",

I mean it\u2019s about getting older and about connection betweena middle-age woman trying to survive in a messed up sexist and racist world and an older guy who feels lonely.\n\nI like that there are so many moments where you\u2019re just kind of watching the characters and you have time to really reflect on things. It\u2019s not like nonstop action. Nothing against nonstop action of course, but the character study is quite fascinating. And you got complex characters. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain.\n\nFunny, until recently, I didn\u2019t know that this was actually based on a novel. And that\u2019s rare for a Tarantino film. Maybe that\u2019s why Jackie Brown feels different to me. \nUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t read the novel so I don\u2019t really know how close of an adaptation it is.\n\nNevertheless, I really like Jackie Brown and I think it\u2019s one of those movies you can just watch it again and again and as you get older, you relate to it more and more.\n\nOh, and the movie is also got some pretty funny dialogue and one liners. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote. \n\n Robbie: My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.\n\nEdit: christ, I forgot to mention the great cast (Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda), and fantastic acting. Even a young Chris Tucker does a pretty good job too with his minor role too.",

Not to mention it's this family from Michigan just trying to get their weird, artistic daughter to California. \n\nIf you haven't seen it, this movie deserved better. I'd love it to get a full theatrical release. As it was intended to get. It had a limited one but was cut out because of the pandemic.\n\nSo give it love on Netflix. It's so insanely fun.",

Probably in a major city like Tokyo or Osaka.",

        "content": "I liked it a lot.\n\nSince I knew nothing of le Carr\u00e9's work or Smiley, and went into it blind, I wasn't sure most of the movie and before the reveal whether Smiley was the mole or not and playing everyone. He gives this smirk whenever key information is revealed and it's like he is amused how far people before him/catching upto him have come but it isn't going to matter since HE IS THE MOLE and they lost now.\n\nWhile he was he narrating the story to Benedict Cumberbatch's character about meeting Karla for the first time, I was wondering the whole time whether he was bullshitting and giving a fake story. Maybe he IS the real Karla and the one in Russia is a \"fake one\" setup by him himself. Basically Usual Suspect-ing us. Also the way that shot was framed and filmed, it was like he was talking to himself(since I thought he IS karla) and the other chair was empty meaning There IS NO KARLA strong arming my suspision that he could be the mole. Also he doesn't remember the face of the now \"HEAD OF RUSSIA\"? That was pretty sus to me. I guess he saw him too long time ago but he should atleast remember his important features.\n\nI honestly don't know if it was intentional or not or if that was just how I was interpreting it. Was Smiley intentionally made to be a Red herring for newbies like me? I later learnt that Smiley is a famous character in the books and other media so for a newbie coming into this movie, were people like me also sus of smilie too? Or did a majority of the target audience knew he was a \"good\" guy beforehard and were never sus of him and were just focusing on the real mole between the 4 main candidates.\n\nAlso Benedict Cumberbatch's character, since I was so sus of Smiley, I felt was the perfect fall guy since he was doing most of the dirty work. I felt smiley was setting him up so he would die at somepoint and blame one of the 4 so Smiley will be free of any suspicious and keep on continue being the mole now being the head of the department.\n\nAnd was the woman who was executed in front of Jim in the torture chamber, the same one Tom Hardy's character got the mole info from? That's pretty grim honestly. Doesn't he still think she is alive and they are going to trade her back?\n\nAll The deaths in this movies are just so brutal and bloody.\n\nAnd at the end, Bill was going to be traded back to the Russians? But then Jim killed him because the betrayl was just too much? That would just fk up the deal that were going to do with the Russians. And Bill will get arrested. I suppose he had nothing left to loose. He is a true loner now. Drove the kid away too.\n\nHonestly Pretty smart move planned by Karla to throw off Smiley by Bill seducing his wife.\n\nI liked the Christmas scenes. Everyone was \"happy\"\n\nThe ending montage was great with that french song.\n\nThis feels like those movies that get better on a rewatch. Am excited to rewatch it again someday.",
