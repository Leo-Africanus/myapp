        "content": "Hi Reddit. I'm Eric Lin. I directed ROSEMEAD, which stars Lucy Liu, Lawrence Shou, Orion Lee, Jennifer Lim, Madison Hu, and James Chen. It opens nationwide and in Canada this weekend 1/9.\n\nROSEMEAD is the first feature I've directed though I've shot many films as a cinematographer. Some of those films include HEARTS BEAT LOUD, THE SOUND OF SILENCE, I SMILE BACK, EQUITY, and THE EXPLODING GIRL.\n\n**ROSEMEAD's synopsis:**\n\nInspired by the harrowing true story, Lucy Liu transforms in a riveting, career-redefining performance as an ailing woman who takes drastic measures to protect her troubled teenage son (Lawrence Shou). As his dark obsessions grow and time runs out, she is forced to make impossible choices: how far will she go and what is she willing to sacrifice? Set against the simmering tensions of a Chinese American community, ROSEMEAD is a gripping portrait of a family pushed to the edge.\n\n**Watch the trailer here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD](https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD)\n\nIt's a story about the desperate need for connection and it's a film that was meant to be seen and shared with other people. Please check it out in theaters this weekend.\n\nI'll be back on Tuesday 1/13 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to chat.\n\nAsk me anything! Talk to you all on Tuesday.",

I love that movie and it\u2019s become a holiday classic, and while it does a great job of being a holiday movie I realized it\u2019s also such a New Yorker movie, as well. I love all the different scenes in the famous landmarks like Central Park, Lincoln Center and so on, and the characters and writing have a real New York feeling, at least to someone like me that hasn\u2019t lived in the city. \n\nWhat other movies do something like this? Where the themes or genre don\u2019t need to rely on the setting but the movie still does a great job of capturing the setting. Would love to hear some suggestions, one of the things I look for in movies is making the cities feel alive and beautiful in their own way.",

The kind of moment where the room goes quiet and heads turn your way.\n\nI was watching TV at my brother's place with his in-laws in the room when *Downfall* came on. Not exactly a feel good movie, but seeing Nazis eat shit for a few hours didn't seem like such a bad time.\n\nEverything was fine until a scene about halfway through. The Russians are closing in, the war is clearly lost, all hope going if not yet gone. Eva Braun and her friend Trudi share a quiet smoke and some girl talk in a corner. The conversation turns to relationships, and Trudi asks Eva about what Hitler is *really* like in private.\n\nShe looks pensive for a moment, then quietly says, \"He's changed...\"\n\n***ADOLF FUCKING HITLER HE'S CHANGED JESUS GOOSESTEPPING CHRIST***\n\nI lost it. Couldn't help myself. Literally rolling on the floor. Hurt to breathe, nearly collapsed a lung. Disapproving looks did not sober me up at all. Could have been worse, of course.

For context, movies I\u2019ve cried at are Beautiful boy, the fault in our stars, the boy in the striped pyjamas, five feet apart, and the greatest showman (yes these are all sad movies except the latter, i cried during the \u201cthis is me\u201d song lol). But these weren\u2019t proper cries, I only cried a little. Now I want a movie that\u2019ll make me sob hysterically, please and thank you. :)) ",

        "content": "The last 20 minutes of the original movie\n\nI rewatched the original after a lot of years and realised how monumentally they conveyed the tension that built in these scenes. You could see all the time in the facial expressions and body language of Ripley how she felt under pressure and in the technical effects with light and vapour and sound. At the final scene where the heroine goes in cryosleep we can witness a powerful image of coming to peace. Even though I knew very well how it ends i still got the goosebumps during all the scenes from the final act. ",
