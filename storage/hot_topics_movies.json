        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

In any case, I just watched All the President's Men, which I've watched about 5 or 6 times since it first came out. This one is excellent on so many levels! For starters, it's based on the true story of the Watergate break-in, which happened just a few years before the movie came out and was thus still big news. And what's more, the story is amazing in-and-of itself! As they say, the truth is often stranger than fiction, and this is a case in point! Until 1972, who would have believed that such a huge illegal operation was going on, administrated by our own president! To me, the silver lining behind all this was the ability of the free press, the Washington Post in this case, to get to the bottom of all this and expose it to the public, which is free speech in action, without which our democracy could not stand. \n\nUnfortunately, since then, I'd say we've slid downhill tremendously, since most of our news sources have become untrustworthy and we now allow known criminals to occupy our highest positions of power. Those of you who still care about what our country stands for, in particular, what our founding fathers have created for us, ought to take this movie and its message seriously and still stand for our democracy, which I sincerely hope never dies!

That might bother some people, but for me it worked.\n\nIt gives you space. You can just enjoy the momentum, or start noticing what sits underneath. Identity, ambition, control, addiction. It doesn\u2019t explain much, and that\u2019s what I liked about it.\n\nThe film doesn\u2019t pretend to be deep, but something stays with you. Not loud or dramatic, just a quiet weight that builds over time.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it a masterpiece, but I\u2019d still be interested in seeing more from that world.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen it recently, how did it land for you?

Spider-Man 2, The Incredibles, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the King, Chicken Little, etc.\n\nSome were surprisingly good, others were\u2026 not, but I kind of miss that era where studios tried to extend the movie experience through games.\n\nRecently I noticed an indie film called Connection that got turned into a story-driven game (called *Stay Alive for Me*), and it made me realize how rare that crossover has become.\n\nDo you think that kind of movie/game synergy could ever come back, or was it just a weird relic of that time?",

I think it\u2019s a bit underrated, but such a good one to get me into the season. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s Halloween (1978) and I usually watch the OG Psycho, not the 98 remake. We don\u2019t talk about that one haha",

        "title": "Coraline Explained",
        "content": "*When I was a child and Coraline first released I was horrified of the film and could never watch it all the way through. Now that I am an adult I finally have and I think after reading both the novel and seeing the film I finally understand the film.*\n\nWatching Coraline for the first time as an adult was a completely different experience than what my childhood fears imagined. As a kid, I couldn\u2019t make it through the movie \u2014 the eerie button eyes and the uncanny world terrified me. But now, watching it as a 20-year-old, I realized it\u2019s more than just a creepy stop-motion film. It\u2019s a dark, symbolic story about temptation, neglect, and identity.\n\n**The Beldam (Other Mother)**\nThe Beldam represents manipulation disguised as love. She\u2019s the embodiment of temptation \u2014 offering Coraline everything she craves: attention, delicious meals, and parents who seem to care. But her perfection is artificial. Her goal isn\u2019t to nurture; it\u2019s to possess. By creating a fantasy world tailored to Coraline\u2019s desires, she lures her into complacency. The Beldam symbolizes toxic relationships and how abusers often present charm before revealing control. Her button eyes, stitched smile, and spider-like body reflect how she spins emotional webs to trap her victims.\n\n**The Ghost Children**\nThe ghost children are tragic warnings of what happens when someone gives in. They once accepted the Beldam\u2019s offer, trading their freedom for false happiness. Now, they exist as lost souls, forever voiceless and unseen. They guide Coraline by showing the price of giving up one\u2019s will. Their fading presence adds emotional weight \u2014 they\u2019re victims of neglect and manipulation, reminding us how easily innocence can be stolen.\n\n**The Symbolism of the Eyes**\nEyes are a major theme throughout the film, symbolizing awareness, truth, and identity. The Beldam\u2019s request to have Coraline sew buttons over her eyes represents surrendering one\u2019s perception and individuality. Once the buttons replace real eyes, a person no longer \u201csees\u201d reality \u2014 they become blind to deception. Coraline\u2019s refusal to lose her eyes is her refusal to lose herself.\n\n**The Cat**\nThe black cat is both mysterious and wise, acting as Coraline\u2019s moral compass. Unlike other characters, he moves freely between worlds, representing insight, instinct, and independence. His sarcastic but protective attitude helps Coraline realize that courage doesn\u2019t mean being fearless \u2014 it means choosing to act despite fear. The cat also reflects the adult voice of reason, challenging Coraline\u2019s assumptions and encouraging her to think critically.\n\n**The Ending**\nIn the end, Coraline triumphs by using her cleverness, bravery, and empathy. She doesn\u2019t just defeat the Beldam; she grows. Returning home, she learns to appreciate her real parents and the imperfect but genuine love they provide. The garden scene at the end mirrors her emotional transformation \u2014 from isolation to connection. Watching this as an adult, the message hits harder: life isn\u2019t about fantasy or perfection. It\u2019s about authenticity, resilience, and self-trust \u2014 values that only come from facing, not fleeing, the real world.\n\nI\u2019d like to also add that I confidently believe that the cat disappearing into the signpost signifies that the Other World still exists and The Beldam still has a mental grasp on Coraline even if she escaped the evil witch\u2019s hands.",

I just had to rewatch the movie (and was thrilled that Dr J. Allen Hynek was the advisor on the movie and had a cameo in it). Does anyone know how much of the movie (i.e. scenes such as power outages and seeing UFOs out on the highway) were taken from real stories?  Did Spielberg write the entire screenplay?",

Not over-used, underlined the emotions of the scenes, and paired with the perfect song. Zach Snyder comes to mind, I know he can be heavy handed with it, but still I loved 300 when I was younger and I think Watchmen had some good examples. Is there a movie or scene that you think has the perfect use of slow-mo?",

        "content": "An 84% RT rating and 74/100 on Metacritic, plus the reunion of Spike and Denzel, plus the fact it's a modern day remake of a Kurosawa classic convinced me to give this a go. And wow, it's bad.   I know Spike can be hit or miss sometimes but this was miss for me on all fronts. Not even Denzel could save this for me. I honestly think it might be his worst performance. And the acting across the rest of the cast is just as bland and uninspired, especially the lady playing his wife and the kid playing his son and ASAP Rocky who is woefully miscast and has 0 screen presence. I think the only person I even kind of enjoyed watching was Jefferey Wright. The random celeb cameos were unnecessary and took me right out of the movie. I get that this is Spike trying to pay homage to New York by getting as many NY names in here as possible but I think he definitely could have gone about it in a better way. And also, is it not weird to anyone else that the rich characters escape this whole situation unscathed and the poor/lower class characters are brutalized, racially profiled, maimed, put in jail,  etc.?? What exactly is the message here? I really struggle to see what critics enjoyed so much about it. Maybe a fan of this movie can give me some idea of why it worked for them, and encourage a rewatch.",
