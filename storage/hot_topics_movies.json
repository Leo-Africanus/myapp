To the shock of many who knew her, detectives on the scene treated her death as a suicide until her autopsy results came back with the cause of death ruled a homicide.

        "content": "I noticed while watching one of my favourite films on streaming that the Coens have gone back and edited one of my favourite scenes in it. In the original cut, when Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is about to be roughed up by one of Johnny Caspar's goons to make him talk, he asks for a moment and the henchman raises his hands and holds back. Tom then grabs a chair and hits him across the face,.presumably breaking his nose. Said goon with perfect comic timing holds his hands over his broken nose and says \"Jesus Tom\" and walks out of the room. This last bit has now been cut from the version on streaming and the Criterion Collection Blu Ray. Why???? It was a small funny moment in a great gangster picture that is full of these perfect little Coen touches. I don't understand why they would take it out now 35 years later. It's still funny and it doesn't ruin the tone of the scene.\n\nIn general I am all for having the directors original vision kept intact even years after the fact if the film was edited by the studio or if the budget was slashed, etc. but they were obviously happy with it originally, why change it now?? Surely there is something to be said for giving something away to the audience once you have released a cut you were happy with and no longer touching it.\n\nI shall have to keep my DVD forever now.",
