The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze.

From the eerie silence to the blood-soaked chaos, every scene builds dread. It\u2019s not your typical vampire movie there\u2019s no romance or charm here, just raw survival and horror.

        "content": "Every once in a while I\u2019ll remember a movie that got announced years ago, made a bunch of noise... and then just disappeared. Like it was gonna be a thing, people were attached, maybe even a script got written, and then nothing. Either it\u2019s technically still \u201cin development\u201d or it quietly died and no one said anything.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s easily the 21 Jump Street / Men in Black crossover. That\u2019s such a stupid idea but also exactly the kind of stupid I love. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill somehow getting wrapped up in alien stuff? That could\u2019ve been gold. And there was real talk of it happening. Like script written, people attached, it almost existed. What the hell happened??\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of others that pop into my head from time to time, stuff like Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Lovecraft movie, Fincher doing a Jules Verne thing, or all those weird Star Wars spinoffs that probably died the second someone changed jobs at Disney. And then there\u2019s stuff like Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, which sounds insane but apparently almost existed?\n\nAnd there\u2019s so many others. Whole graveyard of weird, wild, or straight-up insane projects that almost happened. Most of them probably wouldn\u2019t have even worked, but I still wish we got to see the mess.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one for you? The movie that got scrapped, delayed to death, or is still fake-alive in \u201cdevelopment\u201d that you\u2019d instantly buy a ticket for if it suddenly came back?\n\n",

But when it comes to African cinema, we\u2019re carving our own path, and it\u2019s working. Still, I\u2019m curious:  \nWhat makes YOU hit play on an African film?  \n\n- Is it raw authenticity? (No safari clich\u00e9s \ud83d\udc18 \ud83d\ude05)  \n- Unheard perspectives? (e.g., Lagos cyberpunk, ancient folklore reimagined)  \n- Cultural deep dives? (Food, music, traditions that feel lived-in)  \n- Or just damn good storytelling that happens to be African?  \n\n\ud83c\udfac What\u2019s MISSING in mainstream cinema that African films deliver?  \n- Do you crave non-Western heroes?  \n- Locations that aren\u2019t NYC or London?  \n- Stories where colonialism isn\u2019t the only plot?  \n\nYes, a Hollywood blockbuster often gets more eyeballs in Africa than our own films. But that\u2019s changing. Shows like Blood &amp; Water and films like The Woman King proved our stories travel.  \n\nSo, lay it on me:\n- What African films/shows gripped you? (Nollywood, Riverwood, Ghollywood\u2014all count!)  \n- What tropes should we BURN? \ud83d\udc40  \n- What would make you say \u201cShut up and take my money!\u201d \ud83d\udcb8  \n\nP.S. African creators\u2014chime in! What\u2019s working locally vs. globally?",

Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gave a strong performance and Jodelle Ferland as Lilith was genuinely chilling. The movie does a great job of slowly shifting from social drama to full on supernatural terror. It\u2019s one of those films that keeps you second guessing if it\u2019s all in her head or if this is really a demon child. The scene with the hornets still gets under my skin. I know it didn\u2019t get great reviews back then but I think it deserves more love especially for horror fans who enjoy subtle buildup and disturbing child villains. Anyone else think Case 39 deserves a reappraisal?\n\n",

A simple story that all takes in a matter of hours and just has a certain energy to the pacing that makes it one of the shortest 2 hours films I've ever watched.\n\nWhen they say no one knows how to shoot LA like Michael Mann, they really aren't kidding imo. So many amazing shots of the city's landscape throughout this film.\n\nMichael Mann's directing style is just absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique out there that gives this film a unique identity as well.\n\nTom Cruise as this move's villain is maybe my favorite role he's ever done as well. It's nice to see an actor who's constantly playing the hero play the villain for once and boy, does Cruise do that well here.\n\nOf course, there are times where some realism and laws of physics are probably sacrificed for a more compelling plot, but I thought that was fine in term of the overall narrative.\n\nThis is definitely one movie I highly recommend seeing if you haven't yet. 10/10 in my book.",
