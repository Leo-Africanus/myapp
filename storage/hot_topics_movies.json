        "title": "2 Takes on the Same Scene: Manhunter-Red Dragon Will Graham and Hannibal",
        "content": "Watching these two versions back-to-back, I was struck with the feeling that the Manhunter scene is far more effective than the Red Dragon version despite the scenes having mostly the same essential dialogue (I've not read the book, but the similarities in both suggest to me that these scenes are relatively faithful to Harris' depiction).\n\nManhunter plays out relatively flatly. At this point in the film as well as in the culture at large, Hannibal Lektor (Lecter) was a complete unknown. We know from what that film tells us is that he was a former psychiatrist and maniac killer, but it's all academic. So when we see him in his cell, it is very easy to underestimate his intelligence and, more importantly, the depths of his evil. It's only when he really starts fucking with Will that we start to understand that this isn't a human being. It's a monster wearing human skin.\n\nRed Dragon, on the other hand, has the luxury as well as the burden of Anthony Hopkins' truly terrifying previous performance as Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs. That is where most people in the audience were first introduced to the character **and also** got to see how dangerous he really is. That's a luxury because A. in Red Dragon the audience already knows who this Hannibal is and therefore doesn't need an explanation to \"get it\" but also because B. the audience *wants* to see Hopkins go nuts as the character. But it's a burden because having seen what the character does in SOTL (as well as \"Hannibal\"), Red Dragon now has to somehow top that without letting the good doctor out of his cell. It's hard line to walk.\n\nUnfortunately, all Ratner and Hopkins came up with to do that (maybe it's all that anybody could do) is to re-hash the dungeon scenes from Demme's film. The result is really not that effective in my view. In Manhunter, Lektor knows he's effectively neutralized and so he just takes pleasure in fucking with Graham because that's all he has left. Graham is always in control of the meetings and Lektor always has to capitulate. But in Red Dragon, Ratner still tries to use Hannibal to scare both Graham and the audience and it just comes off as . . . well silly, when you get right down to it. Graham has already caught Lecter. He's locked up. His efforts at intimidation amount to little more than posturing and anyone in Graham's position would see right through them.\n\nAnyway, that's what I think.\n\nHere are the two scenes. I know some folks will find the sterility and near banality of the Manhunter scene tonally uncreepy and therefore less effective, which is fair. I just find the Grand Guignol treatment in Red Dragon to be artificial and therefor not particularly frightening.\n\n[Red Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqw-QEOnUtM)\n\n[Manhunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN244X4OiLQ)",

        "content": "For me, music is key to a great film. My favourite film is the Good the Bad and the Ugly, which as we all know, has a absolute masterpiece of a soundtrack from the great Ennio Morricone. However it doesn't have to be an original song or score for it to be great, for example one one of the main songs in Apocalypse Now is \"The End\" by the Doors, which I think fits the vibe of Apocalypse Now perfectly. Another example is Forest Gump, which uses loads of different songs from that 60s period which helps to add to the atmosphere they are creating.\n\nSo my question is, what are some of your personal favourites?",

He has such a distinctive voice and sometimes the father talks immediately after the narrator and it was so obvious, even as a child, that it was the same actor, even though the characters were so very different. \n\nThis also happened in Deadwood when Garret Dillahunt played one character in the first season and then another character in later seasons. I kept waiting for it to come out that he was a secret twin brother or something! ",

The final frame of it was the A24 logo, and I tripped out wondering how old they were.\n\nApparently, Aronofsky made a deal for the rights to the film to eventually circle back to him. In 2023, they did, and he ended up selling the rights to A24. They've become a sort of meme because they're making films left and right now, but I guess I can't do much besides respect their hustle. \n\n\\[The link to the article I read\\](https://web.archive.org/web/20230302100250/https://variety.com/2023/film/news/a24-darren-aronofsky-pi-imax-release-1235539577/)",
