        "content": "It was a realistic and true ending, especially in the\n80s teen sex comedy genre. \n\nAwkward guy has an attractive friend who screws over girl. Awkward guy likes girl. Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

        "content": "\n\nHonestly, I was quite disappointed. I expected a movie revolving around the cloning plot. Specifically, the idea of two Mickeys existing at the same time due to an error. That would have been a great movie! Instead, what was advertised as the main concept feels like a subplot in the movie. Essentially the entire thing revolves around the intelligent aliens. And then there was also the plot with Mark Ruffalo being an obvious stand in for Trump. But then there was also the subplot with Steven Yuen.\n\nI finished the movie feeling incredibly confused, because how did they mess up the initial concept like this? The idea of a guy who is constantly sent on deadly missions and is revived is an absolutely golden idea. It also leads to an interesting discussion about consciousness and if a copy of you is still really you. But that\u2019s barely even brought up. The whole plot with two versions of Mickey is completely sidelined. Which makes no sense at all. That should have 100% been the main conflict in the movie, like it was advertised as. Instead, we got a mess.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the movie horrible, but I definitely didn\u2019t like it as much as I hoped I would.",

I went and saw it twice in a weekend when it came out and its the most fun I've had in theater in like 2 decades. The way they went back to horror rather than an action film is probably what instantly earned my approval. While I realize its not a piece of art in the way something like there will be blood is, its still wildly fun which in my opinion is something that has been missing from movies for a long time now (with exceptions of course). Hell, its been a few months now and i still will just randomly smile thinking about a new *good* alien movie as I enter my 40s lol. Almost makes me emotional haha. Its just the coolest monster design by a country mile for me. The show is a little disjointed but I *love* how animalistic the xeno moves in it but I digress...",

By the end I actually felt a little lighter like it didn\u2019t fix my problems or anything but I wasn\u2019t as tense and it made me wonder if that\u2019s just me avoiding real life for a couple of hours or if rewatching something familiar really does help your brain decompress.  \nAnyone else get that feeling when they throw on an old favorite?",

        "content": "Now, plot \"devices\" don't need to be actual physical things, they can be information or situations or characters, but the one that stands out to me is in fact a device: the Stark Industries \"fabricator\" from *Spider-Man: No Way Home*.\n\nIn a cinematic universe full of magical stones and space gods and whatnot, that fabricator is egregious, IMO. Peter's vague and hand-wavey explanation of it is almost insulting:\n\n&gt; \"It can analyze, design, construct basically anything.\"\n\nThat's it. Magic box can just do everything, no questions, no issues. The story needs Peter to develop a cure for everyone's villainy, so here's the Box That Develops Cures for Everyone's Villainy.\n\nWhat other examples are out of there of outstandingly lazy plot devices?",

        "content": "I have a personal theory, based solely on acendotal observations, that the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark is the most parodied movie scene of all time. Specifically the part where Indy swaps the golden idol for the bag of sand and then escapes from the boulder. \n\nThe scene is perfect to parody because it's visually memorable (obviously), easy to replicate in other situations and characters, and doesn't involve any dialogue. Even kid shows can parody it since there's nothing too adult about the scene.\n\nNow, I have no way of proving this without watching and cataloging hundreds of hours of film and tv (not to mention comics, video games, etc). That being said, does anyone else agree? \n\nIf not, what scene do you think has been parodied more? Or what scenes are runners up for the title?\n",
