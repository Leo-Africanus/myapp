        "title": "Alfred Hitchcock's \"Lifeboat\" (1944) was a unusual offering from the master of suspense but it's a genuine and sublime find for anyone willing to give it a look. Tallulah Bankhead provides the right kind of camp.",
        "content": "I had \"Lifeboat\" on VHS when I was 10 years old and I must have seen that movie a lot of times. I was so invested on that B&amp;W picture and made me realize movies weren't just about space ships or adventurers or pratfalls but about human emotions as well as kitsch. \n\nTallulah Bankead was a great surprise, she looked like Bette Davis (I saw All About Eve prior to this) but there was something about her which stood out, the smoky voice, the stylish coat, the debonair way of expressing herself and this was her stuck in a dingy by herself until more people showed up. And she had quite a strong chemistry with the much younger John Hodiak (so handsome and so talented. Sad he had to die so young), their scenes together going from tension and hostility to increasing sexual tension as she swoons over his Tattoed chest. The cast is marvelous: William Bendix, Mary Anderson (very earthy portrait), Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak (outstanding as the morally ambiguous Nazi soldier who is taken in by the group of survivors), Henry Hull, Heather Angel (brief but sad) and a memorable turn by Canada Lee, his eulogy speech being a particular highlight. \n\nWhile the film is about this group's fight for survival in the middle of the Ocean, it's also about trust and overcoming one's differences. Even in a boat, you still see the class differences between each person. Bankhead's Connie still tries to keep her society lady composure but as she loses each of her items, she starts to drop her countenance, even letting her hair down. \n\nThere's so much to discuss about the movie. I also love the way the relationships are shown, how Cronyn playing with Anderson's hair is just as sexy as any sex scene in a modern movie. It also shows how the lack of food and water can drive someone to madness as we see with the Bendix character who goes from being a goofy and lovable guy to losing his marbles in a slow and unfortunate way.",
