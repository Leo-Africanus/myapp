I\u2019ve already watched and loved Interstellar, Severance, Moon, and I\u2019m really excited about The Three-Body Problem.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated by stories that dive into deep concepts like time, space, consciousness, and the mysteries of existence while wrapping them in captivating narratives and stunning visuals. The kind of content that keeps you thinking, \"What if\u2026?\"\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing out on some hidden gems or even well-known classics that I haven\u2019t come across yet. So, I\u2019m turning to the community for help.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for sci-fi movies or shows that are:\n\nMind-bending and thought-provoking?\nVisually stunning or have a unique storytelling style?\nFocused on deeper themes rather than just action?\nThey don\u2019t have to be super recent; I\u2019m happy to explore older classics or lesser-known titles too.\n\nWhether it\u2019s something like Arrival, Dark, Primer, or even lesser-known works that deserve more recognition, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Also, if there are international titles or indie projects in the same genre, feel free to share those as well!\n\nLooking forward to building a new watchlist based on your suggestions. Thanks in advance for helping me dive deeper into the sci-fi world!\n\nCheers",

To me, though, it's just strange to find movies where the filmmakers spent so much time detailing all the aspects of a new reality only to never realize how dull the end product would be. With all the pre-viz cinematics, table reads, and rough edits only to lose sight of the sum of all the parts. Obviously no one knows everything and it's great to take these risks, it's still fascinating.\n\nFor example, [City of Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHf7UhHpmE).\n\n[Mortal Engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsFc2gguEg).\n\n[Tomorrowland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ7O-RrATY).\n\n[Renaissance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ftZhphGgwo) (bit of a cheat since it's animated but the new whiz bang tech for it demanded a solid story idea)",

        "title": "Wild Strawberries: The Title's True Meaning",
        "content": "I recently rewatched *Wild Strawberries* (Smultronst\u00e4llet), Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1957 classic. Since my Netflix is set to English, it displayed the English title, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice how the translation loses the symbolism of the original Swedish one.\n\nThe Swedish title, Smultronst\u00e4llet, literally means \"a wild strawberry patch,\" but it\u2019s more commonly used idiomatically to refer to a special, idyllic place. It could be a place that holds nostalgia or simply somewhere where you feel safe and happy.\n\nThis symbolism is woven beautifully into the movie. Isak Borg, the protagonist, revisits key moments of his past, including a visit to his childhood home. One particular memory involves the girl he loved picking wild strawberries. However, instead of this being a moment of joy, it\u2019s ironic, as she\u2019s seen picking strawberries while cheating on him, turning his *smultronst\u00e4lle* (both childhood home and a wild strawberry patch) into a symbol of loss and missed opportunities.\n\nI think the original title adds depth to the film, especially as it underscores the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and memory. It\u2019s a clever piece of symbolism that doesn\u2019t quite come through in the English title.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this small piece of trivia about an excellent movie!",

        "content": "From [Fangoria.com](http://Fangoria.com) in an interview with Bill Skarsgard, when asked about the specific inspirations for the character of Count Orlok in Nosferatu (2024):\n\n&gt;\"There were a lot of different things. There was a Bulgarian movie called\u00a0*Time of Violence*\u2014a great movie, over four hours long, set in Bulgaria in the 17th century. And there\u2019s this guy, the antagonist of the\u00a0movie, taking over a village and forcibly converting Christians, and it\u2019s incredibly violent and horrible. That performance was something Robert talked a lot about in terms of who Orlok could have been when he was alive. We\u00a0talked about\u00a0that one a\u00a0lot,\u00a0and\u00a0various different\u00a0things\u2014little snippets from here and there.\n\n&gt;But that was during the very early stages.\u00a0Once you start delving deeper into a character, hopefully, you start getting inspiration from whatever\u00a0it is\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0actually\u00a0working on,\u00a0and that\u00a0creates seeds that come out of it.\u00a0**Robert also wrote a backstory for Orlok, just a few pages, that he shared with me, which was also very helpful.**\"\n\nI know that in the original movie and the book, Orlok/Dracula wasn't fleshed out since he served as simply being a figure of pure darkness and evil. He didn't need the background or some kind of crazy backstory, he just needed to fulfill the role in the story (alongside backstories not being as much of a focus for the time). But to hear that Robert apparently did some amount of expansion on Orlok's character got me super intrigued, and makes me wonder if anyone actually knows what this backstory is that Robert wrote?\n\nI expect this to go nowhere since the movie is relatively quite new, but I figured I'd ask the wider movie community to see if I can be surprised.\n\nEDIT: I've been *thoroughly* surprised, haha.",

        "content": "Last night, I got to see \"A Letter to Three Wives\" and while the three leading ladies were superb, Linda Darnell was the standout. Besides being mesmerizingly beautiful, like a Greek statue in motion, she wasn't just a beautiful woman, she could act and her scenes with Paul Douglas and Thelma Ritter display a prowess in delivering acid-tongued one-liners with aplomb. \n\nSadly, her career started to falter in the 1950s, a string of commercial failures as well as being typecast in sex-symbol parts and never being challenged as an actress. \n\nShe died young in 1965, from a house fire. She was trapped on the second floor of the home by heat and smoke, as the fire had started in the living room. She was found, still alive,  next to the burning living-room sofa, with 80% of her body burned. She died soon after.",

        "title": "This year, I watched over 365 movies. Here's an assortment of favourites, surprises, and thoughts.",
        "content": "So, why did I decide do this? Short answer: Twitch streamer Northernlion and Cine2Nerdle Battles, the former a movie trivia machine, and the latter a movie-trivia PVP game. Hoping some folks are familiar with both or either as explaining makes this giant post even bigger. Anyway, those got me to finally make a Letterboxd, and set me on a movie frenzy which peaked in early January. So I figured I'd try and get through a year's worth. One a day was already kind of out the window as I started late, but 365 seemed surprisingly doable given the appetite I suddenly had for it (and sure enough I went over). There were so many classics I hadn't seen, recent beloved movies I didn't get to see in theatre, etc. Hilariously, I actually thought I'd \"run out\" of the best stuff before the year was out, but of course that's patently absurd, especially with some of the choices I made. I suppose I should apologize up front for the anime movies too, which some might consider boorish to count, but what the hell, I wanted to see them. I ended up with 391 movies new to me, including 11 rewatches, mostly to show my wife or prepare for a sequel. \n\nThat all said, I don't recommend this. It's easy to burn out and just really not be in the mood some days when you're stuck on such a goal. There were some days I put on a movie I knew I wouldn't be too concerned about, and I'm sure you can notice them. And really, I only had the luxury of time to do this since my backshift job allows me a lot of downtime, so yes, I know I'm blessed there. It'd be downright unreasonable otherwise. Anyway, hopefully someone enjoys this read, and maybe discovers a movie they were unaware of or watches something they've been putting off. But really, I wanted to make a post like this also just for me, as something of a year-end review, to go back and recap everything since it can be easy to forget with such a deluge. So I won't feel too bad if this goes unnoticed, as I kind of suspect.\n\nBut enough about all that. [Here's the Letterboxd Diary of what I've seen this year.](https://letterboxd.com/PureLionHeart/films/diary/) Out-front note, I didn't give star scores, as I always hate looking back and being utterly embarrassed by younger me's choices. So I just noted whether I liked it or not, and added my favourites to the appropriate list. I'll mainly use this post to showcase my Top Ten, a list of the surprises both good &amp; bad, and some random musings on actors, directors, genres, whatever. And don't worry, I don't believe there's any spoilers here.\n\n*Top 10 (alphabetical):*\n\n* **Anatomy Of A Fall** - Just an utterly fantastic drama and mystery. There's really not much more I can say, save that Sandra Huller is fantastic and I hope to see her in a lot more.\n* **Asteroid City** - Turns out I love Wes Anderson's work, and this one has enraptured me for reasons I can't really articulate. I still think about it, and devoured YouTube essays as a result.\n* **Coherence** - Thrilling, and a fabulous ending. I had heard it was insanely confusing to understand, but highly disagree, unless you're trying to track everyone, which the movie really points out itself as foolish. The book was real heavy-handed, though.\n* **Dune: Part Two** - Just an amazing follow-up. I've not read the books, but I know I am actively failing the material every time I'm cheering for Paul, but so be it. And God-damn, Austin Butler was amazing with the subtleties. He could not have been hornier for Paul, and I'll stand by that viewpoint.\n* **Hell Or High Water** - Heard good things, but didn't expect such a great, tight plot acted so well. Chris Pine was great, sure, but Ben Foster is the real treat. Been keeping an eye out for his work since.\n* **Locke** - This should not have worked, but dammit, does it ever. Any movie that has me cheering at the end is an all-timer. I was on the edge of my seat since so much could have gone every which way.\n* **Take Shelter** - I discovered Jeff Nichols' work this year, and loved all but The Bikeriders. This one had me uneasy all the way through in the best way. And yes, I'm one of those folks who subscribes to the ending being another dream/episode. \n* **The Hunt** - Damning, depressing, terrifying stuff. More a horror movie than most films I'd watch. Especially as it goes on and things just don't improve. Drives home the ending all the further. Mads' best work, and I say that despite adoring Hannibal.\n* **The Vast of Night** - The biggest surprise of the year, probably my overall favourite just on sheer unreadiness. For all the movies I liked this year, nothing gave me the outright chills except this and Coherence, and this was an order of magnitude stronger. Why such a surprise? I thought I was about to watch It Comes At Night, and had the wrong movie. If there's one absolute recommendation in this entire post, it's this movie. Easily.\n* **Women Talking** - My wife could not have undersold this more. She liked it, and broadly explained it as the women taking a vote about what to do with the men of the town. That's it. I assumed something supernatural, as she's much more into horror and the like. The actual content was much more harrowing and enthralling.\n\n*Surprises (Good &amp; Bad):*\n\n* **The Vast Of Night** - One more shout-out, because my God. Expected a likely mediocre horror, got a feature-length Twilight Zone episode that kept me enraptured the whole way through.\n* **The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs** - So wildly inconsistent, wow. My fault, I didn't know it was an anthology. I could have watched two straight hours of Tim Blake Nelson singing and shooting, and Near Algodones was still good, but the rest did little for me (maybe The Mortal Remains). Not helped by the fact my wife decided to get high to watch it with me during the Buster Scruggs section, and then got subjected to the nightmare that is Meal Ticket at her peak. The poor woman.\n* **Tar** - The wife and I actually gave up on this early on in the classroom section as it seemed too esoteric for us, with no knowledge of the subject matter, but I gave it another crack myself later in the night, then eventually convinced her to go back. So fantastic once the movie fully revealed itself. And I cannot stress enough how surreal it was that just earlier that day, and for the past few weeks, I had been replaying Monster Hunter World...\n* **The Hunt For Red October** - I just find it hilarious they had English, Scottish, Swedish, and New Zealander actors doing Russian accents...\n* **The Killing Of A Sacred Deer** - This was my first Yorgos Lanthimos film, and nearly put my off his whole filmography. The plot is fantastic, but I utterly loathed the monotone delivery throughout. Thank goodness he's loosened up on that. I couldn't imagine Poor Things without the over-the-top deliveries like Ruffalo's.\n* **Sicario** - Good enough movie, but man does it feel unusual for Denis Villeneuve in retrospect of his later work. I also bring this up because I dared to try the sequel and quit less than 10 minutes in when they added Muslim suicide-bombers to the Mexican cartel, and it was blindingly clear the intention and views of the film and filmmakers.\n* **Moonrise Kingdom** - My wife and I were struggling on what to think of this for a decent chunk of runtime, until we finally settled on a description of immense sincerity. We loved it by the end and were actively rooting for everyone.\n* **Ad Astra** - What little I heard about this was as a boring, dull, sci-fi movie. I don't get it at all. Hell, there's a car chase with guns on the moon! And in a spaceship taking off! But who cares, because the contemplative acting and dialogue are the real point, and it's great at that.\n* **Kiss Kiss Bang Bang** - This movie is an enigma to me because from the sum of its parts, it should easily be one of my all-time favourites. I adored The Nice Guys, for example. But I swear, I just couldn't get into it. It just never seemed to come together for me, and I just don't know why. I may rewatch it again, maybe I was just in a bad mood or something.\n* **Mud** - I knew of this solely from Cine2Nerdle and getting beaten with it, and it was my intro to Jeff Nichols as mentioned. I generally don't care for coming-of-age films, but this one was fantastic with the way it approached a boy learning of love in so many different ways. Take Shelter did more for me, but this was very nearly in my Top Ten as well.\n* **Furiosa** - I'll just be honest, this was a let-down for me. Still good, undeniably, but Fury Road is a masterpiece and this just couldn't measure up. Surprisingly, I think one of the biggest faults lies in the soundtrack. Nothing hit as hard, and music was used much more sparingly. It was shocking that the biggest chase scene was nearly silent compared to what Fury Road did at every opportunity.\n* **Babylon** - Incredibly up-and-down. It largely didn't click for me, especially the saccharine ending, except for every moment Brad Pitt was on screen: he was solid gold. And that speech by Jean Smart, too. I loved seeing her since Legion may well be my favourite TV show.\n* **It Follows** - Turned out to be a massive disappointment, really. I think I was expecting a more methodical, robotic force that required clever rule use and the like, and while that's there to an extent to be sure, the continually revealed ability of the creature to think and react diminished things for me. It's less a force of nature, which makes it feel less scary somehow.\n* **I'm Thinking Of Ending Things** - This was half-spoiled for me thanks to a video from Jacob Geller of all things, but I still thought it fantastic, possibly moreso because I knew the premise and went with it.\n* **Can You Ever Forgive Me?** - All the Letterboxd reviews are right. Give them both Oscars. I am very much not a McCarthy fan, but that was an amazing movie. I really need to watch more with Richard E. Grant too, he's a delight.\n* **The Double** - A wild movie, and forgive the pun, but I did a double-take when I saw the director was Richard Ayoade, never expected that. Intrigued the whole time, though I don't think Eisenberg can play a cool version of himself.\n* **Phantom Thread** - Didn't think I'd care for a movie about a dressmaker, but it was Paul Thomas Anderson, who I had come to very much like this year, and Daniel Day-Lewis, so I had to try it. Absolutely did not expect the plot I got, or how much I liked it.\n* **May December** - Most notable to me because I completely misjudged the premise since I had no knowledge going in. I assumed it was Natalie Portman &amp; Julianne Moore who were in the age-gap romance. Fantastic film. Charles Melton sold it all sold well.\n* **Bobby** - Watched this after JFK on a lark, seemed a sensible follow-up. I did not expect to care so much about everyone (well, not Slater's character...). The decaying materialistic relationship, the marriage to avoid Vietnam, the career devotee dealing with retirement. It also helped being Canadian and having little-to-no details on the collateral damage that occurred in that kitchen, and who survived. This one is definitely boosted by recency-bias, but I loved it.\n\n*Lastly, some other random tidbits and musings.*\n\nFirst, genres. I gave some more horror a chance, but I'm still not really into them. But I did discover as a result what is likely my favourite new genre of film, which are basically long-form Twilight Zone/Outer Limits episodes. That's how I'd describe Coherence and The Vast Of Night, and I would be immensely thankful for further recommendations of that ilk. My interest in movies about Hollywood is pretty 50/50: Mank &amp; Trumbo were great, but Babylon mostly left me cold as noted above. The biggest surprise in this avenue, however, is that I don't like mob flicks. The Scorsese oeuvre did absolutely nothing for me this year (though I recall liking the Departed). Others like Donnie Brasco also didn't hit. Not a lot of comedies watched at all either, and that's probably not going to change. Dramas and thrillers are still where my heart lies.\n\nNext, I got to go through a lot of works by specific directors and actors. Jeff Nichols was a lovely surprise, as noted. But Wes Anderson got the deepest dive from me, and turns out I love his style. Still more to see, too. Paul Thomas Anderson also got more viewings from me, and I'm very eager to see the rest of his work, can't imagine disliking any. I quite liked that Paul Schrader trilogy of sad men as well. Meanwhile, I have three notable mixed bags: Soderbergh, Ridley Scott, and the Coens. It's basically a 50/50, which I guess is expected as they both have large bodies of work, and jumping between genres. For actors, I remain unflinching that Jake Gyllenhaal is my favourite actor. Nightcrawler from years past cemented that for me, but I got to see a lot more of his work this year and not an iota of doubt creeped in. Rebecca Ferguson showed up numerous times, and I loved her on screen every time. She really caught me off-guard in Doctor Sleep, a movie I liked a lot more than I expected of such a sequel. The man himself aside, I have got to admit that Jared Leto can absolutely act: Requiem For A Dream, Dallas Buyers Club, Hell, he was giving his all in House Of Gucci even. Jesse Plemons was in so many movies I saw, sometimes in bit parts that just had me doing the Leo DiCaprio meme at the screen, but he's always a delight. \"How can that be profitable for Frito Lay?\" will be quoted back-and-forth between my wife and I for years. Finally, even though I've seen numerous movies with him in them in the past, I had no idea how prolific Jared Harris was. I genuinely, embarrassingly thought that Chernobyl was his first work. Feel free to laugh. \n\nThe most important thing I learned of all though? All it takes to get me to watch a movie is the title. So many watched on the back of that alone, and not all them worth it:\n**All The Old Knives, A Most Violent Year, The Devil All The Time, The Pale Blue Eye, A Cure For Wellness, The World To Come, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Kill Your Darlings, Our Kind Of Traitor**, etc, etc.\n\nSo that's it. A year of movies completed, and I'm kind of proud of it. If there's any movies I've gone through that anyone wants to hear my thoughts on, by all means ask. Or any other questions or remarks. To cut off one: Will I do the same in 2025? God no! I do want to try and keep up on watching things a bit more than previous years, but I think I'll focus mostly on getting older films out of the way(I've only seen one Hitchcock film, for example), and rewatching stuff I've been meaning to for ages. Also probably Nosferatu. If I'm about to obsess on anything for the new year, it's looking like indie games are the culprit after everything I spent in the Steam sales...",

This movie is like \u201cInherent Vice\u201d.  Both have Joaquin Phoenix tripping out and both juxtapose reality and hallucination.  I found it easier to separate the two in \u201cInherent Vice\u201d.  The noise complaint notes left in Beau\u2019s apartment were probably a hallucination.  As far as plot goes, did Grace and Roger\u2019s daughter really commit suicide by drinking paint?  The theater group commune was probably real but his placement in the plot was false.  Did Beau kill his mom or did she die from a falling chandelier?  I think the latter.  Was the end a hallucination or judgment in the afterlife?  Ari Aster sure makes some dark disturbing stuff.  I thought \u201cMidsommar\u201d took the cake until I watched this one.  ",

Mussburger (Paul Newman) hopes to take control of the company he works for by purchasing a majority share -- but he must first devalue the stock. So he convinces the board to appoint know-nothing recent graduate Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). But Mussburger's plot backfires when Barnes' latest invention succeeds, thereby increasing the company's value. Worse yet, undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has the scoop on Mussburger's shady dealings.\n\nHonestly, the synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Especially with Tim Robbins' huge role in Silo, coming back to watch his earnest performance as Norville Barnes is a breath of fresh air.  You'll find deliciously satirical writing and direction from the Coen Brothers, knock out performances by Newman and Leigh - the Hudsucker Proxy is an overlooked gem.  With the focus around New Year's Eve, there is no better time to watch this amazing movie if you've never seen it before.  Infinitely quotable, excellently acted, and supremely unique, I hope more people take the time to watch one of my favorite movies tonight.",
