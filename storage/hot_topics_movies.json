        "content": "#[Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) if you want to just nab one and skip the wall of text.\n\n---\n\nAlright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen during the ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1itlqyx/oscar_bingo_xii_submission_thread/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- If you win just be sure to yell \"BINGO\" really loud wherever you are. And if you wanna post your gamecard to the game thread that would be fine too.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

These moments with Neal are probably the most human interaction he's had in nearly a decade and this scene where he finally fights back his only response is of what he had in his prior life before his wife's death. When you get that twist at the end of the movie it makes the entire movie that much more heartbreaking. Del's entire monologue is esentially him fighting back by just reininsicng on the life he once had. Amazing performance from Candy who probably would've been one of the better character actors if he stayed alive.   \n  \n",

I thought the story was so much more powerful because of its surrealist qualities. I expected scenery chewing villains and overwrought scenes of torture. What I got was more akin to a haunted dream that left me pondering the passage of time. This is a bold film from a real artist. I\u2019m not even raving about the movie. On letterboxed I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and It\u2019s far from my favorite of the year. But I\u2019m truly struck by the artistry and how much the movie surprised me. Bravo! ",

        "content": "I just finished watching Deepwater Horizon, which is generally fine, but one thing I really appreciated was the way it found to explain what was happening on Deepwater Horizon and what Marky Mark's company did, thus allowing the rest of the movie to be a lot easier to understand from both a technical and political perspective. Basically, an early scene has Marky Mark's young daughter practicing her speech for class on what her Dad does, with a Coke can as a demonstration. \n\nThat got me wondering, in an era where so many movies seem to just plunk two characters down and have them talk about things that they are both already aware of solely for the audience's benefit (\"Wow, I can't believe it's been 5 years since you had that car accident where you lost your young son named Michael, after which your wife left you because she couldn't process her grief, and you moved back in with your estranged father....\"), do you have any other examples where a movie found an elegant or effective way to deliver some complicated backstory or foundational knowledge required to understand the specifics of the story?",

I personally thought the movie was good, not the 10/10 masterpiece I see people hail it to be. \n\nThe camerawork was incredible, as well as the performances but I thought the story, while dealing with an important topic, was told in an extremely shallow way. I couldn\u2019t connect to any of the characters and didn\u2019t feel much during the entire movie. The only time I really thought \u201eyeah this is great storytelling\u201c was that last scene in the car. \n\nSo if anyone who really really loves Anora would explain to me why you do I\u2018d greatly appreciate it.",

But what they don't know is that Romain, the person we first meet, has come in contact with something infectious earlier that night and now it's slowly spreading.\n \nIt's like The Crazies meets Irr\u00e9versible with a bit of Kids thrown in the mix. It's relentless! I can't recommend it enough!\n \nEdit: Title was supposed to be the best zombie outbreak movie you've never heard about",

        "title": "My interpretation of Rear window's ending",
        "content": "I think, contrary to popular opinion, even though Jefferies and Lisa are depicted as happy at the end, this doesn't represent a shift in Jefferies\u2019 perception of Lisa's \"perfection.\" Although he witnessed different facets of Lisa's personality, his preoccupation with Thorwald prevented him from revising his initial, flawed interpretation of her.\n\nThis is symbolized by the difference in how Jeffries is portrayed while he uncovered the truth about Thorwald and how he is portrayed when the dancer\u2019s truth was shown.\n\n1. When he formed his interpretation of Thorwald, Jefferies is shown looking into the window.\n2. When the dancer\u2019s truth about her relationship is revealed, we see Jefferies away from the window with his eyes closed \u2013 symbolizing the fact that he never modified his flawed interpretation of the dancer\u2019s, and subsequently Lisa\u2019s, \u201cperfection\u201d.\n\nJefferies\u2019 obsession fueled his interpretation of Thorwald's actions, ultimately leading to a correct conclusion. Ironically, this same obsession blinded him to the truth about Lisa. This demonstrates that while a biased, obsessive approach can coincidentally uncover truth, it's a dangerous and unreliable method. Relying on such methods is inherently risky, even if they occasionally produce a correct outcome.\n\nJefferies\u2019 obsession with his own interpretation led him to uncover one truth while simultaneously blinding him from others.\n\nBy only showing Lisa and Jefferies\u2019 \u201chappy ending\u201d for a few seconds during the ending scene, the film replicates Jefferies' limited perspective and implicates the audience in the same act of potentially misinterpreting a brief observation as the whole truth.\n\nJust as Jefferies' view through the rear window offers a fragmented and potentially misleading view of his neighbors' lives, the film's concluding glimpse of Jefferies and Lisa \"being happy\" is misleading \u2013 underscoring the unreliability of limited perspectives as a source of truth.",

        "title": "'The Holdovers\" Review: Toast to the Lonely Ones",
        "content": "The Holdovers is a movie set in the 1970s at a boarding school in Boston. It\u2019s neither a time nor a place I\u2019m familiar with, yet I still feel a sense of nostalgia. It's a story about lonely people during the joyful holiday season.\n\nThe protagonist, Paul Hunham, is a cynic, disillusioned with the world. He is lonely and disliked, neither by his colleagues nor his students. His self-pity is on full display, evident in his words: \"I think the world is a cold and bitter place, and it thinks the same about me.\" What he doesn\u2019t realize is that his own actions contribute to his misery. Or maybe he does, but he seems to take a certain pride in the aesthetic of being a loner and an outsider. He clings to the moral high ground because it\u2019s the only thing he has left. It makes him feel superior to others, serving as an excuse to avoid confronting his own insecurities. An excuse to justify being an asshat, because, in his own mind, it\u2019s the world that\u2019s flawed, not him. An excuse to avoid true self-examination. Armed with Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, a powerful book on stoicism, he uses it to justify his solitude. Yet, despite holding the philosophy so dearly, he fails to embody its principles, allowing addictions to take control of him.\n\nHe reminds me of who I once imagined I would become, or might still become, a loner, angry at the world, unable to see that I was sabotaging myself with self-pity.\n\nThen there\u2019s Angus Tully, a student left behind at school by his family, abandoned in a place he doesn\u2019t want to be. He watches the other students leave, reunited with their families, while he remains, trapped. The loneliness and quiet betrayal feel like crying out loud without a sound. Since kindergarten, I was always the last one waiting to be picked up, standing alone, watching the world move on without me. Waiting and waiting for my parents to show up. I\u2019ve forgotten most things from my childhood, but that feeling, that sense of hopelessness and desperation, still haunts me from time to time.\n\nSpeaking of loneliness, the first loner I ever knew was my father. I used to wonder, Why do you always stay home instead of going out with friends? I told myself I would never be like that when I grew up. But somehow, I did. Just like the movie says, \"The steps you take to avoid your fate are the very steps that lead you to it.\"\n\nSo how do we fill the void of loneliness? Not by obsessing over ourselves but by thinking about others. Everyone is fighting their own demons, too busy bleeding to notice the next guy\u2019s wounds. Paul Hunham assumes Angus Tully is just another troubled kid, abandoned because his parents don\u2019t want him around. Angus, in turn, sees Paul as a lonely loser on a power trip, clinging to authority because he has nothing better to do. Trapped in their own perspectives, neither realizes the depth of the other\u2019s suffering.\n\nBut the story shifts when they begin to care. When Angus learns the truth behind Paul\u2019s bitterness, and when Paul sees the pain behind Angus\u2019s defiance, their loneliness starts to dissolve. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but a true one. Loneliness isn\u2019t cured by endless self-improvement or chasing happiness. It\u2019s eased by genuine care for others. The light we give to others is the same light that fills our own void.\n\nIn the end, Paul takes the fall for Angus. But in doing so, he sets himself free. Finally, he can pursue his dream of writing his monograph. Will he succeed? Who knows. But at least, now he\u2019s free.\n\nI guess the reason I love this movie so much, aesthetic aside, is that I can feel every bit of loneliness it conveys\u2014but also see a cure for it.\n\nToast to the lonely ones. To the holdovers.                 ",
