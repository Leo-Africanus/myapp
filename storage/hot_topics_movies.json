        "content": "She is the one who cheats on him, but the movie tries to make it seem as if we should be on her side and that it\u2019s Cal\u2019s fault she did it because he became a \u201cboring partner\u201d.\n\nNot only that, but their family friends: Bernie (reluctantly) and his wife choose to side with Emily and doesn\u2019t receive any emotional support over it until Jacob takes him under his wing to move on from her by teaching him his womanizing ways.\n\nAnd when Emily finds out that he slept with their son\u2019s teacher (who takes him ghosting her too personal), she has the audacity to act so self-righteous and disgusted when she finds out he also slept with nine other women. I get there is her thinking there was a personal motive where she felt this was him getting back at her, but she is the one who wanted a divorce.\n\nHe\u2019s a grown man who\u2019s allowed to explore since he\u2019s no longer married to her. But more importantly, she NEVER once apologizes for hurting Cal first. By the end of the movie, Cal once again has to be the bigger person who makes up for all the \u201cwrongs\u201d he\u2019s done.\n\nThe way this movie tried to tell its messages was very weird. It was an entertaining movie, but it never fails to piss me off at the same time lol\n\nEDIT: Man, I clearly need to work on how I write titles for posts like this. I want to clarify, I don't think Cal is the villain of the story but the point I'm making is that the way this movie tells it's story. It's framing it as if he is. Sure, Emily might be called out for cheating, but she is let off the hook a little to easily compared to Cal. ",

It feels like today however that in movies there is always something to listen to, whether it\u2019s quippy dialogue or music over the top of scenes. I don\u2019t think there are really ever more silent or quiet scenes like there are in films like Bullitt or The Italian Job for example.\n\nWhy is this, and when did it start? Do people just expect to have always something going on at all times now? Watching older films back they just feel oddly silent comparatively and I\u2019m just wondering when the switch was and what started it",

        "content": "I've been a pretty big cinephile for a while, and while a lot of movies have made me feel something none of hit home quite as much as The Whale. This is a bit of a long post and has some of my own personal family drama, so if its not the right place for this sort of thing I understand. \n\nTo start off my father has always had an uncanny resemblance to Brenden Fraser, so much so that all of our family has talked about how weird it is watching any movie with him in it. My mom always loved the mummy because it felt like \"seeing him as an action hero\". When i was young this similarity wasn't as clear to people outside our family, as my father was between mid 300 - low 400 ibs. Not quite the whale but still morbidly obese. Well around my highschool years his doctor finally convinced him of the severity of it and he not only lost almost all his weight but got quite fit. That was when everyone started to really see how much he looked like him. \n\nHe wasn't used to the attention and he eventually had an affair and lost everything, my mom actually stayed with him at first but he sort of continually pushed everyone away overtime. Currently almost everyone in our immediate family except his mom cut contact with him, I'm the last person in our family left that he talks to. To be fair much of this has been due to his own actions, but now he's entirely alone and I cant help but feel for him even with all he's done. Unfortunately in the past 6-7 years he has gained all his weight back, and has been declining in health (now on ozympic and diabetes medication) he continues to message chinese chatbots which he is often convinced are girls interested in him, hes moved back in with his mom (whos 91) and ubers for work and is in his late 60s since he doesnt have much money or assets to his name anymore. \n\n I knew watching this movie would be hard because even from the trailers I could see how much the main character looked how my dad does now. Even his living conditions are similar to those in the movie with a house thats pertually dirty, clutter and trash all over the place, and junk food filling most of the pantry. I also think Brendan Fraser nailed the way a morbidly obese man moves and talks, Im all to familiar with the wheezing while speaking, the slow sort of waddling walk. Watching this movie was like watching my dad and I honestly wasn't prepared for it. I think the lesson at the end was honestly what I needed to hear, part of me has honestly felt almost guilty for keeping contact with him, like I was betraying the rest of my family. But when I know im the only family someone has left I don't think its wrong to show them love even if they've done a lot to hurt everyone else. ",

He gave us The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Tender Mercies, and so much more over 60+ years. One of the last true legends.\n\nWhat's the Duvall performance that stuck with you most? Mine is Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove. One of the greatest TV performances ever put to screen.",

        "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird (1962): What a beautiful film!",
        "content": "*Before I start, yes: I had not seen this before. Yes, I had heard of it and am aware that I may be one of the five people on this subreddit who has not seen this movie.*\n\n*Also, I am writing directly. If I step across any sort of line with my thoughts, I have not done so to deliberately provoke.*\n\n*Plot:* A defense lawyer raises his two children in 1930s rural Alabama, as he is tasked with a court case of a black man accused of assaulting a white woman.\n\n*My thoughts:*\n\nThis is possibly one of the most wonderful films I have seen in a long time, where the writing is equally well matched by the acting of all of the characters. Though being aware of the fame of the movie, it still delivered beyond my expectations.\n\nAnd indeed my expectations were that it would be a stereotypical court drama touching on racism and racial injustice in the 1960s court system.\n\nI could not have been more wrong: First, the film is set 30 years before the year in which it was filmed (difficult years...). Second of all, the theme of racism is not the primary theme in my opinion, though it is rightly noted for tackling it.\n\nIn truth, the first hour is very much a story about the children of the film, who are for that time the main protagonists. The brother and sister are out exploring the town, learning about one of their neighbours who they fear. The sister starts learning how to behave properly, that she needs to wear a dress to school, about their father as a person.\n\nAnd indeed, this one of those old films that undertakes trying to show an older time than when it was filmed (something easily missed, taking into account that the viewers more likely than back then on release knew these times). It's fairly naturalistic in a way as it is touching on the subjects of poverty in the Depression south as well.\n\nWhen the subject of racism enters the picture, it does so gradually, as if the viewer is the child gradually discovering this about the world. And quite brusquely: the film does not shy away from having characters use the n-word. (Hell, just the subject matter of the court case is inflammatory at face value). And it is this frank portrayal of the subject matter that I appreciated. All the more so keeping in mind that this film was released when segregation was still ongoing. It has an authenticity to it that I don't think any modern film can when discussing this period.\n\nBut more so: it is where the film's other protagonist, Atticus really shines: trying to uphold more than the law but his own sense of justice through his calling. The lynch mob scene will probably remain in my mind for a very long time. But for an additional reason than the fortitude of Atticus: in an odd way, probably by how it gets diffused, does it perhaps portray some of those in it as not completely irredeemable, but flawed people who have lost their way in the society they were brought up in?\n\nAnd this idea of what the film was saying is perhaps cemented by what Atticus says in his closing statement: it's not the law, but the 'unwritten social law' that is driving the trial. And this to an extent raises this film as a story above its subject matter.\n\nFurthermore, there &gt;!is not a complete happy ending here. This is a mature tale that does not take the audience for fools looking for a thrill. The trial ends badly, then tragically. Justice goes undelivered (even though Atticus' efforts are nonetheless recognized). He is left a sort of tragic hero who goes on doing the work that has to be done even if it comes out fruitless. Who lives in a society where he sees its flaws, but still deals with it as best he can. A quiet dignity in front of indignity. This is why he ends up critically acclaimed as one of cinema's heroes, why it even impresses me 64 years later. One of the most likeable protagonists I've ever seen on screen and that isn't easy.!&lt;\n\nThere is much more to say about this movie, but it probably already has, and I've probably written enough. Watch it, even if like me, you had reservations based on the synopsis (i,e, that it might be too heavy a movie).\n\nGreat film, and easily would earn a 10/10 even in 2026.",

        "content": "The scene is from the Special Edition, the one where the xenomorph is born from an ox instead of a dog.\n\nI find this to be the best single sequence in the entire film and it is nothing short of magnificent. The emotional punch of the scene, the sombre atmosphere, Sigourney Weaver's facial expressions, Elliot Goldenthal's score, Charles S. Dutton's monologue ... everything comes together beautifully.\n\nThe editing of the scene is particularly a thing of beauty. As Charles S. Dutton says, \"for within each seed, there is the promise of a flower\", the xeno bursts out of the ox in the next shot, which is immediately followed by Ripley's nose bleeding that serves as foreshadowing for her eventual condition.\n\nIn light of how well executed this sequence is, I find it to be a pity that the rest of the film turned out to be such an incoherent mess. I won't write down everything I find to be wrong with the film, just a few points as I remember them.\n\n1. Elliot Goldenthal's score takes a drastic downturn after this scene. The rock music playing during the gang rape was particularly hideous. Who had that bright idea, I don't want to know.\n2. I had seen the theatrical version long ago and therefore, the subplot of trapping the xeno inside a nuclear waste chamber came as a surprise to me. Now I think the entire sequence and its aftermath was a complete waste of time and was rightly excised from the theatrical cut.\n3. The finale is an utter mess. I had little idea of what was happening and who was where.",

What feels like a slow paced burn turns into a gut punch by the end when you make complete sense of whatever events that have happened.\u00a0\n\nThe movie is about a girl revisiting the memory of her father and her revaluation of the whole trip through the eyes of an experienced adult. She doesn\u2019t read too much into it when she\u2019s in those moments but now that she\u2019s pieced it all together, she sees her father\u2019s pain and suffering and we as the viewers come to feel it in the end too. This is why i feel aftersun is a painful and haunting watch.\n\nThe cinematography and background score really help us fill up the blanks that the movie deliberately leave for us. All of it really ties into an emotional and unforgettable experience. I don\u2019t think im getting over this for a while",
