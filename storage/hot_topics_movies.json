I really like finding out peoples favourite movies on specific actors because I like to see the wide variety of picks people have and learning of underrated gems. \n\nSome of his movies like The French Connection (1971), Unforgiven (1992), The Conversation (1974), and Enemy of the State (1998) are my favourites from him and he's become one of my favourite actors.\n\nHis good guy roles and bad guy roles are both fantastic but I think my personal preference would be when he's the villain because he's so good at it.\n\nHis portrayal of Lex Luthor is also my favourite in Superman (1978).\n\nThis year he'll have been retired for 21 years, with his last movie being released in 2004.\n\nI think that he only has one credited voice acting role which would be General Mandible in Antz (1998).  \n\n\nWhat are your favourites?",

        "content": "Hello\nI'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny\u2014but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.\n\nMost movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts\u2014and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)\nIf you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!\nI hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything \ud83d\ude05. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!",

        "content": "I do feel like the obvious answer has to be Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition DVD special features, but when I think back I can't remember a time I wouldn't bring up the Shrek DVD special features either. Clerks special edition had a lot of cool extra content and feature too, pretty much any Kevin Smith project had great feautres. I would say anything with Kevin Smith, PTA, Wes Anderson, Tarantino, and Cohen Brothers I was always super into.\n\nGrowing up I would take an 8th of shrooms and bring 3 DVDs up to my room and just have a marathon while I couldn't sleep. \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was always a go-to for me, \"Life Aquatic with Steve Zisou\" was an amazing film that I liked a lot more on rewatch (definitely recommend an 8th to get very detail oriented for themes and even fun easter eggs), and usually a fight between \"Kung Pow:Enter the Fist\" if I wanted to just laugh my ass off, or \"O' Brother Where Art Thou\" if I really wanted to take my brain away and enjoy a masterpiece. \n\nIs there one in particular that comes to mind? It doesn't need to be pigeon-holed to just a movie I guess, DVDs for shows have great special features as well. \n\nThank you for commenting and keeping things respectful! ",

I also don't mind the shakycam in those movies too as at least you can focus on what's going on in those scenes.\n\nBut one thing I will say is how it kickstarted shaky cam in action movies for the worse. After Bourne Supremacy, every filmmaker decided to start including shakycam in action movies. Batman Begins was an early example of shakycam in action movies and then we had dozens more that had shaky cam until the trend finally went away once people found out that people couldn't replicate Bourne's shakycam. Even in The Bourne Identity, there was some shaky cam (especially the first act) in that film also.\n\nI ain't talking about The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Jason Bourne (2016) as we talk about those an another day in a separate post. But for a while, shaky cam in action movies were a huge trend around Hollywood.",

Hs death causes her to lose her baby and after she finds out who outed her husband to the cops, she poses as a babysitter to the woman who's given birth and needs a nanny. DeMornay's Icy Blonde look and cold expressions switching from a sunshine smile to a menacing foul-mouthed threat, she's just perfect in this movie. \n\nI am disappointed she never got a part as good as this one. I saw her in Feds, unrecognizable in Runaway Train, moving in Testament, a brief but warm presence in The Trip to Bountiful, she was my favorite version of Milady De Winter in \"The Three Musketeers\" (I haven't seen Eva Green's take, though). \n\nShe was also the original choice for Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook and I can't help but think she probably would have been a more faithful and intriguing choice than Julia Roberts' boyish turn. Girlfriend looked more like one of the Lost Boys than an actual fairy.",
