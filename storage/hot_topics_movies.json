I would love to see a \u201cmaking of\u201d movie about it because I have no idea how they got Kermit to ride a bike but it was worth the cost of admission to see that scene alone.

'The Last Crusade' in particular has this brilliant pacing where Indy has a goal, sees an obstacle and has to quickly think on his feet to knock it down, let off a quip, then move to the next beat. It's just delightful. [The 'no ticket' scene is a great example.](https://youtu.be/s0vNsH81YeA?si=Y4DMb7z9itI2eAN8)\n\nIt's absolutely baffling to me that all we got out of the legacy of those are one good Mummy movie and two okay National treasure movies, iirc. And now Jungle Cruise, I guess? Ugh. \n\nEDIT: okay I'll rewatch the mummy returns, I stand by that national treasure is just okay though \n\nAnyway, can anyone please recommend some adventure movies that scratch my itch for quick thinking escapades? Doesn't have to be after Indiana Jones but bonus points if it is! Thank you! ",

        "content": "I was thinking, the other day, after a rewatch of Pulp Fiction that we, collectively as a society, really missed out on a Vega brothers movie that would have been great. Looking at the performances of Michael Madsen and John Travolta in those movies, coupled with Tarantino's storytelling, it makes me kind of sick thinking about what could have been but never was. Just imagining a single scene of those two characters having a chummy interaction with each other makes me tingle a bit.\n\nThis got me thinking about the question I am posing today for you bunch of movie buffs... what do you think is the greatest movie that is known to have been conceived but never got made? What are we worse off for as a media consuming civilization for not getting the pleasure of watching? I will throw my hat in on the never made Vincent and Vic Vega movie, but I haven't really explored too many other options... I leave that to you all.\n\nI request that everyone, before replying, check the existing replies (Ctrl-F search if you have to) to see if your suggestion was recommended, give it a thumbs up, and add your take as a reply.

When talking to Michelle for the first time at the plant, he says \"I used to sit next to you in history class.\"\n\n3.) During his exam in college, when he hilariously answers \"Herbie Hancock,\" its a History 201 exam. \n\n\u200b\n\nI thought \"Oh how funny? He lost his history book, and was distracted by the pretty girl next to him in history, which all made him really bad at history.\" No other class exam was shown, and people who congratulate him refer specifically to his D+ (from the HIS201 exam). So did he ONLY struggle with history? \n\nI don't know, just thought that was funny/interesting. I don't know what it means... lol. \n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",

I can't find any of other connections between the two films with writers (both Hollywood legends Landis and Hughes) or directors? Is this purely coincidence and just a really common trope? Is there any other movies where this happens?",

        "title": "I enjoy every movie I watch.",
        "content": "I often see posts of people saying they hate particular movies (saltburn, civil war etc). It always scares me but then when I watch them I at the very least enjoy them, most of the time like or love them. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m not critical or I don\u2019t notice the nuances, I definitely see the variety of the quality of the movies I watch. Nor do I want to act like I\u2019m better than anyone for this. Most of the time I of course try to watch the movies I know I will probably enjoy, so that could play into it. But when I was in a relationship I got showed a lot of movies I never thought I would like (such as sisterhood of the traveling pants, camp rock, low rated horror movies) but for some reason I can\u2019t say I hate any of them. Maybe I just like the experience of watching a movie or I\u2019m just very easily entertained, maybe it was the company while watching those films, I don\u2019t know. But I can\u2019t for the life of me remember the last time I put a movie on and had a bad time. Am I the only one feeling like this? I am a bit of a \u201ccinephile\u201d in the sense that I watch a lot of movies and I am very passionate about them. The last couple of years my favorite movies has been challengers, the substance, puss in boots 2 etc. so it\u2019s not like I only watch marvel movies lol (even though i also enjoy them of course)",
