        "content": "It\u2019s been years since I saw this, last time was probably when I had it on VHS as a teenager. Currently rewatching it right now and it\u2019s such fun - the cast is great. \n\nYou have The Rock at the start of his movie career as a lead after Mummy Returns, &amp; he looks a lot more human and normal than slot of his other roles.. His early films weren\u2019t too bad actually didn\u2019t think.\n\nYou have Sean William Scott not being Stifler, Rosario Dawson, and Christopher Walken being.. well Christopher Walken as the bad guy and it just works. \n\nYou also have Walken talking about the concept of the \u2018tooth fairy\u2019 oddly prophetic for another role of Johnson\u2019s down the line\n\nA nice mixture of comedy, action and the passing of the tor do so to speak as Arnie &amp; Rock pass by at the start.\n\nI know it was never going to win awards or anything but rewatching it now as an adult I\u2019m having a blast as much as when I was younger it\u2019s just a good switch off your brain movie.\n\n(Also the first of many films where the Rock ends up in a Jungle)",
