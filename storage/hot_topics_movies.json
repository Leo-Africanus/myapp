But this is a saying that I have never heard in my life and causes my to pause until my laughter subsides.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite sayings in a movie that just aren't used anymore. Maybe you'll try and bring them back. \n\n",

But like, there's already plant life on the planet, &amp; humans share something like 50% of our genes (much less of our total DNA content) with plants, due to gene conservation. So were the Engineers speeding things up, like \"hey, let's skip to fish\"? If so, that would presuppose that the genes we share in common with plants &amp; other non-animal life are actually conserved across the galaxy, which would be pretty cool. But of course the movie doesn't get into any of that, &amp; eventually forgets how cartographers &amp; biologists work, or that you should run in a 90-degree angle when a giant donut is rolling toward you. Is there any \"expanded universe\" content that explained this better than the movie did (or didn't)?",

        "content": "A lot of people hated Beau Is Afraid, but for me, it was the first time a movie mirrored the inner chaos I live with\u2014and made me truly see it.\n\nI\u2019ve always called it anxiety. I laughed it off, tried to stay functional, thought that if I named it, I had some control. But I wasn\u2019t naming it with awareness. I wasn\u2019t meeting it with any kind of mindfulness. I was just surviving it, letting it narrate my reality from underneath.\n\nWatching the movie, I realized I\u2019d been thinking myself into entire imagined worlds. Scenarios of what could go wrong. And my body responded to those stories as if they were real. They felt real. That\u2019s what anxiety does\u2014it creates entire realities that don\u2019t exist, then makes you live inside them.\n\nI\u2019m a teacher, and I see this in kids all the time. The way fear and anger build on themselves. How one spark becomes a fire when there\u2019s no pause, no breath, no space to see what\u2019s really happening. And I recognize that in myself. Their panic is my panic. Their fear, mine.\n\nWhat Beau Is Afraid did was break through that fog\u2014not gently, but truthfully. It showed the absurdity of spiraling fear, the pain, the disconnection, and yes, even the comedy of it all. And because it made me laugh, it made me look.\n\nWatching it felt like someone saying, \u201cThis is real. You are not imagining it. And it is massive.\u201d And they were right. It\u2019s the most immense thing I carry, and I\u2019ve carried it without really noticing how heavy it\u2019s been.\n\nMindfulness, to me, is just the act of noticing. This film helped me notice. It pulled that fear out of the background and let me sit with it, feel it, and finally call it what it is\u2014not weakness, not overthinking, but a whole internal world begging to be understood.",

        "title": "What is the most visually stunning animated film you have ever seen?",
        "content": "For me, Kirikou and the Wild Beasts is one of the most iconic animated films in France, directed by Michel Ocelot, who has made several Kirikou films and many other magnificent animated films. If you ask anyone in France if they have heard of the Kirikou cartoon, it is very unlikely that they will say no. I remember seeing it when I was little, and a few years later I realised how visually stunning it is, one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen to date. The details of the leaves, tree trunks and sand are so well crafted, and the colours are vivid, bright, brilliant and beautiful, reflecting a sense of harmony. I would be thrilled if director Michel Ocelot were to release a 4K re-release. And you guys, what is the animated film, or non-animated film, with the visuals that have most impressed and blown you away, and why?",
