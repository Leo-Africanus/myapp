        "content": "Looking for some underrated films! \n\nMy personal pick is \"Coherence\" (2013). One of the films that blows your mind once you realize what's happening. Even more impressive that it was shot in 5 nights with no script (about 80% of the dialogue is ad-libbed) which makes the whole movie even more grounded and realistic. Phenomenal film, and go watch it as blindly as you can, its a one of a kind experience.",

Im asking this question in this post because ive already watched *every* popular movie or TV show from the past 30+ years.

(Maybe it has less to do with the actors themselves and more to do with the script or the director.)\n\nMovies where two actors had no chemistry at all in the first movie they were in, but found amazing chemistry in the next one, would also be totally fine.",

The acting as passable, the story was an interesting concept but it required suspending a bit of critical thinking. It wasn't a movie that was bad enough to turn off. Didn't like it, didn't hate it.
