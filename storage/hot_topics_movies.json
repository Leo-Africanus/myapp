        "content": "More than 20 years and dozens and dozens of feature-length superhero movies later, I still think that **The Incredibles** sits at the top of the list by a fairly wide margin. \n\nThis movie has so much to say about personal and familial growth. Every member the family is well-written in their struggle with finding their place in the family and in the greater world. On top of that each one of their superpowers perfectly reflects their character\u2019s *personal* strengths and weaknesses without being hamfisted about it! You get to see how both suppression and expression of their powers affects each family member differently. \n\n\nIt\u2019s really a masterclass in movie writing and I only scratched the surface: the retro-futuristic setting, the surprisingly emotional and intense story beats, the villain\u2026 all of it is so thoughtful and well-executed.\n\nThen there\u2019s the music, the voice acting, and the creative *action*! \n\nBrad Bird\u2019s fingerprints are all over the action set pieces. From the kids discovering the broader range of their superpower abilities while under extreme pressure, to Bob\u2019s strength paired with his brute force tactics, to Helen\u2019s ingenuity and quick-thinking skills in both the plane and hallway sequences, all of it is so clever and entertaining. \n\nThe absolute worst thing I can say about this movie is that the animation looks 20 years old, because it is. But otherwise this movie has been both a blessing and a curse all these years for me because I hold every other superhero movie to this standard. Unfortunately 95% of them have not been even close to this level of excellence. \n\n\n\n",

I know Beetlejuice didn\u2019t have much screen time in the original, but it still feels like this movie is missing his presence.\n\nBut Willem Dafoe was absolutely hysterical in it. I loved every scene he was in, the way he talked so proudly of himself and his career as an action Star, the fact that his assistant used cue cards and brought him coffee just for him to crush it every single time into a big trash can",

        "content": "In Con Air, there\u2019s a really weird scene where Garland Greene, the creepy serial killer, sits down to have tea with a little girl at an airstrip. At first, it seems like maybe this is a turning point for him, like he\u2019s showing he\u2019s not all bad. But if you look closer, something feels off. No one else ever interacts with the girl\u2014she\u2019s only ever seen with Garland. In a movie full of loud, chaotic characters, she\u2019s this strangely quiet, almost ghostly presence. And where are her parents? If she were a real kid, wouldn\u2019t there be an adult around keeping an eye on her?\n\nThen there\u2019s the setting itself. The airstrip has a trailer park, but it\u2019s completely deserted. No adults, no movement, nothing. The whole place feels weirdly empty, like it\u2019s frozen in time. And the girl doesn\u2019t act like a normal child would\u2014she\u2019s way too calm, even though she\u2019s sitting across from a guy known for wearing people\u2019s heads as hats. It\u2019s almost like she doesn\u2019t belong in the same reality as everything else happening in the movie. Compared to all the violence and chaos surrounding this scene, she seems completely separate, like she\u2019s not really there.\n\nBut to my way of thinking, the biggest clie is when the plane crashes at the desolate airstrip. You\u2019d expect people from the trailer park *next door* to come running out to see what\u2019s going on. But nobody does. It\u2019s like the place was never really alive to begin with. If the girl were real, someone would have noticed her or reacted to the huge explosion nearby. Instead, it\u2019s just silence. This makes it seem like Garland wasn\u2019t having a heartwarming moment with an innocent child\u2014he was talking to a ghost. And if that\u2019s true, it adds a creepy new layer to his character. Maybe he wasn\u2019t spared from his dark nature, but instead, he was drawn to something supernatural, like a sign that he\u2019s already got one foot in the world of the dead.",

How did John Rambo go from being a traumatized Veteran, tormented by his past and turned into a social avenger after being mistreated by bullying cops, to a loyal war mercenary, serving orders from army officials and fighting the Russians? \n\nI watched First Blood Part II in disbelief. Apparently, Ronald Reagan liked the Rambo sequels which doesn't put these films in a positive light. \n\nPart II wasn't even good. The point of the first film was a critique of fascism, of how veterans are not taken care off and become social outsiders bcause the Government refused to do its part. Part II almost completely forgot what the first film said, didn't get John Rambo is not G.I. Joe and basically turned the sequels into the antithesis of the crux of the original. Part II is generic, formulaic and violent. Some scenes are as cringy as any Chuck Norris' war film. Julia Nickson as Cao exists solely as the foreigner who yearns to be saved by an American.

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a neat little trick Steven Spielberg uses in his movies, starting with\u00a0*Jurassic Park*. There's a scene where Alan Grant is having raptors explained to him, while in the background, John Hammond is having a separate conversation. Both conversations are audible, but as the audience, you naturally focus on Grant\u2019s, which is more relevant to the plot. This layering of dialogue makes the world feel more lived-in, like we\u2019re overhearing real people rather than just following a scripted exchange.\n\nIn\u00a0*Saving Private Ryan*, that moment with the translator, Upham, works similarly. His nervous, clumsy energy contrasts with Captain Miller\u2019s (Hanks) composed discussion, reinforcing their dynamic. The overlapping dialogue makes it feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping rather than being spoon-fed exposition, adding a level of realism that pulls you deeper into the scene.\n\nSpielberg does this in\u00a0*Jaws*, too\u2014think about Brody, Hooper, and Quint talking over each other on the boat. The chaotic energy makes their interactions feel natural and unfiltered, pulling us deeper into their world.\n\nIt\u2019s such a clever way to enhance immersion without drawing attention to itself. Has anyone else noticed this in his other films? Would love to hear more examples!",

        "content": "I enjoy when films pull this off. Rather than focusing on what you're hearing or what characters are saying, the scene uses silence to make things feel more uncomfortable. Long pauses in dialogue where there's more to read from what isn't being said and the stretch of silence rather than what is being said. What are some movie scenes that pull this off really well? \n\nThe Shining stands out as a really strong example. There's a scene with Jack and Grady that has plenty of silent moments in between conversation.  Just long awkward pauses within the conversation that really made the scene feel more eerie.

        "content": "I\u2019m 64 years old and I haven\u2019t enjoyed the \u201cHorror\u201d genre since being a teenager. I bought the Nosferatu 4K steelbook as a blind buy.\n\nI absolutely LOVED it. Everything about it from the writing to the acting to the photography and its transfer to 4K.\n\nNow unfortunately I\u2019ve fallen down a deep rabbit hole having now watched Bram Stoker's Dracula in 4K and loved that as well And I have the preorder in for \u201cRenfield\u201d at Walmart.\n\nMy question is, are there any other horror movies on the same level as Nosferatu? I didn\u2019t like the Lighthouse and have the VVITCH on the way.",

I'm thinking of movies like Hell or High Water, No Country for Old Men, Way of the Gun, Drive, Heat. I don't there is this certain sense of doom that I kind of feel from these movies and I want more, I really enjoy the types of endings these movies have and I'm looking for more. I'm just having a tough time exactly expressing what that certain feeling or vibe is.",

From the way they looked, to the way they moved, and especially the way they behaved, they just gave off an incredible vibe of being creatures not from this dimension.\n\nSo it got me wanting more movies with strange monsters that just feel incredibly unsettling.

They don\u2019t necessarily have to be Jackie Chan movies\u2014other actors who are just as skilled in martial arts are great too. That\u2019s why I also really enjoyed Donnie Yen later on.\n\nI remember when Jackie Chan was involved in Gen X Cops\u2014I was a teenager when it came out, and I thought it was absolutely amazing. So I\u2019d love to know if there are any modern martial arts movies that capture the same kind of action, creativity, and energy.\n\nI already have watched a lot so I would love to hear your recommendations!",
