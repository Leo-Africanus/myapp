        "content": "I believe it's still on Disney+, maybe by writer and directors Alex Garland and Danny Boyle who did 28 Days Later as well, it's one of the most unique, modern sci-fi films that have been made in recent decades still, and it has scenes that just swallow up all of your attention.\n\nWhat is interesting about that movie is its connection to 28 Years Later which comes out soon. Danny and Garland fell out in the production of this movie, creatively, and over the years they've both reflected on why that was. According to Garland he wanted the movie to be a slow-burn, and very contemplative, where the conclusion would be that the crew would give in to their mission to restart the dying sun, by just letting themselves die and accept the possibility that the mission might be a fluke. In his original script which can still be bought, the movie has many, many differences to what Danny Boyle ended up making onto screen, where they play chess in the opening and ending. There are still deleted scenes in the DVD of the characters playing chess.\n\nBut ultimately, what frustrated Garland and caused him to start directing on his own (making films like Ex Machina, Annihilation and Civil War) was that Danny Boyle was fixated on figuring out a solution to the plot that would be more hopeful and positive. He started making more and more editorial decisions to the script, and Danny recalled Garland pointing at an idea of making an intro-monologue to explain the premise saying \"If you do that, I'm off the project.\"\n\nThat also makes the movie interesting in itself -- how it's stuck between versions and is arguably an unfinished draft. The biggest complaint is that 2/3rds into it people joke it turns into \"Jason X\", but curiously this part is also in Garland's script, but everything just happens at a different location and leads to a different endgame.\n\nI highly recommend giving it a watch. It's a deeply evocative, but also epic science fiction, that has an all-star cast that create some intense scenes together where you're glued to the screen. It's easy if you already like Chris Evans (Captain America) who even said this was his favorite movie to make.\n\nCLIP: [Chris Evans as \"Mace\" in Sunshine (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUfubQCfHUU)",

If you as an actor are the one beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak ocean of mediocrity, you have done your job ten times over. \n\nSo, what are the best examples?\n\nI will die on this hill but Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody absolutely deserved every single ounce of praise that he got. The movie as a whole is wildly inconsistent and definitely is not a great film especially in terms of honouring the legacy of a band as iconic and truly legendary as Queen, but Maleks performance I will to the hilt defend because he put everything he had into the portrayal. In a bad movie, he very much deserved his Oscar win. Fight me. ",

As we watched it, I picked up on something I hadn't noticed in previous viewings.\n\nThere is a scene where Drew Barrymore's character Lucy invites her dad and brother to watch *The Sixth Sense*, which is new to her but not them (due to her memory problems). When talking about it afterwards, Lucy says something like \"I can't believe Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time!\", thus spoiling the ending of that movie. \n\nIt caught me off guard because it was so blatant. But that got me wondering: are there other examples of a movie spoiling a different, completely unrelated movie? ",

I\u2019m looking for more films like this, slow-paced but gripping, where every frame feels like art, and the story unfolds with emotional depth. \n\nOpen to any language or genre, as long as it leaves a lasting impact. What should I watch next?\n\nEdit - I should have added something that available on streaming for free. ",

        "content": "Just finished watching my favorite Tarantino film for the umpteenth time, but I just noticed something that I guess went over my head on previous viewings.\n\nNear the end, we see Ordell laying low at this house after killing Louis and abandoning the van. There\u2019s a woman on the couch and he talks to her and says the hilarious line \u201cThis some repugnant shit\u201d. Later on, when Max Cherry shows up, that woman is still sitting on the couch, but she\u2019s not moving. Ordell tells Max to sit on the couch next to her, and even says \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re here\u201d. I also noticed Ordell had some bloodstains on his yellow shirt.\n\nIs that woman supposed to be Sheronda, and did he kill her? If so, why? Earlier in the film he refers to how he\u2019s got multiple properties with women staying at each one, one of which is the house in Compton he told Sheronda (who he referred to as a \u201ccountry girl\u201d) that it was actually Hollywood. That\u2019s gotta be the same house he was lying low in, right? We also see Sheronda during the trial run of the money exchange, so we know she was kinda part of the thing. I guess she was considered a liability? Idk, I couldn\u2019t find anything about this while searching online. Maybe someone here knows more than I do. Thanks!",

        "content": "rob zombie's 2003 horror movie house of 1000 corpses holds the dubious honor of being one of the very few movies in existence where many members of it's cast died before it turned 20 years old. before the film's 20th anniversary in 2023, 7 members of it's cast died. \n\nthe first was dennis fimple who was actually sick from heart disease at the time, hence why his character sits down for most of the movie. however, it was not the disease that claimed his life but a car crash in 2002. house of 1000 corpses would be fimple's final movie, releasing the year after his death.\n\nthen came matthew mcgrory, a man who is largely known for holding the guinness book of world records for the tallest actor, standing at 7 feet tall and 6 inches. mcgrory's career was relatively short with only a few film credits and television credits to his name. most people will likely know him as karl the giant from tim burton's big fish. it's worth noting that he was one of only 4 actors from house of a 1000 corpses to return for the film's sequel the devil's rejects, reprising his role as tiny firefly. the same year that movie came out, mcgrory would pass away from congestive heart failure at the age of 32. the devil's rejects is dedicated to his memory. \n\nthen came karen black, a woman who needs no introduction if you're a fan of horror. she stars in house of 1000 corpses as mama firefly, the matriarch of the firefly family. she did not return for the sequel the devil's rejects due to demanding too high a salary to come back. after house of 1000 corpses, she continued to get steady work in both film and television until her 2013 death from cancer at the age of 74.\n\nthen there was tom towles. towles was a character actor who broke out into mainstream success with his portrayal of otis in henry portrait of a serial killer. throughout his career, he starred in many different movies and tv shows. house of 1000 corpses wasn't even his final collaboration with rob zombie as towles later starred in the devil's rejects, halloween, and the fake trailer for werewolf women of the SS. towles died in 2015 at the age of 65 from a stroke. \n\nthen there was irwin keyes, an actor who took full advantage of his towering height to play larger then life characters. throughout his career, he starred in many movies of many different genres and played many different roles. in 2015, keyes died at the age of 63 from complications of acromegaly.\n\nthen there was sid haig, who despite his long career in both film and television is likely forever destined to be known as captain spaulding, one of the greatest killer clowns in film history. his performances as spaulding is often considered to be among the strongest parts of those movies. in september of 2019, haig died at the age of 80 from pneumonia. his final performance as captain spaulding was in 3 from hell.\n\nfinally, there was michael J pollard, a famous character actor who had been acting since the 1950s. he was known for playing quirky and off beat supporting characters. he had a respectable career and even earned an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his role in bonnie and clyde. after house of 1000 corpses, pollard went into semi retirement, only making 2 more movies before his 2019 death from cardiac arrest at the age of 80. \n\nRIP to them all.",
