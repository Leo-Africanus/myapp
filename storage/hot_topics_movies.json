        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

Whether taken as a whole seperate work or as the culmination of several of the darker heroes storylines, this movie was a treat. The main character Yelena narrates the opening with a realization \u201cthere is something wrong with me\u201d and the direction of the movie explores the idea of inner reflection with gusto. Every character in this film has something they are dealing with. Some dark regret they have to deal with, and it culminates in a shared realization of the method by which to deal with one\u2019s pain: friends. The movie implicitly prescribes friends as the cure for depression. It\u2019s heartwarming in every sense and also gives the team an unshakeable bond that was both fun to watch form as well as believable. This was a good movie. It doesn\u2019t have the best storyline in marvel, that honor still belongs to Nebula, but it does tell a coherent and touching story about why we all need friends.",

        "content": "I remember when the speed racer movie came out I was so excited initially because I loved all the iterations of speed racer, all the cartoons, the manga, the comics, I found the story interesting and the world so different from any other series. Then the reviews came out, and it was panned, even today on rotten tomatoes has a 42% critic and a 60% viewer score. Disappointed I didn't see it until years later when it was available on streaming and I cannot believe I denied myself that long. I don't know why people seem to hate when a movie is heavily stylized or just trying to be fun but it's EXACTLY what it should have been. It captured the feeling of the cartoon and manga very well, all the cheeseyness included. The story was fine if predictable, but who doesn't know the story of speed racer to some extent. The actors who were part of it were very clearly giving 110% to it. The world, as I said before, was EXTREMELY stylized. Beyond even that they had some crazy interesting shots. All while managing to keep the tone of the movie fun BUT serious to the characters even if we would find it ridiculous.\n\nI'm not gonna sit here and say it's a need to watch movie, it's not telling some crazy story that everyone needs to experience. It's not ground breaking in effects, or visuals, or acting. That being said the fact this movie was PANNED on release is criminal. So if you're looking for a movie where the people who made it cared 100% and the actors were giving everything they had and is such a fun time you'll wonder where the time went you should watch it.",

I was with a friend and he whispers to me \u201cdude she\u2019s like perfect\u201d and I just nodded in agreement. Totally forgot about the movie for like a minute or two.\n\nI still say her face game in that movie is unmatched in the history of cinema. ",

It\u2019s darkly funny watching him try to get it right and failing in ridiculous ways, yet slowly improving. \n\nThat experience made me realize how many films I might dismiss too quickly based on trailers or hype.

        "title": "The Bikeriders, 2024 (rewind)",
        "content": "Hello guys\n\nI recently saw The Bikeriders, starring Tom Hardy, Jodie Comer and Austin Butler. Upon release it made little to no money and the audience didnt like it either. I had friends who have seen it and they said it was lackluster to say the least. Overall it was called a mediocre movie.\nSo as you can imagine, I had no high hopes seeing it, but since Jeff Nichols (the director) is one of my favourites since Mud (2013) and I like all the actors in it I was thrilled a little bit still. \nTo my biggest surprise it was so good, I would even call it one of the best films Ive seen in a while, meaning \"best\" in a traditional movie way.\n\nI didnt quite manage to discover the flaws that the others mentioned, mainly the absence of the story.\nAs I see it theres a clear and straightforward story that the movie wants to tell. It is one of the driest and realest representation of how life works basically. I just cant comprehend how people missed this.\nI really dont wanna be \"that one guy\", but it pretty much seems like Im the only one with this opinion. \nThe reason why this movie is so important is because to my knowladge, this is one of the few films from recent times that deals with life in this aspect, the most important aspect. \nIts uncontrollability.\n\"You can give everything to a thing and you can give it everything you got, but its still gonna do what its gonna do\".\nThis is the key element of the movie and the key to life itself too.\n\nTho we see the sad story of a group of homies turned into a gang, this problem they face is real for anyone.\nWe see a lot of interesting and deep down good hearted and good natured human beings trying their best to find something real. To feel that they are wanted somewhere. They are all outcasts and that is what ties them together. There is an unspeakable tragedy in that when these \"friendly\" outcast people are forced to be in the same cathegory as the bad people who are forced to the edge of periphery for much more stronger reasons. The movie deals with the important question that why does someone doesnt deserve to be the part of the bigger picture and who decides it and on what terms exactly. The film shows that even though you can have good intentions your actions will be measured by your sorroundings and you cant do shit about it. Only the illusion of possibility stays. I think this is a very very very important lesson to life. \n\nTheres something beautiful in humans you know, and this films shows it. The beautiful fact that even after the world tells you, you are not someone who can be the part of 'the society', you still try to find connections and still be the part of something. As this gives you meaning. To deprive someone from the right to belong somewhere is the most hurtful and unhuman thing you can do, since all of us crave this feeling, even more so in a broken world. And this movies is all about this.\n\n As I said Ive seen no movies like this as much as I can recall.\nYeag sure, there is no traditional story telling as you would have in a Dune movie or in other so called \"absolute cinema\" movies. But there are evergreen lif lessons about loss and human connections. \nIm very sad that it flew over so many people heads.\nIts a gem a of a movie and I ask you to give it a chance wheter you have seen it or not.\nIm interested in your opinion,\nCheers",
