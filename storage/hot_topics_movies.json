        "title": "Dumb and Dumber (1994) was my favorite movie as a kid and it holds up better than I expected as an adult",
        "content": "I'm 35 now and rewatched it a couple weeks ago. I had categorized the movie in the \"dumb comedies for preteens\" bucket since I'd last watched it 20+ years ago, but now think that it's an all-time great comedy. Highlights:\n\n* They're dumb enough for great slapstick but not mentally challenged like they are in the sequels. For example, Lloyd's plot to make Seabass pay for their meals at the diner shows that he's competent enough to move the plot forward, instead of just being a passive imbecile. \n* Jeff Daniels was mainly a serious actor but took on a role opposite the funniest actor of his generation and made no effort to out-funny him. If he had, the chemistry would fail. Harry isn't quite a straight man, but he's competent enough to be a good foil to Lloyd. IMO this dynamic makes the romantic rivalry over Mary Swanson work better than if he had played either extreme.\n* Jim Carrey might be at his best in this movie. His ad-libs (\"big gulps huh?) are some of the most memorable lines and he doesn't go full cartoon character like he did in the Ace Ventura movies.\n* There's just enough sincerity to make it all come together. \"I'm sick and tired of eking my way through life\" is a great dramatic scene.\n* The writing is pretty damn smart in some scenes. When Harry learns that Lloyd had extra gloves that he wasn't sharing when the two were roughing it in the snow, he strangles him and Lloyd responds \"you're hands are freezing!\" It's a great exchange that I didn't catch as a kid.\n* There's a good mix of throwaway gags (\"we landed on the moon!\") and longer-form absurdity that relates directly to the plot, like the IOUs or selling a dead bird to a blind kid. \n* It's ultimately a movie about friendship. The resolution doesn't involve either of them shacking up with Mary Swanson, instead they just go on to new adventures, with fundamentally the same relationship that they'd had at the beginning. \n* Dumb and Dumber's soundtrack is one of the best compilations of rock-heavy 90's music that I've heard. Music is never overused, but it frames scenes perfectly. Boom Shackalack and Mary Moon are tied inextricably to those scenes in my mind.\n\nMore than anything it's just funny as hell in every way that it can be. What other comedies cover such a nice spectrum?",

The premise is incredible. A memory-retrieval noir set in a flooded Miami. Feels like Blade Runner fanfic set in the world of Inception.\n\nBut halfway through, it just evaporates. The plot turns into a sluggish romance, the mystery fizzles, and Hugh Jackman ends up swimming through people\u2019s memories in a tank. All the momentum vanishes in a haze of voiceovers, flashbacks, and unnecessary monologues about time.\n\nNot talking about movies that were bad from the start, I mean the ones that trick you into thinking they\u2019re about to be amazing.

So basically Samara has an 'I can change him' boyfriend who is in trouble with the mob boss Andy Garcia and now it is up to her to bail him out. \n\nIts basically a heist dark comedy of sorts. The movie is actually not that bad. Karl Glusman( never heard of him or seen him before) stars as the dead weight boyfriend. There is this one particular emotional scene with the Glusman bloke and my first thought was....He has acted very well. The problem with the movie is that there are a few emotional scenes with Samara weaving as well and she cannot act to save her life. \n\nI am surprised that Andy Garcia doesn't get more work. He is a fantastic actor. Its a decent one time watch movie. ",

I\u2019m cool with that part.\n\nWhat I\u2019m more fuzzy on is the whole \u201cgetting stuck\u201d thing. Like, if you\u2019re under with a group and everyone else comes back up but you\u2019re still asleep, couldn\u2019t they just shake you awake? Or do the \u201cdunk\u201d? Or does it not work that way once you\u2019re hooked into the dream-sharing setup?\n\nJust trying to wrap my head around the mechanics a bit better\u2014anyone got a clear explanation? \n\nHe was so concerned most of the movie about making sure he was back- but he was also never alone. Couldn\u2019t your partner physically bring you back? \n",
