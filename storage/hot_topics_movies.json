        "title": "'HIM' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*HIM centers on a promising young football player (Tyriq Withers), invited to train at the isolated compound of a dynasty team's aging QB1. The legendary quarterback (Marlon Wayans) takes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 on a blood-chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, power and pursuit of excellence at any cost.*\n\nDirector: Justin Tipping\n\nCast: Marlon Wayans, Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox\n\nProducer: Jordan Peele\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [30%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/him_2025_2/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [39 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/him/)\n\n[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \\- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \\- 3 / 10\n\n&gt;\"Him\" falters as a comedy and even more so as a horror film, rarely putting in the effort to build tension or create memorable scares.\n\n[New York Magazine/Vulture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/334) \\- [Bilge Ebiri](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bilge-ebiri)\n\n&gt;The movie at times plays like a high-budget student film: It\u2019s eager to impress us with technique. And it does, at least until we realize that there\u2019s not much else going on.\n\n[Newsday](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/338) \\- [Rafer Guzman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/rafer-guzman) \\- 0 / 4\n\n&gt;\"HIM\" does not have the Peele touch. What it has is an intriguing premise, but no coherent story and no clear idea of what it wants to say.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [Frank Scheck](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/frank-scheck)\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, *Him*, directed by Justin Tipping (*Kicks*), squanders its potential. While it starts out promisingly, it seriously devolves in its second half into a surreal phantasmagoria that\u2019s more gonzo than chilling. If you\u2019re looking for a truly disturbing film about the dehumanizing effects of professional football in the corporate age, the one to see is still 1979\u2019s *North Dallas Forty*. \u00a0\n\n[The Direct](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100010147) \\- [Jeff Ewing](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jeff-ewing) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Marlon Wayans is exceptional, and well supported overall by the film's other players. Some moments do add confusion, but it ultimately comes together well enough to be a laudable experimental effort.",

        "content": "I went on a George C. Scott binge recently, and I came across Hardcore. This film is really interesting, it is about a father whose teenage daughter goes missing in California and turns up in a porno film. This leads him to search for her and leads him into the subculture of pornography.\u00a0\n\nI got to say, I honestly think this film is overlooked &amp; underrated. What makes the film is George C. Scott and his performance as the father, Jake van Horn, who immerses himself into the industry we would never dare go into, just so that he could find his daughter. George C. Scott is just a good actor, who always commits himself to the role and always is the best part of anything he is in. Season Hubley is also great as Joanne, a prostitute who help Jake find his daughter. What I like is that Joanne and Jake found a grudging respect for each other, in spite of the cultural differences between them. Also good was Peter Boyle as the private investigator\n\nHowever, I did feel that the ending was a bit of a letdown, which I found predictable. I did read that Paul Schrader was forced to change the ending from what he originally intended it to be.\u00a0\n\nBut regardless I did enjoy the film and I do think it is overlooked.",

All of the cowboys riding into the town to avenge the deaths of their 2 fellow cowboys and the rest of that scene of them sitting down to eat the feast. And the music just adds to the drama. Meeting the cowboys and all that, especially Johnny Ringo,\u00a0[who just straight up shoots a priest right between the eyes](https://youtu.be/9DChwPjMK5U?t=265)\u00a0bc he was annoyed with him talking all that shit. And then\u00a0[our first intro to Doc Holiday](https://youtu.be/kEPVuP_q5hs?t=6). Again, near perfection in my opinion. His mannerisms and gestures are so on point. He is just such a bad ass. The whole film was just so well casted, written, directed, scored, and edited. I love it a little more every time I see it.",
