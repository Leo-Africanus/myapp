Before a massive charge towards the enemy lines he pins the poster to a log in the trench he\u2019s about to exit.\n\nAt the very end of the movie in which Paul and the German army are instructed to charge enemy lines one last time before the armistice was signed at 11am, he\u2019s fatally stabbed.\n\nHe stumbles out sits down and passes away. The camera pans to show the surroundings and all of sudden you see the poster that\u2019s still pinned to the log that his friend pinned up.\n\nI realized last night that it\u2019s the exact same trench that they charged out of half way though the movie and the same trench that they charged to get into at the end of the war. It basically went to show that during the war, neither side actually made true gains but rather fought from and fought to win, again and again. They fought over the same small piece of land repeatedly. Insane.",

        "content": "I had to pause District 9 as I was watching it, I was thrilled during the final mech fight scene. Invested so fully and realizing the stakes. Edge of my seat; if we're gonna get lame about it. I had to stop myself and the movie at that moment and realize there's been nothing quite like this since then and Blomkamp wasn't some schmuck.\n\nElysium came and went and no one really seemed to care much about it. I thought it was tightly constructed, had a great villain and a pulsive narrative that kept me excited. I'm biased on this one, I like it and I think it's overlooked. But again, I don't think there's any denying the energy of the directing.\n\nThen we come to Chappie, which was a truly odd screw up of a movie. Everyone seemed to get makeup done by different studios and show up to shoot this movie at different times. It is awkward and Die Antwoord are truly terrible. The sad thing is, Copley gives a strong vocal performance and there is a shell of a really great movie here but it's fumbled by baffling decisions.\n\nMy opinion is that he deserves at least one more shot. When he was up for bat for the Alien and Robocop franchises, I was I excited! Specifically because they aren't based on his homegrown ideas. Elysium was diet-Halo and Chappie was....just not great, both of those are pretty much based off his written ideas. District 9 was more of a leftover idea from the defunct Halo film, COMBINED with Blomkamp's vague futurism ideas.\n\nTo make a long story short; I think he's a great director and a lousy writer. In that sense, I almost thought of him as the next Ridley Scott. Think there's lots of wasted potential with him.",

        "content": "There are 14 books in the Wizard of OZ series (This is **excluding** Wicked and other books created by authors other than Frank Baum. I still like other media of it), each with different stories, different characters, and just colorful adventures for days! (I am on ***Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz***! I havent read all the books yet, but I will get there soon!) \n\nThe books are a bit dark and sometimes confusing, but the story is very intresting and there is a lot to the world of Oz. Especially when it comes t the characters. Dorothy isn't the only main character of the series, and the Wicked Witch isn't truly the main bady of Oz.\n\nI am really surprised that there hasn't been a successful TV show made from these books, let alone a movie **trilogy** (or to some extend, an MCU of the OZ) Like there are so many unique characters in the Oz world that a movie can be made from them.",

        "content": "All these years later and no Western hits quite like Tombstone. \n\nThe screenplay is *drenched* in style and atmosphere. The dialogue and scenes are tightly trimmed and move at a quicker pace than more classic westerns-- yet somehow characters still feel fully realized and unique, with inconic character moments left and right. Val Kilmer delivers the performance of his career and one that would be endlessly quoted in pop culture for decades after--but Kurt Russell, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, and others (seriously, look up the cast, *everyone* was in this movie)-- they all deliver great character performances that feel unique and lived in, with tons of emotional intensity. This is not a quiet, meditative \"prestige\" Western. It's operatic, mythical, melodrama that somehow never gets old. \n\nHonestly, does anyone actually watch Kurt Russell above *without* getting chills? \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe biblical symbolism is heavy handed but melodramatic by design and it carries throughout the film. Cowboys represent the worst of human nature, a plague requiring divine retribution. The film sets up Wyatt to step into that archetype of the pale rider of death--which he is in a larger sense--&gt;!but Doc Holiday, a man who is literally pale with tuberculosis and  looks like a walking corpse, comes to embody this archetype for Ringo, bringing him his personal apocalyptic retribution in the film's climax.!&lt;",

        "content": "To me it's kind of a mashup of Blade Runner and Minority Report with the animation style from Invincible*. It's French, with subtitles.\u00a0\n\nI think the writing stands out. Lots of animation has mediocre writing. This one is grappling with concepts of freedom and identity and consciousness.\u00a0\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;Mars Express is the first feature film of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie P\u00e9rin, a French animator known for the 2016 animated TV series Lastman.[3] P\u00e9rin said he was inspired by hard-boiled film noir detectives in movies such as Chinatown, The Long Goodbye, Kiss Me Deadly, and Point Blank. Since the protagonists of those were all men he wanted to see the differences when a woman was put in the main role.[3]\n\n\n&gt;P\u00e9rin said he was also inspired by movies in which the protagonist realizes that they are in a conspiracy that is too big for them, such as Three Days of the Condor, All the President's Men, The Parallax View, Blow Out, and The Conversation.[3]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Express_(film)\n\n\\* some people probably dislike this animation style but I think it's probably cost effective and that's why studios pick it. It's tough to make a good\u00a0 animated movie with a reasonable budget.\u00a0",
