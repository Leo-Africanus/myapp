        "title": "The Sean Bailey Era of Remakes Is Over Soon",
        "content": "Sean Bailey Greenlit the Last of the Disney Live Action Remakes\n\nIn 2024, after a string of live action remakes that underperformed on Disney+ and in theaters (The Little Mermaid for example), David Greenbaum became the head executive for all Disney live action films.\n\nUnder Sean Bailey, his primary focus was the live action remakes or reimaginings of their animated catalogs including original films for streaming like Noelle, Togo, and several under 20th Century Studios before a sudden choice to shift over to the Disney label likely after Home Sweet Home Alone did poorly with critics.\n\nOutside of Lilo and Stitch, Snow White underperformed. Greenbaum came in and Stitch got upgraded to a theatrical release instead of streaming (it still has some of the Bailey-isms of the remakes since Beauty and the Beast).\n\nTangled getting a remake was either a Bailey decision or an Iger choice way before Greenbaum, it probably at just been in development for a number of years until the sudden change in leadership.\n\nNow that Stitch 2025 is a high, could they be more selective of what they want to reimagine? Or is this just a short transitional period until David Greenbaum champions more original and fresh IPs just as Iger is getting ready to retire in 2026?\n\nNevertheless, the oversaturation of live action remakes is slowly coming to an end and the fatigue is showing more some movies that don\u2019t work.\n\nUPDATE: Considering the recent developments at Disney, I need to add more context. Daria Cercek is handling all live action theatrical movies for the Walt Disney Studios label as she came from Paramount. David Greenbaum is the president of all live action theatrical including Searchlight and 20th Century.",

        "title": "'M3GAN 2.0' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous rampage, its creator, Gemma, has become an advocate for government oversight of AI. Unbeknownst to her, a defense contractor has created a military-grade weapon known as Amelia, the ultimate infiltration spy. However, as Emlia's self-awareness increases, it becomes less interested in taking orders. Hoping to stop Emilia, Gemma decides to resurrect M3GAN, making it faster, stronger, and more lethal.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [62%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan_20)\n\n**Metacritic:** [56/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/m3gan-20/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\-  4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is, admittedly, a pretty bizarre conflagration of tones and ideas. But so were most of the Child\u2019s Play films... and the rollercoaster effect of never quite knowing what genre Johnstone might pull from next is a key part of the fun.\n\n[Empire Magazine - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/m3gan-2/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is more absurd, self-aware silliness: a riot of timely tech paranoia, with almost no horror but a ton of successful comedy. Slay, queen! We are following *Terminator 2* rules here: if AMELIA is the cold, ruthless, unstoppable T-1000, then M3GAN is the T-800 who can take her on \u2014 the fan-favourite baddie gone good \u2014 with Williams\u2019 Gemma as the tech-sceptical Sarah Connor-type, who must learn to love her former foe. (Because if a M3GAN can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too?)\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/m3gan-2-0-review-allison-williams-1236298922/)\n\n&gt;The campy sense of mischief that made Gerard Johnstone\u2019s 2023 hit *M3GAN* so enjoyable asserts itself intermittently in *M3GAN 2.0*, a logical title for a follow-up to the thriller about a murderous robot. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, *Mission: Impossible* and the *Austin Powers* franchise. There are amusing moments reminiscent of the original, but in terms of tone and coherence, the movie loses its way.\n\n[AV Club - Anna McKibbin](https://www.avclub.com/m3gan-2-0-review) \\-  C+\n\n&gt;It seems that Johnstone and his collaborators learned the wrong lesson from *M3GAN*\u2018s shocking success (the original did fairly well in the box office and launched a thousand memes). Audiences weren\u2019t won over by the film\u2019s philosophical untangling of man and tech, but flocked to see M3GAN\u2019s uncanny physicality and unique murder tactics. This was a robot who combined the familiar (bitchy villain dialogue) and unfamiliar (galloping after a child like a dog in a frilly dress). She was Chucky meets *Heathers*. Unfortunately, neither AMELIA, nor this new more morally driven M3GAN, engender that same delighted shock, and so Johnstone settles for the worst of both worlds\u2014something that limps, with exaggerated metal squeaks, into the future.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/06/m3gan-2-0-review-sequel-1236441718/)\n\n&gt;With AI and its constant advancements a frightening eal-life prospect that can out-horror any horror film with its evil possibilities, the *M3GAN* franchise, as steroided-up as this sequel is, is fighting against time to remain science fiction instead of being a template for a future documentary\\*.\\* Still it is all a lot of fun to watch, and the filmmakers have met the requirements expected by a sequel designed to outdo its predecessor where *more* becomes the mantra. What made the first film such an instant hit, even in its marketing months before release with that dancing doll image, really can\u2019t be replicated, but this edition is so jacked-up we still can dig it for what it is. All of the players deliver and there is a very amusing supporting turn from none other than Jemaine Clement as an Elon Musk-style tech billionaire named Alton Appleton wanting to take the latest creations from Gemma and company to more questionable heights. Clement delivers some nice laughs as you might expect.",
