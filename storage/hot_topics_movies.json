There is no lyp-synching or blending of voices between actor and subject. It is all Chalamet in the same way\u00a0*Walk The Line*\u00a0was all Phoenix and Witherspoon, and\u00a0*Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter*\u00a0was all Spacek.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-james-mangold-1236081991/) (70):\n\n&gt;Whatever script flaws there are in terms of structure, plot momentum and an opaque central character,\u00a0*A Complete Unknown*\u00a0offers rewards in its lived-in performances and in the exhilarating music sequences that propel it forward. For many audiences with an affection for Dylan\u2019s music and the era in general, that will be enough.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (39/100):\n\n&gt;A superficial illustration of the artist\u2019s allure, interspersed with endless, increasingly comical shots of people watching him perform and smiling beatifically.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/10/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamets-bob-dylan-is-an-electric-revelation) (100):\n\n&gt;Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format. It\u2019s all rise, but troubled and unclear. You might not buy Chalamet\u2019s Dylan at first; I didn\u2019t, until that Guthrie bedside scene. There is amazing bravado in this performance.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/10/bob-dylan-movie-review-a-complete-unknown/76857860007/) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is that rare biopic that leaves you wanting to watch it again\u00a0*and*\u00a0go on a Spotify deep dive, and you're apt to find new respect both for Dylan as a bluesy contrarian and Chalamet as a top-shelf thespian of his generation.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/a-complete-unknown-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;James Mangold's A Complete Unknown explores the music of Bob Dylan with fantastic care and a great performance by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-complete-unknown-review-timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan) (70):\n\n&gt;Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold takes his hands off the steering wheel for A Complete Unknown, resulting in a Bob Dylan biopic that takes unpredictable turns. Rather than connecting the dots between how the world influenced him (and how he influenced it in turn), the film frames his enormous musical sea changes as personal drama for his peers. It\u2019s formally straightforward, but its focus on the characters in Dylan\u2019s life \u2013 rather than the musician himself, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2013 turn him into an enigma, for better or worse.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-complete-unknown-bob-dylan-movie-review-b2661910.html) (60):\n\n&gt;Despite the drip-fed reminders of contemporary history (the Cuban Missile Crisis! the Kennedy assassination! Weren\u2019t the Sixties wild, man!), A Complete Unknown struggles to fully engage with Dylan\u2019s relationship to that intersection between politics and music.\n\nWritten and Directed by James Mangold:\n\n&gt;The film follows the life and career of musician\u00a0[Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)\u00a0from January 1961, when he moves from Minnesota to New York City, to his 1965 concert at the\u00a0[Newport Folk Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival), resulting in\u00a0[controversy over the use of electric instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy).",

However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?\n\nFirst one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.\n\nAnother example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo. (UPDATE: It's called \"The Firing Squad\")",

But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien\u2019s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm\u2019s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we\u2019ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.\n\n[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):\n\n&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson\u2019s LotR in the best way. It\u2019s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):\n\n&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from \"The War of the Rohirrim.\" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that\u2019s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It\u2019s hard to get mad at this movie, but it\u2019s oh so easy to be disappointed.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson\u2019s trilogy \u2014 few do \u2014 but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):\n\n&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):\n\n&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth\u2019s famous legends.\n\n\\--------\n\nDirected by Kenji Kamiyama\n\n&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001\u20132003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.\n\nRelease Date: December 13",

        "title": "La La Land\u2019s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009)",
        "content": "I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb\u2019s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.\n\nDespite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would\u2019ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would\u2019ve played out in other circumstances, I can\u2019t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could\u2019ve been, and ill-fated love. \n\nThe way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It\u2019s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. \n\nI know it\u2019s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children\u2019s movie, but I couldn\u2019t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they\u2019re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. \n\nBarring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up? Any thoughts about La La Land and its ending? ",
