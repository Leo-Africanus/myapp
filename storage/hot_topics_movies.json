But that is just about the only major flaw this movie has, and its easy to get used to. The music, cinematography and animation all slap so hard. The standout feature though is the writing. Every single joke is clever, the plot is well paced, all the characters are unique and interact well with each other. \n\nAnd the premise, outright hillarious. I wont spoil anything but its a tightly interwoven set of threads that recontextualize each other; which all get expertly revealed in the correct order to maximize impact. Not to mention that despite the fairy tale aestetics, it delivers emotional moments and covers interpersonal relationships with light hearted respect. Also there is mystery and foreshaddowing for those paying attention and trying to piece the puzzle together before the characters do. ",

Some mob members killed a relative of a politician by mistake, and a few days later were killed by the mob in turn as punishment - at the time I thought, man, I don't even think they have a name for the emotion these guys were feeling when they realized how badly they fucked up.\n\n  \nSo then I thought, are there any good movies or scenes that capture really well that feeling of \"I fucked up, I'm going to die, and there's nothing I can do about it?\" It doesn't count if the person thinks there's a chance to fight it, it's gotta be realizing they are powerless to stop it.\n\n  \nThat famous scene in the Goodfellas is more or less that, but it was for a split second.

        "title": "Characters who had their names changed in movie adaptations",
        "content": "Adaptations inevitably take a lot of liberties when adapting something from another medium into a movie, but most of the time they try to keep the names of the characters the same, because there is usually no reason anyone would want to bother changing them. But sometimes names do get changed for one reason or another.\n\nOne notable example is how in the original Universal Frankenstein movies, Victor Frankenstein was renamed Henry Frankenstein, and Victor's friend Henry Clerval was renamed Victor Moritz. I have heard conflicting reasons, one was that excecutives thought that the name Victor sounded too \"severe\" and \"unfriendly\" to American audiences in 1931, the other more likely reason was that instead of the book the movie was adapting a play that had made the same name changes (why the play changed the names is also unclear).\n\nAnother example is how in Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, it was thought that Sauron and Saruman's name sounded too similar and would confuse audiences, so they changed Saruman's name to Aruman. The problem is that they apparently made this decision pretty late into production and it wasn't properly communicated, so the characters will alternatively say Saruman or Aruman at different points in the movie. To make matters more confusing, he's still called Saruman in the credits.\n\nSo what other characters had their names changed in the adaptation?",

I would expect the camera crew to be more jerky and suddenly stop if they are expecting to pan from him walking from the store directly to the car? Is it something they edited in post to make smoother, or they're just really good at smoothly following any unexpected action?",
