They are introduced in a triumphant way at first, but the intro progressively gets darker, in a way that I find more effective from the goofy costumes\n\nDollar Bill is gunned down because his cape got stuck in the revolving door of a bank he was hired to protect, Silhouette is killed in a hate crime after publicly showing her sexuality, and mothman is dragged off to a mental hospital ranting and biting.\n\nThere\u2019s a really great in universe documentary the crew made called under the hood that adds to a lot of this backstory",

I haven\u2019t had a cigarette in 8 years but almost considered smoking again for a fleeting moment. For those who don\u2019t know it\u2019s a danish film about a nice man who gets accused of being a pedophile. \n\nI want to kill every character in this movie lol. Holy fucking leading questions. It\u2019s realistic and this shit can happen to anybody, which makes it so hard to watch. There\u2019s been several instances so far where I yell the screen. I\u2019m not usually one to get bothered by film but this is just too real, and too helpless of a situation. \n\nI would never normally pause a movie to make a rant post. It\u2019s an odd thing to do. But I had to get that out of my system if I\u2019m going to finish this rollercoaster ride to suburban hell. Fuck all these people. I get why they\u2019re handling everything so poorly, it\u2019s a hard thing to deal with. But fuck the cop and his leading ass questions, fuck Gerthe, and fuck the parents for convincing their daughter that she was abused even though she told them she made it all up. \n\nI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t work with kids. \n\nEdit: finished. What a ride. I was surprised to see a happy ending and then BANG. right back to fuck this whole town. Idk if I missed something but idk who the shooter was. Fuck him. \n\nEdit 2: this post may seem like a complaint. It is not. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes movies that make them feel something, even if it\u2019s a bad feeling. ",

        "content": "I\u2019m don't like how a lot film and TV constantly depict the lower or working class as hopeless, self-destructive, uneducated losers. Someone\u2019s poor, therefore their life must be a tragedy of abuse, neglect, addiction, and ignorance, not a condition of unfettered capitalism. And it\u2019s usually packaged as \u201cgritty realism\u201d or \u201cmelodrama with heart.\u201d It seems sympathetic, but they still treat poverty as a moral failure, like being poor automatically makes you broken. I listed some examples but removed them because I feel that would make this post dwindle into a debate about how wrong I am about them and that isn't my point.\n\nObviously movies like Norma Rae do a good job. Billy Elliot and The Full Monty are good examples of movies that do it right. And the original run of Roseanne (I know, I know and I haven't seen The Conners) is pretty perfect in its tone. David Lynch's The Straight Story just came to mind. I am trying to remember but I feel My Name Is Earl didn't punch down at its characters.\n\nI'd love some recommendations for other movies/shows that would fit.",

It was quite the 80's/90's flashback that I completely forgot about about and never gave much thought to. Anyone else recall this distant memory?

        "content": "So, Kelly Reichardt is getting her new movie, \"The Mastermind\", realesed soon. AMC decided to use it as their monthly UNSEEN SCREENING. If you don't know, AMC shows off a new movie, that hasn't realesed yet, early and the audience won't know what it is. It's kept a secret and all you know about it going in is the rating and runtime. \n\nI say all this because Kelly Reichardt is not a general audience director. Her movies are very slow and methodical. Alot of scenes of nobody talking and just jazz music playing, which alot of people like. This is not a director who pleases the general audience. The day after the screenings, people have posted (on other socials) how boring the movie was. Rimming the director's usual style. \n\nNow, you could say \"Why hate on the director's style that she is know for?\" Thats the thing. No normal person knows Kelly Reichardt. To make an audience of regular joes go raw into one of her movies was not a good idea. I don\u2019t know why AMC chose this of all upcoming realeses.",
