I was having fun laughing at some of the stuff that I now see as overly dramatic but I found cool when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, once it got to the hospital (filmed at St Mary's in Long Beach) scene where Lauren is taken after Pacino finds her in the tub, I was very impressed by the actors in that scene - they seemed to really memorize their hospital lingo and make it believable.  But as I watched more, I kinda felt like the main doctor had to have been someone they just found at the hospital they filmed at and told him to \"pretend this just happened\".\n\nSo I wound up doing some quick research on imdb and got his name, but he's not credited in any other movie.  Some google searching led me to his profile, and everything seems to line up and definitely looks like he was a real doctor, pretty cool:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8buza1izazoe1.png?width=2080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1e96c63c1d057eb2e7ec47a521cec51c3f5e27\n\nAlso, I think the blonde nurse is also a real nurse too, she seems way to natural in her actions in that scene.",

Shot from Stan\u2019s perspective, they both look back at him and laugh amongst themselves, with Stan and the viewer unaware exactly what it is they\u2019re laughing about. At some point in the film (it\u2019s been a while), Stan confesses his love for Mary. In my mind, the clear implication from the conversation between Mary and Dr Mierzwiak is that Stan has at some point had Mary erased, and is now unknowingly falling for her again, something Mary and Dr Mierzwiak find to be comical.",

It's worth a watch, it's a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first \"anti-hero\" sad movies. \n\nAnyway, anybody else got stories like this?",

The bright colors (red, orange, yellow and green) have such an impact on the vibe of the film. With that said, Theo wears ALOT of red and orange colors. Similarly, the OS1 primary color is a bright orange which matches his shirt in the posted frame. Colors like red and pink symbolize love, and In this case, the start of Theodore and Samanthas romantic journey. Theodore continues to wear these bright orange/red shirts during the \"Honeymoon phase\" (as Theodore calls it) of their relationship. It signifies a healthy beginning to true love.\n\nHowever, as we dive into the issues that Theo and Sam face, he wears more neutral colors such as pale blue and white. When Sams prostitute shows up, Theo is wearing a white shirt. In this moment Theo is extremely uncomfortable, as he is being asked to have sex with someone hes never met by his computer girlfriend. This ultimately causes a pretty deep split between the two, probably the biggest we see in the whole movie aside from the breakup.\n\nAlthough It is a pretty obvious detail, the color usage is a very nice touch in my opinion. I love that colors symbolize the strength and status of Theo and Sams relationship as the movie plays on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vmtsjj4twoe1.jpg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0480a652ffe064fcd40d642c62d3100348a651\n\n",

The younger daughter is even a bit confused by this and ask if she's the product of incest.\n\n- The older daughter despises him and becomes very upset whenever he touches her.\n\n- There's a scene where he invites the younger daughter to watch TV with him instead of doing homework, and says \"we won't yell mom.\" He sits on the couch with his arm around her, and the camera lingers on him as he looks at her.\n\n- In the scene where the daughters visit him in the hotel room, he says \"I've never hurt you\" and the you ger daughter becomes upset to the point where she can't even speak and the older daughter rushes her out.\n\nIs this what the film was implying?",

        "content": "Okay, so yes, this is a bad movie, B movie all the way, was not stunning, was not amazing, but damn it dude, I had a blast watching this, like, Vin Disel doing all his most Vin Diseliest things, stupid plot, totally ridiculous, for some reason Michael Cane is in this thing. \n\nI did some research and found out that, much like Riddick, this movie was based on one of Vin's DnD characters. Like, all us dorks out there who play table top think \"Man a movie about my character would be so awesome,\" and spoiler, no, it would be stupid, and we have proof of that BECAUSE THERES A GUY OUT THERE NAMED VIN DISEL WHO SOMEHOW GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE MOVIES BASED ON HIS CHARACTERS and they're terrible, but they're so FUCKING fun!\n\nThe entire movie is tropes, EVERY scene, is a trope, its kind of amazing, I had a blast watching this 4/5 would recommend.",

        "title": "I rarely watch movies outside of the pop culture sphere, yet I watched \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\" and absilutely loved it",
        "content": "I've been seeing videos about the Criterion Closet for years now, so when I saw a stack of them in stores I picked one up at random and found I had pick Jeanne Dielman. I had no idea what the movie was abut, let alone that it was over 3 hours of the most mundane subject matter. Despite my inexperience with a larger movie portfolio, I still ended up loving this. What I found quite different about thsi movie form everything else I've ever watched is the lack of dialogue and busy on-screen motions is it gives you so much time to think about Jeanne and how she's acting. You can process through how she goes about her days in relation to you, and reckon with your preconceptions about what a home life is like for women like her. The buildup is long and nessecary so that it feels completely natural when she snaps in the last 10 minutes. I could totally see me never watching this again, but I'm really glad I went way out fo my comfort zone and tried something totally unique. It has really made me rethink waht exactly a movie is supposed to be.",

        "title": "Soylent Green",
        "content": "Charleston Heston movie that was ahead of its time and a dire warning as well.\nSOYLENT GREEN was a typical sci-fi dystopian movie from the 70 \u2018s when Heston\u2019s career was being regulated to such movies and campy disaster movies. \n\nCharleton Heston\u2019s career was a shadow of its former self after appearing in Beneath the Planet of the Apes but he had one last hurrah in SOYLENT GREEN when it comes to movies with important messages or warnings. He plays a NYC detective that investigates the company behind Soylent Green, a superfood whose ingredients are unknown to the public.\nThe movie addresses climate change, food supply, and overpopulation in a very dark manner. It was years before any of these subjects took center stage but Soylent Green was ahead of the curve. Makes you think about where today\u2019s processed food actually comes from and the effects it\u2019s having on the general population. Add additional comments.\n\nIts a very dark movie but in 70\u2019s people had access to healthier foods than we do today and I suspect if the situation ever came down to it, our government would feed us human remains while the rich and privileged get to enjoy real food.\nWe are approaching that time as corporations are considering feeding us bugs and drink cockroach milk.\nAnyway after SOYLENT GREEN, Heston did another dystopian movie called THE OMEGA MAN where in the end his blood provides a cure for a virus turning people into vampires. From that point on it was EARTHQUAKE and AIRPORT 75 and roles in lesser movies and TV shows until his final role in 2003. \n",
