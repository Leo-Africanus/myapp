Paddington 2 is the only thing I\u2019ve thought about all day and seeing the immense joy it\u2019s brought other people has also brightened my day even more. God I can\u2019t even think about the ending without wanting to kill myself because of how perfect it is. And can we also talk about the perfect bookend of his human mother saving him from the water like aunt Lucy did at the beginning? \n\nPure cinema, I truly can\u2019t wait to watch this movie with my kids for their first time.

Spielberg's version of West Side Story.\nWell, I saw it and I liked it, despite having a 6.5 on Filmaffinity.\nThe pace is good, the script is quite acceptable, but the car chases are on another level. Lily James, by the way, looks gorgeous. I recommend it.\n\nHave you seen her? You like me? I would like to know your opinion.\nGreetings.",

        "content": "Edit: It's TBS (2008)\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to find a film I watched about 10+ years ago, so I think it was made in early 2000s or late '90s. It's a psychological thriller(?), not mainstream, probably European\u2014maybe Scandinavian or from Northern Slavic countries.\n\nHere are the details I remember:\n\n- entire film has a bluish/blue tint/filter or I remember it like that because I was little \n\n- main characters are a blonde girl and a guy who's bald I think\n\n- the guy has large scars on his back that look like whip marks, which he got from childhood abuse\n\n- he kidnaps (and possibly rapes) the girl\n\n- I remember them running away through a forest and a river at some point\n\nThe ending scene is very memorable: the guy is holding the girl's necklace as a keepsake, and he is in a brutalist concrete building (lots of raw concrete, very stark). He kills the girl at the end. Edit: she finds a necklace box that contains jewellery from other murdered girls, so he kills her because she found it (?).\n\nThe atmosphere is tense and dark, more of a psychological thriller.\n\nThe film was shown on TV in late evening or night hours.\n\nEdit: main characters were both in late teenage years or early to mid twenties, the guy is a serial killer (and a serial rapist), I remember it like that\n\nIf anyone recognizes this film or can help identify it, I would be very grateful!\n\nThanks a lot!",

        "content": "I have watched 500 days of summer twice. The first time I saw it, i was 19 and really a hopeless romantic and funnily enough did not the get the message of the movie at all and sorta fell with the idea of love even more(not sure how that makes sense) but now that I\u2019m 25 and have been through a serious relationship which was very similar to that in the story I\u2019ve realized that it is actually a highly insightful movie about love and expectations and more importantly how important it is to not be resentful over someone not matching your expectations of a relationship.\nThe way the protagonist keeps on idolizing summer is exactly how I went about my relationship and watching the story unfold was like watching my own story through a 3rd person\u2019s perspective and finally might\u2019ve learned the art of letting go.",

Is anyone else that big of a fan of it or am I just crazy? Lol. \n\nOf course, what makes a movie great is largely subjective and this is just my opinion. But I'm still curious to see what kind of fanbase (if any) this movie has.",

Every once in awhile ill put on that movie ive seen a bazillion times for background noise or to go to sleep to ect and ill think about putting on the commentary track but I never do cuz I figure who wants to listen to people talk over my favorite movies, but I figure theres prolly some standouts that are really worth checking out right?

An example would be *U-571* where the United States takes credit for capturing the enigma machine when it was really done by the British and the Poles. \n\nWhat are other examples of movies like this where it portrays one country taking unjust credit over another country.?",
