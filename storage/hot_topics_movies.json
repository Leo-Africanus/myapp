He's using their knowledge of where a tornado has recently hit to go and buy up the survivor's land for cheap.  \n\n**Except that information is useless,** because everyone already knows if a town has been wiped out by a tornado, because it's immediately in the news. Shared on social media. Just _freely_ published in weather reporting data online.  \n\nSpending (presumably) tens of millions to know potentially minutes quicker is of absolutely no benefit. It's like hiring someone to let you know if your house has burned down, you'll already fucking know!  \n\n---  \n\n**Easy-fix**; change it so Marshall is funding StormPAR to predict where _future_ tornados are going to happen, allowing him to short companies with resources in the area (e.g. that oil refinery), or to buy up businesses _ahead_ of time, and slapping massive insurance policies on inflated associated assets. As soon as it becomes predictive (rather than reactive) it's an even better \"bad guy plot\" because it would mean they were potentially witholding that information from victims.",

Is it because Clint Eastwood is cool?\n\nI actually found myself rooting for The Bad because he was an outside force.\n\nThe only good thing that Blondie did was show humanity to the dying soldier, The Bad similarly showed humanity to the guy he gave the alcohol to.

There is a near infinite amount of planets with a molten core and I'm gonna venture based on our current discovery of alien races most of them don't have sapient races.  Does that mean they specifically go after other races just to be dicks?  Makes no sense.\n\nBeyond that, I just have no words for the entire end and the queen fight.  Just what the fuck.

        "content": "I enjoy Liam Neeson action movies because he doesn't just phone it in like other older action stars making action movies. They have a decent plot, well shot, and his acting is always good. The action is mostly well done, but some have a lot of cuts and bad editing. I will rate them in order of: 1: Action. 2: Story. 3: Everything else.\n\nI'm only ranking pure action movies, and he has to be the **main protagonist**.\n\n\n\n1. **Taken** - The one that started it all and still the best one. Great story and action.\n\n2. **Run All Night** - One of his best when it comes to pure action, and the plot is interesting with some twists.\n\n3. **Non-Stop** - Pure adrenaline, set on an Airplane, intriguing plot and twists.\n\n4. **Unknown** - Another one with great plot and twists. Action movie with mystery.\n\n5. **Darkman** - This is an underrated movie, it's a comic book adaptation, but I'll count it as an action movie.\n\n6.  **A Walk Among the Tombstones** - Detective movie with action and good story.\n\n7. **The Commuter** - Similar to Non-Stop but set on a train and just a fun movie.\n\n8. **Honest Thief** - Liam Neeson doing what he does best. Not bad.\n\n9. **Cold Pursuit** - Different from his other action movies, but a funny action movie with dark humor. \n\n10. **The Marksman** - Liam Neeson against the cartel, say no more.\n\n11. **Memory** - Generic action movie, not much to say.\n\n12. **Taken 2** - Disappointing sequel compared to original.\n\n13. **The Ice Road** - Not a bad movie, but it's more of a disaster movie with some action.\n\n14. **Retribution** - Below average. The whole movie takes place in a car, with some twists, and can be boring.\n\n15. **Absolution** - Yea this is one of his worst action movie, bad plot, bad acting, only little action scenes.\n\n16. **Blacklight** - Literally unwatchable trash with boring plot, avoid it. How did this cost 40m??\n\n17. **Taken 3** - Just for the fence scene, this deserves last place.",

It also won an Oscar btw. \n\n[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-wilderness-lemming-suicide/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-wilderness-lemming-suicide/)\n\nClip: [https://youtu.be/YNZ\\_K14iT-Q](https://youtu.be/YNZ_K14iT-Q)\n\n  \nFrom recent history the one that instantly comes to mind is Netflix' \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive\" (a documentary series I guess). It has had quite a lot of criticism from the drivers and fans for deceptive editing, exaggerated rivalries (like portraying drivers who are in reality friends as enemies), and in general misrepresenting the actual sitution.\n\nThe makers justify this by saying..\n\n&gt;A spokesperson for the producers of\u00a0*Drive to Survive*\u00a0said: \u201cThe stories we tell across a series of\u00a0*Drive to Survive*\u00a0are not fabricated, the narratives clearly follow real events. In order to help make Formula One appeal to a wider audience, we tell these stories in an entertaining and compelling way.\n\nBut I'm sure there's way worse examples?",

        "content": "As the question asks, I wanted to know if anyone else has a story like mine. For me, the choice was a toss-up between Daredevil starring Ben Affleck and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. After thinking it over, I have to give it to Atlantis. I loved that film for everything it was and what it represented to me.\n\nI saw it in theaters with someone very important to me, someone who has since passed away. To this day, I can't watch it without tearing up a little. I remember that person, of course, but I also find myself marveling at how much I still love the characters, the world, and the experience. I often wonder when the last time was that I felt so deeply immersed in a Disney animated film.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but that theater experience was unforgettable. As a kid, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around how they pulled off the animation, the angles, the sense of movement, the way it felt like we were surfacing through water. It was stunning.\n\nAnd to add another layer, the person I saw it with was a big fan of Jim Varney, who voiced a character in the film. Atlantis was his final role, which made it all the more meaningful.\n\nSo, what about you? What film holds a special place in your heart, and why? I\u2019d love to hear your stories. Hopefully, this discussion helps us all reconnect with the love of film and those unusual gems that manage to capture our hearts.",

        "content": "Gotta say, when I first saw Groundhog Day, I thought it was just this dumb, funny movie. Bill Murray stuck in some miserable town, surrounded by annoying people and his coworkers like Chris Elliott and random locals who just wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. I mean, even I was annoyed by Stephen Tobolowsky. But that was the joke, right? You watched it for Bill's facial expressions as he gets tortured by the same day over and over again. That was the whole appeal, it was funny.\n\nBut then you get older, and suddenly you're like, Whoa. That\u2019s life, man. Yeah it's funny but it's also absurd and kind of sad.\n\nThe movie\u2019s actually...kind of deep when you watch it when you're older. Cause you realize real life is surprisingly repetitive. There are days you wake up and feel exactly like Bill Murray\u2014trapped in the same job, having the same small talk with the same people you secretly can\u2019t stand. And you just want out. Suddenly, those suicide scenes? Not so funny anymore.\n\nBill isn\u2019t just this smug, narcissistic jerk getting what he deserves. Well... he kind of is. But then you start to realize so are you. You think you're better than everyone around you. That you're destined for more. That this isn't the life you were meant to live.\n\nOkay, maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nMaybe you guys all got your lives together and you\u2019re mature and selfless. Not me though and honestly, I kind of hate how relatable the movie has become.\n\nHave you ever had that experience with a movie?\n\nNot just discovering it\u2019s deeper than you remembered, but realizing it hits totally differently now? LIke you finally caught all the dirty jokes you missed as a kid. Or you rewatched something you loved and thought, Wow, this is way weirder than I remember. Or like a friend of mine once said that a movie her cherished and thought was profound turns out it was really dumb.\n\nWhatever the case, any movie that felt totally different when you watched it after a long time, feel free to share. Wonder if I should go back and watch some old movies I like btw, after a long time has passed now. Who know how it'll hit me now....",

Those rules can be for movies or tv. And can you also tell what role they turned down and why they turned it down?\n\nThank you",

        "content": "Just watched Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and loved it. I saw a lot of polarizing reviews of it on Reddit but honestly I really vibed with it. It's a revenge drama that goes out of its way to make the act of getting vengeance completely emotionally draining and traumatizing. Weaved into the narrative is a fair bit of important social commentary on rape culture and sexual assault.\n\nCarey Mulligan gives an absolutely fantastic performance, simultaneously funny, charming, badass, broken, traumatized and vulnerable. The casting in general is on-point, especially the movie's conscious decision to\u00a0use well-known \"good guys\" to play rapists and rape enablers.\u00a0\n\nThe climax of the movie is an absolute gut-punch and I can see why so many people hated it.\u00a0It takes some major balls to kill off your righteous, justice-seeking protagonist in such a brutal, agonizing manner, by the de-facto villain of the story of all people.\u00a0But it makes sense with the thematic intent of the movie, which is the old adage of digging 2 graves when seeking revenge. The actual ending of the movie does somewhat lessen the blow a little bit but it feels very much like a pyrrhic victory.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a well-made dark psychological drama.",

Real freaky stuff, makes you question our understanding of our universe, and whether something supernatural is at work or not.",
