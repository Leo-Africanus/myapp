        "title": "'The Electric State' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_electric_state): 21% (from 19 reviews) with 3.10 average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-electric-state/): 30/100 (9 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take full ownership of their boys-with-toys mojo in this slick but dismally soulless odyssey across the American Southwest in a retro-futuristic alternate version of the 1990s. Following Cherry and The Gray Man, the brothers continue their post-Avengers streak of grinding out content for streaming platforms, amassing big budgets and marquee-name stars for quick-consumption movies destined to leave zero cultural footprint.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-russo-brothers-netflix-1236157136/)\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is emotionally incoherent because the moral of its story is contradicted by the emphasis of its telling. It\u2019s no wonder the filmmakers appear to side with their villain. As Skate puts it: \u201cOur world is a tire fire floating in an ocean of piss.\u201d Despite all of the clout and capital at their disposal, the Russo brothers can think of nothing better to do than stick our faces in it.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-electric-state-netflix-movie-review-1235101527/): D\u2013\n\n&gt; There\u2019s no rule that says book-based films shouldn\u2019t diverge from what\u2019s on the page. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d and Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cStarship Troopers\u201d certainly did, and those stories found their audiences in both mediums. In this case, however, the filmmakers have diluted the source material, showing a clear lack of interest in making their creation just as haunting, searing and satisfying as the original product.\n\n-[Courtney Howard, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-electric-state-review-1236330760/)\n\n&gt; I\u2019m not surprised that Netflix and the Russos want to tell a story about how humans and machines can live together in peace, but I struggled to find much humanity in a picture so gleefully soulless.\n\n-[Matt Goldberg, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/)\n\n&gt; There is a gallery of wacky individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing some undemanding work for voice-artists including Brian Cox, Woody Harrelson, Alan Tudyk and Colman Domingo. But there\u2019s no soul, no originality, just a great big multicolour wedge of digital content.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-simon-stalenhag): 2/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State is somehow both punishingly obvious and completely incoherent. Ultimately, however, the only real point is that pop culture should be revered as humanity\u2019s prime sustenance. Cosmo is based on a children\u2019s cartoon that\u2019s presented as the only real emotional bond between Michelle and her brother; the surrounding landscape is nothing but malls and fairgrounds, temples to consumerism where characters practically salivate while listing off menus items from Panda Express; and there\u2019s a searingly earnest piano cover of \u201cWonderwall\u201d at the end. The Electric State isn\u2019t about dystopia. It\u2019s the dystopia itself.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-electric-state-review-netflix-b2710157.html): 1/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State loses some of the quiet profundity of the original text, but as a breezily watchable retrofuturistic jolly, it has just enough juice.\n\n-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-electric-state/): 3/5\n\n&gt; Throughout, the film essentially functions as a plea to its viewers to put technology aside and embrace the power of human connection. It's a noble message \u2013 and one which most audiences members will surely be able to emphasise with \u2013 but in truth it feels hollow coming from a work that seems so clearly to have been made with the Netflix algorithm firmly in mind.\n\n-[Patrick Cremona, Radio Times](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/scifi/the-electric-state-review/): 2/5\n\n&gt; Should we expect more from a Netflix movie by now? Probably. But The Electric State is indicative of too many blockbuster offerings from the streaming service that do just enough to get you to watch, but are rarely good enough to be memorable.\n\n-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a64069135/the-electric-state-review-netflix/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nIn a retro-futuristic past, orphaned teenager Michelle traverses the American West with an eccentric drifter and a sweet but mysterious robot in search of her younger brother.\n\n**DIRECTORS** \n\nAnthony &amp; Joe Russo\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nChristopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely (based on the novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nStephen F.

        "content": "I\u2019m trying to find a horror movie, probably from the late 90s or early 2000s, possibly American. There\u2019s a specific scene I remember:\n\nTwo kids on bikes find a hole with a skull inside. One of them goes down to investigate and touches the skull. As soon as he does, he freezes in place and suddenly black leeches, slugs, or larvae start coming out of his eyes and body, devouring him alive. Later in the movie, a worker investigating the hole suffers the same fate.\n\nI watched it as a kid and maybe some details are different :(\n\nDoes anyone know what movie this is? Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "I don't know how the hell I never heard of this movie before. DeNiro and a young DiCaprio on the same film antagonizing each other in phenomenal performances in a incredible story. \n\nThe movie is the real story of writer Tobias Wolff during his teenage years when his mother was married to his abusive stepfather. Based on the synopsis I thought that would be a great moment of revelation when we find Dwight (played by DeNiro) is abusive but it starts simple, we see a positive side of the character consistently while we still realize how awful he is. It's also the most realistic portrayal I've seem of bullying from an authority figure. When I finished the movie, I knew there would still be some people who think Dwight was a good guy who was just parenting simply because the movie doesn't exaggerate his abuse.\n\nI'm amazed by the fact I never heard of this film considering the big names attached to it.",

        "content": "Chocolat is about an outsider who arrives at a village with her daughter. She opens a small chocolaterie, a place for anyone wishing to taste the chocolate delights she has at her place. Unfortunately, some of the Townspeople, led by Alfred Molina's mayor, see her as a unwanted presence and wish for her to be gone. \n\nIs it sappy and schmaltzy? Probably, yet it's also engaging and offers viewers a warm and cozy watch and Juliette Binoche is always a welcoming and appealing leading lady. The film was a change from the dramas she often did and showed she could lead more mainstream, light-hearted offerings. \n\nI also enjoyed seeing the star of Ponette, Victoire Thivisol, as the daughter. Alfred Molina starts out as unlikable as the repressive mayor yet he isn't entirely a caricature and Judi Dench is moving as the elderly woman who was rejected by her daughter for being improper. \n\nI do wish we could have been spared Johnny Depp's pointless cameo as a handsome gypsy who shows up, merely so Binoche's Vianne could have a romantic interest (or, more like, a quick fling). I didn't like how contrived it was.",
