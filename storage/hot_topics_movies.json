It is just mind-boggling for me how she switches so effortlessly between roles in thoughtful \"arthous-y\" films on the one end (stuff like Notes on a Scandal, Babel, I'm Not There, Blue Jasmine, Carol and T\u00e1r), and Blockbusters and genre films on the other end (Lord of the Rings &amp; Hobbit, Indiana Jones 4, Robin Hood, Cinderella, Thor: Ragnarok, Ocean's 8, Borderlands). She also did many films that I would put in between these two categories (Elizabeth films, The Aviator, Nightmare Alley, Don't Look Up etc.).\n\nIt just seems to me like she isn't snobby at all and very open to try very different types of roles, as long as it is either interesting or fun.\n\nWho are other actors that you think have a similar career?",

There's a lot of actual reviews that are weirdly negative (including a lovely quote of \"If you love Jesus and His story of redemption, do NOT watch this\") so I don't know if it's an attempt to balance them or just a campaign to try to boost it's rating. Has anyone noticed this on other films?",

For 2 hours i was hyperfocused its like a nootropic effect. After a long time i felt i watched a perfect movie.\n\nIt\u2019s a masterpiece from Denis, he knew how to lock us into his world.\n\nThe only thing i love about the Sicario 2  is the last scene, nothing else.\n\nI hope 3 will be as thrilling as one.",
