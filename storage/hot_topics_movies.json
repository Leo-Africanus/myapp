The conflict has spilled onto Earth, and humanity is caught in the crossfire. The Autobots have forged a fragile alliance with the military, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, are more determined than ever to enslave mankind for their own power.\n\nMeanwhile, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew\u2014Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and others\u2014are laying low after their last mission, trying to live a normal life. But their peace is shattered when a mysterious ally, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), seeks them out for help. Optimus needs their skills in navigating dangerous streets and using vehicles to battle the Decepticons, who are now trying to take control of critical transportation routes to fuel their war effort.\n\nDom, reluctant at first, is convinced when he learns the Decepticons are targeting his family\u2014his crew, and even his daughter, Brian (Paul Walker's character\u2019s son, introduced with technology to honor his legacy).

        "content": "I once saw a clip of a Hollywood film in which a wife catches her husband in their bedroom in bed with another woman. The other woman quickly rushes out but the husband performs the mother of all gaslighting by calmly getting out of bed, gets dressed, sits in a chair and starts reading the paper all while denying the wife\u2019s continued protestations. \u201cWhat woman?\u201d \u201cWhat bed?\u201d\n\nI think the actor was Bill Macy and the film likely made in the 60s or 70s. Can anyone help me identify the film?\n\n",

It started as your typical cheesy 90s action movie but by the third act the movie decided to lose its mind and it is glorious. From JCVD punching out a snake to him taking out a helicopter with a shotgun, to Wilford Brimley blowing up his house with a bow and arrow while riding away on horseback is equal parts awesome and wtf. And the final act was nothing but kicks, bullets and things blowing up every 5 seconds. Did it make sense no but was it awesome yes, yes it was!\n\n# \n\n# ",

        "title": "[Movie Review] Companion (2025) is a really fun black comedy about sci-fi relationships",
        "content": "COMPANION (2025) was a film I was back and forth reviewing due to being a science fiction black comedy. If I had to define its genre, I'd say it's cyberpunk lite. A story that could basically be summarized as \"What if Blade Runner starred the machines and had really stupid people after them?\" Despite the comedic elements or perhaps because of them, the film deals with a lot of incredibly dark subject matter and touches on numerous themes of both technology as well as socialization. \n\nIt's sort of an interesting comparison to EX MACHINA, which had the idea of our machines as wholly inhuman but mankind confusing them for people. This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit). There's a strong feminist theme to the movie that underscores the comedy and slasher movie vibe as our heroine struggles to understand what her \"boyfriend\" now wants to murder her.\n\nThe marketing spoiled a lot of this movie in a manner like CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD as one of the biggest twists comes around the fifteen minute mark but is spoiled by the poster. Indeed, I wasn't even aware it was meant to be a surprise until I watched this movie with my nieces. They had no familiarity with the movie and thus were completely taken off guard when it happened. If you can watch the movie unspoiled or with people who don't know anything other than the title, then I recommend it. Otherwise, note, that the rest of the review will treat this initial reveal as a given.\n\nThe premise for Companion is that Irish (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) are a sickeningly happy couple that are visiting their Russian friend's house for the weekend. It is an incredibly luxurious house in the middle of nowhere and they'll be joined by several friends. It is in the near future with self-driving cars and a variety of other luxury items that seem to be available only to the super rich, though Jack isn\u2019t one of them. One of the guests, Kat (Megan Suri), is initially very hostile to Iris and she doesn't know why. Sergey (Rupert Friend) gets aggressive with Iris and events spiral out of control when he's killed.\n\nWhich turns out to have been the plan all along as Iris discovers that's what she was programmed to do all along. Iris, much to her shock and horror, is a companion robot for Josh. A sort of sexy Tamagotchi that was given a set of fake memories and a willingness to please that overrides all other considerations. Rather than the superhumans of Blade Runner, companions are deliberately made to be no smarter or stronger than \"regular\" humans with the ability of their owners to make them even dumber or weaker. Josh is fond of his companion robot but no more so than a pet and arguably even less than that as he's willing to sacrifice her as part of his plan to murder Sergey then rob him. Unfortunately, he's careless with his master control and he's turned up Iris' survival instincts.\n\nMuch of the movie is, essentially, not so veiled commentary on \"nice guy\" misogyny. Josh is good looking and willing to put on a pleasant enough face around his girlfriend but only when she's subservient to him. Ultimately, she's a convenience and someone that he gets increasingly violent toward as he finds his plans thwarted. We also discover just how fragile Josh's self-esteem is. The fact Jack Quaid is the kind of actor that would be the dorky but handsome lead in a romantic comedy, makes his transformation even more shocking. Like a slowly boiling kettle, we also see how the escalation grows from dismissiveness to furious rage.\n\nThe movie's humor comes from the same source as the movie's terror. The murderers are not particularly competent at their crimes but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous. All of them, even the more sympathetic ones, think of Iris as an appliance that needs to be destroyed. The absolute lack of sympathy from everyone around here is surprisingly well realized. Sophie Thatcher beautifully embodies both the idealized retro-girlfriend with her 1950s-esque inspired look as well as the increasingly capable Iris as she realizes her only way out may be blocked by what she was made to be. I had a lot of fun with this movie.",
