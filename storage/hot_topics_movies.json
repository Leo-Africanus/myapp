        "content": "in my opinion, the scariest movie ending is the ending of the original the fly. although i prefer the cronenberg remake, the original film is a solid movie and the ending is more disturbing then anything that cronenberg could have cooked up. it's scary and disturbing on so many levels to the point that, no matter how many times i watch the movie, the ending still gives me chills.\n\nfor starters. this ending plays exploits so many phobias at once. arachnophobia is the obvious one but there's also vorarephobia, the fear of being eaten alive.\n\nand then, there's the fact that we finally get a good look at how the fly with andre's head and arm looks and it's...freaky. for some reason, the fly is bald and looks rather old. it looks rather creepy. and when the fly speaks, it doesn't really mouth words but just kinda opens and closes it's mouth in a rather unnatural way. \n\nand speaking of the fly, throughout the whole thing, the fly is begging and pleading for it's life. you'd think that the high pitched vocals would make the scene less scary but i would actually argue that it makes it MORE scary. fun fact, while filming the scene, vincent price and herbert marshall had a hard time filming the scene without bursting out laughing upon hearing the high pitched voice. how much are you willing to bet that they weren't laughing when they saw the finished product? \n\nand then, there is the spider itself. this scene gets us up close and personal with the spider and it looks terrifying. \n\nthere's also the question of whether the fly has andre's brain or if this is a fly trapped in a man's body. the film seems to lean more towards the ladder but that makes things even worse. andre with the fly's head is becoming more and more fly like over the course of the film. as such, it stands to reason that the fly was becoming more human like. for god's sake, the fly learned to speak.\n\nand of course, this already unsettling scene becomes even more so if you know what spiders actually do to their prey. \n\nall these things combined result in one of the scariest endings of any movie ever.",

Really looking for movies that look and feel made for the theater. Some movies I think might be good are Blade Runner, just about any Christopher Nolan movie, Alien, just movies where being in a theater really changes the viewing experience.",

Plus all the celebrity appearance make it a very fun and easy to watch movie. ",

(Even though he is not really as perfect as he thinks) \n\nAs the title implies, I\u2019m looking for suggestions for movies similar to this. They don\u2019t all have to be Hitman movies. Any movie that has the same type of feel, with super perfectionist detail orientated characters. ",

        "title": "Tombstone",
        "content": "Good afternoon everyone. I'm 23, born in Mississippi, now living on the east coast. Due to how hard life has always been for me as a kid, teenager and even now as an adult: movies have always been a shelter for which I could always seek refuge without refusal. I've seen probably a little over 200 films. Many known, many unknown. Of various qualities. Today, I watched and finished the 1993 action western known as Tombstone. \n\nThe movie starrs Sam Elliot, Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton, and is based on true events that unfolded in the turbulent, rusty wild west. Gun slinging, poetic cursing, exquisite fashion and the grimey streets of the dusty time of cowboys, outlaws and lawmen. Out of all the movies I've ever seen in my life, very few are held in regards by me to the likes of James Cameron's Avatar (first film), Dead Poets Spciety and Lord of the Rings. Tombstone is now held to that standard and I can not praise this film enough. \n\nI've cried many a tears in my life but the tears I shed for Tombstone were ones of gold like the Norse Goddess Sif in her stories. A small family of out of towns folk, arrive in the well established Town of Tombstone. But shortly they wise up to the extortion and terrorism of the cowboys. A gang of pillagers, brutes, drunkards and killers who the townsfolk are more than fed up with. But after certain events unfold, it is up to Wyatt, a former Marshal, to bring law and order to this town that defines the frontier in some ways. \n\nIf you want romance, action, realistic depictions of the old west, a beautiful score, delightfully mad dialogue and great cinematography.. I can't recommend Tombstone enough. I give this masterpiece a 100/10.\n\n\"Why Johnny Ringo... you look like someone just walked over your grave\"\n\"We started a game we never got to finish..\"\n\"I was just foolin about..\" \n\"....I wasn't\" ",

Marcus Aurelius choses him as the next caesar instead of his own son.\n\nHe's also a loving father and husband. He wants to kill Commodus but when he sees Lucius he stops, because he could hurt him. So his father instinct wins over vengeance and hatred. \n\nAnd what are your examples of positive masculinity? \n",
