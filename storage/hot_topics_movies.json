        "content": "Years ago when Imagine Dragons was at its peak of their popularity, everybody was using their songs in commercials and trailers (e.g. Friction for Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Warriors for Wonder Woman). But for some reason, someone thought that using Believer in the trailer Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was a good idea for a period piece mystery film, set in the 1930s.\n\nAnd that song did not work in the trailer at all. It was way too modern for a film set in the '30s and it was a weird song choice as well too for that trailer. That was definitely a weird moment during that period, before we even had slowed down songs in movie trailers.\n\nI give a special shout-out to Suicide Squad (2016) using Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody too and that was because the trailer was such a huge hit, WB hired the company that edited the trailer, to re-edit the movie as well. And it certainly didn't help the movie's quality at all lol.",

By the end, Cooper and company have crafted a winning dramedy that has elements of what makes any good rom com work. Wrapping up NYFF on a pleasant if unspectacular note, it\u2019s destined to be a very easy watch for folks, once it comes out later on this year.\n\n[Vulture - Alisson Wilmore](https://www.vulture.com/article/is-this-thing-on-review-bradley-cooper-made-a-crowd-pleaser.html)\n\n&gt;We\u2019ve seen Arnett play variations on his character before, sardonic and self-deprecating.

I think will always maintain its cult status and be remembered as an example of what science fiction films looked like in the 1970s before Star Wars altered the genre forever (but Alien was close behind\u2026 things were changing fast).",
