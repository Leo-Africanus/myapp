That\u2019s a dereliction of duty, but it\u2019s one I didn\u2019t commit on purpose. I simply hadn\u2019t bothered to think about it.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):\n\n&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope\n\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):\n\n&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don\u2019t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d might be very, very bad (and by \u201cmight be\u201d I mean \u201calmost objectively is\u201d), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today\u2019s audiences might consider as \u201cgood.\n\n[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):\n\n&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which \"Kraven the Hunter\" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows \"Kraven\" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Crowe\u2019s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there\u2019s not much to like elsewhere\n\n[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):\n\n&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it\u2019s best that this misbegotten series quits while it\u2019s just-barely ahead.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):\n\n&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):\n\n&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.\n\nDirected by J.C. Chandor:\n\n&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.\n\nRelease Date: December 13\n\nCast:\n\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven:\n* Ariana DeBose as Calypso Ezili\n* Fred Hechinger as Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon\n* Alessandro Nivola as Aleksei Sytsevich / Rhino\n* Christopher Abbott as the Foreigner\n* Russell Crowe as Nikolai Kravinoff",

I recently watched Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, and while not particularly a movie I enjoyed, he didn't fall short of a great performance. Particularly the scene talking to his brother at the bar. I was on a binge last year of his filmography, and I was blown away by I Love Liza as id never seen it before. Such a raw story, raw emotion, he portrayed something perfectly, albeit something I haven't been through and would never want to (as someone who suffers severe depression and is a lover I think losing a lover to suicide would be the hardest thing I could ever imagine). Although I've only watched it maybe twice total now I would consider it a comfort film for me now (is that fucked up?). The sniffing gasoline is both sad and hilarious at the same time, which I think it's intended to be and very well done. I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.. but when he grabs that pillow I have never felt a gut punch in a movie as hard as that. He was such a talent, and I am truly sad we will not see him in any new roles. A love letter to Philip: Thank you for sharing your talents, we will never stop watching. ",

        "content": "Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. \n\n  \nI figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. \n\n  \nSo, for example....\n\n  \nBack To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. \n\n  \nTop Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks \"80s\"\n\n  \nBut Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there. \n\n  \nCan anyone beat Rocky 4 for \"Most 80's 80's Movie?\"",

        "content": "I was in High School when John Q. came out and it really was the first movie to expose me to the US healthcare system.  As a healthy teenager with an upper middle class upbringing, my only first hand knowledge of health care system was getting shots, physicals, etc.  Nothing major.\n\nWatching this movie opened my eyes to the horrors of our health care system and has stayed with me all these years.  I know it isn't a great movie by any means but it made an impression on me of a man who would do anything for his child in a system you expect to help him.  Instead you learn how bad the system is and what is forces a man of conviction to do.\n\nAs with the news, I flashed back to this moving thinking of what drives a man to violence when he is trampled by the system.  How doing something crazy is sometimes the sanest option you have left.",

Good pre-Christmas watch.   \n  \nHowever, I was surprised that I didn't know either lead actor, so towards the end I searched the cast, and it turns out the main actress is Lindsay fucking Lohan. I honestly didn't recognize her \ud83d\udc80 \n\nShe's beautiful but it's fun to suddenly see her at 38. The last I knew of her was her troubles in her early 20s. A friend pointed out to me that she's been on Netflix for years now doing cheesy shit like this",
