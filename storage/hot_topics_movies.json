        "title": "The Gamble New Line Cinema made making the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy was INSANE",
        "content": "Imagine being New Line founder &amp; head honcho Bob Shaye. It\u2019s circa 1998 &amp; you\u2019ve just been shown a presentation by a kiwi filmmaker most people have never heard of it. You\u2019re shown costumes, weapons, cgi tests, miniatures, all funded by a rival studio that decided it can\u2019t make this project because it\u2019s just too expensive. So said Rival studio boss has given kiwi filmmaker a chance to pitch the project elsewhere. Every studio in town has turned the pitch down since there are some very large strings attached. Rival studio boss must be reimbursed for the millions in spent development costs, he must be given a % of the box office and you only have a 24 hours to decide. You were kiwi film makers last stop before heading back to New Zealand in defeat.\n\nThe kiwi filmmaker is pitching you a two film adaptation of perhaps the most well known book trilogies in existence. Your film company needs a hit, badly. After the presentation everyone looks to you for a reaction. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d you say. You see the faces of kiwi filmmaker and his team go white with dread before adding \u201cit\u2019s 3 books? It should be 3 movies\u201d. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the start of one or the biggest most insane gambles in Hollywood history. The price tag? 270 million. That number will go up before all is said and done. \n\n\nJust think about it for a minute. New Line funded the production of 3 films shot back to back in a tiny country halfway around the world, by a director whose never had a hit movie, using unproven technology, with no A List star and if none of it works, the movie doesn\u2019t succeed? You might lose your company. \n\nThe production goes way over budget, loses a main actor after a few days of filming, New Line is constantly trying to mitigate its risk by cutting the runtime down, selling foreign distribution rights(boy will they come to regret that) \n\nThe press is all over New Line. \u201cThis is insane\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fail\u201d. \u201cWhat are they going to do when it does fail\u201d etc. But then\u2026\n\n\n\nMay 2001 hits. Newline decides to preview 20 minutes of the first movie at the Cannes film festival. This is where everything changed. The public and press got its first real look at the film and the response is better than anyone could hope. New Line loosens up. Gives more money to finish the movie. There some actual buzz &amp; hype now. \n\nBut then 2 things happen. \n\n\nOne is another highly anticipated book adaptation is coming out a month prior. Basically the hottest property on the planet not named Star Wars or Pokemon. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d. And when it does come out? It has the biggest opening weekend of all time. \n\nThe other thing? Tragedy. 9/11. Do audiences even want to see a movie about wars and elves and hobbits? Will anyone care? \n\nBoy did they ever. December 2001 the gamble pays off. Whats more? They get 13! Academy Award nominations. It\u2019s now officially a phenomenon.\n \nAnd you\u2019ve got 2 more movies to release. Each more successful than the last, an unheard or rarity for sequels of that era.",

        "content": "I've been going through childhood movies (posted last time about Kung Pow) and trying to view them through the lense of an adult. Watched George of the Jungle today which was one I loved as a kid. The movie is underappreciated and underrated. Yes, it's insanely stupid. Yes, it has a lot of low hanging fruit humor. Yes it's a lot of physical gags. But... It's executed so well. I don't know how any of the actors filmed that movie with a straight face especially with any scene involving Brendan Frasier because he's so over the top. The humor as an adult is great because so much shit flew over my head as a kid. The 4th wall breaking is also great. I also didn't realize this was a Disney film and I can't believe they greenlit something that not only lampoons their own IP, but also has so many gags that would be normal in something like Scary Movie.\n\nAll in all, if you're a mid 30s millennial like me you should watch it again. I think you'll appreciate it even more as an adult and I plan to show my kid the movie soon.",

I did watch the trailer afterwards because I was curious how much it gave away.  Truly a shame what marketing does to a good film.  When I hear people claim a film is predictable, I wonder how many watched the trailer beforehand.",

I have been thinking about it recently, and have been wanting to rewatch it. Things i remember about it:\n\n\\- This was on the TV like 7 or 6 years ago.\n\n\\- Think Toy Story but live action (with actors on set yk) and the bad toys were real bad and had a grudge against the main character.\n\n\\- There was an army of toys marching up a river bank.\n\n\\- They had killed someone....? I think fire was involved (im not 100% sure tho)\n\n\\- The toys were going to atack the main characters.\n\n\\- It was either an action, or a horror.\n\n\\- May have been a series as it may have ended on a cliff-hanger (for the next episode) or there was an ad break idk.\n\n  \nI would really want to rewatch this.\n\n",

        "content": "Sometimes we like movies... at first. Then something happens and it completely changes the narrative of the film. It's kind of like how Rambo I went from psychological action drama to over-the-top adventure action. Which films have you seen that you were fine with at first, but displeased in the end result?  \nDon't have any single movie examples, but I know a lot of people feel this way about the Saw franchise going into a different and more convoluted direction after the third film due to the new writes. It was certainly kind of weird to add a lot of new stuff to an already complex storyline.",

And I don\u2019t care about accuracy, it\u2019s fine that Spielberg made the dinosaurs brown with no feathers - who cares? But the film overall movie experience holy shit it shows how far we\u2019ve fallen (recent Indy movies, latest Hobbit movies.. if you like them I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t just wow, serious drop in quality despite spending a shit ton more). \n\nTLDR: why do you think modern movies that pander off existing IP can\u2019t just \u2026 cast better? Better costumes? Doesn\u2019t have to be ground breaking new stuff but is it just laziness? Or a lack of an artistic eye?",
