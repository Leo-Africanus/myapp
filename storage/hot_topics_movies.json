Including a few not on the list. Very much appreciated. I'm going to watch Irreversible tonight and I have a few others ready to watch. I won't be watching A Serbian Film because it sounds like I don't need that in my life haha. Thanks all.\n\nand apologies to those I've exposed to movie related trauma\n\nEdit 2: I just watched Irreversible (Spoilers ahead naturally). Honestly I thought that it was a very good film which is possibly cheapened(?) by it's reputation as a 'controversial' or 'shock' film. I actually had heard of it before in the context of a film that was designed to make you sick and the horror of the rape scene.\n\nYes the rape scene is ROUGH. I left out a long deep sigh after to release the tension and man is it painfully long... but in my opinion it is entirely integral to the point of the film. I felt that showing the film in reverse order was ingenious in that it shows us that the victim is nothing that the rapist attributes to her in his rage, which (in his mind) justifies his violence. It provides the context of this persons life before this horrific act and humanises her, after the fact which I felt was actually far more poignant.\n\nIf we had seen the film in the chronological order we would have been left feeling the anger and satisfaction of revenge and would have forgotten about the women and what she has lost. In my opinion this is the main message of the story.\n\nFinally there was an interesting dynamic between three types of men we get introduced to in the film. One, her ex boyfriend is loving but too \"cerebral\" to quote the main character. The rapist which is full of rage and self pleasure and her boyfriend which is a balance between the two. I haven't taken the time to think about the significance of this yet but I feel it's also an important part of the film.\n\nIf I had one problem with the backwards order of the film it's that I would have taken extreme pleasure in seeing that fucker get his head smashed in if I had had the context at the time (Which I just realised is the wrong fucking fella... God damn there is no justice in this movie). Maybe that was part of the point too...\n\nAnyway thanks a lot! I feel I probably watched the best one first lol. Any more suggestions of a similar quality of narrative please comment and let me know!\n\nAlso the shakey camera does calm down after a while thank fuck",

        "content": "Julie Andrews didn't get to play Eliza Doolittle because she wasn't famous enough. The studio wanted a name and Audrey Hepburn only said yes because she was told if she said no, the next person they'd be asking would have been Elizabeth Taylor. Julie Andrews wasn't going to play Eliza if Audrey had rejected the part. \n\nThrough the years, Audrey Hepburn got a lot of scrutiny. Her not getting nominated while Julie Andrews ended up winning the Oscar for \"Mary Poppins\", the dubbed singing by Marni Nixon (let's just pretend previous leading stars didn't get dubbed whenever they sang in movie musicals). \n\nBut watching My Fair Lady, I thought Hepburn was fantastic in it. Her Cockney accent, played by a Belgian actress, was pretty impressive and what struck me the most was how funny she was in the film's second half. Her starting out as a clumsy flower girl and then gradually changing her demeanor, showing vulnerability as she struggles to \"change\" and when she finally becomes a \"lady\", she starts to create her own identity and is faced with the tragedy of losing it all and going back to what she used to be. \n\nI thought Hepburn truly nailed these sentiments within Eliza. So much of the praise was directed at Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins that people forget how genuinely good Hepburn is in the movie.",

        "title": "One thing I miss from older movies- the slower pacing of scenes!",
        "content": "I was watching some older movies such as Close Encounters, Star wars, and Alien and realized something was different. Something which I don't think many modern audiences would like, but I liked it so to speak. I just couldn't figure out what it was.\n\nI then watched half of an awful Antman multiverse Marvel movie before giving up and realized what it was. It wasn't the lack of CGI, actors actually being big names, or stunts being real back then. It was the slower pacing of scenes!\n\nFor example, I think in 2001 SO there was like a 10 minute scene of a ship docking. I actually got bored of that as a kid and fast forward if my dad wasn't looking lol. In Alien they spent like 5 minutes looking for a cat and then later she spent what felt like 10 minutes looking for the cat again. And they made it work too as they made it interesting. I can see how modern audiences might not like that but to me that is so much better than what they do to pad out movies in the modern area, which is usually lots of table talk-and I'd say there is actually more talking than what they did in the older movies too.\n\nIt might bad take. I just do miss movies that might stick to the plot being one night to a week over it being like the telling of the whole war. Then again you do have to be careful with what you ask for because the Modern Starwars movies have drawn out scenes like the Casino Planet. IDk then again I probably would take the Casino Planet jobber sidequest over adding more table talk in",

        "content": "Adam Curtis\u2019s 2016 film starts with an overview of the takeover of NYC in 1975 by an unelected panel of bankers who cut workers and impose austerity on the city. The character of Donald Trump comes in to save the day by rebuilding the city. This film has many echoes and characters from our present era, only 9 years later, including Putin, and Assad. The feeling of confusion and hopelessness fostered by the film continue through to today given the spate of headlines out of D.C. \n\nHighly recommended.\n\nFilm is available on BBC and a more full description here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation\n\nTrailer:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AUiqaFIONPQ?si=LopPa_NVQ7IRgeNN",

        "title": "Watched Tranformers One and as someone who loved Transformers since I was a child and have gotten progressively more and more disappointed in the franchise as I've grown older, I gotta say this movie was amazing",
        "content": "I'll try to keep at least the first section of the review spoiler free. I will give a little bit of background first.\n\nI was 11 years old when I watched Revenge of the Fallen with my friends. The explosions, the action, the music, the cars, THAT Megan Fox scene. I loved that movie and after it I became a big Transformers fan, watching whatever movies and clips I could find online at that age. It even spilled into my other hobbies like gaming and music; I started listening to Linkin Park (still do) and played whatever games had transformers in them. I remember playing Fall of Cybertron a lot on my Xbox 360. Got as many Transformer toys and figures I could get. Just saying I was a fan would be an understatement.\n\nAs I got a couple of years older I started watching the other movies as they released. Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction, The Last Knight, Bumblebee, Rise of the Beasts and none of them after DotM just..... clicked. I blamed it on a couple of things, but mostly age. I thought I had just outgrown the Franchise, maybe a movie filled with explosions and guns and robots are just too childish.\n\nSo Transformers is a series I mostly look back to with happy thought. I still think about the old days where I was at my friends house being blown away by Revenge of the Fallen, I still think about all those hours I sat behind the screen playing Fall of Cybertron, I still listen to Linkin Park imagining Optimus Prime jsut got done giving a speech. But thats mostly in the past. Transformers is not what it used to be for me and I didn't think I would ever enjoy a new piece of Tranformers content ever again, and I still thought that when I ehard about the release of Tranformers One.\n\n''just another Transformers movie, it'll never live up to the old ones.'' That was literally my thought when I first found out about the movie by seeing a promotional poster in the cinemas I was at for another movie. I put off reading anything about it, I put off searching anything about it up. I just was not interested. Until, I saw a short clip of the movie when scrolling on TikTok. It was funny and I remember thinking ''oh so this Transformers One is THAT kind of movie, funny.''\n\nFastforward to today I was bored and I wanted to watch a movie when I suddenly remember that clip, that 10 second clip that entertained me so much and I thought why not. And boy do I have to say I LOVED this movie.\n\nThe plot is interesting enough to make you pay attention. You can guess which direction its going pretty easily but I didnt go in expecting much so I didnt mind. But everything else is truly amazing.\n\nThe characters, the jokes, the writing, the animation, I loved all of it. If you are looking for a movie that will just simply entertain you, without you even being a Transformers fan, give it a chance. If you will like it as much as even halve of the amount I love it, you will not regret it.\n\nSpoilers ahead as I get a bit more in depth of why I love this movie so much.\n\nGrowing up Ive always seen Optimus and Megatron fight and hate eachother, but seeing them 'young' as friends really intrigued me. It was something I have never thought of as possible or even imaginable but the writers pulled off this amazing friendship of soon to be enemies. On screen they share an amazing chemistry and display of friendship, and after every second of enjoyment of them I got this dread, this glooming sense of them one day becoming enemies. I knew we would find out how they would turn into enemies in this movie and I was NOT looking forward to seeing this beautiful friendship ruined, but I mean that in a good way. The introduction of Bumblebee was also amazing. He has always been this 'young wild and free' Autobot in the movies and in this one its no different. He stole every scene he was in and yet again in this movie, became my favourite transformer.\n\nI was just as excited to see Starscream on scene. I thought there were no surprises left and I practically jumped out of my couch when they mentioned his name. The writers keep delivering on these amazing moments that just satisfy you as a Transformers fan.\n\nTalking about delivering, there are AMAZING golden moments of hilariousness in this movie. I have laughed out loud multiple times and basically enjoyed this movie from start to finish.\n\nThis movie just gives you so many amazing moment. D16's (Megatron) descent into evil (I would even say rightfully so, after having seen this movie), Orion Pax becoming Optimus Prime, Bumblee being hilarious as ever, Optimus fighting in a 1v3, moments of friendship and betrayal; you cant help but feel sad for both Optimus Prime and Megatron. And ofcourse this legendary, incredibly nostalgic Optimus Prime monologue at the end. I swear I literally expected to hear a linkin park song when he was delivering it and I maybe would have bursted out into tears if I did.\n\nAs amazing as this all is, the most important thing for me is realizing, knowing that I am NOT too old to enjoy Transformers. I am 26 now and I just got done laughing, crying, watching a Transformers movie full of excitement, something I havent been able to do for almost 15 years.\n\nI am grateful for Transformers One for this reason alone. It has singehandedly changed my opinion on the Transformers franchise of the past 10 years. It may not be the best movie ever, but it has broken into my top list of movies I have ever watched for that reason alone. It has immediately made me love it and I will die holding on to this movie with my heart.\n\nPlease give it watch if you havent yet.",

        "content": "I'm looking for examples of film trailers that are particularly well put together (modern or not), whether from a narrative point of view or in terms of the use of music/sound effects: many of my friends think that trailers spoil films, and that too often we see too much of them, or even that they show the film's final plot twist.\n\nThere has indeed been a tendance for a certain genre of cinema to show the key plot points in the trailer. I remember the film \u201cThe Italian Job\u201d (2003) showed absolutely every element of the film, including the ending scene, in the trailer, which is a bit...surprising?\n\nAnyway, if you have any examples of good trailers (whether it's a big production or an independent film, whatever the language), I'd love to see them!\n\nEdit : Wow, a loot of awesome piece of history. Here are my favorites, which haven't been mentioned yet  \n\\- [Sin City](https://youtu.be/h2QJMfXJZaY?si=ofHXbwS325dpB6ae)\\- [The Green Knight](https://youtu.be/sS6ksY8xWCY?si=z2LgmnDWfvL5Mw6j)   \n\\- [Creed 2](https://youtu.be/u22BXhMu4tI?si=_cnUSW9WadIdHRjc)   \n\\- [Mandy](https://youtu.be/hRKVxT4-1wM?si=RnMOlew6eXnht_C8) ",
