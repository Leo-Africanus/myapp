Everyone is treating acting very serious in what is a wacky premise, don't get me started on the world building. It's just a shame that I never got to see a sequel and now with Bruce Willis' condition I don't think we will every see anything else related to this world again, which is kind of a shame.\n\nIf you were to ask me, the movie is 10/10 Super Green\n\nEDIT - I forgot to mention how great the **PRACTICAL** effect were in this movie. I do know they used a fair amount of CGI, but upon rewatch in 2026, this movies stands up to ANY sci-fi movie made today; and I think it will stand the test of time.

        "content": "I watched the movie last night and really loved it , it genuinely touched my heart, as someone who went through a lot of loneliness and bullying due to the fact that my family was always moving and even if i somehow did manage to make friends they'd just feel empty , I'd never feel any connection with then and after all that we'd just move and I'd have to do it all over again. \n\nBut i really don't understand the hatred for this movie for some reason a lot of the comments online about the movie just say stuff like \"boo hoo privileged white kids in a suburban neighborhood going through trauma is \"unrealistic\" and the characters are just straight up losers\" , i really don't understand this pov on the movie maybe it's mostly form the people who never suffered with anxiety and loneliness and just think that the movie is an exaggeration that appeals to the fantasies of the \"loser\" audience, I'd like to know more people's views on the movie.",

        "content": "33 years later, that performance still amazes me. I've tried to rationalize it over the years, thinking Kilmer's shutout from Oscar consideration must've been the result of some funky AMPAS politics, because it sure as hell wasn't due to a lack of artistry or execution on his part.\n\nSome will argue that the field of Best Supporting Actor nominees was exceptional that year (Tommy Lee Jones won for The Fugitive),but Val's \"Doc\" stood toe to toe with the best of them, and he was deprived of a nomination altogether.\n\nThere's something about how he delivered the quietly violent \"Doc\" persona with charm, humor, and swag. I guess sometimes a great performance doesn't need a statuette attached to it to stand the test of time. ",
