        "content": "On this day, June 11, 1982, one of the most beloved and magical films in cinematic history was released in U.S. theaters: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, directed by Steven Spielberg. Although its world premiere was at the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, it was on that June 11th that the world truly began to fall in love with the tiny alien with the bright eyes and giant heart. In the midst of the 1980s boom, E.T. landed just before the summer of blockbusters, at a time when audiences craved stories full of excitement, adventure, and soul. The film didn't just deliver: it broke records. In its first week, it grossed over $100 million and went on to gross nearly $800 million globally. It surpassed Star Wars as the highest-grossing film in history, holding that title for more than a decade, until another Spielberg film (Jurassic Park) dethroned it in 1993. But beyond the numbers, E.T. left an indelible mark on pop culture. Its influence was immediate: phrases like \"E.T., my house, telephone\" became part of popular language, and the iconic scene of the bicycle flying in front of the moon is one of cinema's most recognizable images. The film won four Oscars (including Best Original Score for John Williams) and was one of the first films deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress. The most impressive thing is how, 42 years later, it continues to touch the hearts of new generations. Parents who saw it as children now share it with their children. And why does it remain relevant? Because E.T. was made with sincerity. Filmed from a child's perspective, without cynicism or exaggeration, it addresses complex themes like loss, loneliness, and true friendship with a sensitivity few films have matched. In a world filled with CGI, remakes, and franchises, E.T. shines with its simplicity and genuine emotion. It doesn't need bombast to move. Sometimes, all it takes is a glowing finger, an unexpected friend\u2026 and a bicycle. So today, June 11th, let's celebrate not only the anniversary of its release, but everything E.T. represents: the magic of cinema when it's made with heart. When was the first time you saw E.T.? Does it still move you like it used to?",

It\u2019s not necessarily the worst I can think of but considering it doesn\u2019t have much more than what I mentioned, it would be an uncomfortable experience at the very least. \n\nWhat other movies would be your last choice to watch with family members present?

I mean, most of it took place in like 3 different settings.",

I also wish that Hollywood would have more Sci-fi movies that aren\u2019t just action hero movies in space. I loved it. What are some sci-fi recs for non action hero movies?",

        "content": "My top 3 would have to be... (In no particular order)\n\nIp Man (1) - when he fights the 10 Japanese fighters after his friend Liu is killed by Captain Sato and Lin being killed by General Miura.\n\nCaptain American Winter Soldier - the elevator scene, of course. This absolutely had to be in my list,  the tension building up as more and more \"big, tough guys\" come into the elevator, Cap noticing small details like the dude visibly sweating and everyone around making small glances at him being nervous... Rumlow making seemingly random small-talk. The fight itself had amazing choreography as well, such a small compact space, Cap having to fight with only one arm for a quarter of the fight. \ud83e\udd0c\n\nMatrix Reloaded - when Neo fights hundreds of Agent Smiths after speaking with the Oracle. The CGI is terribly outdated now, with sequences of the scene looking like they are straight out of a cheaply made video game, but for the time the film was made it's understandable. I still love the fight scene itself, especially when Neo gets the pole and starts knocking all the Smiths out of the circle.\n\n\nHonorable mentions: \nAny of the John Wick movies\nKill Bill vol. 1 (fight against the Crazy 88)\nNaruto: Shippuden - Madara after he is resurrected during the Fourth Great Shinobi War.",

I'd love a good movie where the guy is scared or hurt and the girl has to work for him to convince him love is worth it. \n\nI sometimes feel like the first is story sets up so many false expectations in women and the second one is way more real life. Probably why I haven't seen it in movies lol",
