The scene after he corners Dre in the alleyway is especially brutal. Dude *literally* beats the shit out of the kid (yes, you can see the poop stain afterward), and the entire time he\u2019s giving him a mafia style beatdown with his fist sinking into Dre\u2019s gut harder and harder each time, you can see the absolute sadistic glee on his face.\n\nDidn\u2019t stop at Dre either. This kid wanted the smoke with Jackie Chan (Mr. Han), a grown man, and treated a tournament with twelve year olds like this was his audition for the next Street Fighter role! \n\nIt was entertaining and all for a bad guy but the sudden switch as soon as he was defeated with that flip kick just didn\u2019t feel believable to me.

        "content": "General Hummel was portrayed as the main antagonist, obviously along with the other 17 marines that went rouge with him. But he wasn't a normal \"bad guy\". We dont find out until way later that his true intentions were to bluff the Pentagon (with the threat of those 15 VX-gas warheads aimed at the heart of San Fransisco + the tourists they were holding hostage) into paying out $100 million dollars (from a shady slush fund full of proceeds from illegal arms sales that the pentagon makes) so he could distribute $1 million dollars to each one of the 83 marines families that had died under his command over the years, and then pay the other rogue marines a mil each. Pretty noble agenda, but at the same time, not so much.\n\nOur first inkling of who the REAL bad guys are was revealed when the Navy Seals entered the shower room, got surrounded, and then slaughtered.\u00a0[Captains Frye and Darrow](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCHteEFvEum8Xu7sQZGIP8Waow1OLitqJfweF-Pq3Ods3oCPKD2bNjsRZGtW2gWr1rlTMu9Q_S94br0FqDhH8Fa40gaT-nsI_YmE0MjWqzMcQ2meV8m6HpYNqfQV8ZQPLmKPuEo3DtQO0/s1600/vlcsnap-2014-03-10-16h04m01s12.png)\u00a0both have a moment during\u00a0[that scene](https://youtu.be/-PNJ5e8Qq3g)\u00a0where they are both shown, how do I put this, to be enjoying slaughtering those navy seals a little too much???\n\nAs the movie progresses, it still kind of feels like Hummel is the bad guy. But then after he gives the ok to launch the first VX-gas rocket bc the pentagon missed the deadline, and then changes the landing coordinates of the rockets mid-flight, shifting it from heading right for the football stadium full of people out to the open ocean, his true intentions are finally revealed. He was just trying to bluff the pentagon.\n\n[And then we get one of the most intense scenes from all 90's action movies.](https://youtu.be/hiJUZjv7xP4)\u00a0(In my opinion). \"This mission was based on the threat of force. I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I am out of my fucking mind? We bluffed. They called it. The mission is over.\" And then Captain Frye busts out such a creepy reply, revealing that HE is the true antagonist of the movie (Captain Darrow as well); \"Who ever said anything about bluffing General?\" That was such an eerie scene. He also was the last rouge marine to go down (I think??), suffering\u00a0[probably the most gruesome death](https://clip.cafe/the-rock-1996/im-gonna-choke-million-bucks-out-of-youre-gonna-die/)\u00a0of them all. (Well,\u00a0[Captain Darrow becoming \"The Rocket Man\"](https://youtu.be/DNg8OCIMZgI?t=31)\u00a0was pretty freaking brutal too, fitting for the movie's 2nd leading antagonist.) I love this movie, and the very well-written switch up of the main antagonists.",

I'm in my 30s and I really like movies of all genres and time periods but movies before the 80s I have not seen many besides the Bond movies and some of the classics Godfather, Jaws, Alien etc. and yet this movie is very very good. Couple of times it got me chocked, made me laugh a little and smile quite a few times.\n\n  \nI can't say it feels very Christmasy, it does have a cozy feeling probably because of the black and white and always seeing it associated with the Christmas season on TV. It has a lot of heart (I haven't finished it yet), feel for George Bailey missing out on life, Id say many of my generation probably feel similar, shit I can't even get a job or build a future.\n\n  \nThe only real critique I have is that the warmness, kindness in this film does not exist in the world today if it ever did. Potter and his cruel and cutthroat ideals are really what society is like today.\n\n  \nHave younger people watched and or liked this film? Like under 30?

CRITICAL INCIDENT chronicles journalists\u2019, lawyers\u2019, and family members\u2019 efforts to explore the Border Patrol\u2019s involvement in the incident, ultimately pointing to cover-ups, and uncovering the existence of a little-known unit inside the agency that had been involved in other border related incidents. In 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the case and recognizing that Hernandez-Rojas\u2019 human rights had been violated during his arrest.\n\n  \nTrailer: [https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y](https://youtu.be/1FQWH5IYT5Y)\n\n",

        "content": "I recently watched Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts and The Cooler with William Macy and Alec Baldwin, both pretty average movies from the '90s and '00s but I was struck by how much better they look compared to most modern Hollywood and streaming services content. The texture, colors and overall feel just draw me in. Both films have these perfect night shots: dark, moody and full of detail unlike a lot of new movies where night scenes look either flat, overly brightened or way too dark to see anything.\n\nAnother thing in general, not just in these two films, is how alive the environments feel in older movies. There\u2019s wind, movement and atmosphere in almost every scene, which makes the world feel real and immersive. In contrast a lot of modern movies seem weirdly still with no wind, no rain, barely any movement in the background and sometimes even the shadows on actors faces or in the set decorations look fake, almost like they\u2019ve been airbrushed or Photoshopped for a magazine cover.\n\nThese advances in technology should be making movies look even better and help improve the overall production and not result in the flat, lifeless visuals we often get nowadays. It\u2019s frustrating to see all this potential wasted when older films with fewer resources managed to create such rich and immersive worlds.\n\nWhat do you think about it?",

        "title": "Satoshi Kon\u2019s Tokyo Godfathers has a subtle homage to another Christmas classic baked into it.",
        "content": "If you haven\u2019t seen Tokyo Godfathers yet, you really should watch it. IMO it\u2019s one of the best Christmas movies out there, and on rewatch, you notice more and more little details each time. The big one to stand out for me on this rewatch was that Gin has A Christmas Carol subplot.\n\n\nAt some point, Gin starts calling himself trash and sees himself as inferior to \"regular\" people. He also tells a story about how his daughter died and his wife followed soon after, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s homeless (though it\u2019s later revealed it's actually because he had alcohol and gambling addictions).\n\n\nWhen he goes off on his own, he meets an old man passed out drunk in an alley. The old man is wearing the same exact clothes as Gin, and the old man remarks that Gin reminds him of himself when he was younger.\n\n\nThe old man refers to himself as trash, saying he's as worthless dead as he is alive. Gin scolds the old man and says don\u2019t talk about himself that way. Gin gets to hear what his own words sound like when coming from someone similar to himself\n\n\nThe old man ends up dying with no loved ones and drunk, and his dead body is ripped from the tent and beaten by young kids. This is Gin\u2019s Ghost of Christmas Future warning him of how his life will end up if he doesn\u2019t change his ways. \n\n\nThe next man Gin meets is a doctor that looks eerily the same as him. Same age, same haircut, same facial expression, and nearly the same facial hair. \n\n\nWe find out this doctor coincidentally has the same exact backstory that Gin lied about to Hana and Miyuki earlier. The doctor's daughter died of sickness and his wife died soon after. \n\n\nExcept the doctor didn\u2019t end up homeless. He went on to help people as a doctor, and is getting married to Gin\u2019s daughter ironically enough (also solid commentary on father issues and marrying a man similar to your dad). \n\n\nThe doctor tells Gin he can only live each day trying his best. This is Gin\u2019s Ghost of Christmas Present\n\n\n(Now, Gin looks down after this and notices the doctor wearing a metal leg brace. I don\u2019t know the exact meaning of this, but in the scene afterwards, Hana scolds Gin for running away from his life. However, because the doctor has a leg brace, he never has the option to \u201crun\u201d away from life. Also could be commentary on how disabled people are basically forced to approach life with a positive outlook to be able to survive the world.)\n\n\nThe last of the men Gin meets is a man is literally buried amongst trash (in an apartment). The man has a crippling gambling addction, and almost abandoned his wife. Funnily enough, his backstory is that his child died (presumably stillborn), and his wife was soon to follow because she was getting ready to jump off a bridge. The same backstory Gin tells, and a close enough backstory to the doctor. \n\n\nGin sees his own decisions from a third person perspective, and he yells at the guy to not abandon his wife when she needs him most. If he really loves the woman, he'd be there for her no matter what. This basically allows Gin at redemption for his sins regarding his own wife and child. This is Gin's Ghost of Christmas Past. \n\nGin uses these lessons to fuel the climax, doing whatever it takes to be there for his chosen family, risking his life to save the baby, and reconnects with his daughter.\n\n\nTokyo Godfathers is noted for being more grounded than Satoshi Kon's other works, but if you look close enough, you see he includes magic and surrealism in his subtle own ways, like bringing Christmas Ghosts to life, or like envisioning Tokyo as a magical entity scattered with hidden faces in the buildings. It's truly a wonderful watch.",
