They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what\u2019s on film I\u2019ve seen (or at least know about).\n\n",

        "title": "Hard to believe \"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\" is nearly a decade old.",
        "content": "I pinpoint that film's release date to be the day Star Wars fans were permanently fractured. Some say *The Last Jedi* did but while that film undoubtedly *expanded* it, this film got the fanbase into an ugly division that has yet to be fully healed nearly a decade later. Before, it felt unified, the love for the original trilogy, the hate for the prequel trilogy and special editions, there was still enjoyment of being a fan. Then *The Force Awakens* comes and fan wars began on how some felt it was a return to form with spectacular effects, emotional beats, and the best acting in the franchise, while others felt it was a safe cash grab that did nothing to respect the lore, got too political, got too childish. The film's outstanding success only made these arguments nastier. I can remember what Reddit and IMDb was like during those days. Disagreements over movies always happened but this felt like the tipping point, especially as people continue to be this argumentative and cruel in their debates. No longer about having friendly disagreements, just to see who's the better \"fan\". I do hope the fanbase can come back to being more unified someday.",

        "content": "Watched it with my dad the other day and its genuinely the only movie that i was able to sit dtill and watch. Ive watched 50+ movies over the year and zombieland is easily my favorite movie of all time. Tallahasse mafe me laugh so much. Real genuine ones which is rare from me. Then the other thing thats funny is he relates to my dad because they both just want twinkies in life. Anyways when the girls betrayed tallahasse and columbus i genuinely crashed out and got mad at them. When Bill Mercer died i literally cried and watching them bond made me happy. I was literally shouting no and turn back when he was about to get shot. Then when i thought tallahasse was gonna die i got really sad and mad at the girls and i laughed and got sad for tallahasse when he shot the twinkies. The movie is so well made!",

We ended up talking about 'The Goonies'.\n\n(Spoiler)\n\n&gt;!The first thing I think of when remembering The Goonies is the scene with the kid in the van with the kidnappers. \"Tell us everything\". And the boy proceeds to tell the story's of his earliest memories.!&lt;\n\nThis specific clich\u00e9 began somewhere in a movie. Was it really The Goonies? Or was there an earlier movie that coined this clich\u00e9?\n\n\"Tell us everything\" followed by an autobiography. Where did it start? ",

        "content": "Just re watched Superbad for first time in like 3 years. Great movie. Perfectly depicts every teenage/early 20 year old boy\u2019s dream. I am 23 so the movie had me reminiscing the entire time. Can\u2019t help but wish I was 17/18 again with my only priorities being girls and alcohol. The ending was so bittersweet tho. I had never really noticed it before, but now I\u2019m a little older, with most of my high school friends having drifted away, the final escalator scene really hit home. They were both happy, met girls, were excited about their lives ahead, but at the same time they both felt themselves drifting onto different paths and understood that they can\u2019t be best friends forever. The final scene where Evan drifts out of view of Seth, that really hit me. Maybe because I\u2019ve finally accepted that me and my best friend since primary school have drifted apart. It just seems to capture the moment of initial realisation so perfectly. It\u2019s mad because when I was a teenager, I never thought SUPERBAD would have me in my feelings. Anyway, brilliant film. ",
