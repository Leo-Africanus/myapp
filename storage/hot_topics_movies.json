        "content": "#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K. Brown\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Ana De Armas\n* Selena Gomez\n* Lily-Rose Depp\n* Goldie Hawn\n* Connie Nielsen\n* Ben Stiller\n* Oprah Winfrey\n\n\n#Submit in the comments and have fun!",

I want someone to recommend me an underrated comedy movie because it will probably be new to me, as long as it isn't in a \"can you recommend me a underrated comedy movie\" article or reddit post, I've probably never seen it before.  \n  \nI'm feeling down right now because my pet kitten (his name was link) recently died in a preventable death due to hypothermia, he was my first ever pet too. I've honestly been skipping school a bit so watching movies will be a nice way to pass time. \n\nI'll probably reply to the comments and just rate the movies you guys suggested me if anyone is even interested in that. Anyways thank you to anyone who reads this and gives me an recommendation, literally means the world to me right now.",

        "title": "Kingdom of Heaven (Directors cut) is outstanding",
        "content": "I just noticed something upon rewatch where when they are fighting in the forest you have an array of great actors all in one scene. These include Qui Gon Jin/ Rob Roy, Legalus/ Paris, Jaime Lannister, Lucius Vorenus, and Remus Lupin haha. All that to say just a really really good movie and this is stale news obviously but the directors cut is so much better than theatrical so I encourage anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it to give it a watch. \n\nTo me this is only a touch \u201cworse\u201d than Gladiator and one of Ridley Scott\u2019s best movies. If gladiator is a 9/10 then kingdom of heaven is 8/10. Excellent story excellent action excellent acting and the cinematography is beautiful too. It\u2019s such a shame to me they don\u2019t make historical/ancient epics like this much anymore nowadays. I guess that\u2019s because everybody wants superhero movies and Hollywood does whatever will make them the most money. I miss the days of movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, etc being popular and getting big budgets. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s more interesting about recycled and unoriginal superheroes constantly being made into \u201cnew\u201d movies but I guess it\u2019s all subjective. Still would LOVE to see more movies like this one being made in the years to come but I ain\u2019t holding my breath lol. Cheers ",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a 23-year-old guy, and I absolutely love romance movies. I\u2019ve enjoyed them since I was a kid, and my love for the genre has only grown over the years. My mom introduced me to romance movies when I was young, especially Nicholas Sparks films, and over time, I developed a real appreciation for them. I genuinely enjoy watching the dynamic between two people falling in love, seeing their connection grow, and admiring the emotions and chemistry between them.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had a strong idea of what romance should be. Even when I was 8, I saw something beautiful in how two people could love each other, and that perspective hasn\u2019t changed. Romance movies give me that feeling of admiration, both for the relationship itself and for the way different characters evolve emotionally.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people, especially other men, tend to call me \u201cgay\u201d for liking romance movies. I\u2019m not, but it\u2019s frustrating that people assume that just because I enjoy love stories. It makes me wonder if a lot of guys out there secretly enjoy romance movies but just don\u2019t admit it because of how others might perceive them.\n\nSo I wanted to ask\u2014are there any other men here who genuinely love romance movies? If so, what got you into them, and what do you love about them? Would be great to hear from others who feel the same way!",

First time I watched an Al Pacino film (yes, I know, uncultured swine I am). Him and Robert De Niro stole the show, played off of each other very well. \n\nI know there are plenty of Al Pacino gems that I need to watch on the list, but what\u2019s a performance of his that you hold in the highest regard? I\u2019m stuck between wanting to view \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Advocate\u201d or \u201cScarface\u201d next before I dive into \u201cThe Godfather\u201d Series\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated, thank you!",

        "content": "Considering that it was based on some silly SNL sketches, you'd think this movie would have been a long SNL skit. But no, this movie had heart and amazing set design. The costumes were great, and any scene involving the Coneheads' house were packed with details. This wasn't some low effort spin off, the production team put effort into the movie and the dialog. There are so many little gags, from Jason Alexander's toupee to Beldar's weird naked body, it's a movie you can watch multiple times and appreciate something new. And nowadays, it's fun to see all the cameos from a very successful SNL cast at the time. Dan Aykroyd holds nothing back. And when they arrive at Remulak, scene of them flying into the atmosphere still looks good today (unlike most movies today using lazy CGI).\n\nI still don't know why it was panned at the time. I know critics hate comedies, since comedy is much harder to pull off than drama, but the movie is much more than its contemporary reputation.",

Even in Saiki K like how everyone thinks he\u2019s normal but he\u2019s kind of basically a god. Stuff like that.
