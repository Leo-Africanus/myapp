Compared to those kinds of turns, Elordi\u2019s role didn\u2019t strike me as particularly demanding or transformative, nor did it feel like something only he could have pulled off.\n\nTo me, it felt like a well-executed performance that a number of capable actors could have delivered at a similar level. That\u2019s where I struggle to see the case for an Oscar nomination, where the bar is (or should be) set much higher than competence.\n\nCurious to hear what others think? What specifically about his performance stood out to you as awards-worthy?",

I can\u2019t recall the last time a movie has made me cry since I\u2019m not nearly as emotional as I was when I was a kid, but HOLY HELL did this movie bring me close to doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie about a father and his son as they traverse a post apocalyptic United States in search of a boat to see if they can find a safer place to live.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear during the movie that humanity is doomed. A worldwide disaster struck the now ash covered planet, and pretty much all plant and animal life is gone. Because of that, it isn\u2019t uncommon for any remaining people to start resorting to cannibalism.\n\nI ended up watching it on my birthday, and it really put a damper on the remainder of it. Is it arguably a good movie? Yes, but I have no desire to watch it again. Not for a very long time at least.",

Whenever, I was over there, in my tiny 1-person campervan in seclusion, climbing a mountain in pitch-black, or jumping out of a plane I just reminded myself why I was doing it.

        "content": "So Shawshank Redemption has pretty much been my favorite movie since it was released. I normally always sit down and watch it if I see it on or streaming somewhere and have the time. I\u2019ve probably seen it a hundred times. \n\nThe reason it\u2019s my favorite movie isn\u2019t just because the acting is great, the story is great, and the pacing is almost perfect. It\u2019s that it takes me on this complete emotional journey of ups and downs and leaves me feeling happy and uplifted. I always have a smile on my face when credits roll. \n\nI recently just realized not a single other movie in my top 10 leaves me with that same feeling. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have other feel good movies on my watch list, it\u2019s the complete package that those other movies are acting. \n\nSo I figured I\u2019d come here and ask Reddit if you guys got any suggestions of another movie that could maybe make my top 10 that gives me that complete emotional journey with a happy ending.

        "title": "Finally watched The Fall (2006). What did you think of the style and story?",
        "content": "I recently watched The Fall by Tarsem Singh after seeing a few clips online. The movie immediately caught my attention because of how beautiful it looked. The costumes, color schemes, and locations felt so intentional and striking that it made me curious enough to finally sit down and watch it.\n\nFrom the start, the film gave me a strange, nostalgic feeling. It felt like being transported back in time, watching a movie in the family room as a kid during summer break. That made sense since it came out in 2006, but at the same time it somehow still felt completely timeless.\n\nVisually, I found it beautiful but also a little weird in a very artistic way. The style felt dreamlike and surreal without feeling random. I really appreciated how bold it was with its visuals, especially the costumes and locations, which stayed with me long after the movie ended.\n\nI did feel that the story became a little messy toward the end. I was confused by some of the characters, their actions, and the reasoning behind certain moments. Still, it did not take away from the experience for me at all, and I would absolutely watch it again.\n\nIt is the kind of movie that lingers. I found myself thinking about it the next day, replaying images and moments in my head.\n\nThe best way I can describe watching The Fall is that it felt like one of those dreams you have during a summer afternoon nap, the kind of dream you really like. When you wake up, you immediately want to fall back asleep just to continue it. That is exactly what this movie felt like to me.\n\nI would love to hear other people's thoughts and experiences, especially how the story and visual style worked for you.",

Argue for a film where the lack of clear resolution was essential to its theme, respected the audience's intelligence, and has sparked lasting discussion\u00a0because\u00a0it wasn't spelled out. Why would a concrete ending have ruined the film?\n\n* Examples:\u00a0Inception\u00a0(spinning top),\u00a0The Thing\u00a0(1982),\u00a0Lost in Translation\u00a0(the whisper),\u00a0No Country for Old Men.

She also plays a deadbeat mother. \n\nCan you recommend more films and tv shows with such bad/mediocre artists who clearly love the artform. Like in Disaster Artist they show Tommy believed he was making a masterpiece. I cannot remember but does Birdman fit this bill? Or was he just a has been like in Sunset Boulevard? Watched Birdman long time ago. ",

The camera work, the lighting, the mood, the actors/actresses he casts,  he has a style that I vibe with.  The Wrestler in my opinion is one of his finest.   He has some deep scenes.  His latest 2025 movie with Austin Butler wasn't my favorite.   ",
