        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

        "content": "Breakfast Club, Clueless, Fast Times and Ridgemont High, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Lady Bird and Rushmore are fantasies. Which film accurately depicts the high school experience? \n\nDoes a film exists that is as banal as real high school but still manages to be interesting? As grim as Elephant (2003) is in topic, I thought the tone hauntingly captured the feeling of being in high school. Is there something better out there?",

        "content": "*Teens participate in a grueling high-stakes contest where they must continuously walk or be shot by a member of their military escort.*\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Pts. 1 &amp; 2 , and The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes)\n\nCast: Cooper Hoffman, Ben Wang, Mark Hamill, David Jonsson, Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Charlie Plummer\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_long_walk_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [80/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-long-walk-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Total Film - Lauren Milici](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/the-long-walk-review/)\n\n&gt;The Long Walk is not for the faint of heart, but it is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made, and one of the best dystopian sci-fi movies to hit the big screen in a really long time.\n\n[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \\- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;It can exhilarating as Frances Lawrence and JT Mollner bring a bit of edge to this beloved Stephen King adaptation. Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson are both excellent, delivering riveting performances that emotionally reel in the audience. It can also feel repetitious at times, trying to replicate the highs of some of the more exciting set pieces, building towards an expected ending.\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1953442/the-long-walk-review/) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;\"The Long Walk\" is an emotionally obliterating all-time great Stephen King adaptation, and undoubtedly one of the best films of 2025. The camaraderie shown by the group is not unlike the foxhole friendships developed between soldiers during wartime, but given the hopelessness of their situation, it starts to feel like we're watching the American version of \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Wang provides a majority of the much-needed levity with his sharp tongue and fearless delivery, while Baker's warm, gentle optimism represents the best of humanity.",
