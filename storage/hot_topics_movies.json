        "content": "It could be an inclusion done by a director, writer or producer, doesn't matter that much, as long as the pettiness is on full display in the film.\n\nTwo famous examples:\n\nRoland Emmerich had characters mocking critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel added in Godzilla (1998) after the two had criticized some of his earlier films. The characters on-screen are the useless mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene, the latter giving mayor Ebert two thumbs down at the end of the movie. The real life Ebert and Siskel were not impressed, neither by the movie nor their parodies.\n\nBob Fosse's semi-autobiographical All That Jazz (1979) starring Roy Scheider as Bob Fosse stand-in Joe Gideon features a rival Broadway/film director played by John Lithgow. While it was never confirmed who this character was based on, rumours suggest Fosse's Broadway rivals Harold Prince or Michael Bennett, or some amalgamation of the two. Regardless, in a non-pivotal scene Lithgow's character Lucas Sergeant is approached by a fan (much to his ego's excitement), when the fan says:\n\n'Could I have your autograph? I'm an actress, too. You're my favorite director after Joe Gideon. I'm so sorry your show was a flop.'",

        "content": "Video games are a relatively new medium in the grand scheme of things, as such for decades movies were made by people who had never played a video game before, and like many people of their generation they held quite negative attitudes about those darn Nintendos those kids are wasting their time with, and this could be seen in the movies they made. Games would be depicted as childish wastes of time and/or money at best, and violent things that could lead kids to become violent at worst.\n\nAs time went on people that actually grew up playing games starting getting involved in movie production so things became less negative. But these people often didn't play games anymore and thus their understanding of games was quite outdated (think of how many portrayals of \"modern\" games would still use old concepts like levels and lives, as well as 8-bit sound effects, or how many just reference old games and not much else). Things have gotten better in recent years though, since many adults involved in movie production now still play games, and collaborations between Hollywood and video game companies (which are often owned by the same parent company) require games to be portrayed in a more faithful/flattering light.\n\nSo with that in mind, what were the worst portrayals of video games in movies and which were the best/most accurate? What fictional movie game would you actually want to play?\n\nEDIT: Just so we're clear, I am not talking about movies based on video games, but the way video games are depicted in movies.",

        "content": "In Costello's opening narration, he says \"twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job, we had the presidency, may he rest in peace\". Going by the timeline, it implies he was referring to JFK, who has Irish roots (&amp; is someone Frank seems to admire). And this line plays over the first time we see the guy on screen.\n\nIn that ballistics lecture Colin attends (Matt Damon's first scene), the subject matter being discussed/diagrams being used are that of JFK's head wounds when he was assassinated.\n\nDunno if it can be seen as foreshadowing that Colin will end up killing Costello, but if it is, nice touch.",

        "title": "Phantasm",
        "content": "There's a fair amount of Horror fans here on r/Movies and there must be more than a few who are familiar with this series. One of my very favorite Horror series if not my outright favorite, mainly purely based off of the first two although I also think the third and fourth ones were pretty good as well (and also quite impressive despite their small budgets). The first two always see regular rotation from me every October as part of my Halloween playlist. The Tall Man is definitely among the more unique of the Horror icons and he was played to perfection by the late, great Angus Scrimm throughout all five. The series is such a great blend of surrealism and mind-bending Horror with some fun Action elements sprinkled throughout. And who doesn't love the iconic flying death spheres.\n\nMay as well rank them while I'm at it. For other fans here, how would you rank them? Mine goes:\n\n* Phantasm II\n* Phantasm\n* Phantasm IV: Oblivion\n* Phantasm III: Lord Of The Dead\n* Phantasm V: Ravager\n\n2 has always very easily been my favorite of the series. It's literally not only my favorite Horror film, but one of my favorite movies in general. With the bigger budget you can tell so much more was able to be accomplished. It's like a vintage Survival Horror video game from the 90s as a movie. Just a riot of a movie. I have a lot of love and respect for the original as well, but it's always hard not to look at 2 as being the definitive entry.\n\n3 and 4 are also very good, but the fifth was sadly held back by the clear lack of a budget, but you can tell they tried their damndest. I will say as a lifelong fan the ending of 5 certainly hits hard and brings full-circle the themes of death and loss, which have been prevalent since the first film. It also certainly hits much harder in light of the health issues series star Reggie Bannister has sadly recently suffered. I'm just glad a fifth and final film was finally made after so many years of waiting.",
