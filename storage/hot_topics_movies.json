        "content": "I read an interesting piece in The New Yorker by Namwali Serpell, where she points out a growing trend in movies toward excessive literalism, leaving little room for audiences to interpret meaning on their own. Films now seem to patronize viewers by relying on overly explicit metaphors and heavy-handed commentary. For instance, The Substance shows Demi Moore literally giving birth to her younger self through her back. She points out The Brutalist for visualizing its metaphors too explicitly: immigrants' lives being depicted as literally turned upside down and showing the American Dream as something that, \"literally fucks you.\" Did anyone else read it and just curious about thoughts about whether they feel that movies are spelling out symbolism instead of trusting the audience's intelligence.",

But she was never asked back in Top Gun Maverick like she aged a lot and left Hollywood forever. \n\nJennifer Beals who is known for Flashdance 1983 film, she was huge that time but nowadays she has been forgotten. Even now generation wouldn't know Jami Gertz but if you was in the 80s you probably remember her from the lost boys, Sixteen Candles and others but nowadays she retired and she is a million, but I don't think she is well remembered that well as soon as you see her face bow compared to the 80s where you would recognise her well.\n\nWell can you guys think of more 80s celebrities that are completely forgotten as you watch them again and some others you recognise their face, but didn't know their name from a classic 80s film as you searched them up. Well any suggestions about this?",

        "content": "\n\nThe whole premise is bonkers but so clever it how it serves as a metaphor for how ethnic minorities, black people in this case, are utilized as drones of consumption and how this perpetuates negative stereotypes (e.g. Fried chicken, obsession with hair products, selling drugs, etc.). It shows how to be critical of those consumer goods we're obsessed with. What makes us feel good or \"look cool\" to others isn't necessarily good for us. \n\nI also love the point it made when Fontaine almost gave up and accepted his fate as a mere clone living in a vicious cycle. Even after people figure out the trap, that knowledge alone won't keep you from falling into it again and again. We might be products of our environment and even our genetics, but at the end of the day, we have free will, and it's up to us to break free from the cycle we are stuck in.\n\n\nI myself am Latino (Puerto Rican to be exact) and I feel like many points made in the film apply to my culture as well. In recent years, Puerto Rican culture has become a bit more known internationally, thanks to things like Bad Bunny and the Despacito song. While there is nothing wrong with people being curious of and being entertained by the culture, there is also a concerted effort to perpetuate pretty offensive and harmful stereotypes about my people: From sexual promiscuity thanks to reggaeton music to the idea that we all live in slums next to the beach. And many fellow Puerto Ricans end up internalizing these stereotypes and thinking it makes us \"cool\". \n\nThe film just really spoke to me this way, and feel it even applies to other ethnicities or minority groups. Great film. It was like Us, but actually good. Also had no idea Boyega had such range in acting. He was phenomenal.",

It was made in the early 90\u2019s, it heavily feature a gay couple that were refers to as soulmates. It had a deaf character and featured BSL. It\u2019s interesting how things that were once just part of telling an interesting story have been so politicized.",

I\u2019ll nominate Shawshank Redemption, by about 40 seconds.",

Whoever says the PG-13 rating ruined this movie is absolutely wrong. \n\nJohn McClanes character was not lost in this film as at this point in time Bruce Willis still cared about his job. John McClane feels like John McClane.\n\nThis film always feels to me like it is pushing John from 80s-90s style action to a more modern style action, while maintaining the franchises roots. \n\nThe main villain is very good in this movie. Definitely the best villain whose surname isn't Gruber in this franchise. \n\nSo over all this movie is like a 7/10. ",
