I am fully convinced that the events in this movie, even though it is a satire, would 100% play out the same way in real life, to a point that it converted me to being a misanthrope.\n\nDid others enjoy this movie as well? Did you enjoy the movie or didn't think much of it?",

He\u2019s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.\n\nWell, The Blind Side is on TV and it\u2019s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what\u2019s on film I\u2019ve seen (or at least know about).\n\n",

Contrast, depth of field, interesting composition... \n\nI think what's happened recently is that big budget movies are being directed by people with almost zero experience and every single creative decision is being left for post production. That's why movies are \"flat\" right now. \n\nAt least a few years back our daft, big budget nonsense was made by people who had some visual flair. ",

Brando is an information broker. He's not really part of the actual heist. \n\nBassett is just there to be DeNiro's love interest. She's barely in the movie and knows next to nothing about the actual heist. \n\nAnd secondly, there's a twist in the movie that they straight up spoil in the trailer. \n\nAn absolutely horrible trailer for an otherwise good movie.",

Many different animators worked on it and made with a variety of filters to it, so every scene looks in a different.\n\nDefinetely a watchable movie if you like to watch a beautiful art film.\n\nNever saw the original footage of the actors.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akLbLR2Xvd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akLbLR2Xvd8)",

The Northman was advertised as a viking action epic, when it's a Robert Eggers movie. Asteroid City's trailers didn't even reveal *any* of the black and white scenes. What are some other ones that I'm missing?",

        "content": "I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan. Actually, a massive one. I love so much about the franchise, and can find something to enjoy in most of the different shows/movies, even if they're generally not well regarded.\n\nThe fourth movie though, despite being an even number and apparently quite popular, just doesn't do anything for me. I dont know if it's the departure from the usual space opera setting, the over laboured fish-out-of-water gag of the crew going back in time, or the heavy handedness of the environmental message, but for one reason or another I just cant get on board with it.\n\nHaving said all that, I dont hate it. I can see why people like it - it takes a risk in changing up the setting, the individual performances are generally pretty good, and the \"save the whales\" message is pretty hard to take issue with. \n\nSo overall - I dont like it, but I do *respect* it. Curious if other folks have movies they feel the same way about?",
