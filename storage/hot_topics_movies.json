In some of the Police Academy sequels, his scenes were the funniest, by far.",

        "content": "For me it was CODA (2021). I had seen every Best Picture nominee following up the awards night. CODA was the last on my list because I had seen people say it\u2019s \u201ca glorified tv movie. Too safe. Etc. Etc.\u201d When I started CODA, I thought \u201cIt\u2019s good, but predictable. Troy Kotsur deserves the Oscar..\u201d I was still leaning towards Licorice Pizza being the best film of that year I had seen.\n\nBut the movie did something. It began to grow on me. I became highly invested in the scene with the young woman and her deaf parents individually. But the scene with her father Frank (Troy Kotsur) places his hands on his daughter\u2019s neck to feel the vibration of her vocal cords as she sings to him. Completely had me hook, line, and sinker. I felt every moment in this film led to this powerful scene. I began to cry. Moved me so much.\n\nWith a sure certainty I remember saying to my Momma. \u201cI just watched CODA. It\u2019s going to win Best Picture tomorrow. Mark my words.\u201d Then I asked her to watch it with me. She agreed.\n\nI know I\u2019ll catch a lot of flack for that, but I own up to it. I love this film. Sometimes something sweet and simple can hit us harder than we imagine. I love this movie.",

        "content": "Looking for that movie changing moment where the plot either twists or is realized by the main (or secondary) character.\nExamples would be Shutter Island, Leo realizing he's the 67th patient. I love the slow reality creeping in, each little hanging plot thread is finished off. He sees the \"gun\" he's holding isn't even real, that he was alone in that cave, etc. \n\nCan also be one that the viewer knows and we see the character finally figure it out. Example Gone Girl. My favorite realization in that movie isn't the husband finding out, but the couple in the trailer park and they beat the crap out of her for real and take her money. Just nice poetic justice right there ",

        "content": "Chef (2014) is one of those movies I really should have watched a long time ago. So many people recommended it to me, and once I finally did, I just couldn\u2019t stop watching and rewatching it.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m having a boring weekend, feel down, or get that sense like I\u2019ve lost some passion for life, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s watch Chef again.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it, but basically it\u2019s a movie starring and directed by Jon Favreau about a chef who eventually quits his job and starts operating a food truck, and that\u2019s when the movie really becomes fun. From there, it turns into a great road-trip kind of film.\n\nThere are some big names in it like one of my favorite actors Bobby Cannavale, but there's also Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, and Robert Downey Jr. even shows up. But what really sells the movie is the story. It\u2019s a feel-good comedy, maybe not particularly sophisticated, but the message about following your passion (or finding it again, reinventing yourself, not letting problems stop you, rediscovering that inner sense of liveliness and creativity) is so well expressed.\n\nAnd if you like good food or enjoy cooking, you definitely won\u2019t be disappointed. The music is great too, and there\u2019s plenty of it. The whole thing is just so charming and pleasant. It\u2019s become my \"comfort food movie\" as one of my friends says. I guess he means \"comfort movie\" but I'm fine with putting the word food is there cause, you know, it's a film about cooking. Forrest Gump is his \"comfort food movie\" btw. I never connected with Forrest Gump like that. So I guess different strokes....\n\nHave any of you watched Chef and enjoyed it so much that you\u2019ve rewatched it a lot? If not, is there a movie you consider comforting enough to be your \"comfort-food movie\"?\n\nP.S. I seen Favreau in a lot of films but I just really like his character in Chef, just so charming.",
