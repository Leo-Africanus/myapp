He was just chilling by himself in a cafe, eating some pie, minding his own business, and all of a sudden that random dude cramps up in his space, pissing him off and causing a switch to flip, revealing his character's true, extremely dangerous  personality.

        "content": "I don't want this to come across as some curmudgeonly rant against the fashion industry. I realise fashion is an art form like any other, and a lot of talented people work in the field.\n\nHowever, there's one scene from the Devil Wears Prada that I never resonated with as much as others seemed to. It's the moment where Andy and Miranda are standing before a pile of clothes and Andy essentially claims that she isn't entrenched in the high fashion world, choosing instead to buy simple clothes from department stores.\n\nWhat follows is a monologue from Miranda, essentially explaining that Andy is actually deeply affected by the decisions made by high level fashion designers which then trickle down into the department stores and bargain bins.\n\nIt always feels like the scene is supposed to prove Andy wrong. It certainly ends with Andy unable to reply, and the sense of a point scored in Miranda's favor.\n\nBut after all these years, I still don't feel the monologue really disproves Andy's point.\n\nYes her sweater is cerulean due to a trickle down of higher level design choices, but it's clear Andy still makes the decision to pick whatever item of clothing is available in the department store.\n\nIf an entire industry is based around promoting Style A, or Style B or Style C, yet it becomes apparent that Andy would pick whatever style is available, it actually paints her as immune to the fashion industry rather than beholden to it.\n\nIf they'd chosen green, she would have picked green.\n\nIt's like someone wanted to buy a watch just to tell the time. Yes I'm sure a million decisions are being made about watch faces and minute hands by incredibly passionate people... but if someone goes out and simply buys a watch, while they might be swayed in their choice by individual designs, they're hardly beholden to those higher decisions.\n\nMiranda's argument seems to be \"a lot of people put a lot of work into this arbitrary decision you made\". But the scale of effort that goes into something doesn't seem convincing on its own; I think Andy would have been right to counter that, just because a lot of people worked on something, doesn't mean the work is inherently valuable to her decision.\n\nThough I'm sure both things are true, and I have to commend The Devil Wears Prada for giving such food for thought after so many years.",

        "content": "Hi Reddit! This summer, I wrote about many of the major film releases:\n\nI argued that James Gunn\u2019s bright take on [*Superman*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/?gift=bFe8Cm5Ue-K-qmFIa1pU49Qb7FSZ3WLlBUzx9Yn2eqw&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharehttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2025%2F09%2Ftrump-economic-pain-strategy%2F684166%2F%3Futm_source%3Dreddit&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo) brilliantly embraced its corniness. In my [*Eddington*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/eddington-ending-explained-antihero/683632/?gift=bFe8Cm5Ue-K-qmFIa1pU40uE5ajeWrinoDGGM0_1AXY&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharehttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2025%2F09%2Ftrump-economic-pain-strategy%2F684166%2F%3Futm_source%3Dreddit&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo) review, I wrote about how the film aims to spark empathy toward its most twisted character, with uncomfortable results. And I wrote that Liam Neeson had made the perfect transition into comedy in [*The Naked Gun*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/08/the-naked-gun-2025-movie-review-liam-neeson/683734/?gift=bFe8Cm5Ue-K-qmFIa1pU4yconO7_WFPy8TLHD8QRRpk&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharehttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fideas%2Farchive%2F2025%2F09%2Ftrump-economic-pain-strategy%2F684166%2F%3Futm_source%3Dreddit&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo).\u00a0\n\nIn this AMA, I\u2019ll talk about which summer films were worth the hype, which flew under the radar, and which movies you should be looking forward to this fall.\u00a0\n\nAsk me anything!",

        "content": "*Through a surprising twist of fate, single strangers Sarah and David get to relive important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present.*\n\nDirector: Kogonada\n\nCast: Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [55%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_big_bold_beautiful_journey)\n\n**Metacritic:** [39/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-b2827639.html) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;Kogonada neither wrote nor edited A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, and so we\u2019re largely lacking in the sophistication department, or the soft musicality he\u2019s been able to construct in his earlier films.\n\n[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/a-big-beautiful-journey-review) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;Is *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* a piece of wannabe creativity with a yawning hollowness at its center, or an A-list romance with some welcome aesthetic sensitivity? Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-and-colin-farrell-play-the-game-of-love) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;This film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well \u2026 or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge\u2019s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no. The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.\n\n[Variety - Tomris Laffly](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-1236520085/)\n\n&gt;The film\u2019s tonal inconsistencies hurt its impossibly talented co-leads considerably. Most of the time, both Farrell and Robbie seem detached and surprisingly cold when they are supposed to be embracing intimate, vulnerable feelings audiences know they\u2019re more than capable of projecting.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-kogonada-1235151392/) \\- 'D+'\n\n&gt;\u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey\u201d is miscalculated as a romance and a fantasy, and while I\u2019m loath to blame a craftsman as intelligent as Kogonada entirely for the outcome, he did, after all, agree to direct this lousy script. A big, bold, beautiful bore indeed.",

        "content": "What I\u2019ve always loved about Treasure Planet is that it feels like a time capsule from two different futures: one imagined in the 1700s, and one imagined in the early 2000s. On one hand, you\u2019ve got the swashbuckling, hand-drawn grandeur of classic Disney adventure. On the other, you\u2019ve got bold digital animation, sci-fi ships sailing solar winds, and that early-2000s punk rock spirit through Jim Hawkins. It\u2019s like a movie that exists in two eras at once (past and future) and somehow it works beautifully.\n\nIt had such a unique aesthetic that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen replicated. If anyone knows any similar media that is like it, please share. \n\nAlso, idk if this counts as self promotion (I hope not) but I noticed reddit didn\u2019t have a subreddit for this movie and went ahead and made one over at r/treasureplanetmovie ",
