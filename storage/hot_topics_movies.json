Sunshine (2007). first two acts are tense, beautiful, brilliant sci-fi about saving the sun. and then the third act shows up and\u2026 suddenly it\u2019s a slasher flick with a burnt zombie mutant. it just jumps from genius to B-movie nonsense in a blink and almost ruins everything i just watched. seriously, my brain was like \u2018wait, what\u2026\u2019",

        "content": "I finally watched 'A Real Pain' as one of those films I feel I should watch but could never get round to starting. I just finished it and now I'm desperate to talk about Kieran Culkin's performance so here I am. \n\nCulkin's portrays a character who rampages through extreme emotions from scene to scene, one moment he's calm and in control, the next he's angry and confused, the next he's hurt and vulnerable, the next he's pleading with the world to make sense. He wraps all this together into a believable character that is magnetic to watch. I've watched performances  before that I thought commanded the screen but I'm not sure I've ever seen a performance that showed such range and craft. I didn't know he won the Oscar before watching the film, afterwards I checked to make sure he had as anything else would have been a travesty.\n\nThe film ends with a close up of Culkin's face that brings everything together that  we've been watching for the last 90 mins and instantly explains who he really is. It is simply magnificent and I can't recommend A Real Pain enough.\n\n",

People thought the movies were going to be awful. Problems with special effects and editing. Conflicts with the producers. Directors having a heart attack because of the stress. But those movies became huge box office success\n\nHas there been any recent movie that went through this? Production hell, but turned into a huge box office success? Or do the hollywood directors get whatever they want nowadays? Or are movies nowadays not as ambitious that would have production hell?",

        "content": "On its original broadcast, on Sunday, November 20, 1983, more than 100 million people, watched the film when it first aired on the ABC television network.\n\n**The Day After** received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide. ABC and local TV affiliates opened 1-800 hotlines with counselors standing by.\n\nABC then aired a live debate on Viewpoint, ABC's occasional discussion program hosted by Nightline's Ted Koppel, featuring the scientist Carl Sagan, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elie Wiesel, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Brent Scowcroft, and the commentator William F. Buckley Jr. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, but Buckley promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe film was broadcast on Soviet state television in 1987, during the negotiations on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n\nCensors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. \n\nIn July 2018, a rough cut of the film appeared online, although rumors had long circulated that a second, even more dramatic version of the film existed, but it had never been released. The rough cut contains several new scenes as well as longer takes of scenes already included in the film. The rough cut contains almost fifteen minutes more footage.\n\nThe film received 12 Emmy nominations and won two Emmy awards. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the film received the Goldene Leinwand Award for reaching three million viewers in the cinema.\n\n\n\nThe same theme was also the subject of the British film Threads in 1984 and When the Wind Blows in 1986.",

        "content": "I've got a trip to San Fran coming next week, so of course I go to the source of my inspiration for that journey. And as always, it's a great ride. *The Voyage Home* is funny, exciting, tightly paced and the characters are enjoyable throughout. Simply put, it's a good movie.\n\nBut isn't that weird? The proverbial 'fish out of water' story in this regard, whether it be time travel or different culture or transmutation or whatever it is- that's usually regarded as a desperate move, not something that makes a franchise work. Goodness, look at how many times it's a low point in a respected franchise; yet for Star Trek, it's one of the most thoroughly enjoyable the franchise has to offer. That's so weird that such a bizarre, otherworldly idea works so well. What makes this film so unique that is succeeds when most of its ilk can't even tread water?",

        "content": "The amount of emotion and anger I have towards what happened to Lilya and her younger friend is unparalleled. The worst part is the belief she holds that she's finally going to be given a better life. My heart is empty. This movie is the pure essence of despair. The even worse part is that these tragedies are still a modern day issue in this world. We all seem to see the world through our own lenses and find tragic stories sad. However, this film does a good job of forming a connection with the characters and the empathy subsequently hits harder in my soul. I am empty after viewing this. Very good movie. Despite the fact it kills me inside.",

I also just saw Troy (2004) for the first time, and I\u2019m planning to watch The King soon. What I liked about them was the mix of:\n\t\u2022\tSerious, weighty tone (less stylized, more grounded)\n\t\u2022\tPolitical intrigue and personal drama\n\t\u2022\tBattles that feel gritty and real, not comic-booky\n\nI\u2019ve seen 300, which was entertaining but a little too over-the-top (although the fight choreography is what really made it worth the watch for me). I\u2019m more into the historical/character-driven side of things. I\u2019ve also enjoyed Game of Thrones for the politics and grounded parts (less so the fantasy elements).\n\nWhat are some other movies or shows in that vein \u2014 ancient world, medieval, or samurai settings \u2014 that balance political intrigue with realistic warfare?",
