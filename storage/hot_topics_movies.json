        "content": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI\u2019m Eli Craig. I\u2019m the director and co-writer of CLOWN IN A CORNFIELD which will be in theaters May 9! The film is based on the Bram Stoker Award-Winning Novel of the same name by Adam Cesare.\n\nI also wrote and directed the horror-comedy cult classic TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL, LITTLE EVIL starring Adam Scott and Evangeline Lilly and the award-winning comedy short THE TAO OF PONG. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I'll be back tomorrow Friday, May 9, at 7 PM ET for answers.\n\nMORE ABOUT CLOWN IN A CORNFIELD\n\nIn CLOWN IN A CORNFIELD, Quinn (Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams) have just moved to the quiet town of Kettle Springs hoping for a fresh start. Instead, she discovers a fractured community that has fallen on hard times after the treasured Baypen Corn Syrup Factory burned down. As the locals bicker amongst themselves and tensions boil over, a sinister, grinning figure emerges from the cornfields to cleanse the town of its burdens, one bloody victim at a time. Welcome to Kettle Springs. The real fun starts when Frendo the clown comes out to play.\n\nThe film stars Katie Douglas (\u201cGinny &amp; Georgia\u201d), Kevin Durand (Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), Aaron Abrams (\u201cBlindspot) and Will Sasso (The Three Stooges).\n\nCheck out the trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww5V8BPpj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww5V8BPpj8)\n\nFollow the Film u/clown_in_a_cornfield\n\nTalk to you all later!

        "content": "Blackhat was a flop back in 2015 and is seen by many as one of Mann\u2019s worst films. I enjoyed it at the time but would definitely agree it\u2019s towards the bottom of Mann\u2019s filmography, but I will also concede that I like everything he\u2019s made, even Public Enemies. Blackhat always felt disjointed and one reason I thought this was the opening of the movie with the nuclear power plant being hacked and then the return to it halfway through the film. It always felt that it was split up, mainly due to the sky. It looked like it was supposed to be the same night instead of days/weeks later.\n\nI finally got the chance to watch the directors cut due to the physical release by Arrow and I would highly recommend any Mann fans or fans of action thrillers to check it out. The nuclear power plant opening is moved to the correct place in the movie and helps the movie to not feel as disjointed. The new opening, the hack of the CME and selling of soy futures helps the movie by not making the stakes seem high as immediately as before. \n\nI don\u2019t see a lot of discussion about this movie and I wish that would change. The main group is comprised of interesting characters, the action scenes are quick, ruthless, and bloody, and the cinematography is beautiful. In other words, it\u2019s a Michael Mann movie.",
