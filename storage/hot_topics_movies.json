        "content": "Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.\n\n\nI mean, I've seen lots of violent movies (including all the Saw films) but somehow there's scenes like this that really hit hard and I'm not sure why. Wondering if anyone else has anything similar.",

        "content": "I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn\u2019t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nHoly hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.\n\nOne of his killings (and you\u2019ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I\u2019ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).\n\nThe production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.\n\nIf you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven\u2019t seen it in years. Check it out. I\u2019m interested i hearing what others think.",

        "content": "Hello! I'm gonna try to make this quick and express myself as clearly as possible. How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?\n\nFor example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.\n\nWhat is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.\n\nEdit: obviously \"give *me* the vocabulary,\" I typed out the title too fast",

And most have had a lasting impact in cinema and stood the test of time. \n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of big titles that made a lot of money, but it has me wondering what will stay relevant years from now, movies that we show our kids and future generations will still love.

Over time, the family notices jars of honey to be missing or have eaten crackers. The brother eventually follows the trail and goes up, I think a freight elevator up to the attic. Surprisingly, the attic was a makeshift lab to previous owner with books of study and butterflies pinned to the walls. The brother who has a looking glass kind of item finds out that the person who was eating all the honey and crackers was a small little person barely any bigger than a rat who has anger issues. The entity was the roommate/pet to the previous owner and had a huge secret or something and so put up a protective ward (the circle of rocks) to prevent a troll king or something. That is all that i can remember. Please tell me the name if someone knows. ",

        "content": "Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, \"But where's his brother?\", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.\n\n- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.\n\n- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. \"Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic.\" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of \"There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!\" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.\n\n- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (\"I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box\"). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the \"real\" prestige.\n\nGreat fucking movie. Any other things you have picked up on after the 12th time through or so?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nJust a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "I just watched Pleasantville and I was blown away. The acting, editing, and cinematography were fantastic. The storyline was truly original, as I can\u2019t think of many films (if any) like it.  It almost felt like watching Truman Show for the first time, which was a huge success at the box office and talked about often. I also felt like the message was so relatable, no matter your age. \n\n\nSo my question is this, why isn\u2019t this film popular? At first glance, it appears it should have been a hit. I\u2019m not saying you should necessarily compare it to the greatest dramas of all time, but it definitely deserves more recognition than it received. \n\nWhat am I missing? Why was this film a box office bomb? ",

Normally have conversation afterwards and rate the movie, the following week, the previous week\u2019s winner sits out of the spin and it\u2019s only 2 choices, the 3rd gets their pick on the 3rd week. It\u2019s been great and it\u2019s something we look forward to, my 13 year old has had some interesting choices. Anywho, just a suggestion to all the families of movie lovers.",

He\u2019s a hell of a dancer, and has a great voice during this scene.\n\nI recently learned that there was a lot of footage cut from this film that\u2019s not even in the extended cut.
