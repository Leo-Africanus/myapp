I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.\n\nDuring this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Ant-Man,\" and \"Prisoners,\" I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn't alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.\n\nFor an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like \"The Suicide Squad,\" \"Dune,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" or \"Late Night with the Devil,\" I just think about how deserved it is. I'm so happy he has had continued success. It is deserved!",

        "content": "I have brought this up before but always find it fascinating when a director/creator can bring out multiple films in a single year. It\u2019s something really special when they are true classics.\n\nMy favorite example is Spielberg in 1993 with Jurassic Park and Schindler\u2019s List. Apparently the wild differences between the two process nearly drove him crazy. There are stories of George Lucas needing to oversee (at least some of) the visual effects after a certain point, Robin Williams calling Spielberg just to cheer him up and so on.\n\nBut the man delivered two *pillars* of filmmaking in a very short span. I know it\u2019s happened other times and would love to hear everyone weigh in!\n\nEdit: Love these responses and am getting schooled on some great films!\n\nTo clarify I did mean separate productions and not filming and releasing sequels super close together. Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Matrix 2 and 3, Hunger Games and probably a few others are a topic for a different discussion IMHO.",

        "content": "My local independent theater was having a Kubrick series every Thursday for several weeks. The movie wouldn\u2019t start til 11p or 12a a lot of times, and then afterwards a guy who knew EVERYTHING about every Kubrick movie would talk. He was pretty awesome. \n\nWell\u2026this night we were watching *2001*. It started around 11:30p, went through the entire watch time, took a small break, and then had an hour discussion. So by the end it was after 3:30a. \n\nFinally we all went to leave and\u2026it had snowed probably 14 inches out of nowhere since we got inside. Nobody was going anywhere, as the plows couldn\u2019t keep up. \n\nSo we just all went back inside and watched it again, and talked through it this time. It was fun. Kickin it with 100 strangers and drinking hot chocolate while watching and discussing Kubrick til the sun came up. It was a cool experience.",

There's no music, just the conversation, and you're screaming internally for him to just get the hell out of that house.\n\nAnother one is the coin toss scene in No Country for Old Men.\n\nWhat are some other examples of scenes that had you holding your breath",
