        "content": "[translated from Yle news:](https://yle.fi/a/74-20127817)\n\nThe story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.\n\nThe Russians gave H\u00e4yh\u00e4 the name \"White Death\" \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nAccording to his personal notebook, H\u00e4yh\u00e4 killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.\n\nThe movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.\n\nH\u00e4yh\u00e4 was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.\n\nDue to his injuries, H\u00e4yh\u00e4 was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.\n\nSimo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 was born in 1905 in Rautj\u00e4rvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.\n\nThe film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about H\u00e4yh\u00e4.\n\n[more news details](https://www.screendaily.com/news/finnish-film-h%C3%A4yh%C3%A4-about-the-white-death-sniper-in-the-works-exclusive/5199577.article)",

        "title": "I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ",
        "content": "I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. \n\n1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren\u2019t even IN other movies. \n\n2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. \n\n3: If your movie isn\u2019t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. \n\nCouple of facts: \n\nFirst movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube\n\nLast movie: Planes trains and automobiles. \n\nBest movie: American Fiction \n\nWorst Movie: The Creeps.  \n\nMovies I watched that I had seen before: 16\n\nMost movies watched in a single day: 5\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a long year and I\u2019ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. \n\nEdit: sexually lol \n\nAs requested Top 10: \n\n1: American Fiction\n\n2: biosphere \n\n3: They Cloned Tyrone \n\n4: 1917\n\n5: Maxxxine \n\n6: the Blackening\n\n7: the vast of night \n\n8: The green knight \n\n9: bottoms \n\n10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)\n\n\nEdit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? \n\nThere are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). \n\nSo allow me to clarify what in reverse:\n\n3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don\u2019t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the \u201cmovies should be as long as they need to tell the story\u201d people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn\u2019t be a need for an editor nor \u201cdirectors cuts.\u201d Some stories don\u2019t need the time and some stories need more. \n\n2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don\u2019t ever really see it on the screen.  \n\n1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see \u201cJustin Long\u201d is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn\u2019t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. \n\nIf I learned anything real, it\u2019s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it\u2019s fun, then it didn\u2019t waste my time. \n\nGlad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  \n\nGlad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go watch \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful knife\u201d now. \n\n\n\n",

Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse\u2019s story. \n\nThe Simpson\u2019s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn\u2019t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it. I also much preferred the animation style it had than what the series turned into a couple years later. ",

        "content": "The scariest movie I\u2019ve ever seen is Insidious. It wasn\u2019t just the jump scares\u2014it was the feeling of constant dread. The idea of spirits invading a home, especially the Lipstick-Face Demon, stuck with me. The scenes in \u201cThe Further\u201d were so creepy, like stepping into a nightmare you can\u2019t escape. Even the silence in the movie felt tense, and the music made everything worse. What made it scarier was how real it felt\u2014like this could happen to anyone. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it afterward, and for days, I kept feeling like something was watching me from the shadows.\n\n",

In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria\n\n1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified\n2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)\n\nIf we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy\n\nEdit: Link updated so everyone can view my apologies\n\nEdit 2: [https://letterboxd.com/OgarTheDed/](https://letterboxd.com/OgarTheDed/) Adding my Letterboxed so people can track my progress and I will be creating a weekly/ bi-weekly update post (IMPORTANT: there will be very little if any progress until after December 16th due to IRL schedule freeing up then)",

Why was he never Hollywoods Big name for solo movies? I always thought of him as super talented but seems he never got his stand alone big time movies. he always played a great role but never got the shine as Hollywoods next big thing. (Feel free to downvote if I\u2019m being stupid but I\u2019m genuinely curious to see what you guys think). ",

Then there\u2019s young Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, who exuded such elegance and beauty that it felt almost otherworldly. Those characters and performances left a lasting impression on me and probably defined my early movie crushes. What about you?",
