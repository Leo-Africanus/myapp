I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 10th.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K.

        "content": "Considering that it was based on some silly SNL sketches, you'd think this movie would have been a long SNL skit. But no, this movie had heart and amazing set design. The costumes were great, and any scene involving the Coneheads' house were packed with details. This wasn't some low effort spin off, the production team put effort into the movie and the dialog. There are so many little gags, from Jason Alexander's toupee to Beldar's weird naked body, it's a movie you can watch multiple times and appreciate something new. And nowadays, it's fun to see all the cameos from a very successful SNL cast at the time. Dan Aykroyd holds nothing back. And when they arrive at Remulak, scene of them flying into the atmosphere still looks good today (unlike most movies today using lazy CGI).\n\nI still don't know why it was panned at the time. I know critics hate comedies, since comedy is much harder to pull off than drama, but the movie is much more than its contemporary reputation.",

Fucking Sharks. He really said we need great white sharks in the Colosseum! I have never jumped back into reality so fast.!&lt;\n\nMe and my husband paused the movie because we just had to take the time to digest what we were watching. We even tried to Mythbuster this to see if it's even plausible and all we could come up with was &gt;!that someone had to raise baby great white sharks. But everyone knows great whites don't survive in captivity. Was ancient Rome even capable of building a tank big enough to support multiple sharks. what about one shark? And if they weren't in captivity then fishermen caught them? and then transported them to the Colosseum? Nah. Not to mention, the next day the arena was bone dry.!&lt;\n\nI really can't remember when a movie irked me this much. I am very for suspension of disbelief; I WANT to enjoy the story. But that was just too much for me. So what whacky scene took you right outta the movie.",

        "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" was the first film to ever win all 5 major academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. To this day it still remains one of only 3 total films to do so. And it surely does deserve that regard.\n\nAs a man who, like most other men, isn't exactly a big fan of the romance genre, and surely not rom-coms, this film is an instant all time favorite for me. I was honestly blown away by it as I was watching it, as cheesy as that may sound. I've seen a few romance movies myself, and while some are decent to good, none of them have ever stuck with me, and none of them have ever came close to being labeled an \"all time favorite\". This film takes everything I may dislike, or thought I would dislike about the romance genre and it does it perfectly. \n\nThe story was so damn compelling that even I was rooting for them to get together at the end, and was certainly affected by the emotional rollercoaster Frank Capra took us on. If you would have ever asked me if I would be invested in the romance and relationship of two film characters before this, the answer every single time would have been a solid no. This film managed to take that line of thought and completely throw it out of the window. \n\nThe acting from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert was simply amazing, and there's no secret as to why both of them managed to take home major awards on the night of the Oscars. To go along with that, the chemistry between them both when they were on screen together was unbelievable. The comedy may be hit-or-miss, but I'm more than willing to excuse that as you can't necessarily expect 1930's comedy to hold up well almost a century later. \n\nOverall, \"It Happened One Night\" is a masterfully written, directed, acted, and shot film that stands the test of time unbelievably well and it's influence has been evident a century later. This, for me, is truly the definition of \"genre-defining\" and will have me viewing romance films in a complete different light from now on. Truly a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets.",

        "title": "Anyone think \"Jingle all the Way\" with Arnold Schwarzeneggar feels like a Simpsons episode in live-action?",
        "content": "Just rewatched the movie and the whole thing reminded me of a live-action Simpsons episode. Swap Arnold for Homer Simpson looking for the favorite toy for Christmas at the last-minute and that's what it is. But also the humor/comedy of the movie felt exactly like Simpsons in the late 90's (when the movie came out).\n\n They have the santas singing only for Arnold to punch them all out, the neighbor is literally a more annoying version of Ned Flanders, you have Arnold rushing through the mall crashing into customers looking for toys getting beaten up by women calling him a pervert, you have the older police officer on the motorcycle who Arnold keeps crashing into and getting into trouble with, etc. Then you have Sinbad's role and everything else. It's just literally a live-action Simpsons episode.\n\n(also props to Jake Lloyd here for his movie role right before The Phantom Menace only 2 years later)",

Thought it was extremely strange in the best way possible with an interesting story, that had me asking myself how we even got here, and some really hysterical moments at times. \n\nThe one question I had is, what are the theories on what animal David turned the heartless women into. The narration mentioned he turned her into the worst possible animal and then John C. Reilly even mentioned he couldn't believe what he did to her. \n\nIm not sure if this has been said by any of the cast/crew but if not would love to hear what the best fan theories are. ",
