My new movie, PAYING FOR IT, a live-action feature film adaptation of cartoonist Chester Brown\u2019s best-selling graphic novel, opens in theaters: NYC 1/30, L.A. 2/3 &amp; more. AMA!\n\n**Official Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw)\n\n**More Information**: [https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it](https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it)\n\n**ABOUT PAYING FOR IT**\n\nSet in the late 90\u2019s, PAYING FOR IT follows the trials and travails of Chester (Dan Beirne), a cartoonist and Sonny (Emily L\u00ea), a TV host, who are in a long-term, committed, romantic relationship. When Sonny introduces the idea of opening up their relationship, Chester begins sleeping with sex workers, forcing him to face his issues with intimacy and romance in the process. Based on the best-selling graphic novel by acclaimed alternative-cartoonist Chester Brown, PAYING FOR IT is a \u201cprovocative, hilarious and heartfelt\u201d (The Globe and Mail) personal take on romance and relationships. From writer/director Sook-Yin Lee, the film \u201cdisplays a maturity and thoughtfulness (...) in the messy contradictions we may hold about love\u201d (RogerEbert.com).  Celebrating the vibrant underground comic and zine era through the experiences of cartoonist Brown, PAYING FOR IT connects the past with the present by bringing together emerging comic actors, performance artists, authors, activists and multimedia creators in front of and behind the camera, and it has resonated for festival audiences and critics alike.\n\n**ABOUT SOOK-YIN LEE**\n\nSook-Yin Lee (Writer, Director, Co-Producer) is a Toronto-based filmmaker, musician, actor and broadcaster (CBC, BBC, MuchMusic). She starred in Shortbus, the ground-breaking 2SLGBTQ movie directed by John Cameron Mitchell that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Her feature film writer and directorial debut, Year of the Carnivore, starring Cristin Milioti, premiered at TIFF. In 2014, Lee won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by a Lead Dramatic Actress in Jack and went on to write and perform Unsafe for Canadian Stage, which examined questions of censorship and artistic freedom. She won Best Director and Best Picture at the 2018 Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival for Octavio is Dead! --a ghost story starring Sarah Gadon and Rosanna Arquette. Death and Sickness, her feature movie made with Dylan Gamble, streams on CBC Gem. She acts in Darkest Miriam, executive produced by Charlie Kaufman, and is set to release her experimental comedy Rest and Relax. Sook-Yin is a music recording artist and film score composer. She contributed songs to Brandon Cronenberg's horror movies Infinity Pool and Antiviral.\n\nAsk me anything r/movies! I'll be back tomorrow, Thursday 1/29 at 3 PM ET, to answer your questions.\n\n",

        "content": "I\u2019m a massive Coen brothers fan so even I\u2019m surprised how long it took me to actually watch Burn After Reading. Unfortunately sandwiched between the cynically incredible No Country for Old Men and the Job like epic of A Serious Man, BAR is even by the Coens standards a bit odd. \n\nIt\u2019s also fucking hilarious \n\nThe story of a volatile low level CIA analyst who after being faced with a demotion due to a (not at all well hidden) drinking problem decides to quit and start writing his memoirs only to find his wife is divorcing him whilst she\u2019s having an affair with a paranoid Treasury department officer, only to THEN have his memoirs unintentionally stolen by two dimwitted gym employees who believe the disc it\u2019s on contains government secrets after sed wife decided to copy his financial records and the disc was accidentally left at sed gym, it\u2019s definitely a twisting narrative with a lot of important characters that play a role. \n\nBut what makes it hilarious is that, though in a conventional espionage this would make for a taut, tense, even dark thriller of multiple secretive players trying to double cross each other (not saying that doesn\u2019t happen here but still), in Burn After Reading it ultimately doesn\u2019t mean anything, literally. \n\nWhilst the macguffin of the CD containing the information is important to several of the characters for varying reasons, the key is that it actually isn\u2019t important to pretty much everyone else. Osborne (the analyst) is in fact so so low down the totem pole of the CIA that even the director of the organisation barely cares that the supposed \u201cclassified information\u201d is attempting to be sold to the Russian embassy (an extra joke is that Osborne was an analyst for the Balkan region so the Russians additionally wouldn\u2019t care even if it was meaningful).\n\nHowever because, with the possible exception of Osbornes wife who was only using it for divorce leverage, everyone else is placing high importance on the disk, namely, THEY think it\u2019s so valuable, it shows just how badly their own egos play against them. It leads to several somewhat unexpected deaths, multiple profanity laden tirades and a very curious chair. \n\nThe added elements of a tradition spy thriller score at points (pointedly when they\u2019re doing something insanely stupid) also helps to really sell the joke, because they\u2019re so much trying to fill the importance of this thing when really none exists. \n\nI think Burn After Reading is a great example of deflating humour really nailing it. Whilst the setups and the situations are themselves hilarious, what makes it funny is how high stakes and important the situation seemingly are to the central players, only to realise that no one else actually cares. It\u2019s the style of humour that the Coens have perfected and is well worth a watch.\n\nAlso Brad Pitt steals the show ",

I'm *not* asking about movies that have elements that are offensive by today's standards (like Revenge of the Nerds, Sixteen Candles, Blazing Saddles).  I am asking about movies that are simply hard to relate to for younger viewers because they were very specific to a particular time, place and/or cultural moment.",

        "content": "I just researched the movie Be Kind Rewind. None of its plot points make any sense at all. The actual plot is nonsense and it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny. \n\nHowever, the movie is still a great time because the characters and the atmosphere have a ton of heart. It's a feel-good story in a very local environment. The plot points don't seem to matter very much because you're caught up in the emotions. \n\nCan you think of other movies like that?",

        "content": "I must admit, despite being in my early 40s, I somehow missed seeing Fargo. Of course I\u2019ve heard about it and I\u2019m familiar with other Cohen brothers films, but seeing it for the first time made me absolutely slack-jawed at how ridiculously amazing this movie is.\n\nWhat struck me most was how odd the whole setting felt.\n\nI found myself a little depressed in a way because I find I can almost relate to Mr. Lunderguaard a little too much. The constant desire to put up a smiling disarming demeanor even when you are consumed by inadequacy. The depiction also works because he doesn\u2019t look like an obvious loser in terms of physical appearance and his 3 minute elevator first impression actually works until the whole facade just cracks under the weight of his nervous , faltering inadequacy.\n\nThen there\u2019s the two thugs who seem like half brained , yet largely small time crooks who turn out to be utter psychos. The whole car tag scene was just\u2026 how is Steve Buschemi going to talk his way out of this..\n\nI almost burst out laughing when he tries to get out of the parking garage with his face blown off and sees the parking attendant.\n\nAnd then of course, that lunch date with Mike\u2026 ugh it just brought memories of meeting a stranger and suddenly finding yourself trapped in a \u201cget me out of here before I kill myself\u201d awkward conversation. I\u2019ve unfortunately known plenty of women who have been in that situation.\n\nEven the protagonist- she\u2019s hard to relate to on a personal level which I suppose is the point. Painting her as a female Columbo would probably undermine the film. But the food choices just paint the Midwest in a totally unflattering light.\n\nAnd in that way, it\u2019s such an amazing film given I can\u2019t really find myself relating in a positive way to any of these character. I sadly will take away from this film that it\u2019s unhealthy to the point of depressing to keep smiling your way through relationships that are not healthy.",

        "content": "For example, movies tend to show people hiding behind almost any object being safe from gunfire, especially inside cars or behind tables. In reality, neither of those will protect you from most guns.\n\nAnother is that shooting petrol makes it explode.  Again, that's been shown to be pretty much impossible. \n\nI think my favourite is that if a bullet hits pretty much any metal object, it will be deflected by it.\n\nWhat are some others?",
