        "content": "Question, What are your thoughts on Deliverance?\n\nI just rewatched this film and the more I go back to this film, the more I think it's one of the best of the 1970s. Everything about this film is perfect, the pacing, the casting, and the directing. Everyone was on their A game in this.\n\nThe film is about 4 businessmen who ventured into the wilderness to canoe the Cahulawassee River before it is damned. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox all give great performances and I feel Ned Beatty gave the gutsiest performance and should have been nominated for an Oscar. However, I feel Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward steal the show as The Mountain Men, who, thought in 1 (or in Coward's case, 2 scenes), they really portrayed some sick SOB's who decided to have \"fun\" when they caught Jon Voight &amp; Ned Beatty's character.\n\nOne thing that interested me is that although Burt Reynolds broke out with Deliverance and is a main character, it's really Jon Voight who is the main protagonist and the one who has to saved to group and get them to safety after Burt's character become incapacitated.\n\nAnother thing about Deliverance that I like is the feeling of something is wrong and the feeling that the 4 are being watched. I will say, all 4 where really out of their element and that they had no idea what they were getting out. I also like the ambiguity and the uncertainty that is present throughout the film.\n\nOverall, I do love Deliverance and I think it is one of the best films of the 1970s. I also think it is a shame that Burt rarely did a film like Deliverance again until I think the 1990s (Look, I like Burt Reynolds and his films but Deliverance was something else)\n\nSo, What are your thoughts on Deliverance?",

So the wedding and border crossing, everything happened after Susan was rescued? So, after the police caught Amelia, they say \"We located the father in Morocco. He was very angry\". Why was he in Morocco again after Susan has been rescued?\nThis is bugging me.",

        "content": "Great movie, good story, and visually appealing. And there's something about how it was shot that gave it a much grittier and realistic feel than today's movies. \n\nWatching the movie, I couldn't help but think EotS was the proto-Schindler's List (1993) or at least the PG version. Same director, same genre, similar setting. Almost like EotS was the warm-up for SL. \n\nI can't think of such a star-studded cast that yielded such a great movie. Usually movies dripping with movie stars are not great. It must've helped that the actors weren't necessarily stars yet. \n\nChristian Bale, John Malkovich, Ben Stiller, Joe Pantoliano,  Nigel Havers, Miranda Richardson,  Leslie Philips, Masato Ibu  and directed by Steven Spielberg.  What?!\n\nWould recommend (8/10). \n\n\nEdit: added actors to list. \n",
