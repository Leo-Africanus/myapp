        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "I have a few:\n\n\\- WALL-E. Don't ask me why, but when I was a little kid I HATED this movie. It made me so sad. Now I think it's a masterpiece and it's probably my favorite Pixar movie.\n\n\\- Titanic. I used to internalize that romance sucked as a genre and I didn't like this movie at first, but it has really grown on me since.\n\n\\- The Star Wars Prequels. As a kid, I absorbed my parents' hatred of them, but over time they became a sort of guilty pleasure.\n\nEDIT: Another one I forgot to mention is This Is Spinal Tap. First watched it as a kid and a lot of the humor went over my head. Rewatched it recently as an adult and thought it was great.",
