        "content": "I finally watched TENET, and I'm blown away how one of my favorite directors could make such a poor film.\n\nWhen TENET first came out, I missed in in theaters, but tried to watch it at home. I lasted maybe 30 minutes, but was so confused and bored, I stopped watching it.\n\nI finally decided to watch it in full, properly, thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right headspace at the time.\n\nAnd for those that might say the film would have been better if it was experienced in IMAX or theatres, I did watch it on a fairly decent setup. 4K Bluray/UB820, LG G5 Oled + Q990D. I fully appreciate the theater experience, but I don't think it would in any way change my feelings.\n\nAnd after 2.5 hours, I think it's the worst film Nolan has ever made, a director who's films I've generally loved.\n\nInterstellar is one of my favorite films of all time, and I've loved his other films like Memento, Dunkirk, Inception, Batman Trilogy, Oppenheimer, etc... Almost without fail, his films have been complex spectacle with fantastic writing and an emotional core that carried the films.\n\nTENET was none of those things, IMO.\n\nTENET is far too complex for it's own good, and even after fully understanding the different flows of time the characters are going through, it's just a bad story. It's complexity for the sake of complexity, without serving the actual story.\n\nThere are precisely 0 characters you care about, there is no emotional core to the film, at all. The final \"idea\" of the film that Neil and the Protag had this great friendship in two different directions was cool, but it was never earned.\n\nI thought John David Washington's performance was pretty awful, he has the charisma of a wet paper bag, and the writing of the film does him no favors. I've liked him in other roles, so I would put more of this on the writing than him to some degree. The writing in general for all the dialog was AWFUL. People talk like CHAT GPT robots, in unnatural ways.\n\nI at least thought the action spectacle would be worth the price of admission, but I thought it was pretty disjointed and unemployable to watch. The fights where people going forward through time were fighting people going backwards just looked disjointed, and unappealing to watch.\n\nSome of the music was kind of cool, but it felt more like soundscapes than a true OST.\n\nOverall, the entire film felt more like an \"idea\" than an actual film, it was insanely disappointing.",

        "content": "I know I\u2019m very late to the party, but I\u2019ve just finished Octopus Teacher. I remember it being a big deal forever ago, and it\u2019s one of those films I\u2019ve been meaning to get to. I really liked the idea of him befriending the octopus and documenting it. Nature films almost always have a hands-off approach, which makes sense when you\u2019re just trying to capture their life. However, seeing an approach focused on interspecies relationships with a wild creature is quite unique. His daily visits, the curiosity, the way he interacted with her over time it felt like a genuine study of the relationship between a human and an octopus. Watching how she responded, how her behavior changed with his presence, all of that was fascinating, and I think framing it as a relationship makes total sense. That\u2019s what the film really captures well, the give and take, the trust, the exploration of interspecies connection, even calling her his teacher.\n\nBut at the same time, I found it really conflicting. Once you\u2019re part of her world, once she\u2019s used to your presence, you\u2019re already influencing her. So when he refuses to intervene against predators, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s not just philosophy or respect for nature.. it\u2019s ignoring the consequences of your own presence, and I\u2019d argue it\u2019s actually a huge missed opportunity to observe how the relationship changes, if at all, after saving her. From both a human and a scientific perspective, saving her would make sense: it would show how she responds to care, trust, and protection. Not doing it while acting like he admires her comes across as disingenuous, even if she ultimately gets away. It\u2019s an interspecies relationship that\u2019s being studied. A very human response is to protect her\u2026 Just do your part and be a human during these interactions. No human would let that happen to their friend. I get non-intervention when it\u2019s the end of her life, like after laying eggs, but the middle sections felt inconsistent, and that\u2019s what kept bothering me. I also understand the approach to never intervene when OBSERVING nature but that\u2019s not what he is doing. ",

I was wrong. It was a fun movie and I was highly entertained. But something stood out: it has an Amazingly curated soundtrack. Every song that I wanted to be played I heard and there were even some places where the movie exceeded in that\u2026picking songs that were better than what I would have hoped. \n\nLikewise, James Gunn\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack slaps. The Blues Brothers is up there, but I don\u2019t know if that counts in this context. Armageddon is great, the movie is mid but is it a movie soundtrack or for the most part an Aerosmith album, City of Angels is up there as well for me as well.\n\nBut to you all, what movies are GOOD\u2026but the soundtrack is better than the movie itself? \n\nEdit: Baby Driver\u2026how could I forget Baby Driver.

        "content": "Not a movie you liked more on rewatch, but one that suddenly made sense in a different way. Something that hit harder because of age, loss, work, marriage, failure, or just time.\n\nFor me it was Lost in Translation.\n\nI watched it younger and thought nothing really happened. Years later it hit completely different. Feeling disconnected, stuck in routine, surrounded by people but still lonely. The quiet moments made sense. The looks, the pauses, the things not said. It was not about romance anymore. It was about timing, distance, and how some connections only exist for a moment in your life.\n\nCurious what movie changed meaning for you. Thank you.",

        "title": "How did Taylor Sheridan go from writing heartbreaking, thoughtful, and poignant films to writing disposable, propagandistic, soap operas?",
        "content": "My first exposure to Taylor Sheridan was 2015's \\*Sicario\\*. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, \\*Sicario\\* is a bleak story about the ultimate collapse of jurisdiction, legality, and morality around the War on Drugs as national elements and interests slowly degrade into pure power politics. It has been called the \\*Apocalypse Now\\* of the War on Drugs, and while I don't think \\*Sicario\\* is quite a film of that caliber I do think the comparison stands as legitimate.\n\nThe year after \\*Sicario\\* was released, 2016, saw the release of a crime tragedy set in West Texas titled \\*Hell or High Water\\*, directed by David Mackenzie. \\*Hell or High Water\\* is a great films, as all of the performances, settings, and dialogue create a sincere and disturbing look at rural poverty in America. The film, ostensibly a heist film, features characters fully formed from the land which reared them. The cars they drive, the way they talk, and clothes they wear all appear to the audience as sincere to the setting and theme.  The climactic refrain of the film is poignant, \"I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation. But not my boys, not anymore.\"\n\nAnd the year after that we have 2017's \\*Wind River\\*, directed by Sheridan himself. I have mixed feelings about this film. It tackles the topic, that of the murder of Indigenous women on western reservations, with the appropriate weight and despair. At times it \\*almost\\* rises to the level of Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry in terms of the grandiosity and profound sorrow in the western cannon. It is a film which is so tense at times it almost feels like your back is about to shatter from the strain. The climactic standoff absolutely deserves it's place in film history. And it features an incredible, but brief, performance by Gil Birmingham as a father who almost seems to be transforming into a being of pure grief. However, \\*Wind River\\* also features Jeremy Renner as a white guy who seems to really believe that he is just as native as the Native Americans he lives with, and while Elizabeth Olsen turns in a good performance as the representative of an uncaring federal government, she plays a far more central role in the plot that the great Graham Greene, whose portrayal of an indigenous police chief is commanding of respect.\n\nBy 2018 Sheridan had three critically acclaimed films under his belt, with one as director and one being nominated for Best Picture. Then he writes the superfluous sequel to \\*Sicario\\* titled \\*Sicario: Day of the Soldado\\*, which failed to make any real impact at all. Importantly, however, \\*Sicario 2\\* reduces the immorality and cynicism from the CIA characters and seemingly is more approving of the institutions he criticized in his own previous screenplay. All in all, a strange and disappointing follow up.\n\nAnd then \\*Yellowstone\\* happens, which launches Sheridan into the stratosphere in terms of fame and income. I hate \\*Yellowstone\\*. I hate how its understanding of the west is seemingly entirely based in the Texan hatred of public land and land conservation. I hate how the show's understanding of the rural working class and ranching is almost entirely seen as violent, confrontational, and libertarian. I hate the militarism of the show . But I think what I hate most is how a man who once wrote a heartbreaking film about rural poverty wasted the opportunity to offer any meaningful examination of life in the rapidly gentrifying American West, and instead became the primary advertiser for that gentrification.\n\nAnd then the rest is history. He's now writing disposable show after disposable show about the virtues of the American military establishment, as well as about the virtues of the oil industry decimating the rural farmland he was once such a mourner of. In \\*Wind River\\* oil rig workers were the racist, murdering, rapists, in \\*Landman\\* they're heroes holding up the American way of life.\n\nBut I know the answer already. It's money. Soap Operas aimed at suburban conservatives sell very well, and \\*Yellowstone\\* is the apotheosis of that genre.",
