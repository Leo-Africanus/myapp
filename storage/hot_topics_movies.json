        "content": "Just finished The Prestige and damn my brain is spinning. I went in thinking it\u2019s just two rival magicians trying to outsmart each other. But nah, this movie is way twisty..  \n\n\nThe biggest shock for me was Borden being two people. Alfred and Fallon were twins the whole time, living one life as one man. That\u2019s why sometimes he is loving and sometimes cold. Sometimes he cares for his wife and sometimes he feels like a stranger. They literally destroyed their personal lives just to protect one magic trick. That\u2019s crazy dedication.\nThen Angier\u2026 this part really messed me up. I thought he finally used a double. But no, Tesla\u2019s machine was real. It was cloning him. Every single show, one Angier survives and the other one dies in the tank. He never even knows if he will be the man who lives or the man who drowns. He keeps killing himself again and again just to win. That is straight up disturbing.\n\nThen I realized the opening murder wasn\u2019t even normal murder. Angier planned his own death to frame Borden. He sacrificed himself just to destroy his enemy. That\u2019s how deep his obsession went.\nThe ending hurt. One Angier is drowning in the tank and the other is bleeding on the floor. No winners at all. Just two broken men who ruined their lives for obsession.",

But why, in nearly 40 years, has nearly no studio greenlit something similar? Is it because Cool World bombed colossally? Literally the only examples I can think of after that are Looney Tunes: Back in Action, and the upcoming Coyote vs. Acme. (Space Jam doesn't really count in this way, it only has two scenes that blend 2D characters into a 3D world) I mean, sure, theatrical hand-drawn animation in the West is on life support, but  Coyote vs Acme had to be dragged out the doldrums to even be released!",

        "content": "A rule of thumb for playwrights is that any significant story element introduced early in the play should have some sort of payoff before the play ends. If you introduce a gun in act one of a three act play, it better go off in act three or it was an extraneous detail that should be excised from the script. The same rule is often applied to movies as well.\n\nMy question is what examples of an anti-Chekhov gun are there: not just a plot device that has no payoff but a plot device that is introduced and subsequently works in a way antithetical to the way the movie explains. Basically how many movies lie to the audience.\n\nTwo examples come to mind: in Jurassic Park, it's shown early on that the t-rexes are so massive that their footsteps can be heard from far away and shake the ground but later in the climax, a T-Rex seemingly appears out of nowhere with no warning. In Ant Man, it's explained that items that are shrunk down maintain their mass, that's why a punch from a microscopic Ant Man packs the punch of a full grown adult yet we see later in the movie that Hank Pym is carrying around a shrunk down tank that should way thousands of pounds on a keychain.",

So, these are my go-to's but what else should be on the list?\n\nThe Shining\n\nAmityville Horror\n\nRosemary's Baby\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nCarrie\n\nStepford Wives original\n\n\u200b\u200bThat 70s movie about that lady named Sally with the little weird creatures that escaped from the furnace. That was wild.\n\n\u200b\u200bScary Movie 2 is a comedy but I'll put it on the list anyway\n\n\u200b\u200bI haven't watched Scream in so long that I don't really remember if I was scared at all when I saw that.\n\n\u200b\u200bI don't care for gruesome gore. Back in the day a group of guys invited me to go watch Saw with them and I went having no backstory on the movie.\n\n\u200b\u200bI walked out of the theater after the first scene.\n\n\u200b\u200bWhat other haunting movies should be on my list? What have you watched and enjoyed? Thanks in advance.",

        "content": "A safari guide (Cornel Wilde) cautions the hunting party he is leading to respect the African natives they encounter. Instead of heeding this advice, one of the party actively insults the tribe, which captures and kills the entire group. Only the guide is spared. But he is stripped of his clothing, and given a head start before the warriors give chase. Using his knowledge of the land and resourcefulness, the guide must make his way back to the closest British fort. I liked the film it\u2019s very intense but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a favorite of mine, there are scenes where animals are being hunted but the film is very well shot in the African landscape. Cornel Wilde not only stars in the film but he also co produced and directed the film. The film\u2019s language is 95% Afrikaans and 1% English but you watch the film for the intensity. The film is crazy how they got away with some of the scenes back in 1965. ",

I have seen many times that an actor is also listed as a Producer for a movie that he/she stars in.\n\nAre co-producer and producer different or the same jobs?\n\nWhat does an executive producer mean?\n\nFor example, if Disney made a certain movie then why does individual names are attached to that movies as producers? Isn't it the company who made that movie? Isn't it the studio who made it?\n\nIs being a producer on a movie different from being one on a TV Show?\n",
