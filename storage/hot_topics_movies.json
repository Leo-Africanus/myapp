        "content": "Hi\u00a0[r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/)\u2013 We\u2019re directors Isaac Gale and Ryan Olson, and our documentary SWAMP DOGG GETS HIS POOL PAINTED is now playing in theaters from Magnolia Pictures. Jerry \"Swamp Dogg\" Williams has made a huge impact on popular music, and we got to follow him around as he writes and creates with some friends, like Jenny Lewis, John Prine, Mike Judge, Johnny Knoxville and Tom Kenny. After premiering at SXSW in 2024 the film had a great festival run, and is now playing and expanding in theaters nationwide. The two of us are based in Minneapolis, and we also make music as Marijuana Deathsquads, and produced the score to this film. More information on the film below:\n\nSWAMP DOGG GETS HIS POOL PAINTED is a wildly entertaining and fittingly unconventional documentary about convention-defying singer, songwriter and record producer Jerry Williams, aka Swamp Dogg, one of the great cult figures of 20th-century American music whose singular voice and ideas have shaped the history not merely of soul music, but of country, hip-hop and a dozen other genres. In the film, the titular artist and his \u201cbachelor pad of aging musicians\u201d, including the charming Guitar Shorty and lovably quirky Moogstar, navigate the tumultuous music industry, transform their home into an artistic playground and invite fellow musicians like Jenny Lewis and John Prine and superfans Mike Judge, Johnny Knoxville and Tom Kenny to play in their unique musical sandbox\u2026and paint Swamp Dogg\u2019s pool. Bursting with infectious personality and stoner energy, SWAMP DOGG GETS HIS POOL PAINTED is a music documentary unlike any other.\n\nOfficial Trailer:\n\n[https://youtu.be/p6DxeQc1D9A?si=E8aChVbEZeWQD2vC](https://youtu.be/p6DxeQc1D9A?si=E8aChVbEZeWQD2vC)\n\nGet tickets for the film:\n\n[https://www.magpictures.com/swampdogg/screenings/](https://www.magpictures.com/swampdogg/screenings/)\n\nWe'll be back at 4 PM ET today (Thursday 5/15) to answer questions.

It\u2019s certainly *an* end, wrapping up seven films\u2019 worth of storylines with a showman\u2019s flourish. What it doesn\u2019t do, though, is rule out another. As Cruise breezes into his mid-60s, it\u2019s hard to imagine him pulling off anything like the high-wire act he achieves here. But the door is still open, and the challenge is there, should anyone else choose to accept it.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-1236396671/) (80):\n\n&gt;It's the most enveloping \"M:I\" film since \"Ghost Protocol,\" because something's at stake.

He\u2019s cinema as the madman dreamer\u2019s paradise.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-1235122988/) (50):\n\n&gt;\u201cWe make our own destiny,\u201d someone intones during the film\u2019s closing voiceover, and by the end of Ethan Hunt\u2019s story, it\u2019s hard not to take those words to heart. I only wish that Cruise and McQuarrie had managed to make a better one.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (75):\n\n&gt;If this is the end of the 'Mission: Impossible' movies, they ended on an adequate note.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise) (6/10):\n\n&gt;While its action is reliably thrilling and a few of its most exciting sequences are sure to hold up through the years, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning tries to deal with no less than the end of every living thing on the planet \u2013 and suffers because of it. The somber tone and melodramatic dialogue miss the mark of what\u2019s made this franchise so much fun for 30 years, but the door is left open for more impossible missions and the hope that this self-serious reckoning isn\u2019t actually final.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/14/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise-wildly-entertaining-adventure) (5/5):\n\n&gt;It is a wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films in the M:I canon - but we still get a brand new, box-fresh Tom-sprinting-along-the-street scene, without which it wouldn\u2019t be M:I. Moreover, this eighth film gives us a terrific new character, US sub commander Capt Bledsoe, played with suavity and the tiniest hint of camp by Tramell Tillman (from TV\u2019s Severance) who has the chops for M:I9 whenever that happens.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;The Final Reckoning is stuffed, convoluted, and ludicrous at times. But it\u2019s also mostly a great send-off to this universe, a deserved celebration for everything this series has accomplished, and one final (again, seemingly) showcase for Cruise as one of the greatest action stars of all time.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1859165/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;And yet, The Final Reckoning is too messy, too awkward, too clumsy. It somehow feels overlong and inert even as it never slows down.\n\n[Screendaily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-spy-franchise-wraps-a-self-regarding-double-bill/5204859.article) (70):\n\n&gt;The press notes get the tone of the film best: \u201dIt is impossible to overstate how seismically significant the filmmaking partnership between Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie has been on the direction the *Mission: Impossible* franchise has taken since they first joined forces on it,\u201d they intone. \u201cOr how uniquely potent it is.\u201d *Mission Impossible - The Final Reckoning*, the second instalment in a globally-shot, monumental multi-year concurrent film-making effort which should be lauded for its ambition, knows what popcorn cinema escapism is all about. But, like the perennially defiant Hunt, it sometimes over-estimates its own powers.\n\nDirected by Christopher McQuarrie:\n\n&gt;Ethan Hunt and the IMF team continue their search for the terrifying AI known as the Entity \u2014 which has infiltrated intelligence networks all over the globe \u2014 with the world\u2019s governments and a mysterious ghost from Ethan\u2019s past on their trail. Joined by new allies and armed with the means to shut the Entity down for good, Hunt is in a race against time to prevent the world as we know it from changing forever.\n\nCast:\n\n* Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt\n* Hayley Atwell as Grace\n* Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell\n* Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn\n* Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge\n* Angela Bassett as Erika Sloane\n* Esai Morales as Gabriel\n* Pom Klementieff as Paris\n* Mariela Garriga as Marie\n* Pasha Lychnikoff as Captain Koltsov\n* Holt McCallany as Serling Bernstein\n* Janet McTeer as Walters\n* Nick Offerman as General Sidney\n* Hannah Waddingham as Admiral Neely\n* Shea Whigham as Jasper Briggs\n* Greg Tarzan Davis as Degas.\n* Charles Parnell as Richards\n* Rolf Saxon as William Donloe\n* Tommie Earl Jenkins as Colonel Burdick\n* Katy O'Brian as Kodiak\n* Mark Gatiss as Angstrom, Head of the NSA\n* Indira Varma as The Head of the DIA\n* Tramell Tillman as Captain Bledsoe\n* Lucy Tulugarjuk as Tapeesa",

        "content": "For me, there's no comeuppance that's equal to the one at the end of the two-part story in the French films \"Jean de Florette\" and \"Manon des Sources\". Roger Ebert described it as \"perfectly, even cruelly, suited to \\[the antagonist's\\] crime.\"\n\nPeople have commented that it's tragic, and that they end up feeling sorry for the villain. I am not one of those people. I took great joy in the punishment; couldn't have picked a more fitting one if I tried. The only thing that could have made it better is if they'd added a scene after the ending, after he's willed his property to the last family he has left. I'd add a scene where they reject his gift and sell the land off. To hell with his obsession with ancestry and land possession. Leave no trace of his legacy whatsoever, and his name disappear till it's only on his own tombstone.",

        "content": "I just don\u2019t get the point of the film. Are we supposed to pity Kidman\u2019s character? I was never rooting for her, and a lot of the time, I just felt sorry for her.\n\nDickson\u2019s character is such a piece of shit, and treats her terribly\u2026but is that the point? I never once felt like the two had any chemistry, or fondness for one another. The lengths her character went to, to seemingly attract Dickinson became so glaringly pathetic, that I had to look away. And again, he treats her like shit. Was that first sex scene between Dickinson and Kidman supposed to be \u201cerotic\u201d or \u201csexy\u201d? Because again, I just felt sorry for her. \n\nTowards the end, the film alludes to her character taking the bedroom techniques that she learned from Samuel, and incorporating them with her husband\u2026but it didn\u2019t feel like Kidman gave a shit about her husband. It felt like Banderas\u2019 character could\u2019ve divorced her, and she wouldn\u2019t have cared. In no way was I ever intrigued or invested in her marriage. \n\nThe film just felt like a series of vignettes, with no clear beginning, middle or end. It\u2019s one of those films, that when it ended, the first words out of my mouth were \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d.\n\nI just didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters. I didn\u2019t care about her marriage, career, affair, etc.\n\nI was talking with a close friend about the film. He made it clear that he felt the film was about female empowerment and sexual freedom\u2026and I couldn\u2019t disagree more. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m not thinking about it correctly. I don\u2019t know. I may watch it again. \n\nCan anyone change my mind? ",
