Is it because Clint Eastwood is cool?\n\nI actually found myself rooting for The Bad because he was an outside force.\n\nThe only good thing that Blondie did was show humanity to the dying soldier, The Bad similarly showed humanity to the guy he gave the alcohol to.

Shared on social media. Just _freely_ published in weather reporting data online.  \n\nSpending (presumably) tens of millions to know potentially minutes quicker is of absolutely no benefit. It's like hiring someone to let you know if your house has burned down, you'll already fucking know!  \n\n---  \n\n**Easy-fix**; change it so Marshall is funding StormPAR to predict where _future_ tornados are going to happen, allowing him to short companies with resources in the area (e.g. that oil refinery), or to buy up businesses _ahead_ of time, and slapping massive insurance policies on inflated associated assets. As soon as it becomes predictive (rather than reactive) it's an even better \"bad guy plot\" because it would mean they were potentially witholding that information from victims.",

        "content": "Just watched Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and loved it. I saw a lot of polarizing reviews of it on Reddit but honestly I really vibed with it. It's a revenge drama that goes out of its way to make the act of getting vengeance completely emotionally draining and traumatizing. Weaved into the narrative is a fair bit of important social commentary on rape culture and sexual assault.\n\nCarey Mulligan gives an absolutely fantastic performance, simultaneously funny, charming, badass, broken, traumatized and vulnerable. The casting in general is on-point, especially the movie's conscious decision to\u00a0use well-known \"good guys\" to play rapists and rape enablers.\u00a0\n\nThe climax of the movie is an absolute gut-punch and I can see why so many people hated it.\u00a0It takes some major balls to kill off your righteous, justice-seeking protagonist in such a brutal, agonizing manner, by the de-facto villain of the story of all people.\u00a0But it makes sense with the thematic intent of the movie, which is the old adage of digging 2 graves when seeking revenge. The actual ending of the movie does somewhat lessen the blow a little bit but it feels very much like a pyrrhic victory.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a well-made dark psychological drama.",

Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \"the Family\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into homicidal nocturnal albino mutants. The Family blame science and technology for their condition and they see Neville, as the last symbol of science, therefore he must die. Neville, uses everything at his disposal in an attempt to survive with the help of Dutch (Paul Kosolo) and Lisa (Rosalind Cash) who he meets which he know he\u2019s not alone. I really liked the film, Charlton Heston\u2019s performance is good and his character has very good chemistry with Rosalind Cash. While The Family are not vampires, they look like druids and they are allergic to the light. Anthony Zerbe as Jonathan as the leader of The Family who wants to kill Neville.

        "content": "I won't go too deep into this, but I do want to know if anyone agrees or has any opinions about it. Both films are fun and adventurous movies about romanticizing boyhood and the nostalgic \"boys will be boys\" era. I love that both movies share the same kind of comparable narrator and the characters embellish the stories they tell in a very old-school kid way. My main point is that these movies feel very similar yet very different and I find them to be one of the best double feature viewings to have every handful of years.",

I was surprised when a scene popped up that had Thomas Manning (Jeffrey Tambour\u2019s character) talking into a radio asking if they forgot about him in the crypt. \n\nI\u2019ve seen that movie a bunch of times and had no idea that was there! Any other movies like this?",

        "content": "Here's a couple for me:\n\nStar Wars: How people in the Original Trilogy seem to think the Jedi were just a myth, even though they existed for thousands of years prior, and weren't wiped out until 20 years before, meaning there would be plenty of people still alive who had interacted with them. I've heard people suggest the Empire did a 1984-esque campaign to make people forget, but I'm just not buying it. It would be like if some evil dictator wiped out all Hindus, and 20 years later most people thought Hindus never existed, even though there would undoubtedly be people who had Hindu friends and acquaintances still around.\n\nSigns: How water is like acid to the aliens. You know, water, that liquid that covers three quarters of the planet? Imagine if you were looking for a planet to settle on, and found one that was three quarters covered in sulfuric acid, ,where it frequently rains acid, and where the inhabitants are mostly made of sulfuric acid. Do you try to colonize that planet? ",

        "content": "I was watching Independence Day again on the 4th of July as one does, and decided after a decade maybe I was too hard on Resurgence and maybe I should try again.\n\nThe first bit of the movie before the aliens arrive I was like wow, this is a good movie, maybe I was just overly critical when I was younger; however, what the actual fuck is the second half of that movie?\n\nI have no problem with sci-fi world building, in fact it's one of my favorite things in fiction, but by god, none of it made sense in it's own continuity, when compared with the original film, or with just a basic understanding of science.\n\nFirst of all, why in the everloving fuck would they care about our molten core?  There is a near infinite amount of planets with a molten core and I'm gonna venture based on our current discovery of alien races most of them don't have sapient races.  Does that mean they specifically go after other races just to be dicks?  Makes no sense.\n\nBeyond that, I just have no words for the entire end and the queen fight.  Just what the fuck.  Also, the accountant who learns to fight aliens can go to hell too.  I just, can't even.",

        "title": "Recommendations for Robot Movies?",
        "content": "I've been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I'm halfway through the year now, and I'm loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.\n\nWith that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.\n\nSo I'm trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.\n\nRequirements:\n\n\u26aa The movie has to have a robot in it. It doesn't have to be a starring role. It can even just be one scene. But preferably, the robot would have some significance to the themes of the film.\n\n\u26aa A robot can be a lot of different things, but it needs to have some sense of humanity. Blade Runner counts. Transformers counts. Even Interstellar counts. Sonic the Hedgehog (with the little drone robots) doesn't count.\n\n\u26aa Short films and documentaries are a plus, to space out normal feature films.\n\n\u26aa Bad movies are awesome! Like I said, I'm watching Nic Cage movies this year. My tolerance for bad movies is pretty high.\n\n\u26aa It needs to have a Letterboxd entry. Sorry, that's just how I track my movie habits. If it's not on Letterboxd, I may still watch it, but it won't be part of this.\n\nSo, what do you recommend?",
