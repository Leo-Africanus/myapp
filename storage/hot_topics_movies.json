        "content": "Hey\u00a0[r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/)! We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.\n\nSynopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father\u2019s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.\n\nTrailer:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M)\n\nWatch on MUBI:\u00a0[https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024)\n\nAsk us anything!

        "content": "X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). \n\nIs there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? \n\nEdit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense \u2014 but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman\u2019s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don\u2019t discount it. ",

Idk if I've watched those more than Shark Boy and Lava Girl, though. I loved that movie as a kid and saw it so many times. My poor mother let me watch that movie three times in theaters.  She had to sit through it every time. Then it became one of those movies that you just see on TV and start watching again. Then I would rewatch it as an adult as just an amazing bad movie to laugh at. All in all, I've certainly seen it more than a dozen times. There were also all the movies we had on VHS and DVD, like the first Pokemon movie and Over the Hedge that I'm also sure I've seen a dozen times. If I had to guess though, I think Shark Boy and Lava Girl takes the crown, even though it's obviously not my favorite movie of all time today.",

Not a single frame is wasted.\n\nIt's quite remarkable how this movie is going this way till interval, and then going back post interval and packs so much story in between its never ending action. \n\nHardy &amp; Theron nail their part but Nicholas Hoult character win the movie for me. \n\nBefore this movie, I never expected a movie to be all action. You expect movies to set a plot, to set up characters, to set up story, MMFR does everything without slowing down, and that's art for me.\n\nIt's like a video game where you follow the main character. It's like a heavy metal song you love. It's like the best TV series payoff you wait to happen for years. It's legit perfect. \n\nFrom the ridiculous guitarist belting riffs Iron Maiden would be proud of to the pole swinging assassins, it's just a feast for all senses. \n\nAnd, dare I say, if you little high, there not exists a better adrenaline inducing movie.\n\nCheers.

The pacing is slow, the characters are shallow, and the plot feels like it is trying to be deep without actually saying anything.

It is supposed to be serious and emotional, but it was so cringe I actually laughed out loud. It felt like a bad parody, and then somehow Jeff survives anyway, which makes everything leading up to it completely pointless.!&lt;\n\n\n\n&gt;!The mountain does not mean anything, the visions go nowhere, and the entire journey adds up to absolutely nothing. They build up all this mystery for two hours and give you zero answers. It is just vague scenes, random symbolism, and a bunch of nonsense dressed up to seem important.!&lt;\n\n\n\nThe whole movie is a complete waste of time. It tries to look smart, but it is hollow from start to finish. In a year full of great films, Mountainhead stands out as a total failure.",

        "content": "Was recently rewatching The Lost World and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to see how they hold up. Both of these films are absolutely flawed, but I am happy to say I really enjoy them, especially Lost World. \n\nStill, both of these movies have some of the dumbest fucking scenes I\u2019ve ever seen that I genuinely don\u2019t know how they got out of the writers room. Kicking the raptor out the window, Nuking the fridge, swinging with Monkeys, the entire character of Mac in Crystal Skull, all of that was pretty bad. \n\nBut man, there is some genuinely brilliant filmmaking in both, some of my favorite scenes from Spielberg ever. Everything with the T-Rex\u2019s in Lost World is incredible. The Raptors long grass scene, all impeccably shot and tensely crafted filmmaking. Lost World is far and away the best Jurassic Park sequel. I really enjoy the San Diego 3rd act but it does absolutely feel very disconnected from the rest of the film. \n\nI love Crystal Skull\u2019s opening at Area 51, vintage Indiana Jones, as well as the chase at the University. Love the chemistry between Shia Laboeuf and Harrison Ford, as they have a very interesting dynamic. I honestly think this movie is mostly very enjoyable, but definitely has the weakest 3rd act in the series. Everything after the Ants fight and waterfall is pretty stale. Still, the direction just has so much energy and urgency when compared to Dial of Destiny, which I think is good but slightly worse than Crystal Skull. Just nothing can beat Spielberg\u2019s directing. \n\n",

Before the film we had to watch previews and Zootopia 2 had a perfect trailer. It did several things correct in my opinion: \n\n1) It did not ruin any jokes or plot points of the movie! \n2) It let the audience know something new is coming, with some new characters\n3) It was quick and to the point. \n\nI feel like most previews absolutely ruin the film and make me think \"Why would I even bother seeing this in theaters?\" As a quick comparison, we got a trailer for the Gabby Dollhouse Movie and the preview told us essentially the entire film. \n\nShoutout to the person who made the Zootopia 2 trailer, I want more trailers like this! Have a great day",

It transported me to another time and place with loads of atmosphere and historical detail. \n\nNow, I'm interested in historical depictions that aren't \"hollywood-ized\". Of course you need to juice things up with a plot, but how many films depict historical eras not in their glory, but rather in their misery? The distant past was unimaginably brutal, sick, and chaotic. The book The Wager is a good example of a gritty historical tale.\n\nAre there any movies (or shows and books for that matter) that do a good job of capturing the grit and doom of historical periods?",

        "title": "Before Sunset might be the most perfect sequel ever, and just an incredible movie overall",
        "content": "I decided to jump into Richard Linklater's well-regarded Before trilogy as I recently finished the Normal People series and have been in the mood for melancholy romantic stories. Before Sunrise was really, really good - charming, romantic and captured that exuberance of doe-eyed youthful passion so well.\n\nBut Before Sunset, man, it's just on another level. Maybe it's because I'm the same age as the characters now, in my 30s and married and with some life experience but it felt so resonant. Jesse and Celine have grown and changed over the past decade - they're more jaded and cynical, and not the hopeless romantics they used to be. But this growth is what lends so much more depth and complexity in both personalities and the current state of their relationship, and how much that one night steered the course of their lives in the ensuing years.\n\nAs with Sunrise, the dialogue is really the star here and it's even better than before. Whereas in Sunrise, Jesse and Celine's conversations leaned more towards more fun and youthful and often idealistic, sometimes pseudo-intellectual (makes sense given their age), here they're tinged with a melancholy and occasional bitterness that can only be brought on by experiencing more of life. In Vienna, Jesse and Celine talked about art and love and literature and all these grand, human-condition concepts. Here, they talk about global warming, crime and broken romances. It's actually crazy just how well the script captures just how I've myself been feeling in my 30s.\n\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy's chemistry is as amazing as ever, and really sell the whole concept and premise.\n\nAnd that ending? Absolutely perfect. Jesse knows he's going to stay. He's probably known it all along.\n\nCan't wait to finish off the trilogy with Midnight",

        "title": "A Concentration Camp, a Father, and the Armor of Imagination",
        "content": "Rewatched Life is Beautiful today. When I was around 17, I asked my uncle, a Marine what he watches when he feels down or lost. He didn\u2019t even pause didn\u2019t even have to think. He said Life is Beautiful. At the time, I watched it but I don\u2019t think I fully grasped it. My mind was still too young, maybe too untouched by life to comprehend it\u2019s quiet ache, too cushioned to understand the quiet devastation hidden behind the laughter. I thought it was sweet, sad but now after life has carved itself into me now I really see it. \n\nNow at 29, rewatching it hit differently. I felt it in my bones. This film isn\u2019t just a piece of cinema. This isn\u2019t just a movie. It\u2019s a father\u2019s quiet rebellion against despair. A love story in the middle of a war. A reminder that sometimes the most heroic thing you can do is protect someone\u2019s sense of wonder even as the world around you falls apart. It\u2019s a meditation on love in it\u2019s purest form. On fatherhood. On the power of imagination as a shield against horror. On hope when everything around you screams despair. It\u2019s a love letter to the human spirit. To a father\u2019s refusal to let the world dim his child\u2019s light.\nIt doesn\u2019t ask you to deny pain it simply shows you how light can still exist within it.\n\nWatching Guido that beautiful, foolish, radiant man laugh, joke, shield his son with nothing but imagination, it broke me. It reminded me of my uncle. How he never spoke much about what he saw or lived through, but how he showed up always with strength, always with humor. Maybe this is what he was trying to teach me all those years ago. That life will not always be fair. It will hurt. It will take but it will also give. And in the middle of all of it, you still get to choose how you love. You still get to choose how you show up for the people you love. You still get to choose beauty.\n\nNow coming to the movie Guido\u2019s character is joy incarnate. He walks into every room with a joke, a sparkle, a story. Even when he\u2019s thrown into unimaginable darkness, he keeps that light burning not for himself but for his son. Watching Guido smile through horror make a game out of hell protect his son\u2019s innocence with nothing but humor and heart, it destroyed me. Not because it was sad. But because it was so full of love. That rare, boundless, unconditional kind. Sometimes surviving isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes you have to find a way to make life feel beautiful even when it\u2019s not. \n\nAnd I finally understood why my uncle a man who had tasted darkness and still chose kindness turned to this movie. Because some people don\u2019t survive just for themselves. They survive for the ones they love. They laugh not because they\u2019re blind to pain but because they know sometimes laughter is the only armor we\u2019ve got. That kind of strength the quiet, selfless kind he carried too. Maybe that\u2019s why he loved this film so much. Maybe that\u2019s why he wanted me to see it.\n\nI wish I could sit with him today and tell him I finally get it. Years later, I finally get it. That I understand now what he was trying to show me back then. And I carry that with me now, a deeper understanding of what it means to love through pain, to protect with laughter and to believe in beauty when the world gives you every reason not to. That Life is Beautiful isn\u2019t about denying suffering, it\u2019s about choosing love anyway. Even when it\u2019s hard. Even when it hurts.\n\nSo tonight, I sat with the version of me who was 17 and the version of me now. And we both cried. For the things we\u2019ve seen. For the innocence we lost. And for the reminder that even in the most broken places, light still finds a way in.\n\nSo if your heart is heavy, if you feel like you\u2019re losing grip watch this movie. Life is Beautiful. Not always. Not easily. But sometimes because someone chooses to make it so.\n\n",

I remember telling my friends at school the next day how awesome the movie was and how a guy got hit with an axe. From then, my dad would always let me watch any R-rated movie, and then would just cover my eyes if there was any nudity in a scene. If there was a sex scene, he'd send me out of the room and tell me come back later (these were always movies playing on tv, so he had already seen them and knew when those scenes were coming up). The only movies I wasn't allowed to watch were slasher horror movies, mainly because they just knew that'd give me a nightmare. Once I was in like 6th grade or so, they were fine with me watching those.\n\nWhen I talk to others about that though, that apparently wasn't the norm with everyone. I personally liked it and thought I'd be fine with doing the same with a kid, but I'm curious what y'all's experiences were.",
