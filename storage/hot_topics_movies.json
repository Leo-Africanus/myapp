        "content": "Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. \n\n  \nIn the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.\n\n  \nThe first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2. \n\n\n\nI think it's such a crazy, bonkers idea that people would eat up, World War 2, based on a true story, Hollywood, celebrities, all in the same movie, I am absolutely shocked that nobody has made a movie about it, it seems like a perfect idea.

        "content": "Hi everyone. My younger brother recently passed away at the age of 30 and I am struggling with the grieving process. I often like to do therapy by cinema, so wondering what are your favorite/best movies with a brotherhood motif? Preferably something with a relatively positive message, but admittedly I love dark and thought-provoking movies so nothing is necessarily off-limits. Thanks",

        "content": "It\u2019s one of my favorite movies, but I\u2019m curious how Gen Z feels about it. Does it still resonate, or does it feel dated and over the top? I wonder if the movie\u2019s idea of \"romance\" might seem more like codependency or a mix of personality deficits to younger generations.\n\nI feel that the type of \"romance\" portrayed in the movie might feel a bit dated now. It seems to me that younger generations take a more practical and matter-of-fact approach to love and relationships compared to 35 years ago. For example, Chani\u2019s love for Paul in *Dune: Part Two* strikes me as a more conditional kind of love. I can\u2019t recall the exact quote, but she essentially says she will love him as long as he doesn\u2019t harm the Fremen cause.\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone but am especially curious about Gen Z's take on this.",
