        "content": "Lifelong Alien franchise fan, hear me out. \n\nI realize Prometheus was confusing and weird and some parts were straight nonsense, but I love the way they told the story of existence and evolution. It\u2019s a high-concept story that was only made better by the wistful musings of the characters, especially Fassbender. His search for humanity in media, philosophy, and poetry is a thing of beauty. Even though it ends well for exactly no one, just the fact that they tried to tackle this subject in the context of a horror-thriller-sci fi was so ambitious and creative I can\u2019t hate it. \n\nTo me, this movie is an extension of concepts explored by Bladerunner and other films, stemming from \u2018Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u2019. It\u2019s about creation and evolution and the pursuit of the soul, by a creature that can neither create, nor evolve, nor has a soul. \n\nThis was the David show, for me, 100%. He steals every scene he\u2019s in. \n\nThe cinematography, score, and ambition of this film deserves way more respect than it gets. ",
