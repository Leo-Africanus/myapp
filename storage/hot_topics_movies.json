        "content": "#[Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) if you want to just nab one and skip the wall of text.\n\n---\n\nAlright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen during the ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1itlqyx/oscar_bingo_xii_submission_thread/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- If you win just be sure to yell \"BINGO\" really loud wherever you are. And if you wanna post your gamecard to the game thread that would be fine too.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

Basically, an early scene has Marky Mark's young daughter practicing her speech for class on what her Dad does, with a Coke can as a demonstration. \n\nThat got me wondering, in an era where so many movies seem to just plunk two characters down and have them talk about things that they are both already aware of solely for the audience's benefit (\"Wow, I can't believe it's been 5 years since you had that car accident where you lost your young son named Michael, after which your wife left you because she couldn't process her grief, and you moved back in with your estranged father....\"), do you have any other examples where a movie found an elegant or effective way to deliver some complicated backstory or foundational knowledge required to understand the specifics of the story?",

I was thinking about other films and tv shows that have intense scenes like the flanking scene, and came up with a few. I'm posting to see what ya'll can add to my small list so far.\n\n**13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi**\u00a0(2016)  \n\\- I'm watching this right now and the movie manages to maintain such intensity throughout, i just love it.\n\n**Sicario**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The border crossing scene is so great.\n\n**Heat**\u00a0(1995)  \n\\- I haven't rewatched in a while, but i do remember the big shoot-out scene as being pretty intense. It's time for a rewatch i think.\n\n**Bone Tomahawk**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- I don't want to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it, but my recommendation if you have not is to go in blind and not read anything about it. It's just a great film.\n\n**The Revenant**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The bear attack is pretty riveting. The entire movie is pretty intense and a bit depressing, but i do like that there is a bit of justice in the end.\n\n**Saving Private Ryan**\u00a0(1998)  \n\\- The Knife kill scene is etched in my memory for all time.\n\nI will also mention\u00a0**Black Hawk Down**\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0**Band of Brothers**\u00a0(2001) which both have many such scenes, too many to list here.

It was the third older movie that I've seen semi-recently, where two central (male) characters share a love interest or are somehow romantically linked to the same (female) character. The two other movies are Deer Hunter and Lonely Are The Brave. In all of these titless this is depicted as not that big of a deal and is never a central event or point of conflict in the movie. Especially in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid the two male protagonists seem to be into the same lady quite openly. \n\nSo my question is, why is this theme present in these movies and, especially,  why is it not depicted as that big of a deal? It comes across as somewhat strange as a modern viewer so I was wondering if anone had any insight. I hope I made my point clear and thank you for sharing your thoughts.",

        "content": "I was 9 years old when that movie came out, and it was an acid trip before I knew what an acid trip was. The kid could fly. \n\nOf course I also didn't get the metaphor in The Life of Pi (the book) until someone pointed it out to me, so maybe my mind is just too literal for the movie. The visuals of the roof scene haunted me for at least a decade. Just such a weird, weird movie. ",

        "content": "I am looking to watch a movie with my grandma, and wondering if people have some good suggestions. Nothing too graphic or violent, she likes movies that are a bit of an easy watch. Nothing too complex in storyline (she\u2019s 85 and can get a bit lost). Nothing too silly either, something that does tug on the heartstrings a bit with good characters, told from a female perspective is nice too. \n\nHere are some examples of movies that she likes:\n- best exotic marigold hotel (2011, 2015)\n- calendar girls (2003)\n - guernsey literary and potato peel pie society (2018)\n- Brooklyn (2015)\n- she liked Downton Abbey (I know it\u2019s a show) \n\nI appreciate all suggestions! I know my nana will be thrilled, and I love spending time with her. She\u2019s 80% deaf now so we watch everything with closed captioning, snuggled close on her couch. I adore her. Thanks for helping bring a smile to her face \u25e1\u0308 ",

        "title": "Cast Away (2000)",
        "content": "Tom Hanks is the man. This isn\u2019t going to be the first time I write about a movie this year where he is a main character, but this is the movie I think of first when I am asked, \u201cWhat is your favorite Tom Hanks\u2019 performance?\u201d In this over two hour long movie, there is over an hour in the middle where he is the only character on screen. He only interacts with coconuts, rocks, ice skates, wood, water, and yes, a volleyball named Wilson. Wilson also gives the single greatest performance by an inanimate object of all time. During this over an hour stretch, most of the time I would imagine that a movie would lose the attention of an audience, but with Hanks running the show, everything remains interesting. It\u2019s not all Tom\u2019s doing though; the story holds us in too. I do it - so I imagine others do too - I ask myself, \u201cWhat would I do in this situation?\u201d, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Chuck (Tom Hanks\u2019 character) do X, Y, or Z?\u201d, \u201cHow is this survivable?\u201d, \u201cWould I go *this* crazy?\u201d, \u201cWould I go even crazier?\u201d. Not only is Cast Away great entertainment, but it can also be seen as a great learning experience.\n\nHow would you survive alone on a deserted island? Cast Away teaches us to be resourceful. One of the nitpicks I have from this movie is that Chuck doesn\u2019t open the last FedEx package that washes ashore. I realize that it is all part of the larger narrative of the story, but really man, if I\u2019m lost at sea, I\u2019m opening everything. Chuck opens up the others though, and he uses the ice skates as cutting tools, and the dress to help him catch fish. He also uses the skates to perform some dental surgery. How he doesn\u2019t get an infection and die is another nitpick, but we can let it pass. The best package he gets contains his new best friend, Wilson the volleyball. Yes, it\u2019s silly at first, but when you really think\u00a0 about it, loneliness can be the hardest thing to overcome, and using his resourcefulness, he can overcome it by talking to a volleyball. It\u2019s not that much different from when we are kids and interact with stuffed penguin or polar bear toys.\n\nMy favorite sequence in the movie is when he makes fire. After writing out \u201cHELP\u201d in the sand, only to have it washed away by the incoming tides, a little lesson, and then using logs to write his message, he decides to start a signal fire. The ability to control fire is one thing that separates humans from all other species, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we all are knowledgeable on the process of making it. Watching Chuck fail for so long, but keep up the determination to keep going, is inspiring. Never give up. By taking so long to get it going, the film really makes you feel proud of him once he really has it roaring. \u201cLook what I\u2019ve created! I\u2026..have made fire.\u201d Chuck says while puffing out his chest on the beach.\n\nWe all have hardships in our lives. Maybe not lone survivor of a plane crash and lost on an island levels of hardship, but nonetheless, we all have something. When Chuck finally gets home, he has a moment where he explains, \u201cI know what I have to do now. I\u2019ve got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?\u201d Life is hard no matter what. Some days are great, some not so great. I currently have a cold, but it won\u2019t last forever. I get depression sometimes, but it also does not last forever. In the moment, it\u2019s hard to remember sometimes that that is the case, but we always must remember that tomorrow the sun will rise, no matter what else happens in the world, this is going to happen. You never know what will come next.\n\nThis leads me to what I believe to be the most creative part of this film's storytelling. Once Chuck gets off the island, he lives happily ever after, right? Well, not really. Turns out his fianc\u00e9 married his dentist and had a kid. Life moved on without him. Why wouldn\u2019t it? But as Chuck learned on the island, \u201c...keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?\u201d If you\u2019re ever having a hard time, remember this. Keep going, life ahead awaits. There will be ups and downs, but you have to keep going.",

        "content": "This isn't about choices that were initially met with negativity and later praise when the film came out (Heat Ledger). I'm talking casting choices people talk shit about even today but you kinda like\n\nFor me it's easily Scarlett Johansson as the lead in Ghost in a Shell (2017). I think she really channels the vibe of the animation and brought Motoko to life. despite not being Japanese. You can tell she did her homework on the character and it wasn't just an easy paycheck\n\nI'd say her biggest sin was being too big. she quickly became the female face of Hollywood, especially as an action star, aside from Black Widow I think Lucy came out before this and was critically panned. It also doesn't help that this movie wasn't great and didn't live up to the astronomical standards set by the anime. However, Scarjo did live up to it. I'll stand by that.",

        "content": "I apologize if this has already been expressed elsewhere and I'm beating a dead horse. I just finished it and ran to Reddit to scream, but every thread I've seen is, instead, glowing about it. So here I am to be contrarian!   \n\nLook--I love dreamy, surreal, go with the flow type stuff. I loved The Boy and the Heron. I drink that good Ghibli juice all day. Conceptually, this movie could've been giddy good stuff. I love secretary birds, and capybaras, and cats, and dogs, and weird surreal films with beautiful imagery. What's not to love?    \n\nWell, in my opinion. A LOT!   \n\n- I've seen a lot of glowing reviews for the art style. It was pretty, but came off as very \"indie video game cutscene.\" I felt like I was playing Lost Ember on the PS4. A lot of the textures felt kind of... undefined, for lack of a better word. Everything was artsy and pretty but not in a way that felt substantial. There was one scene when our crew first finds some solid land where I thought the water was starting to recede before realizing nope, it was just cutting against the water in a weird way. There's a scene late on where cat backs into a rope and it cuts through their leg. This is still a highly impressive work if it was done by a small studio (which I believe it was), but groundbreaking or award winning? Eh.   \n\n- It felt like the film couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a guided meditation, a spiritual metaphor, or something meant for kids. You have some scenes like the bird ascending that felt like they had deeper meaning, but then you also have pretty on the nose scenes like the lemur giving up material goods or the dog not following his dumb pack mates that felt like they were trying to teach kids simple moral lessons. Great movies can provide lessons for adults AND kids simultaneously; this felt like it veered between tottering on pretentious and \"Aesop's Fables for your young child.\" You also have the cat falling into the water so often that the movie descended into a snooze fest of artificial feeling peril. Stop walking on the edge of the boat, kitty!\n\n- What was that ending?! What?! WHAT?! Again it felt like it wanted to be open for interpretation or what have you, but more than that it felt like it was being intentionally vague just to, like the secretary birds, feel smug and better than you. Arghhh!   \n\nOverall I would've liked it more if it leaned into being more vague and artsy without such obvious moral lessons OR if it had embraced just being a mystical fun for all ages adventure with a lot left for interpretation. Unfortunately for me it feels like it tried to do both and failed to land comfortably in either boat. \n\n\n",
