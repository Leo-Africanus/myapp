His presence really sells that \"pure\" figure.\n\nAlso I had forgotten how much narration Morgan Freeman does. If anything the whole movie shows different shades to the characters. From the guards to the prisoners and all. \n\nThe only ones who are one-sided are The Sisters. Otherwise everyone else shows some good and some not so good.\n\nAlso the cinematography is really beautiful considering the circumstances. A real \"natural\" use of light and I appreciated how well lit it was. Unlike some films today where it's so grey.\n\nI could see directing similarities between this and The Mist. First time noticing that. Yes I know same director.\n\nI had always wondered why this film was so highly regarded. But upon watching it there is so much heart and the themes really speak through universally of resilience, perseverance and this sense of inner purity.\n\nIt's inspired me to watch The Green Mile next. I do wish Frank made more movies but alas. ",

        "content": "Hello there!\n\nYesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialisti\u010dni kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.\n\nI wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 43: Slovenia - Moj ata, socialisti\u010dni kulak (engl.: My dad, the socialist kulak)\n\n&gt;Day 42: Slovakia - Obchod na Korze (engl.: The Shop on Main Street)\n\n&gt;Day 41: Serbia - Balkanski \u0161pijun (engl.: Balkan Spy)\n\n&gt;Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: Unknown Men of San Marino)\n\n&gt;Day 39: Russia - \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440 (engl.: Stalker)\n\n&gt;Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2ni \u0219i 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n&gt;Day 37: Portugal - Capit\u00e3o Falc\u00e3o (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n&gt;Day 36: Poland - Kr\u00f3tki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n&gt;Day 35: Norway - Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 (engl.: You Won\u2019t Be Alone)\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "content": "I don\u2019t really understand why, but this movie hits me directly in my happy place. It doesn\u2019t have the greatest reviews, which is a mystery to me, because even if it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s got incredible casting, solid plot points, pathos, belly laughs, and mothertucking Luke Wilson. \n\nFirst of all, Sarah Jessica Parker plays the neurotic outsider to a T. Birdy, defensive, repressed, insecure, but good deep down, even the cringe fest dinner scene lands because of master performances by her, Craig T, and Diane. There is no way to resist Rachel McAdam\u2019s charms, and she\u2019s in full effect here. Even the tragic subplot works, and the epilogue has me sobbing every year. Just the right balance of zany, touching, and unpredictable (sorry but that\u2019s mostly true). I love it I love it I love it so much. ",

        "content": "This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. \n\nMy theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn\u2019t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching. A film being cheap doesn\u2019t always make the film bad.",
