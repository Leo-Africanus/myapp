        "title": "'M3GAN 2.0' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous rampage, its creator, Gemma, has become an advocate for government oversight of AI. Unbeknownst to her, a defense contractor has created a military-grade weapon known as Amelia, the ultimate infiltration spy. However, as Emlia's self-awareness increases, it becomes less interested in taking orders. Hoping to stop Emilia, Gemma decides to resurrect M3GAN, making it faster, stronger, and more lethal.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [62%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan_20)\n\n**Metacritic:** [56/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/m3gan-20/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\-  4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is, admittedly, a pretty bizarre conflagration of tones and ideas. But so were most of the Child\u2019s Play films... and the rollercoaster effect of never quite knowing what genre Johnstone might pull from next is a key part of the fun.\n\n[Empire Magazine - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/m3gan-2/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is more absurd, self-aware silliness: a riot of timely tech paranoia, with almost no horror but a ton of successful comedy. Slay, queen! We are following *Terminator 2* rules here: if AMELIA is the cold, ruthless, unstoppable T-1000, then M3GAN is the T-800 who can take her on \u2014 the fan-favourite baddie gone good \u2014 with Williams\u2019 Gemma as the tech-sceptical Sarah Connor-type, who must learn to love her former foe. (Because if a M3GAN can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too?)\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/m3gan-2-0-review-allison-williams-1236298922/)\n\n&gt;The campy sense of mischief that made Gerard Johnstone\u2019s 2023 hit *M3GAN* so enjoyable asserts itself intermittently in *M3GAN 2.0*, a logical title for a follow-up to the thriller about a murderous robot. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, *Mission: Impossible* and the *Austin Powers* franchise. There are amusing moments reminiscent of the original, but in terms of tone and coherence, the movie loses its way.\n\n[AV Club - Anna McKibbin](https://www.avclub.com/m3gan-2-0-review) \\-  C+\n\n&gt;It seems that Johnstone and his collaborators learned the wrong lesson from *M3GAN*\u2018s shocking success (the original did fairly well in the box office and launched a thousand memes). Audiences weren\u2019t won over by the film\u2019s philosophical untangling of man and tech, but flocked to see M3GAN\u2019s uncanny physicality and unique murder tactics. This was a robot who combined the familiar (bitchy villain dialogue) and unfamiliar (galloping after a child like a dog in a frilly dress). She was Chucky meets *Heathers*. Unfortunately, neither AMELIA, nor this new more morally driven M3GAN, engender that same delighted shock, and so Johnstone settles for the worst of both worlds\u2014something that limps, with exaggerated metal squeaks, into the future.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/06/m3gan-2-0-review-sequel-1236441718/)\n\n&gt;With AI and its constant advancements a frightening eal-life prospect that can out-horror any horror film with its evil possibilities, the *M3GAN* franchise, as steroided-up as this sequel is, is fighting against time to remain science fiction instead of being a template for a future documentary\\*.\\* Still it is all a lot of fun to watch, and the filmmakers have met the requirements expected by a sequel designed to outdo its predecessor where *more* becomes the mantra. What made the first film such an instant hit, even in its marketing months before release with that dancing doll image, really can\u2019t be replicated, but this edition is so jacked-up we still can dig it for what it is. All of the players deliver and there is a very amusing supporting turn from none other than Jemaine Clement as an Elon Musk-style tech billionaire named Alton Appleton wanting to take the latest creations from Gemma and company to more questionable heights. Clement delivers some nice laughs as you might expect.",

Honorable mention to Secretary (2002), which people love to bring up but honestly didn\u2019t strike me as freaky. My personal pick is Crash (1996) - now that\u2019s freaky in a good way. Disturbing, intimate, and weirdly hypnotic. There\u2019s just something about people bonding over car crashes and erotic injury that makes it stick with you. Definitely not your average date night movie, but it left a lasting impression.\n\n",

When I watched Fury Road I thought \"Well, that is a horrible post-apocaliptic scenario,\" but when I watched Furiosa, ***damn***. I ended that movie DEPRESSED, and with a single thought haunting me: The Wasteland is *fucking hell*. Like, no hyperbole, if I die and go to hell, I would not be surprised that was it. My absolute worse fucking nightmare. \n\nWomen being reduced to breeding stock and exploided like cows for their breast milk. Healthy people being hunted down to be used as blood bags for soldiers that die in the thousands in an extremely violent war for resouces among diseases and cults and cannibals. A burning hot, endless, dead, inescapable desert ruled by the worse of the worse, the most perverted, sadistic, selfish, power hungry, evil men humanity can create. I know Furiosa strong as hell because I would have killed myself.\n\nBut I am curious what other people consider the worse ones.",

        "content": "I randomly decided to rewatch Children of Men the other night and I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for how hard it would hit. I remembered it being good, but I had forgotten just how immersive and intense it is.\n\nFrom the very first scene the world feels completely lived in. The long takes, the grime, the handheld camera work. It doesn\u2019t feel like a movie, it feels like you\u2019re there. That car scene in the woods is still one of the most jaw-dropping sequences I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how relevant it still feels. The fear, the hopelessness, the way people cling to whatever\u2019s left. It\u2019s all eerily familiar now. And yet there\u2019s something deeply human at the heart of it. That moment with the crying baby floored me.\n\nIt\u2019s not a loud movie but it says everything it needs to. Just pure cinema.\n\nCurious if anyone else has revisited it recently. Did it hit you as hard as it did me?",
