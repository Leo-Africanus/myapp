        "content": "Hey reddit. We\u2019re Colin Minihan (writer, director, and editor of What Keeps You Alive, plus Grave Encounters, It Stains the Sands Red, Extraterrestrial, and Coyotes) and Brittany Allen (actress and composer, starring in What Keeps You Alive, It Stains the Sands Red, and Coyotes opposite Justin Long and Kate Bosworth, most recently seen as Dexter\u2019s mom in Dexter: Original Sin, played Popclaw on The Boys Season 1, got murdered horribly in Jigsaw, The Prodigy and several others).\n\nHere's the trailer for our new film, Coyotes:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmMfrJ3Gw44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmMfrJ3Gw44)\n\nWe\u2019re married and have a 2 year old, which makes this career absurd, and love making films that walk the line between horror, thriller, and survival \u2014 sometimes with coyotes involved. \ud83d\udc3a Colin writes, directs, and edits, while Brittany brings her acting and musical magic.\n\nAsk us anything \u2014 filmmaking, acting, composing, horror stories, or the chaos of indie production. We shot Coyotes in 21 days in Bogota. It just premiered at Fantastic Fest and comes out in theaters Oct 3rd.  \n\nWe\u2019ll be back here attempting to answer questions today (Thursday 9/25) at 6 PM ET. Can\u2019t wait to howl with you all!\n\n\u2014 Colin &amp; Brittany",

A change in demographical dynamics/Audience?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that on this period, Resident Evil also had their own animated movies, some were great others really bad though.",

        "content": "Who could've thought that a story about a rather small incident in a rather small town and community would have such an impact?\n\nWith the recent rise of AI and LLMs, we have become used to thinking that very soon there will be a moment when generated music and videos will be completely indistinguishable from reality. And so what? Just trust no one, right?\n\nWell, The Hunt specifically shows what's wrong about this approach. It works only until the moment people want to blame or judge someone. It's only a matter of time until some crime is committed by someone, and 100% AI-generated video or audio will be presented in court as authentic evidence, and no matter the amount of checks and different checking AI tools, no one will be able to truly tell if it's true or false. Cases will be solved entirely up to the judge's intuition and prejudice.\n\nAnd the worst part is that even if someone is able to distinguish truth from a lie with some tools/genuine evidence, it won't make any difference, as the damage is already done.\n\n  \n&gt;!Theo's realization that Lucas wasn't lying, and the fact that Lucas was acquitted in court - all that doesn't matter anymore. Because people have already labeled Lucas as a bad guy, they already hate him and want to kill him. And no actual justifiable evidence will ever change that. People don't trust the government, the court... People don't trust each other. This movie is not just a fictional tragedy, it's a real-life horror.!&lt;",

I don't think Danny Houston has ever played a good guy or likable character, and Rufus Sewell really only had Dark City where he got to be a hero. However even that film features most of the supporting cast thinking he is probably a serial killer. They are both handsome and charming actors but it really feels like they are constantly cast as the sneering, smarmy, sociopathic bad guy. Sewell has a Knights Tale, Man in the High Castle, and even most recently played Prince Andrew in Scoop. Danny Houston has been the bad guy in X-men, Wonder Woman, The Crow, and even the recent Naked Gun. Come on hollywood you have the chance to do the funniest thing. ",
