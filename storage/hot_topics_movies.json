        "title": "I rewatched Am\u00e9lie after 20 years. It\u2019s still one of my very favorite films, which surprised me when I realized how \u201ctell don\u2019t show\u201d it is.",
        "content": "Am\u00e9lie has got to be one of the most accessible foreign films out there to an English speaking audience. I was around 13 when it released, and my experience watching it wasn\u2019t all that different seeing it again at 37. People even show it to young children and they get it, too (despite puritanical ratings boards getting their knickers in a twist about the comedic and rather brief sex scenes).\n\nWhat really leapt out at me this time was something that I guess can only come with 20+ years of film literacy since my first watch: that the film takes *every* opportunity it can to be as crystal clear as possible about what is going on, to the point that it becomes \u201ctell not show\u201d at a baseline level. Or at least, \u201ctell AND show.\u201d\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet has his actors speak from the heart (while they emote so bombastically and delightfully you could understand their mental state from watching this on a vaseline-smeared TV set), and any time Am\u00e9lie has a big moment of change, a narrator is there to guide us through an exact breakdown of her thoughts and beliefs. Many important characters get an entire origin story told to us and a quick bullet point list read off about how they think. There are amazing visuals and stagings and editing and all of it is very clever language of its own, but it is all so on the nose and makes for what\u2019s probably the least challenging \u201cgreat movie\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. And I love that it succeeds so thoroughly in spite of that\u2026 or perhaps, more interestingly, because of it.\n\nPart of me has been almost conditioned by challenging cinema and video essays that demand a viewer pay close attention and do a lot of mental work to fully enjoy cinema, and there sometimes seems to be this belief going around in film circles that anything that doesn\u2019t require deep thought is somehow a lesser form of art\u2026 but here is Am\u00e9lie, cheerfully and lovingly doing the opposite, bringing viewers to happy tears whether they\u2019re analyzing it or not. And I love it for it. Especially now. I needed that escape yesterday.\n\nAnd I want to remind others that yes, there is a ticket to happiness that you can have too, and it exists in the form of a doe-eyed lead on a quirky green DVD box (or I guess, stream it too) and it doesn\u2019t require you to be at your most tip-top shape as a viewer to just deeply connect to it on a soul level.\n\nMagnifique.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*Edit: some have pointed out that Am\u00e9lie is very tell **AND** show and I have to agree with that. Telling without showing would actually mean having things like empty backstory and inauthentic dialogue that gives unnecessary and unbelievable exposition dumps, and conveying information in a way that actively makes the emotional viewing experience worse. So the film deftly sidesteps all those common pitfalls in its rulebreaking.*",

        "content": "I was watching \"Goodfellas\" today, and it had a version of the song \"Stardust\".   \n\nI know the song from \"Sleepless in Seattle\", where it was sung by Nat King Cole and was wistful and a bit melancholy.  [Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7YVBmCOIys) \n\nIn Goodfellas, the song (by Billy Ward and his Dominos) was used in an organized crime montage.  [Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ivfLTxsoGA)\n\n  \nA bit later in the movie, they used [\"And then He Kissed me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPiSB8fSviE)\" by the Crystals, which, for me, was a very prominent song in 1987's \"Adventures in Babysitting\" [Link. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrecN_dsPc)\n\nAre there other songs that have been used in contexts as far apart as romantic comedies or comedy/adventure movies and mob/crime movies?\n\n",

        "title": "Do ya remember The Pagemaster?",
        "content": "The 1994 film about a boy who gets turned into a cartoon and goes on an adventure with Books through classic stories?   \nI was thinking about what if it was remade today. It has some potential with a little rework. \n\nWhat I'm thinking:   \nThe story is more about how books can help kids in the real world. Either as comfort, inspiration, or relatability to something they are going through. The main character is a kid who is struggling with stuff in his life. (family divorcing? school struggles? bullies? being true to themselves? ect) \n\nOne day, he goes to the library and gets transported to the \"illustration\" world like in the original.  He of course meet the personification of Adventure, Horror, and Fantasy. Perhaps each sharing resemblance with someone in his life? (coach, teacher, neighbor, ect) They go through each genre world where the kid learns and grow from each visit. Taking risks in adventure, creativity from fantasy, and bravery from horror. Or something along those lines. \n\nI am curious what actors would fit this story. Any thoughts? \n\nI thought maybe Fantasy is play by an actress who give that motherly caring vibe but has that spunk to her.   \nHorror someone intimidating but speaks gently?   \nAdventure defiantly should be played by someone with a lot of energy and daring behavior. \n\nWho would you pick?   \nHow would you tweak the original story?

        "title": "Who would you give an Oscar to for \"best actor/actress in an otherwise bad movie?\" Both from this year and all time.",
        "content": "I haven't watched enough new releases this year to have an answer for the first part of the question, but for all time these would be my nominees at least. (For reference, a bad movie here doesn't have to be one that lost money, just one you thought was otherwise terrible.) \n\n\n* I think The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies was pretty forgettable but **Martin Freeman** is very, very good casting as Bilbo. Actually, most of the casting is perfectly fine in the Hobbit movies, the issues are more with the writing and the CGI. Bilbo is the real standout though.\n\n\n* **Raul Julia** in Street Fighter is a famous one. Famously he took the role for his kids, and you can really see that he takes it as seriously as any other prestigious acting job.\n\n\n* Twilight did huge at the box office but it has a pretty bad reputation with audiences. That said, I've never heard one bad word about **Billy Burke** as Charlie Swan. He actually does an extremely good job in all 5 movies, and despite not being a main character (and having less to work with), he really elevates that character above many of the other characters with more screen time.\n\n\n* Also from the Twilight franchise, I would nominate **Michael Sheen** as Aro. His performance is *insane* but he makes the character so much fun every time he's on screen. The leader of an evil group of vampires could be a very dry role - they usually don't do anything, they have maybe 20 collective minutes of screen time in the whole franchise until the final battle, but he gave one of the most memorable performances in the entire saga.
