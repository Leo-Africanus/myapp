Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first \u201cSonic\u201d in 2020.\n\n[io9.com](https://gizmodo.com/sonic-3-movie-review-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-paramount-sega-2000540156):\n\n\n&gt;Full of electric spectacle and action-packed adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 completes the best video game movie trilogy yet.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.\n\n[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)\n\n&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (8/10):\n\n\n&gt;Clever jokes, a noticeable reverence for the source material, and some fantastic antagonists make the Blue Blur's latest race an entertaining ride from start to finish.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;The outcome is a \"Sonic\" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\n[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Carrey\u2019s antic madness \u2013 elsewhere often too much to digest \u2013 is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.\n\n[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):\n\n&gt;Whether it\u2019s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):\n\n&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.\n\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):\n\n&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project \u2026 well, it\u2019s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The MVP of the first two films, Carrey dials down the physical comedy in both his roles, amping up punning (\u201cDorkupine!\u201d) to hit-and-miss effect. For all the actor\u2019s gurning and the film\u2019s visual busyness, few images pop or lodge in the memory.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):\n\n&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn\u2019t as fast as its blue protagonist.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before. With their abilities outmatched in every way, Team Sonic must seek out an unlikely alliance in hopes of stopping Shadow and protecting the planet.\n\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog\n* Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower\n* Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna\n* Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog\n\n**Live-action cast**\n\n* Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik\n* James Marsden as Tom Wachowski\n* Tika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski\n* Krysten Ritter as Director Rockwell\n* Natasha Rothwell as Rachel\n* Shemar Moore as Randall Handel\n* Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone\n* Tom Butler as Commander Walters\n* Adam Pally as Wade Whipple\n* Alyla Browne as Maria Robotnik\n\nDirected by: Jeff Fowler\n\nScreenplay by: Pat Casey, Josh Miller, John Whittington\n\nStory by: Pat Casey and Josh Miller\n\nProduced by: Neal H.

Going in without knowing anything about the story, I thought this film was going to be a Sly action film going wild on bad guys (which is also a fun time) but when it started progressing, I was surprised when he is actually getting into a long spanning fight with the police. \n\nI loved how this film was more reflective and character work is done so smoothly through dialogues and flashbacks. A soldier isolated and ostracized by society riddled with PTSD getting pushed around with no limits. I am not saying he is not at fault too but the first blood was not shed by him. A troubled man getting troubled further. \n\nThat monologue at the end of the film was just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking. It also puts into perspective the mental anguish of the character in broad strokes. Overall, First Blood is a triumphant film in all the right ways\n",

        "content": "I grew up knowing Tom hanks from Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, Toy Story, You\u2019ve got mail, saving private Ryan. He was a staple in my household and one of the first movie stars I admired. But for some reason my early mind couldn\u2019t come to accept his early films. \n\nI saw numerous times the vhs boxes for The Burbs and Joe vs the Volcano at the rental store and always created in my head the reasons these weren\u2019t movies for me. I think it was chaos on the covers. I just got a sense they weren\u2019t made for me at that age and I wouldn\u2019t appreciate them. And in a way I was right and in a way I\u2019m beyond glad I waited to age up before I watched them for the first time. \n\nYou are never surprised watching early hanks movies that he became what he did but at times your disappointed that beyond snl appearances that he focused on dramas. There is a rare blend of grounded humanism and over the top performances in these two films that I feel was lightning in a bottle. \n\nAs a Joe Dante fan I have to say other than gremlins 2 and perhaps beyond it felt like the movie most representing the distillation of his spirit as a filmmaker. The cast is top to bottom perfect. It felt like both a love letter to late 50s early 60s tv like Ozzie and Harriett, leave it to beaver, the munsters and 80s hijinks comedies while altogether becoming its own thing. \n\n Tom Hanks masters over the top comedy in this movie. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, his outbursts, monologues, and physical comedy are unmatched in their ability to play to the levels of gonzo Joe Dante asks of him while simultaneously feeling endearing and believable. Which leads to the reason the ending was changed from a twilight zone like twist to a double twist where he HAS to win in the end. But albeit in the wrong way. \n\nAlso props to Bruce Dern, I don\u2019t know how he ended up in this movie but I\u2019m damn glad he did. What a driving force and \u201cstraight man\u201d if this movie could even have one. \n\n",
