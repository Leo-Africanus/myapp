I\u2019m sort of sorry I have. \n\nSome of my main complaints include the weird, TV-movie quality presentation (framing of shots, campy closeups, almost soap-opera-effect moments), the inexplicable changes to the origin story, and Nick Nolte\u2019s bizarre, Gary Busey level scene chewing. Beyond that, the plot is just so meh, and I\u2019m not digging on Ang Lee\u2019s direction. \n\nSo, Reddit, do any of you like this movie? What are some things you appreciated about it? What are your thoughts? ",

The direction and cinematography is also best. \n\nCan't believe this is the first film Sidney Lumet directed. What's your thoughts about this movie. Please share, I want to discuss about it. ",

        "content": "For some odd reason I always thought this was some random giallo film, given the art and title. But to realize it was a Friedkin film after the first 15-min was pure joy. I had to pause and google it right then, after randomly choosing it to begin with, because the setup to the film was just too bizarre to be someone unrecognizable.\n\nBut what follows is just this entire, surreal, hellish adventure film with practical effects that blew my mind. Roy Schneider\u2019s performance is transformative. It\u2019s up there with Jaws for me.\n\nOff the top of my head, easily one of my favorite adventure films and as a Friedkin film, I like it as much as The Exorcist. Massive horror elements too, very genre-fluid. \n\nAnytime I consider a film a 10/10 I\u2019m so curious why others don\u2019t, just out of curiosity. To see that the exposition was everyone\u2019s least favorite part felt almost warm and personal to me, because it\u2019s so strange and really what drew me in. \n",

To give Sophie Marceau something to do besides crying and wearing pretty dresses? \n\nIt even makes William Wallace look bad because his whole motivation is about avenging his wife  and how he yearns to go back to her but then is quick to jump into bed with Isabella. I found it so contrived but then this is the same movie that had Edward II's gay lover, Piers Gaveston, being thrown off a Tower for giggles (that also never happened). \n\nNot every movie needs a love story. It's unfortunate Marceau, a fine actress, was tagged with such a thankless part. They should have just called Judith Godreche and called it a day.",
