        "title": "April 18-20 Box Office Recap: 'Sinners' opens with a fantastic $48 million domestically, making it the best opening for a live-action original film in years. Meanwhile, 'A Minecraft Movie' crosses $700 million worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/ve54b1yp29we1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66d93333fd7c823d8b731a79eebfac3bfbba7ad\n\nOn Easter weekend, audiences decided to go watch ***Sinners***. The result? A #1 debut, and the biggest debut for an original film in the post-COVID era. While ***A Minecraft Movie*** had to cede the top spot, it's already over $700 million worldwide.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $127.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 109.7% from last year, when ***Civil War*** held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like ***Abigail*** and ***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare***.\n\nDebuting atop, Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners*** earned a fantastic $48 million in 3,308 theaters. This is the best debut for Coogler's career outside the ***Black Panther*** films. In fact, it's the biggest debut for a live-action original film in the post-COVID climate, opening above ***Nope*** ($44.3 million).\n\nSimply put, it's a fantastic start. Take into account, getting an original film to open this high is a miracle, given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises. It's a testament to the strength of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. So how they did succeed where other original films failed?\n\nFor the past decade, Coogler has earned some great good will, thanks to his works in films like ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther***. The films have earned fantastic reception, allowing him to finally get an original title like ***Sinners*** to get greenlit. It wasn't easy, obviously; a big reason why some studios turned it down was Coogler's request to have the film rights revert to him after 25 years. So Warner Bros. took the bullet and agreed to his terms, [a decision that apparently scared a lot of Hollywood executives.](https://www.vulture.com/article/to-hollywood-the-scariest-part-of-sinners-is-ryan-coogler.html)\n\nThe film's clear selling point was Coogler and Jordan, but the premise was also very important: a 1930s horror film, with Jordan playing twins. 2025 has been very weak for horror; the biggest horror film is ***The Monkey***, which hasn't even topped $70 million worldwide. The audience was starving for a horror film and ***Sinners*** arrived at the right time to offer just that. The film's fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either; it's sitting at a marvelous 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84/100 on Metacritic. That makes it one of the best films of the year, so even non-horror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., the biggest demos were black (49%), Caucasians (27%), Hispanic and Latino (14%), and Asian (6%). They gave it an incredible \"A\" on CinemaScore. This makes it one of the few horror films to get an \"A\" on the site (***Poltergeist*** and ***Aliens*** are the other two) in its 46-year-old history. Yes, it's insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade.\n\nWhat does this mean? That the film is gonna have some damn great legs. It's already seen in the weekend; horror films can drop over 40% on Sunday, yet ***Sinners*** dropped just 25%. With no horror competition till ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, ***Sinners*** can have a lot of space. For now, we're predicting a $170 million domestic total for the film, which is simply fantastic all around.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 48% this weekend, grossing $40.4 million. That's not a bad drop, but it's still rough just like last week's. The film is not collapsing, but it's not showing great legs either. The film has amassed $343.8 million so far, and it should still hit over $450 million domestically. \n\nUnsurprisingly, ***The King of Kings*** benefitted from the Easter weekend. It dipped just 9%, earning $17.5 million this weekend. That's one of the best holds for a film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Through 10 days, the film has earned $45.6 million, although with the holiday over, maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend.\n\n20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** was hit by the arrival of ***Sinners***. It dropped a rough 53%, earning $7 million this weekend. While the film was aiming an old audience that doesn't go to opening weekend, it looks like the film is struggling to leg out. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $27.1 million, and it remains a question mark if it will hit $40 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, A24's ***Warfare*** dipped 42%, adding $4.8 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $17.1 million, and it will probably end its run with around $25 million domestically.\n\nUniversal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** added $3.2 million this weekend, which is a poor 55% drop after its already low start. Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, the audience doesn't appear to be interested in the film. Through 10 days, it has earned just $13.4 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $20 million domestically, making it one of Blumhouse's lowest grossing titles.\n\n***COLORFUL STAGE! The Movie: A Miku Who Can\u2019t Sing*** managed to sneak into the seventh spot, despite playing in just 800 theaters, earning $2.8 million this weekend.\n\nFocus Features' re-release of ***Pride &amp; Prejudice*** earned $2.8 million in 1,393 theaters. That takes its lifetime total to $41.3 million.\n\n***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 3*** collapsed 75% this weekend, earning just $1.5 million this weekend. Through all 3 installments, the show has made $42.9 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Disney's ***Snow White***, which is nearing the end of its run. It had another brutal 58% drop, earning just $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at a poor $84.6 million so far.\n\nBleecker Street released ***The Wedding Banquet*** in 1,142 theaters, although the film earned just $922,906. That means that the film is gonna make less than what Ang Lee's original made back in 1993 ($6.9 million).\n\nBut the real worst performer of the week was Briarcliff's animated film ***Sneaks***. Despite playing in 1,500 theaters, the film earned an abysmal $530,786 this weekend. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 1,000 theaters. Expect this to fade quickly.\n\nAhead of its wide release this week, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** debuted in 4 theaters, earning $52,514. That's a $13,129 per-theater average, which is quite low (usually buzzy titles like this make $25K or more). Let's just hope it can do better when it hits wide release.\n\nJanus Films also released David Cronenberg's ***The Shrouds*** in 3 theaters, where the film earned $49,361. Alos a low $16,454 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** earned $59 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $720 million. The best markets are the UK ($59.2M), Germany ($27.8M), Australia ($27.4M), Mexico ($24.8M) and China ($24M). The billion mark is becoming more and more likely, pals.\n\n***Sinners*** earned $15.4 million in 71 markets, taking its worldwide numbers to $63.5 million. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.2M), France ($2M), Mexico ($1.1M), Germany ($898K) and Australia ($842K). An okay start, but it's pretty clear it's gonna lean heavily on the domestic side.\n\n***The Amateur*** added a further $11.6 million this weekend, for a $63.8 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($4.1M), France ($3.3M), Mexico ($3.2M), Japan ($2.3M) and Spain ($2M). At the very least, it should hit $100 million worldwide. That'd be great if it didn't cost $60 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Dog Man* | Jan/31 | Universal | $36,001,940 | $97,970,355 | $140,534,355 | $40M\n\n- DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** has ended its run with $97 million domestically and $140 million worldwide. Definitely a success, given it cost just $40 million. But something weird about the film are its legs. Normally, animated films leg out to a 3x multiplier. But ***Dog Man*** finished with just a 2.72x multiplier, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films. While the Super Bowl impacted its second weekend, not hitting the $100 million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing. But then again, this should be enough if DreamWorks wants a new franchise.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe've got three wide releases, though it's unlikely any of them can take the top spot.\n\nThe closest that could challenge the top spot is Amazon MGM's ***The Accountant 2***, which brings back Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and J. K. Simmons in their roles. The original film earned $155 million worldwide, and has been a huge success in streaming and home media, so a sequel was pretty much imminent. Although the 9-year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long.\n\nAnother release is Sony's ***Until Dawn***, an adaptation of the video game. Director David F. Sandberg has had success in the horror field, and in fairness, the movie tries to change things up from the game. Nevertheless, the film's premise (a time loop involving different killers) suggests it pretty much abandoned the game's original plot. It remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket.\n\nAnd as mentioned, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** is hitting wide release. The limited release numbers were quite underwhelming, but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Quite possibly the most nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat documentary I've ever watched in my life. My palms were sweaty for like, 90% of the runtime. The way each climb is shot by the filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Vasarhelyi can only be described as epic. The grand scale of Alex Honnold's achievement is presented perfectly by the camera work, from the wide angle shots that frame him dwarfed by the massive wall of death he's climbing, to the tight close-ups of his fingers and feet digging into the rock face. It doubles as both an account of a monumental feat in rock climbing and human endurance, and a character profile about the kind of person that is willing to put his life on the line in the pursuit of perfection. Alex comes across as equally fucking crazy and inspiring. God bless his wife, she's the real hero for having the patience and compassion to deal with this guy's insanity. Highly recommend this if you haven't seen it, definitely worth the watch.",

But despite the family's failures, they are brought together by what really mattered the whole time: their love for one another and a common goal. \n\n  \nIt's also a great look at early Carell and Dano. \n\n  \nDoes anyone else miss those feelgood vibes that we were getting in the early 2000s from indie movies before streaming was huge?",

Not necessarily the best scene ever, or from your favorite movie, but just a single, specific moment that pops up in your head out of nowhere, even years after you've seen it.\n\nWhat's that one scene for you? What movie is it from, and what's so unforgettable about it? Was it something shocking, something beautiful, something weird, or just a really powerful moment?\n\nFor me, it's definitely a few moments from Annihilation. But one that really messed with me was when they get deeper into the Shimmer and you start seeing how the mutations are blending everything together. Like those flowers that had human-like features, or even the way the crew members started to get mixed up with the environment and each other. That whole visual of nature and people merging in this bizarre, unnatural way was so creepy and unsettling. It really made you think about what was happening in that zone. That whole idea of things losing their boundaries and becoming something else\u2026 yeah, that sticks with you. Coming from a person with plant biology background may be a reason. \n\nWhat's that one scene for you? Share the movie and what made that specific moment so unforgettable. Let's hear those scenes that are just stuck to your memory!",

The idea of possession-as-a-service for assassination, with plausible deniability baked into its very mechanics (\u201cno one would believe it anyway\u201d), is such a strong sci-fi premise. But what really blew me away is how \\*\\*expertly it\u2019s implemented\\*\\*.\n\nThe creative violence feels like early Rodriguez if he had a Cronenberg soul. Every shock is earned, not just stylized \u2014 and that final stretch? Devastating. Cronenberg Jr. Doesn\u2019t just live up to his dad\u2019s legacy \u2014 he\u2019s mutating it into something uniquely his own.\n\nI loved it so much I bought a poster. Next on my haul is \\*Possession\\* (1981), which I\u2019ve heard is equally deranged but in a totally different register.\n\nAnyone else vibe with \\*Possessor\\* this hard?
