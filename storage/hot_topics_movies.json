        "content": "I watched the first season of True Detective in the course of the last weeks and I was totally blown away, especially by the performance of McConaughey and also by how well written his character was. It made me want to re-watch Interstellar, since I remembered his acting to be really good in this one, as well. \n\nSo I finished watching the movie a few minutes ago and during watching it, it became clear to me that his character's personality as Rust Cohle in True Detective is the exact opposite of Joseph Cooper's one in Interstellar. While Cohle sees humanity as a flawed, cancerous anomaly of mother nature, which, in his oppinion, would do best by stopping reproducing at all, Cooper believes in the good traits of society so much, that he even risks never seeing his family again, to get the chance of finding a new home for the human race. Both find themselves in a cruel world, where the bad habits of humans have negative impacts on their lives and both share the destiny of having lost a loved one, yet they couldn't be more different in their beliefs and their motivation to endure.\n\nI really love both of McConaughey's performances on their own, but it's the thought of him mastering the challenge to impersonate two absolutely contradictory characters in the same year, both in a very authentic way, which leaves me in awe.\n\nMaybe this is and was quite obvious, back in 2014, and has already been discussed, but it came to me right now and I really wanted to share this :)",

I thought this was crystal clear from the beginning?\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a few movie twists like that where the director clearly thought it was a twist and you\u2019re just like\u2026 really? THAT is a twist? It would have been a bigger twist for that NOT to be the case. \n\nThe other one for me was Charlize Theron being a bad guy in Reindeer Games. The whole time I was watching it I just kept waiting for the moment she\u2019d do something psychotic. And she does. \n\nBy the way what doesn\u2019t count is if everyone kinda new going into a big franchise movie what would happen. Like a lot of people went into Infinity War 99% sure a lot of people were going to die. That doesn\u2019t really count.

How it takes people out of it and there needs to be some explanation why an actor is different. Or some meta-reference (i.e., \"I'm here, deal with it\" from Iron Man 2).\n\nI feel like people these days are less willing to suspend their disbelief. Or think they aren't able to. They want their work of fiction to be 100% canon-perfect or they are being pulled out of it.\n\nWith the Penguin recently, I never questioned the younger actor playing Francis Cob. There was never a disconnect between Emily Meade and Deirdre O'Connell. All it takes is just two good actors, good costuming, and good makeup for me to believe that they were the same character.I tend to find it more distracting when the de-aging hits that uncanny valley. \n\nWhat is your stance on this topic?\n",

        "content": "This time of year there are always posts about the best movies of the year but it's always the same few titles mentioned.\n\nSo what are the best hidden gems you've seen this year? Ones unlikely to be listed on all the year end lists simply because they weren't seen?\n\nFor example, I just watched: Rumours (2024), starring Cate Blanchett and Charles Dance. I haven't seen much discussion of it but it's a great surreal comedy in the vein of Quentin Dupieux. It's doesn't have a great score on Letterboxd, so I understand it's not for everyone, but it's my first encounter with filmmaker Guy Maddin and I loved it. \n\nI'll also mention: Orion and the Dark (2024) written by Charlie Kaufman who manages to apply his meta sensibilities to a kids movie perfectly. \n\nI'd love to hear some recommendations for a chance to catch up on some interesting titles I might have missed.

The way he loses color as he progressively bleeds out has always had me wonder how they did it as the film is done as one tracking shot.",

        "content": "I am not buff, so maybe the assumptions I make in this post are false. But something I've noticed for years is how characters who are muscular in action films tend to grunt a lot or say \"OOF!\" or similar involuntary hings in action scenes. I know this is such a trivial detail, but I find this an odd choice. For example, in scenes wnere the protagonist is of normal build and is being chased by a buff antagonist or grunt, or is fighting one, the buff opponent will do a lot more grunting than the hero. But I'd assume this is not realistic, because physical efforts should be easy for large muscled people?\n\nI first noticed this in the kids movie Spiderwick, when the buff ogre is making all sorts of grunts climbing the house to chase our kid protagonist and the kid is climbing with ease. Here is the scene, two minutes long:\u00a0[https://youtu.be/1xI\\_CHaHWmw?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/1xI_CHaHWmw?feature=shared)\n\nBut then I noticed the same thing happening again and again in adult action films, whether serious or comedy.\n\nIt's not a bid deal. It's just a weird choice directors seem to be making that most people probably don't care about or notice.",

        "content": "A weird rare little gem just popped up onto Amazon streaming. Safe with Julianne Moore was a movie I watched in college. It centers around a housewife in the superficial, chemical world of the late 1980s in California. Some may find this movie boring or slow, but I loved it. Julianne Moore\u2019s character gets increasingly sicker and the viewer is left wondering if her ailments are psychosomatic or environmental. Maybe the truth lies somewhere in between. The film captures that synthetic feel of the 1980s And is barely saturated in color. Moore seems to be lacking in her own agency in her life. She\u2019s childlike and we get very sparse dialogue from her. This character has deep psychological problems and the viewer is left wondering if she will ever find a place internally and externally that\u2019s secure and safe.",
