        "content": "I saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn't prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.\n\nI watch horror movies and usually don't feel disturbed so it's been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.\n\nYou just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.\n\nIt disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outliers but simply because they were limited by the era and conditions they were born into. I don't like thinking of this powerlessness.\n\nWhile watching I felt like I was grieving for my ancestors for what their \"normal\" was, how harsh those times were, and frankly amazed my ancestors survived things like that. It made me feel grateful to be living in modern times, especially with technology. \n\nWhat's a non horror movie that you found perhaps unexpectedly disturbing?",

So many posts, so many comments, saying how wonderful this movie was.  I gave in and watched it last night.\n\nIt's really good.  Yes, just like you have all been screaming at me.  Good action, good comedy, good SFX, all around a great movie.\n\nI really loved Hugh Grant's performance.  He pulls off smarmy and slimy quite well. \n\nAnd I was leaping out of my seat when I saw [live-action versions](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24550574/80_Kids_Arena.png) of [these guys](https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dungeons-Dragons-cartoon.jpg).

        "content": "What film, for whatever reason, just stays with you constantly because you saw it way, way too young to either \"get\" it, or it was just too much for a undeveloped brain?\n\n\\-----------\n\nThere's plenty of films that scarred me, etc. I picked out Friday the 13th Part 2 for a sleep over at like 10 years old. No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)\n\nBut I'm not talking about horror, vs just not \"getting it\" or having adult themes way out of your league?\n\nThe one film I saw because \"cute robots\" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... \n\nBut it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.\n\nI wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",

        "content": "The influences of Alfred Hitchcock are there as \"Raising Cain\" playis like Psycho meets Sybil. Lithgow plays respected Dr Carter Nix who happens to have multiple personalities, some of them being psychotic murderers. Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer. \n\nSupporting roles are fine, I liked Frances Sternhagen as an eccentric psychologist trying to get to Carter Nix. Lolita Davidovich wears beautiful dresses. Steven Bauer has a nude scene. And aging actress Gabrielle Carteris plays a teenager again, this time no glasses and trashy.",
