It\u2019s Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn being effortlessly charming in Paris, with a twisty mystery plot that somehow blends romance, suspense, and comedy without feeling forced.\n\n Hepburn is attempting to find her dead husbands lost money amongst spies and thieves. It\u2019s stylish as hell, funny, weirdly dark in places, and has some great character actors like Walter Matthau and James Coburn all pulling their weight.\n\n It's snappy, modern, and it's even in color! \n\nI\u2019m on here all the time and barely ever see it brought up, even on the classic film subs. Like how is Charade not in regular rotation for people who love Hitchcock-style thrillers or old Hollywood stuff? Is anyone else a fan? \n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/C6T2Q4XO7uA?si=WgRhVNO-KfNWH8bO\n\nHere is the full movie: https://youtu.be/-uc86VH8hdA?si=sSuJTK1EBjYUMKiz",

Like its predecessor, it's delightfully silly, but now we're in an era where those movies aren't made as often... and when someone tries, it's a 50/50 chance they land it. *Happy Gilmore 2* is a solid return to the kind of film that, honestly, there should be more of. Some jokes run too long, don\u2019t land, or could use another draft. It's a constant stream of cameos, which is overall fun but sometimes a little distracting. But, at its core, the sequel is a good-natured charmer about a troubled everyman who is trying hard to grow up without losing himself in the process, and it gives us a lot to laugh about on the way. What more can you ask for?\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/review-adam-sandlers-happy-gilmore-2-may-be-worst-sequel-of-all-time/)\n\n&gt;With all due respect to *Grown Ups 2*, *The Ridiculous 6*, and *Sandy Wexler*, *Happy Gilmore 2* is the bottom of the Sandler barrel\u2014a grim disaster that not only sullies the good name of its ancestor, but so badly flails on its own limited terms that it suggests the A-lister should concentrate on dramatic parts and leave the immature comedy to others.",

He then sticks his tallywhacker through the hole, teasing the girls with it, which they all laugh. Enter MS BALBREAKER. She sees the tallwhacker sticking out into the room. She starts to move towards it, unbeknownst to the boy himself. Soon as she approaches, she grabs onto it with both her hands, attempting to keep him there. \n\n\nThis scene, to this day, it's still one that cracks me up to no end. Interesting side note, the director of Porkys (a very hard R film from the early 80s) is also the director of A CHRISTMAS STORY. ",

        "content": "The 20th century fox fanfare is probably the greatest and most iconic movie fanfare to ever be written. Sometimes I recount memories with my family members much to their annoyance about how as a toddler I used to rewind the dvd or video cassette and play it over and over again and hum along to it. It probably drove them insane. Anyway even now I am a little bit obsessed with it now, perhaps not as much as then but still. The best fanfare arrangement in my opinion is Bruce Broughton's arrangements to which I think about 5 or 6 exist but were only used for a few years exluding on home entertainment logos before David Newman's fanfare, which I don't mind, but I don't like it as much. The only fanfare I can think of that comes close to this is universal. ",

        "content": "Did anyone notice in Superman '25, there was a lack of wide exterior shots of a city skyline. There were no wide-shots of a city landscape with a visible subway/train system or any of that. The closest to being outdoors with the buildings is the Kaiju fight sequence, and if you look for it, you can't see building beyond the street Superman's fighting on.\n\nSuperman '78 you felt like you were in Metropolis as there plenty of exterior shots of authentic New York settings: alleys, taxicabs, streetlights, diners. Superman Returns also had a nice look to it using miniatures to create the wide shot of the city, juxtaposed with the Sydney skyline.\n\nAlso, in 78 and Returns, they're are shots of Superman flying where we see city backdrops. You will notice there are no shots of Superman '25 flying where there're bridges, damns, and other landscapes in the background. Usually when he flies there, it's just sky.\n\nNearly every exterior scene in Superman '25 looks like it was green screen or CGI.\n\nMost of the movie, they place Superman in situations where a Metropolis backdrop isn't required: the Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica, which is just snow and sky, giving them an easy production set. Then there's the Pocket-verse, which an excuse a CGI backdrop. When the heroes travel to Boravia, we don't get shots of them flying there. They just arrive there. And when they do, there's no backdrop of anything. It's just pure sky. It's an obvious studio set. They could've film in a jungle or somewhere.\n\nWhen he is battling in Metropolis, which already looks small, they take the fight to a sinkhole or the sky or the field to get away from the city, basically trying to distract us because they didn't want to pay for a nice detailed Metropolis.\n\nThe whole movie just looks cheap as far as locations go. They spent a lot on CGI but skimped on authentic locations and backdrops.\n\nIn sum, the set design (and cinematography) Superman '78 and Superman Returns are superior to Superman '25 with its generic backdrops thinking we wouldn't notice.\n\nAnd as I side, I have to say, I originally posted this on /comicbookmov... and everyone called me stupid or simply didn't understand what I was talking about. The moderators even deleted my post.\n\nOne commenter sarcastically replied \"Yes they should've shot the movie in Metropolis\" thinking he had a fair point. His logic being Metropolis isn't real, so how could you film there? But then fails to realize The Dark Knight was shot in Chicago and Superman was shot in New York, where real buildings were used for the exterior shots of Daily Planet, Wayne Enterprises, etc.",

        "title": "Looking for an animated movie I saw over 15 years ago\u2014hand-drawn, talking animals, stormy factory prison escape",
        "content": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019ve been searching for this animated movie for over 15 years, and I\u2019m hoping someone here can help me out. I saw it on Boomerang when I was younger (so it must be from the late 90s to early 2000s) and I can only remember a few key scenes and details.\n\n* Animation Style: The movie was hand-drawn, similar to classic Disney films like Robin Hood, The Aristocats, or All Dogs Go to Heaven\u2014so it\u2019s that kind of aesthetic.\n\n* Main Characters: The movie features talking animals, one of which is an older, scruffy dog (possibly a stray) and another is a ginger-and-white cat. I think there were also some kittens involved in the escape.\n\n* Key Scenes:\n\n    1. There\u2019s a scene where the grey dog gets locked in a narrow, chimney-like prison cell made of stone bricks. The dark stormy clouds can be seen through the top, and the dog becomes angry (his eyes turn red as he gets enraged). He uses this anger to escape, jumping from wall to wall until he reaches the top.\n\n    2. Toward the end of the film, there\u2019s a shot of an army jeep driving away from a factory. The tarps on the back flap in the wind, and the ginger-and-white cat escapes with her kittens. The scene is stormy, with wind blowing the flaps back and revealing them.\n\n* Tone and Setting: The film wasn\u2019t focused solely on this prison\u2014it was just a part of the movie. The setting is more realistic with no magical elements. It\u2019s a modern-day environment, and there are no main human characters\u2014just the animals trying to escape.\n\n* What it\u2019s NOT:\n\n    * It\u2019s not \"Watership Down\", \"Balto\", or \"The Rescuers\"\u2014those movies have different animation styles or fantasy elements that don\u2019t match what I remember.\n\n    * This is also not Plague Dogs. The animation style is also different\u2014think more classic Disney-style (similar to Robin Hood, The Aristocats, etc.) rather than the darker, more realistic tone of Plague Dogs.\n\nI\u2019ve been searching for this movie for so long and haven\u2019t had any luck, so if anyone has any ideas, I\u2019d really appreciate it!\n",

        "content": "Might be hard to explain but here I go... Sort of in 2 parts / observations. \n\nMovies these days are shot more up close. It feels like 90s films had more of a zoomed out lens and shots in general when filming? Of course there were close up's but it's drastically different when you compare films now a days. I understand the tech is different  \n\nIt also seems like everything is going so much quicker and they're trying too hard for certain scenes/phrases. Is it because of attention spans? Feels much more rushed \n\nI could just be extremely biased because I don't watch many modern movies. \n\nI just watched Happy Gilmore 2... It was alright... But does not compare to the first one. It made me also realise the differences noted in this post. \n\nI'm probably just getting old. Anyone else feel the same? \n",

Something about the movie just really affected me on an emotional level. Another one Children of Men, which hit me like a brick with its bleak, grounded vision of a dying future. The world is ending yet people continue on with their lives and go to work anyway. Haunting.",
