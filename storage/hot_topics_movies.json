        "content": "I think the first film is a masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films of all time. Maybe not number 1 but top 5 if not 3. I watched it last year for the first time in years. I didn\u2019t think it would be all that good anymore with how lifeless the series felt in the modern age. But no. It\u2019s still an amazing movie that lives on its simplicity. Dinosaurs are brought back. At first it seems magical. Then it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nAnd now with the seventh movie in the franchise coming out I\u2019m feeling that same tired and apathetic feeling I felt before I re-experienced the original. This really feels like it was not meant to be a franchise. The first film is very simple and the minute you try to stretch it beyond that you lose the appeal. It\u2019s not like Indiana Jones where you can have multiple adventures. That\u2019s why we have Dial of Destiny a chance because a fifth movie could\u2019ve worked. But with Jurassic I just can\u2019t see it. \n\nAnd I feel like with how lifeless the series feels now it\u2019s easier and easier to forget how amazing the first one actually is. Which is why I\u2019m not even bothering to see this one. I saw some reviews of it and that was enough for me to learn this wasn\u2019t worth my time or money. We should listen to the ending of the first one and let these creatures stay gone and not try to bring them back because it never works.\n\nNot sure how anyone else feels about this. For anyone who has actually seen it is there actually something in Rebirth that\u2019s worth while?  ",

        "content": "EDIT: A big thank you to everyone who looked for this movie. I want to reassure you it's\u00a0**not bride of chucky or urban legengs: bloody mary**\u00a0(the final girl was visibly bi-racial, chucky wasn't in it etc.). I'm starting to think it was a cheap, softcore, direct to DVD one off. A few people commented who remembered this movie as well. None of us could remember anything outside of the details I shared in my post. With that, I'm gonna call it. If anyone does find it please DM. Thanks again!\n\n\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019m looking for a very specific movie. I haven\u2019t met anyone that\u2019s seen it but I\u2019m hoping movie buffs in this sub can help. I hope it\u2019s alright to ask.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was a kid I saw a movie in the early 2000\u2019s (possibly late 90\u2019s) about a group of young adults in a house (not sure whose house it was or why they were there). But one by one they were being murdered by a mask figure. Pretty generic but what stood it out was how sexual it was. A lot of nudity and sex. While it wasn\u2019t an actual porn film, there was a lot of nudity and a few memorable scenes:\u00a0\n\nA couple is having sex in a large bed with a red canopy. On the (I guess) ceiling of the canopy is a large mirror. The masked figure breaks the mirror and the couple is impaled while the woman is on top of the man. The mirror goes through both of them. I also recall a scene at the beginning of the movie where the final girl has sex at night on a beach while being watched by the masked figure.\n\nAnother memorable part of the movie is the twist ending (major spoiler alert):\n\nThe final girl is biracial (half black). At the end of the movie, the killer removes his mask and it\u2019s a white male. It turns out he\u2019s her father. I think she set fire to the house and he dies inside of the house (not 100% sure it's been 20ish years).\n\nI\u2019m trying to find this movie because this one ignited my love of slasher films. I\u2019ve seen countless ones since but never this one again. Does anyone know the title of this movie?",

        "content": "I am enjoying rewatching iRobot (2004) with Will Smith this week.  I haven\u2019t\u2019 watched it in over a decade.  What stands out, in particular, is how sharp (picture quality) and good the futuristic visuals look.  The world-building is well done and enjoyable to be immersed in.  \n\nIt\u2019s also got great acting from a charismatic cast and has decent plot with tension/suspense.  \n\n  \nAnyone else still enjoy this 20+ year old movie?  If so, what do you like most about it?",

        "title": "The Real story of Big Fish",
        "content": "I originally watched the movie Big Fish once in theaters because I love Tim Burton movies and I loved the movie for being a fanciful stretch of reality like Edward Scissorshands.\n\nI just watched the movie again with my wife and kids and I get a new perspective from the dad.  The stories are mostly real but they are somewhat more frightening as a real tale without the softened edges for the son.  There are major historical events in Big Fish that I think Tim Burton weaved into the story to give the son perspective without trying to scare him while the father deals with his own issues.  The stories come with real life issues like depression, cowardice, PTSD, paralysis, and risk of death.\n\nWhat if your son asked you about your time in war?  A lot of people just didn't talk about it after WW2.  A lot of people went nuts after their time in Vietnam.  Here, the father gets to tell the tale of almost dying by ignoring the dark parts and violenc by emphasizing his recruitment of twins for defection for a carnival act, and managing them as he worked his way home across multiple Communist countries; rather than telling a tale about his family thinking he was dead, the hardship of war, and his desertion from the military after being a POW (the book version has the boat he was on being sank off of North Korea).\n\nWhat if your son wanted to ask you about your childhood and you spent a long time paralyzed from polio hooked up to machines that pushed and pulled on your body?  You were paralyzed in youth because there were no polio vaccines before 1953 (before Korean War and up to 30 years before end of Vietnam War).  Your son was fully vaccinated and you never even told you about the scare of life with polio (heck, a lot of anti-vaxxers now grew up with vaccines and never knew what polio was).  How do you tell your child about a risk in your life that he will never have to face in his lifetime?\n\nEvery two weeks, you save for a home for your wife and kids.  You put away money for years while your wife and kids live in a trailer park.  You scrimp and save only to have it wiped away by the oil speculation crash of 1986.  Only, the stock crash isn't only affecting Texans, you go home to Alabama to find this gambling destroyed small towns like Spectre as well after Black Monday in 1987.  The father happens to know people who retained their wealth through the crash and he makes a predatory purchase on the whole town of Spectre for pennies on the dollar (via public tax auction).  Then he places it in trust so his friends can get steady payments on the city while he \"saves\" some childhood friends.  Instead of telling the son about exploiting people at their worst and taking advantage after the big banks reamed people over, the dad gets to spin it as a tale of being an accidental bank robber and advising a friend to becoming an even bigger villain in a comical way.  Additionally, he avoids telling his son that he also lost all the family money in speculation by saying a robber took his money.\n\nWorking for a circus with a homeless giant you met battling by the river has a more magical ring is just it's own thing.  The werewolf at night that rages may have been helping Danny Devito deal with his demons like alcohol abuse after hours in his trailer.\n\nTim Burton wrote the movie based on the book but also his own relationship with his own dad.  I think there was more real truths than lies in this story.\n",

He describes the story as offering \"the perfect blend of a great literary story and a spectacular adventure tale.\"\n\n# Official Synopsis\n\n\"After enduring 16 years of imprisonment for stealing a loaf of bread, Jean Valjean emerges a hardened man. He seeks redemption by reinventing himself as a respected dignitary under a new identity. He promises Fantine, a dying factory worker, to rescue and protect her daughter Cosette, who is being exploited and mistreated by the deceitful Th\u00e9nardier family. As Valjean raises Cosette as his own, he is relentlessly pursued by Inspector Javert. Amidst the social unrest shaking France, the destinies of Valjean, Cosette, her lover Marius, and Javert intertwine in a turbulent, revolutionary Paris. Through struggles, sacrifices, and a profound yearning for justice, Valjean strives to complete his journey of redemption and offer Cosette a future of love and freedom.\"\n\n[https://deadline.com/2025/04/tahar-rahim-camille-cottin-noemie-merlant-les-miserables-1236379102/](https://deadline.com/2025/04/tahar-rahim-camille-cottin-noemie-merlant-les-miserables-1236379102/)\n\n  \nThe film's release is scheduled for November 11, 2026, possibly to avoid competing with Nolan's film. I vividly remember the series with G\u00e9rard Depardieu as Jean Valjean and John Malkovich as Javert, which, in my opinion, was one of the best portrayals of Javert. There was also the 2018 BBC series with Dominic West, David Oyelowo, and Lily Collins. The casting of a Black actor as Javert sparked considerable [criticism.It](http://criticism.It) seems that the commercial success of The Count of Monte Cristo, starring Pierre Niney, encouraged France to adapt other classics. However, this adaptation, at best, is mediocre. The idea that Hayd\u00e9e simply falls in love with the son of the man who killed her father, as if declarations of love and romantic words could erase her past traumas and make her fall for the son of the man who ruined her life, is utterly ridiculous. If we dig deeper into the script, particularly regarding the issue of Hayd\u00e9e's memory, the inconsistencies in the storyline become even more apparent.",
