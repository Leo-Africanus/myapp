        "content": "Hey there. So I have recently done a post in this subreddit asking about movies that were ruined by studio interference and meddling.\nAnd I got a comment saying that the opposite isn't talked about enough.\nIt got me thinking what are some movies that were saved by studio interference/meddling.\nThe best examples I found of studio interference making a movie better were:\nPredator (1987) The Studio insisted that the movie did not have enough gun fight scenes. As a result, McTiernan added the scene where the team looses it shoot their guns off into the jungle in every direction.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979) The studio insisted that Francis Ford Coppola, reduce the run time by an hour. So he edited out a number of scenes. If you have ever seen Redux you know how good of an idea it was.\n\nThe Warriors (1979): The studio made Walter Hill remove the comic book panels that he had originally put in the movie. The director\u2019s cut reinstates the comic-book scenes that Hill wanted and they just don't work.\n\nAlien (1979) The studio (producers Walter Hill and David Giler) added in the character of Ash, which original co-writer Dan O\u2019Bannon felt was a completely unnecessary addition. If They Hadn\u2019t Stepped In: We wouldn\u2019t have had Ash, which means we potentially wouldn\u2019t have had the whole Weyland-Yutari conspiracy plot.\n\nSo with these examples out of the way, does anyone have any other examples of movies being saved like this?",

Took risks, was a frank and self aware retelling, and made me appreciate someone I previously judged badly for being a twat. The music integrated incredibly well, to the point where the story built into the songs and I felt the plot transcend into the lyrics. The monkey \u201cbit\u201d works perfectly to support underlying message and somehow did not detract from visual. Not to mention his sober portrayal of himself as a self aggrandizing, selfish, drug addicted, and fame obsessed person. Did not try to make excuses for himself yet I came out a fan. \n\nComplete Unknown was ok and predictable. Better Man deserves the Oscar noms. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss! Main flaw in my argument could be Robbie is a more \u201cflawed\u201d person than Bob which drove the story in a way that suits my personal preferences\u2026",

        "title": "\"Worst\" movie you defend to the death?",
        "content": "I don't mean defend in a \"so bad its good\" way i mean defend in a \"you're all misunderstanding this masterpiece\" kind of way.\n\nFor me its AVP Requiem.\n\nAnd i'll tell you why.\n\nYes, maybe the lighting was bad but i was watching it on my PC so i never experienced the theater viewing, but i think all of the characters were well characterized, their dynamics well explored. I've heard people complain that we never hear what the main character did to go to jail or why he was friends with the sherrif, but i honestly think there's nothing wrong with that, we don't need to know, the movie does a great job of simply showing that although this guy has a rough past, he very clearly has a very very long relationship with the sherrif, by him getting home from jail it shows him as being bold.\n\nThe predalien and the aliens in the movie were extremely intimidating, it seemed like all of the characters, except for Wolf, were completely powerless. The predalien looked awesome as well, so that's a plus.\n\nThe movie is also EXTREMELY ballsy in it's edginess, i can't think of many other cheesy action movies for mainstream audiences that kill children and has pregnant women die in horrific ways. Not to mention the attractive love interest being absolutely massacred? I can't think of a single one of the copy-cat summer blockbusters that did that.\n\nIt's one of my favorite Alien/Predator movies, maybe a tier below, well, Alien and Predator lol\n\nSo yeah, thats mine, whats yours?",
