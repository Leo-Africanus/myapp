        "content": "The first Fast and Furious was actually locked on to the import tuner crowd trend, which was getting popular in the late 90s. If you're not a car guy, you don't realize this fairly accurate under current plot line.\n\nIf you were an American gear head in the 90s, you witnessed this trend with interest (kinda started in Cali and moved into the midwest). You had guys like me who grew up in the 70s thinking that American pushrod V8s were the only way to make power, and now all of a sudden you really had to give respect to 700bhp overhead cam V6s in Supras and Skylines.\n\nIt's really hard to overstate how intelligent Dom's mechanics were to be doing what they were doing in the movie, but that was really happening in the 90s in just a handful of renegade type shops across the country. It was kind of a magical 'coming of age' time for gear heads imo.\n\nYes, the first movie was mainly about cops and robbers, but they had to have hired some consultant who was tapped into this rising trend of Japanese turbo/nitrous muscle cars that could actually turn corners well. To me the first movie was all about the import tuner car counter culture.\n\nThe Fast sequels kind of lost the car enthusiast feel and just became more generic car chase/crime/action movies.\n\nI bet there are other movies where the main plot line is what most viewers focus on, but those who knew the particular trend at the time can see this underlying theme that other people miss the significance of.\n\n",

        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anaconda_2025): 46% (61 reviews) with 5.40 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anaconda-2025/): 44/100 (25 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; While the new film dutifully serves up the callbacks you\u2019d expect, you never get a sense of why these buddies connected to this property more than any other. It\u2019s enough to make me wish I could have seen Doug\u2019s The Anaconda instead. Sure, his \u201cindie-style\u201d project seems to feature a nonsense plot, amateurish acting and extremely questionable action. But at least it would be a labor of love. Gormican\u2019s Anaconda is just a big-budget IP extension trying to pretend it\u2019s something sweeter and scrappier than it is. You don\u2019t need to fall prey to its pretense.\n\n-[Angie Han, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/anaconda-review-paul-rudd-jack-black-1236454664/)\n\n&gt; \u201cAnaconda\u201d constricts its premise a little tighter as it moves along (if only because the absurdity ratchets up in a way that forces the film to adopt a clearer sense of itself), and there are some undeniably amusing bits of stupidity along the way. The post-modern stuff tends to fall flat, but, say, the sequence where Jack Black runs for his life with a regurgitated hog strapped to his back is hard to deny. And honestly, all I\u2019ve ever asked of a movie \u2014 any movie \u2014 is that it make at least two jokes at Jon Voight\u2019s expense, and on that score I have no choice but to acknowledge that Gormican\u2019s meta-sequel delivers, if only just. Still, this self-reflexive Hollywood sendup is so slapdash and unsure of itself that it ultimately feels less like a bad in-joke than a case of a snake eating its own tail. \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anaconda-movie-review-2025-paul-rudd-jack-black-1235169505/): C\n\n&gt; The movie could have really used some of that anarchic, industry-skewering \u201cTropic Thunder\u201d energy. The only risk taken here was asking Sony \u2014 plus any surviving members of the original cast \u2014 to poke fun at themselves, which only goes so far when the film has no fangs.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anaconda-review-1236610556/)\n\n&gt; Anaconda is a disappointing follow-up for Gormican, who cannot crack the code on Sony's bewildering aquatic not-really-horror reboot. A cast of proven funny people are lost in a thick brush of hacky bits and ineffective storytelling, unable to machete their way through to a redeeming climax. There are brief bursts of creature-feature excitement and belly-tickling humor, but way more stretches of bafflingly unclear ambitions that feel like they're struggling to keep the \"movie within a movie\" gimmick afloat. It's Anaconda without the aqua-horror chills, throwback practical effects, and midnight-movie entertainment \u2014 what an odd choice.\n\n-[Matt Donato, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/anaconda-2025-review-jack-black-paul-rudd): 4 out of 10 \"bad\"\n\n&gt; If \u201cAnaconda\u201d had actually been made for $40,000 \u2014 no stars, all new faces \u2014 its pluckiness might have shined through and a message of some kind might actually have been made. Or at least, to quote Gormican\u2019s movie, \u201cThemes!\u201d Instead we get a movie where big name actors punch downward, at the helpless \u201cAnaconda\u201d movies, and at audiences who like \u201cAnaconda\u201d movies, and at all the low-budget filmmakers who work very hard to make good movies, even the schlocky ones. When all is said and done, it can\u2019t hold a candle to all the genuine, ultra-low budget, unapologetic claptrap it\u2019s lampooning. Well, except for \u201cAnacondas: Trail of Blood.\u201d They can\u2019t all be winners. The new \u201cAnaconda\u201d proves that.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/anaconda-review-paul-rudd-jack-black-thandiwe-newton/)\n\n&gt; Regrettably, the one star of Anaconda that gets the shortest shrift is the most important one: the snake. While the film features some monstrous attacks, they play out like something out of an especially uninspired SNL digital short. Sure, the original film and its increasingly lower-budgeted sequels may be funny, but they still pay respect to their creature-feature roots. If Gormican and company had more seriously considered why this particular piece of I.P. continues to resonate, the film may have potentially balanced the horror and comedy elements in a manner that would have satisfied both fans and newcomers to the series.\n\n-[Mark Hanson, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/anaconda-review-jack-black-paul-rudd/): 2/4\n\n&gt; Rudd and Black make the new Anaconda easy enough to accept as a comedy with a dash of clunky effects-based creature action, rather than a full-blown horror-comedy. Intense fandom of the earlier film isn\u2019t necessary to have a good-enough time at this one, and Gormican deserves some credit for smuggling a mid-2000s-style studio comedy back into theaters under the guise of IP (the universal desire for which also gets shouted out here, naturally). Anaconda never reaches the delirious heights of Steve Martin\u2019s similarly themed comedy Bowfinger. But it shares more DNA with that movie than some silly giant snake.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/23/anaconda-review-jack-black-paul-rudd): 3/5\n\n&gt; Anaconda may be getting the benefit of the doubt here because of how few studio comedies make it to theaters. In another era, it might easily have gotten lost in a wave of post-modern updates that included The Brady Bunch and Starsky &amp; Hutch. Its plot offers few surprises, but its simple foundations and character motivations give Rudd and Black so much room to play that it\u2019s an amiable time. The two stars keep the energy and charisma in strong supply, while their film uses low expectations to its advantage, knowing that a good comedy doesn\u2019t need to squeeze too hard.\n\n-[Matt Schimkowitz, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/anaconda-review-2025): B\u2013\n\n&gt; Anaconda\u2019s early scenes, set in Buffalo and seemingly shot there, look appropriately shabby; the interiors are cluttered and drab, and filled with overexposed daylight pouring in from unshaded windows. For a couple of minutes, Rudd and Black\u2019s characters get to act like authentic friends who\u2019ve lost touch and reconnected over their mutual love of movies, over this art form\u2019s power to tell stories that unite people in the dark through their shared connection and humanity. Then they go and run from a CGI snake for an hour. One sad I thought had watching Anaconda: If this is the only stuff modern Hollywood makes now, would these aspiring auteurs even want to work there anymore?\n\n-[Matt Singer, Screen Crush](https://screencrush.com/anaconda-2025-review/): 4/10\n\n&gt; The thing about a film like the original Anaconda is that arguments about whether it was good or not are beside the point \u2014 it fell squarely into that prime Blockbuster Video era in which a film could be so inescapable that its quality for a certain generation is incidental. A sequence in which Doug, Griff, Kenny, and Claire reminisce gleefully about scenes from this bit of pop-culture ephemera they caught during college gets at this fact perfectly, that what they\u2019re pining for is not the movie itself, but this stretch of their lives in which they had time to hang out with their friends. The rest of Anaconda, which involves a quirky Brazilian snake handler played by Selton Mello and a mysterious local with dangerous secrets played by Daniela Melchior, unfolds clumsily and, worse, too earnestly, as though the point all along were to rediscover the magic of filmmaking. Son of Rambow this isn\u2019t. Anaconda may have always been asking too much of its source material, but this reboot has been fatally defanged.\n\n-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-jack-blacks-anaconda-asks-too-much-of-nostalgia.html)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nFour childhood friends: Doug, Griff, Kenny, and Claire, seeking to recapture their youth, travel to the Amazon to film an amateur remake of the 1997 film *Anaconda*. Their project unravels when a real giant anaconda emerges, turning the light-hearted shoot into a perilous fight to stay alive. The movie that they're dying to remake? It might just kill them, literally.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nTom Gormican\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nTom Gormican &amp; Kevin Etten\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nDavid Fleming\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nNigel Bluck\n\n**EDITORS**\n\nCraig Alpert &amp; Gregory Plotkin\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\nDecember 25, 2025\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n99 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$45 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Paul Rudd as Ronald \"Griff\" Griffen Jr.\n\n- Jack Black as Doug McCallister\n\n- Steve Zahn as Kenny Trent\n\n- Thandiwe Newton as Claire Simons\n\n- Daniela Melchior as Ana Almeida\n\n- Selton Mello as Santiago Braga\n\n- Ione Skye as Malie McCallister",

But cause must happen eventually. It's paradoxical, but the protagonists use this to their advantage when they understand how things work. Unlike a bootstrap paradox, where the point of origin doesn't exist, you at least know what the cause is in TENET.!&lt;\n\nNow I'm not necessarily looking for something similar, but it fits the idea of the protagonists being in a bootstrap, and they can either accept it or fight against it (most likely failing, otherwise it wouldn't happen at all, right?). I don't care if they break the paradox or if they continue the cycle, I just want them to realize it sooner than the point of no return.",

I know it\u2019s not particularly popular because of the overly dark and gritty aesthetic as well as some questionable choices regarding Ms. Cratchit. HOWEVER I really appreciate how much time they dedicated to Scrooges past to explain how he became this gnarled old bastard instead of just kind hand waving it off. Guy Pierce also plays a fantastic Ebenezer.  \n\nAnyway, what are your favorite versions? Give me some new variants to watch this year. ",
