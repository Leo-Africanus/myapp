Discuss your game cards, official rulings, and generally anything Oscar Bingo related. Most importantly, have fun!\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\n#- [Game Card Generator](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php)\n\n\n---\n\nHere are some official rules for tonight's game:\n\n- Official rulings on the more subjective answers will be posted in the comments by me. They are open for discussion but at the end of the day I have final say.\n\n- 5 in a row wins. Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. None of this weird four corners bullshit.\n\n- /u/ me to ping me if you have a question. But also be aware, I'm multitasking this, the oscar thread, and getting fucked up.\n\n- If you win, be sure to yell \"BINGO\" as loud as you can wherever you are. If you want to post your winning gamecard and collect your modest karma, that would be cool too.\n\n- This is for fun. Don't take it too seriously and don't spend too much time arguing with official rulings. \n\n- This should go without saying, but only things shown on screen during the ceremony will count. No first hand accounts or background activities. Also, no pre-show. No one wants the game to be over before it begins!\n\n- [Here's last years game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n\n------\n\n\nHave fun and a big thanks to print-bingo.com helping make this fun and easy for everyone!",

        "content": "\nVisually? Absolutely stunning. The animation is insane, and the action scenes are super well-done. The world-building had so much potential, and you can tell they put a lot of effort into making the different regions feel distinct. But the story? Kinda mid. It\u2019s got a solid message about trust and unity, but everything moves way too fast, so the emotional moments don\u2019t really hit as hard as they should.\n\nAlso, Sisu\u2026 I get what they were going for, but her humor feels really out of place sometimes. Like, it\u2019s supposed to be this serious, emotional journey, and then she\u2019s cracking modern-sounding jokes that just don\u2019t fit. The side characters are cool but don\u2019t get enough time to shine, and the resolution feels kinda too easy considering how big the conflict is.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s not a bad movie at all\u2014it\u2019s fun, it looks great, and it has some solid action. But it definitely could\u2019ve been way better with stronger pacing and more character development. Would I rewatch it? Probably not. I give it a 6/10, and the movie was forgotten pretty fast. What do you guys think? (had to delete and repost to change flair)\n",

        "content": "I recently watched Spring, and I think it did a pretty good job of using the body horror/Lovecraft elements as a B plot, with the romance front and center. The majority of the film was getting to know the characters and their burgeoning relationship, with horror sprinkled in amidst it all.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other movies that do this well? I really like romance, and I really like horror (especially monster/body horror), so I'm hoping to dig deeper into this subgenre that squishes them together.",

        "content": "Just rewatched this and wondering again, why do you think this wasn't a big hit back in the day?\n\nIt had the added bonus of being based off of a super popular novel by Thomas Harris. It had Michael Mann as a director, and the performances are amazing. Especially William Petersen is incredible in this. But I also think Brian Cox is a great and more believable Lecter than Hopkins.\n\nAdd great cinematography and soundtrack, imho.\n\nWhy do you think this film sank and the whole Hannibal Lecter as an incredible villain didn't catch on until Silnece of the Lambs? I love SOTL, but why was this so ignored?",

Was that Kiki and Yves? When he returns to his apartment he says it was a set up and he had been meant to be in the cage. \nBut I'm just confused what that scene at Yves house represents. ",
