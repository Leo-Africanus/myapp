Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.\n\n\"What's it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?\"\n\nThere\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties, that was rare.. anyways I just find it refreshing and think the movie has aged remarkably well!",

        "content": "I should start by saying that I am very new to the film world and I have basically zero taste. I am not a bona fide \"film bro\". Even when I know a movie is good I usually have to have it explained to me as to *why* it's good. So forgive me if I am painting in broad strokes and praising things that aren't viewed as super exceptional in the movie world.\n\n---\n\nI just watched *The French Dispatch* (2021) and oh my God, it was *great*. It was amazing. Dear Lord, I can't even put it into words.\n\nI've met lots of people who really don't like Wes Anderson's movies and find them too full of themselves, so I decided to educate myself on his work a bit more. Last night I streamed *The Grand Budapest Hotel* (2014) which was phenomenal\u2014 almost worthy of a Reddit post itself\u2014 but tonight's feature of TFD was just out of this world. I feel high coming out of it.\n\nI wasn't kidding before when I said I don't know *why* I like films. I can't put my finger down as to why I was glued to my seat for the whole 1h48 runtime.\n\nThe nostalgia for a time when there was romance and nobility in the now widely-despised profession of journalism?\n\nThe trope of the \"tortured artist\" made actually interesting and not masturbatory?\n\nThe scene of the art auctioneers discussing what distinguishes an actual abstract artist from a phoney?\n\nThe sentimental depiction of the student pubs where I've squandered so much of my youth so far?\n\nThe ridiculous yet addictive dialog that I'm lowkey unintentionally emulating in this post?\n\nFull frontal female nudity/Chalamet with his cock out?\n\nI need some time to process this. This might be one of those movies that I need to watch a second time in order to fully understand it. But I'm totally hooked into the Anderson cult. *Asteroid City* (2023) and *The Phoenecian Scheme* (2025) both look really interesting (even though I hate Michael Cera). Any recommendations what I should see next?",

Occasionally I'll get in the mood to watch a good movie that I've never seen before and this one was hanging out on my must watch movie list for awhile now so I finally got some snacks put aside and gave it a watch. \n\nIt is a perfect movie, it's got every emotion, and every attribute and quality that makes a good movie. I put this movie up there with Holes, it's got the laughs, the suspense, the shock, the smiles, everything. \n\nI'm actually likely to watch this movie for a second time in the next week, I think it would be even more fun to rewatch, since I'll know all the characters and their names already.   \n\nIf you love a good movie and haven't seen this movie yet, put it on your to watch list like I did! \n\nIf anyone has any movie suggestions let me know!

        "content": "It's just about completely faded from cultural memory, but this animated TV movie from 1982 is at the top of my childhood favorites. Other Rankin/Bass productions, like The Last Unicorn, might have more popularity, but I think this takes first place.\n\nThe mixing of the real world and magical realms is quite unique and not copied all that much. If you're a Ghibli fan or just into anime generally, this could be a great recommendation for ya. Need more convincing? Just watch Ommadon's speech! Every word out his mouth is coated in delicious villainy. ",

But you don't need to just limit yourself to the visual aspect of a film. \n\nSo films that did something unique through their subject-matter, performance-styles or narrative structure would be just as welcome, as movies that were pioneers in terms of technical or filmmaking achievements",
