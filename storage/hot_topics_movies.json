        "title": "Moonrise Kingdom (2012) is the ultimate youth rebellion coming-of-age drama.",
        "content": "It is a great representation of friendship, compassion, and youthful innocence. In the film, we see two young lovers rebel against society and try to find their own lives. A typical coming-of-age story, it begins with a young orphan named Sam trying to find himself in society by participating in volunteer work during wartime. He then tries to flee the nest by escaping his camp and his foster parents. As the story progresses, he eventually finds himself in the vast, open world, falling in love with another young, rebellious girl named Suzy. Their friendship bonds as they sit by the campfire, tell stories, wander through the maze of lush green forests, and sit on the beach as the tiny waves ripple on the golden sand. Sam and Suzy are two of the most endearing children in the Wes Anderson universe, especially Suzy, who acts as an older, mother-like figure to Sam as she reads stories to him and helps guide him on his journey.\n\nThe final torrential downpour of the storm is very suspenseful and full of terror and chaos\u2014something not very typical in a tender Wes Anderson piece. However, Sam\u2019s quiet bravery and Suzy\u2019s unwavering trust crystallize amid the madness. It acts as both a literal and symbolic climax: a cleansing force and a psychological shock that disrupts the rigid order of the adult world and makes space for genuine connection. The children act like adults, and the adults act like children. Visual absurdity and emotional sincerity end the film with a quiet resolution and a sense that, somehow, these two outsiders have found a place where they belong. A typical Wes Anderson ending, its abruptness gives the audience a sense of bittersweetness and unresolved tension.",

Looking for movies with a similar vibe doesn\u2019t have to be space, just something that makes you feel and think.\n\nAlready seen: Arrival, The Martian, Ad Astra, 2001, Gravity.\n\nAny gems I\u2019m missing?",

        "content": "This was just on TV last week which made me remember it, even though it is in my top 20 movie list. It tells of virtually every phase a long term relationship goes through and it does it unflinchingly.  Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are at the top of their game, even though they are required to be low-key.\n\nIt is also the first movie I have seen that tells the story in a non-linier fashion, think Pulp Fiction. The device they use to switch stories is very clever.\n\nIMHO it still holds up well even after 50+ years. If you like to watch adult movies, which are rare now, I can highly recomend it.",

The 2nd one felt like a movie directed by 3 or 4 different people with several different writers. Didn't have the tone as the 1st one at all, the humor was a bit better than the 1st, but good lord #2 was such a let down.",
