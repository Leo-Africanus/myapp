        "content": "When I think of movies from the 1970's, the first thing that pops into my head is that brown, film grained, dirty look that everything had, especially films like Rocky, The Jerk, and Taxi Driver. That sleazy, 1970's look of adult theatres, liquor stores, litter, exhaust fumes, and LOTS of brown/wood everything. Ironically enough, the movie that I think encapsulates that specific style the best is a film that almost wasn't even released during the 1970's at all.\n\nBlues Brothers is a pretty obvious parody/homage of a lot of the tropes that went on with a lot of 1970's action films, specifically the over-the top car chases, and it got me wondering if that also carried over into the visual style of the movie as well? There's so many shots in this movie that nail the look that if someone asked me \"what do movies from the 1970's look like?\" I could just show them stills from Blues Brothers and they'd understand what I meant immediately, like when Elwood is parking the Bluesmobile at Jake's in that dirty alley with that red light. Such a cool shot. But it got me wondering if it was done on purpose to pay homage to the style (and take it over the top) like how someone like Tarantino would do years later, or if it was just a product of its' time?",

It was the Sci-Fi/Horror aspects/special FXs of the film. \n\nBut as an adult, I loved it even more when I grasped what a tragedy it was. Seth Brundle, a good man by all accounts, finalized his life's work. An invention that will change the world. He also meets the love of his life at the same time. \n\nHe seemed to be peaking in all facets of life, but he ruined everything by carelessly putting himself through the telepods and turning himself into a monster. \n\nA good person, reaching the apex of life only for everything to end so tragically (for everyone involved).\n\nI cry almost everytime I really think about what happened to Seth in that movie.

        "content": "I saw a guy on TikTok say that he is going to show his son \"Beauty and the Beast\" to teach him that he should never try to rescue a girl from an abusive boyfriend because she'll always choose him and screw you over. \n\nObviously, that's an insane take but using the plot of the movie it's not wrong. It's not like he misunderstood the movie. It's just a terrible lesson to take from it. I've also seen American History X spoken of as a movie about how &gt;!going woke won't save you from black violence, since the kid is killed by a black kid at the end after getting over his racism!&lt;  \n\nAny other examples you can think of where the plot of the movie could easily teach you an atrocious life lesson?",

On the other, I'm perplexed by their total ignorance of them. I don't remember being equally unaware of the films that came out before I was born. Maybe I hadn't seen them all, but I was at least vaguely aware of their existence.\n\nBut I realize that today we're exposed to so much content that it's perfectly normal to ignore what \"came before.\" These days, we don't know what boredom is. There's so much new stuff out there that you have to make a conscious effort to seek out something old.",
