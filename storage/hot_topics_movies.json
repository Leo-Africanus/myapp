        "content": "Hi Reddit.  I\u2019m Rob Sarkies, New Zealand director of Pike River (starring the wonderful Mel Lynskey).  Pike River is a drama that depicts a mining tragedy that affected an entire community and their fight for justice and accountability.  It was made in close collaboration with the real subjects so questions around process of working with real people to tell their stories in a dramatic form might be of particular interest to some.  But it's an AMA so happy to answer any questions at all, of course, including random questions about New Zealand! Can\u2019t wait to connect with you all on Monday - Rob Sarkies\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4)\n\n  \n**Synopsis:**\n\n&gt;On Nov. 19, 2010, a coal mine explosion in New Zealand kills Anna Osborne's husband and Sonya Rockhouse's son, along with 27 other men. The two women soon embark on a quest for truth and justice, leading to change they never thought possible.\n\nThe movie is out on digital now.\n\nAsk me anything. I'll be back Monday 2/9 at 5 PM ET to answer questions.",

        "title": "*Update!* Last year, Danny Boyle did an ama. I commented and told him about how much 127 Hours means to me. He responded and said he sent me a card.",
        "content": "In case If anyone reading this isn\u2019t familiar with what happened, I\u2019m autistic and 127 Hours has been my special interest for nearly 15 years. I\u2019ve watched it over a thousand times. I\u2019m known as the 127 Hours girl on Letterboxd and the Letterboxd subreddit.\n\nDanny did an ama for 28 Years Later. I knew if I had an opportunity to tell him about 127 Hours, this would be it.\n\nWhen I saw that Danny responded to my comment, I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d see it, let alone respond to it. He also said that he knew about me. That alone blew my mind.\n\nI was waiting months and months to receive the card, but it never arrived. A few weeks ago, a Reddit employee noticed that I never got it, so they messaged me and said that they contacted Danny\u2019s team, and they wanted me to get the card. I felt hopeful that I\u2019ll receive it this time.\n\nOn Friday, a package arrived from Danny. I had a huge smile on my face the second I realized what it was. I was so excited to open it!\n\nWhat he sent me was absolutely amazing. He sent me a very sweet handwritten note, and an amazing bonus. This is what Danny wrote me.\n\n\u201cJess,\n\nIn making a film the director watches it hundreds of times. I was so delighted-and continue to be so-that you have done the same!\n\nWe\u2019d had a big success with Slumdog Millionaire, and it was only that success that brought the finance to 127-no one wants to watch a film about a man cutting his own arm off-they said.\n\nThe film holds a very special place for me and I\u2019m honoured it does for you too.\n\nAll best always\n\nDanny Boyle\u201d\n\nI never thought I\u2019d one day receive a handwritten note from Danny himself. I\u2019m still in shock!\n\nAs for the bonus, he also sent me a 127 Hours film crew t-shirt. It\u2019s exactly like the shirt James Franco wears in the film.\n\nDanny truly has made my life! 127 Hours is my favorite thing in the world and it brings me so much joy. And to be recognized for that by the film\u2019s director is beyond amazing. I never thought something like this would ever happen to me. I\u2019ve been so emotional and my happiness levels have been through the roof! I\u2019m over the moon.\n\nI wanted to share this with you guys because some of the members of this sub wanted an update. None of this would\u2019ve happened if not for this sub and the ama. Thank you,    r/movies   ! \u2764\ufe0f",

Orlando Bloom plays a \"superstar sneaker designer\" (alright...) who creates a shoe called the\u00a0\"Spasmodica\"\u00a0(what??) that is so notoriously bad it literally destroys a Nike-level multinational corporation. It's laughable. On top of that, Bloom proves he can\u2019t act his way out of a paper bag; he\u2019s truly wooden as he heads to Kentucky for a funeral.\n\nThe logic is thin, the lead is weak, and the plot is messy.\u00a0And yet, I love it.\u00a0It touches my heart in a way no other film does. Specifically, the scene where Kirsten Dunst tells him he \"failed\" over and over again hits a very specific chord for me. In spite of all the very valid reasons it's a \"bad\" movie, I need what it\u2019s giving.\n\nWhat is that movie for you?\u00a0The one where the story is broken and the acting is subpar, but you\u2019ll defend your love for it anyway?\n\n[The scene I referenced above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85jaVM30PB4)",

The ending with Paul Riser staring through the door, knowing his son is legitimately GREAT at something, but also horrified at it. It\u2019s so goddamn good.",

Famously used in the movie Scent of Mystery, the system was criticized for poor timing, faint or odd smells, and was considered a failure. If it existed and worked properly, which movies would stand out as being the best and worst smelling?",

The teasing feels natural, the fights feel personal, and the loyalty shows up when it matters.   \n  \nI want the movies that made you think, yes, that is exactly how siblings act. For me, the best is The Fighter. The whole family dynamic feels messy and real.   \n  \nWhat movie felt the most real to you, and what specific moment sold it. A line, a look, a blow up, or a quiet favor.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "It\u2019s a pretty common trope for an adult man to travel with an unrelated young girl, often for the purpose of her protection on a dangerous road trip. TV Tropes calls this the \u201cBadass and Child Duo\u201d trope. Notable examples include Paper Moon, Logan, True Grit, The Last of Us, Les Miserables (partly) etc.\n\nThere are also examples that partially gender swap the trope. For example, Civil War had an adult woman protecting an unrelated young girl on a dangerous road trip. Aliens similarly has an adult woman paired with a young girl.\n\nI\u2019m curious if there are any movies that gender swap both roles: an adult woman travelling with and protecting a young boy (who is not her son). Terminator 2 almost works, but the woman (Sarah) and young boy (John) are mother-son, and there is an additional male protector in the group (The Terminator).",
