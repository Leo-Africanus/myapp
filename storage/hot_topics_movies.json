        "content": "I think the first film is a masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films of all time. Maybe not number 1 but top 5 if not 3. I watched it last year for the first time in years. I didn\u2019t think it would be all that good anymore with how lifeless the series felt in the modern age. But no. It\u2019s still an amazing movie that lives on its simplicity. Dinosaurs are brought back. At first it seems magical. Then it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nAnd now with the seventh movie in the franchise coming out I\u2019m feeling that same tired and apathetic feeling I felt before I re-experienced the original. This really feels like it was not meant to be a franchise. The first film is very simple and the minute you try to stretch it beyond that you lose the appeal. It\u2019s not like Indiana Jones where you can have multiple adventures. That\u2019s why we have Dial of Destiny a chance because a fifth movie could\u2019ve worked. But with Jurassic I just can\u2019t see it. \n\nAnd I feel like with how lifeless the series feels now it\u2019s easier and easier to forget how amazing the first one actually is. Which is why I\u2019m not even bothering to see this one. I saw some reviews of it and that was enough for me to learn this wasn\u2019t worth my time or money. We should listen to the ending of the first one and let these creatures stay gone and not try to bring them back because it never works.\n\nNot sure how anyone else feels about this. For anyone who has actually seen it is there actually something in Rebirth that\u2019s worth while?  ",

        "content": "EDIT: A big thank you to everyone who looked for this movie. I want to reassure you it's\u00a0**not bride of chucky or urban legengs: bloody mary**\u00a0(the final girl was visibly bi-racial, chucky wasn't in it etc.). I'm starting to think it was a cheap, softcore, direct to DVD one off. A few people commented who remembered this movie as well. None of us could remember anything outside of the details I shared in my post. With that, I'm gonna call it. If anyone does find it please DM. Thanks again!\n\n\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019m looking for a very specific movie. I haven\u2019t met anyone that\u2019s seen it but I\u2019m hoping movie buffs in this sub can help. I hope it\u2019s alright to ask.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was a kid I saw a movie in the early 2000\u2019s (possibly late 90\u2019s) about a group of young adults in a house (not sure whose house it was or why they were there). But one by one they were being murdered by a mask figure. Pretty generic but what stood it out was how sexual it was. A lot of nudity and sex. While it wasn\u2019t an actual porn film, there was a lot of nudity and a few memorable scenes:\u00a0\n\nA couple is having sex in a large bed with a red canopy. On the (I guess) ceiling of the canopy is a large mirror. The masked figure breaks the mirror and the couple is impaled while the woman is on top of the man. The mirror goes through both of them. I also recall a scene at the beginning of the movie where the final girl has sex at night on a beach while being watched by the masked figure.\n\nAnother memorable part of the movie is the twist ending (major spoiler alert):\n\nThe final girl is biracial (half black). At the end of the movie, the killer removes his mask and it\u2019s a white male. It turns out he\u2019s her father. I think she set fire to the house and he dies inside of the house (not 100% sure it's been 20ish years).\n\nI\u2019m trying to find this movie because this one ignited my love of slasher films. I\u2019ve seen countless ones since but never this one again. Does anyone know the title of this movie?",

I found myself invested in it from start to finish, especially Ryan Gosling, his acting was just beautiful. I need more Ryan Gosling in these roles, however, it looks like this is the only movie he\u2019s done like this besides The Notebook. I would appreciate recommendations of movies like this that have that raw vulnerability and just stellar acting. ",

        "title": "Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey' - leaked teaser",
        "content": "First look at my favorite director's upcoming movie.\nThe buzz is already deafening for what promises to be a cinematic event of mythic proportions: Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Odyssey. Following his Oscar triumph with Oppenheimer, Nolan is turning his lens to one of the cornerstones of Western literature, and fans are ecstatic. The prospect of the visionary director bringing Homer\u2019s epic to the big screen has ignited a firestorm of anticipation, positioning it as one of the most awaited films of the decade.What makes this pairing so electrifying is Nolan\u2019s signature filmmaking style. Known for his masterful manipulation of time and non-linear narratives, he is uniquely suited to adapt a story that begins in medias res and unfolds through flashbacks. Audiences are eager to see Odysseus\u2019s ten-year journey not just as a linear sequence of events, but as a fractured, psychological odyssey. Nolan\u2019s commitment to practical effects and awe-inspiring IMAX cinematography promises a visceral experience, translating the Cyclops\u2019s cave and the Sirens\u2019 call into breathtaking, tangible spectacles. The themes of perseverance, identity, and the haunting passage of time are central to the epic and resonate deeply with Nolan\u2019s previous work in films like Inception and Interstellar.Fan excitement has been expertly stoked by a characteristically Nolan-esque marketing campaign. The release of a teaser trailer exclusively in theaters has created a sense of event and exclusivity, driving online discussion and speculation to a fever pitch. With an all-star cast reportedly led by Matt Damon and Tom Holland, every tidbit of news is devoured by a fanbase confident that Nolan will deliver a film that is both a faithful, grand-scale epic and a profound, thought-provoking masterpiece. The wait for its 2026 release will be a long one, but for movie lovers, the journey has already begun.",

        "title": "The Real story of Big Fish",
        "content": "I originally watched the movie Big Fish once in theaters because I love Tim Burton movies and I loved the movie for being a fanciful stretch of reality like Edward Scissorshands.\n\nI just watched the movie again with my wife and kids and I get a new perspective from the dad.  The stories are mostly real but they are somewhat more frightening as a real tale without the softened edges for the son.  There are major historical events in Big Fish that I think Tim Burton weaved into the story to give the son perspective without trying to scare him while the father deals with his own issues.  The stories come with real life issues like depression, cowardice, PTSD, paralysis, and risk of death.\n\nWhat if your son asked you about your time in war?  A lot of people just didn't talk about it after WW2.  A lot of people went nuts after their time in Vietnam.  Here, the father gets to tell the tale of almost dying by ignoring the dark parts and violenc by emphasizing his recruitment of twins for defection for a carnival act, and managing them as he worked his way home across multiple Communist countries; rather than telling a tale about his family thinking he was dead, the hardship of war, and his desertion from the military after being a POW (the book version has the boat he was on being sank off of North Korea).\n\nWhat if your son wanted to ask you about your childhood and you spent a long time paralyzed from polio hooked up to machines that pushed and pulled on your body?  You were paralyzed in youth because there were no polio vaccines before 1953 (before Korean War and up to 30 years before end of Vietnam War).  Your son was fully vaccinated and you never even told you about the scare of life with polio (heck, a lot of anti-vaxxers now grew up with vaccines and never knew what polio was).  How do you tell your child about a risk in your life that he will never have to face in his lifetime?\n\nEvery two weeks, you save for a home for your wife and kids.  You put away money for years while your wife and kids live in a trailer park.  You scrimp and save only to have it wiped away by the oil speculation crash of 1986.  Only, the stock crash isn't only affecting Texans, you go home to Alabama to find this gambling destroyed small towns like Spectre as well after Black Monday in 1987.  The father happens to know people who retained their wealth through the crash and he makes a predatory purchase on the whole town of Spectre for pennies on the dollar (via public tax auction).  Then he places it in trust so his friends can get steady payments on the city while he \"saves\" some childhood friends.  Instead of telling the son about exploiting people at their worst and taking advantage after the big banks reamed people over, the dad gets to spin it as a tale of being an accidental bank robber and advising a friend to becoming an even bigger villain in a comical way.  Additionally, he avoids telling his son that he also lost all the family money in speculation by saying a robber took his money.\n\nWorking for a circus with a homeless giant you met battling by the river has a more magical ring is just it's own thing.  The werewolf at night that rages may have been helping Danny Devito deal with his demons like alcohol abuse after hours in his trailer.\n\nTim Burton wrote the movie based on the book but also his own relationship with his own dad.  I think there was more real truths than lies in this story.\n",
