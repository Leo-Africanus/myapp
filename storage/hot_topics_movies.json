Instead, the sister gets killed almost immediately and we get a shoehorned team up between the main character and John Wick. In which, except for the initial fight, it seems the actors weren't even on set together. To the point that some shots of John have significantly different lighting despite taking place in the same scene. \u200bIt seems pretty clear that someone thought that they should somehow include John Wick in the spinoff for marketing reasons and trashed the sister storyline for that, replacing it with what we got.

It could\u2019ve been a powerful story about perspective and identity as a man literally learns to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes. However, there is one pretty big detail about this movie I have neglected to mention:\n\n\nIt\u2019s an Adam Sandler comedy.\n\n\n I\u2019m not saying Sandler is a bad actor or unable of delivering an amazing lead performance in a drama (*Uncut Gems* debunks that entirely*) but I can\u2019t help but feel like this movie would\u2019ve been way better off if it had a lead actor behind it way more focused on taking the story seriously and making some richer out of the key conflict.",

        "content": "One of the things that I don\u2019t think is mentioned enough about this film is how it walks a fine line between parody and sincerity. There\u2019s never a point where you feel it has the seriousness of Lord of the Rings or Indiana Jones (insofar as how seriously it takes the stakes within its own story), and it\u2019s full of campy moments and dialogue that feels like it was destined to become a meme. \n\nThe heroes are tough but never feel \\*threatening\\* in the way that say Aragorn does in Fellowship. They all seem like characters who\u2019d much rather settle every fight over drinks and jokes rather than a sword (well except Inigo hunting the six fingered man)\n\nI can\u2019t even fathom just how the movie pokes fun at its own genre at every turn yet feels like a sincere take on the genre at the same time? It\u2019s the Scream of fantasy-adventure insofar as both pretty much made fun of yet are sort of the modern template for their respective genres. \n\nAnd yet it\u2019s actually a legit timeless classic that really does get better every time you watch it.

Got me thinking that I wonder what type of films messed up people in different generations, so what was it for you? \n\nFor me it was the Sixth Sense. I was in year 7 at High school in the UK and my teacher thought it would be a great idea to let a group of 10 year olds watch it as a Christmas term break up film.\n\nI genuinely couldn't sleep for about 3 days and every room had to have it's door closed, especially the bathroom.

        "content": "I\u2019m curious about the one film you watched this year that really stuck with you after it ended.\n\nIt can be from any language or country. A big theatrical release, a small film you found on streaming, or even something you watched much later than everyone else. What matters is the impact it had on you.\n\nMaybe it was the story. Maybe a performance that felt too real. Maybe a scene you still think about days later.\n\nIf you feel like adding more, you can share:\n\n* The movie name\n* Where did you watch it (theatre/streaming/rewatch)\n* What made it memorable for you\n\nI\u2019m hoping this turns into a good discussion and helps surface films people don\u2019t talk about enough. Looking forward to discovering films I may have missed.",

        "content": "I recently re-watched \"The Polar Express\" after such a long time.  It is a beautiful story of belief, faith, and not growing up too fast.\n\nObviously, I recognized that Tom Hanks plays the conductor, the ghost on top of the train, Santa Claus, and the father of the boy.  Apparently, he also plays the boy, which just shows what motion capture technology can do!  \n\nBut my question is, is there a meaning behind that?  The mom and dad mention how their son is growing out of believing in Santa, so I find it interesting that his dad is showing up everywhere in the kid's dream.  Of course, it's kind of unexplained whether it is a dream or real.  Is the boy dreaming of his dad everywhere because he is actually \"Santa\"?  Any thoughts on this?  Or was this just a fun way for Tom Hanks to be involved in so much of the movie?",
