He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. \n\nA few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  \n\n* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. \n* The jaws guy was hilarious. \n* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.\n* Holly Goodhead... great name.\n* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. \n* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. \n* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.\n\nLoved it.  Though I suspect people who like a more serious bond are not fans? ",

I've recently watched Django Unchained again and he was really briliant in it.\n\nHe was obviously also great in The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road, etc but those are his stand-out performances in my personal opinion\n\nedit: not sure why some people want to argue with me and are downvoting this? I can still think he deserved Oscar wins for his other roles, especially because him not winning an Oscar for so long became a meme for the longest, his smirk when he finally won for The Revenant at the Oscars said everything.

Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she\u2019s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. \n\nTimothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.\n\nAlso have to call out Elis best friend \"Matthew\"... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next\" at the end\n\nthe movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.\n\n\nRemember... the juice is worth the squeeze.",

        "content": "I watch movies alone all the time, but if I have the opportunity to watch it with someone else I take it. For some reason though, I feel like I'm more critical of movies when I'm watching them with others rather than when I'm alone. I also think I'm less likely to have a strong emotional response. Would love to hear other takes.",

Either the movie emphasized the wrong things, bungled facts, filled in a lot of blanks, or just straight up lied.\n\nI imagine ones about world leaders or hugely impactful figures will necessarily attract a ton of controversy, but there's definitely got to be ones where there's no question about how wrong the portrayal was.",

If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. ",

It reminded of the hipster vibe of the late 2000s - early 2010s in the best way possible, although I'm not sure that's what the film was going for. I miss movies like this and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. It also really made me miss TV shows like Whitest Kids U Know and Portlandia.\n\nAre there any other TV shows and movies with this vibe that I should watch?",

        "content": "in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.\n\nfor starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.\n\nthings get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. \"it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.\"\n\nthere's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!\n\neven though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",

Near the end of the movie the girl tells Luke he\u2019s being chosen because he has experienced a lot of pain, implying that it\u2019s a matter of respect. I think in reality the entity chose Luke to become a follower because he is the biggest coward of the group, based on his experience at the convenient store. The entity believed he would be the most likely to submit and comply to it\u2019s commands. It shows Luke hallucinations of the event in order to try and make him react as he did in the store. I bet this is what every follower had in common.",
