        "content": "I have 14 franchises left to add, in my big list of shows, movies, shorts, anime etc. that I mentioned on another post. However i\u2019m confused on what order or timeline I should watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, so I wanted some second opinions. Granted I want what\u2019s considered the best story and overall entertainment wise, to get an easy to follow list to add to my bigger list! I also wanted to know since it\u2019s hard to understand the reboots and remakes and their connections to older movies in this franchise.",

I don't think Zombie Strippers qualifies because it's just stupid, but Killer Klowns from Outer Space is right on the cusp.\n\nThe Craft is almost perfect.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is as well.\n\nThe Great Wall is kinda there.\n\n\n\n\n",

I just started crying and this has never happened to me before. I've cried over scenes but not a performance. \n\nMcNichol had such rawness, such humanity in how she acts that I dare say no teen American actress was ever as good as her. I have no problem in saying this. She just so happened to not have had the best material but even so, she was headed to movie stardom in the early 80s but her mental health prevented her from going further. She went back to TV, did EMPTY NEST for 5 years and then quit the business. \n\nI wish more movie buffs knew about Kristy McNichol. She was that good.",
