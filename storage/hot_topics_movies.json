        "content": "So I was curious about little details from older movies that modern audiences might not realize or fully appreciate/understand.\n\nTake Jaws for example, the famous scene where Quint crushes the can of beer in his hand.  I didn't realize until someone pointed out to me that beer cans were much thicker and were made of steel instead of aluminum.  They were difficult to crush unlike modern cans and doing so was seen as a genuine feat of strength.\n\nOr something else I recently learned was that there was also an old etiquette rule where men who were seated would stand up if a woman entered the room out of respect.  This is now an outdated custom which has been in decline since the ~~90s~~ 70s.  \n\nI'm sure there are some people who might still do it especially in more formal settings, but at 25 this is a rule I was never taught.  \n\n*Edited for mistake and spelling \n\n*Thanks to everyone who commented, it's been fun reading your answers! I did not expect this to blow up like it did!\n",

Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/roofman-review-channing-tatum-1236510112/)\n\n&gt;In the end, it\u2019s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing. Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies all those years ago, as the star\u2019s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who\u2019s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith. While she plays Leigh as closed off to love, leave it to Tatum to find that unconventional point of entry.\n\n[TheWrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/roofman-review-channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-are-a-charmingly-doomed-couple-in-dark-rom-com/)\n\n&gt;The tonal juggling act isn\u2019t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give Roofman its life. It\u2019s a sad movie, really, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn\u2019t make sense, maybe it\u2019s the whole point.",

Would a fall/winter release have been better?\n\nThe scene with an injured Sean Penn confronting Christopher Walken at his home is a master class in acting from Walken. Fear, bravado, nuance, resignation all in one scene. Brilliant.\n\nAnd the score by Patrick Leonard is iconic. Synth 80s moody. Loved it. Patrick Leonard tells the story of how Warner fought Madonna hard on releasing Live to Tell  first, or at all. As he said, there was nothing like it on radio, and it was a long song, with stops in the middle. Her voice was very low, and it was a huge departure for her. Madonna said if they didn\u2019t release it first she wouldn\u2019t do any videos for True Blue  singles. Pat said the execs at Warner were beyond angry at this power move and felt the song would flop hard. Madonna said it would be a hit. This cemented her control over her career.\n\nI'm still shocked the song wasn't nominated for an Oscar.",

'Gabby's Dollhouse' opens with $13.6M. 'The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2' debuts with just $5.8M. 'Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle' crosses $600M worldwide.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/gxdw9gv2l6sf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e413b513efedb7d45b8e2fb4b5afa72fc01437e3\n\nSeptember is coming to an end with three newcomers, and neither had a particularly impressive start.\n\nWarner Bros.'s ***One Battle After Another*** topped the box office, but its numbers are a far cry from its profitability prospects. DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** also had a soft debut, followed by an even worse performance overseas. But the week's worst performer was ***The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2***, which fizzled out from the original film.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $67.3 million this weekend. That's down 20.1% from last year, when ***The Wild Robot*** topped the box office and ***Megalopolis*** massively flopped.\n\nDebuting at #1, WB's ***One Battle After Another*** opened with $22 million in 3,634 theaters. And so, after 7 films, WB's streak of films debuting with $40+ million has come to an end. This debut is slightly below Leonardo DiCaprio's previous film ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($23.2 million). This was also Paul Thomas Anderson's first film to hit #1 and was his biggest debut, although that's not a high bar; none of his films started on wide release, none played at more than 2,000 theaters, and none earned more than $5 million on a weekend. \n\nOn its own, this would be a respectable figure. But there's one big problem: the film is carrying a gigantic $130 million budget. And so it goes from respectable to \"quite bad\". These numbers are eerily similar to the performance of ***Mickey 17*** earlier this year; it debuted with just $19 million on a $118 million budget before fizzling out quickly. One could argue that the film was made solely for acclaim or awards, but it's still a $130 million blockbuster with an extensive marketing campaign and a huge emphasis on IMAX. So its performance must be judged as a blockbuster.\n\nSo how could the film open this low? It's got a fantastic filmmaker teaming up with one of the most popular actors today, and the reviews are fucking fantastic (96% on RT, 95 on Metacritic). Wouldn't that translate into at least $30 million?\n\nFor starters, and this is something that it's a very sad truth, Paul Thomas Anderson is a stranger to the public. He's got the acclaim and awards, but his films have not connected with the public. His highest grossing film is ***There Will Be Blood*** with $40 million domestically. The rest of his films haven't cracked $30 million, and his last three films didn't even hit $25 million. With the exception of ***There Will Be Blood*** and ***Boogie Nights***, all of his films have flopped at the box office. And that's a huge shame, for he has delivered so much high quality for the decades. But audiences only recognize a few directors, and sadly, Anderson is not one of those directors.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is definitely a box office draw. Otherwise, the film wouldn't have opened to $20 million (and it's quite similar to ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** last year). But it's strange that this film opened below that film, considering it had a \"shorter\" runtime, more action and proper actor promotion (***Killers*** debuted during the SAG strike). While DiCaprio can attract audiences to theaters, seems like there's only so much he can do for a film like this.\n\nThe \"no marketing\" excuse can't be thrown here. WB mounted a very extensive marketing campaign, to the point that they even had a Fornite collaboration. It simply seems that the audience just wasn't interested in what the film had to offer, or the interest was smaller than expected. The first trailer also struggled to properly sell the film, focusing solely on DiCaprio and the cast going on crazy shenanigans. The second trailer properly sold the film's premise on a clearer angle, but it feels like the audience didn't want to give it a chance. With current tensions (both inside and outside America), it seems like audiences weren't in the mood for a story about revolutionaries.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 62% of the audience was male, and a colossal 77% was 25 and over. Those demographics are a bit concerning; it means young audiences didn't give a chance to the film, and that DiCaprio's presence failed to attract women to the film. 45% of the audience primarily watched the film for Anderson, and 41% for DiCaprio.\n\nAs an interesting stat, Deadline just reported that 72% of the film's performance came from blue counties. It overperformed in theaters located in blue counties by 13%, and underperformed in red counties by 24%. 51% of the film's attendance were in areas with populations north of 1 million. Compared to non-horror R-rated films, it over-performed in New York City (22% over the norm), San Francisco (+21%), Washington, DC (+26%) and Toronto (+61%). Two underperforming cities were Houston (-30%) and Dallas (-23%).\n\nNow, not everything is lost. Audiences gave the film a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which is the best of Anderson's career and the greatest score for DiCaprio since ***Titanic***. The film's older demographic also indicates that those don't neccessarily rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. With strong word of mouth and awards buzz, perhaps the film could leg out through October. It should definitely cross $70 million domestically. But is that going to be enough for this film? Look at the overseas section.\n\nIn second place, Universal/DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** debuted with $13.6 million in 3,500 theaters. That's DreamWorks' seventh lowest debut ever, and it goes all the way to top 5 worst if we adjust inflation.\n\nConsidering the film's tepid $32 million budget, this is not really a bad way to start. But it truly shows that a show's popularity doesn't always translate to a great result in the box office. Getting audiences invested in a ***Gabby's Dollhouse*** film was always going to be a challenge; it's a pre-scholar show with basically nothing for adults. Kids are obviously the main target, but adults are the ones who pay tickets and so it came a dilemma: will adults pay to watch something that their kids can watch at home in Netflix?\n\nAccording to Universal, 72% of the audience was female, and obviously the main demo was young girls. They gave it a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore, which is actually DreamWorks' first ever film to get that grade (crazy, right?). The film's advantage is that there's not much family competition through October, so it could leg out. For now, it should hit around $45 million domestically.\n\nDropping to third place after topping the box office for two weeks, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** continued its collapse. This time, it dropped 59%, adding $7.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $118.1 million so far, and it should finish with around $130 million.\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped 45%, adding $6.7 million. The film's domestic total stands at $161.3 million, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $180 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, Lionsgate's ***The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 2*** mustered just $5.8 million in 2,690 theaters. That's down a very rough 51% from ***Chapter 1*** ($11.8 million), which debuted back in May 2024.\n\nThere was no way this film was gonna come close to ***Chapter 1***. Not only because they waited 17 months to release the sequel, which was already complete back then, but because the film also earned very poor reviews, signaling that there was very little interest in a follow-up. And if you were expecting the film to be an improvement, well, that's not really the case (16% on RT).\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 51% of the audience was female and 73% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a brutal \"C\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is the lowest in the franchise. Given the horror competition on its way, it would be a surprise if ***Chapter 2*** made it past $15 million domestically. And there's still a ***Chapter 3*** waiting to be released, so we'll see how low the floor can get.\n\nUniversal's ***Him*** fumbled hard on its second weekend. The film collapsed a horrible 73%, earning just $3.5 million this weekend. The drop is not a surprise, considering the film's very poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $20.7 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $30 million domestically.\n\n***The Long Walk*** keeps on walking with some good drops. Once again, it dropped just 47% and added $3.3 million this weekend. The film has earned $28.7 million, and it should get to over $35 million by the end of its run.\n\nIn eighth place, ***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** earned $3.3 million, for a 48% drop. The film has made $38.9 million, and it should finish with around $47 million domestically.\n\nFathom Events re-released Sam Raimi's ***Spider-Man*** trilogy, and they made $2.25 million this weekend combined.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was the Indian film ***They Call Him OG***, which made $1.4 million ($5.2 million four-day).\n\nAfter its horrible start last week, Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** pretty much died this week. It earned just $1.1 million, which was a very poor 66% second weekend drop. Romance films never drop that high. With just $5.7 million in 10 days, the film is going to lose so many screens. It won't make it much further than $7 million domestically.\n\nVertical released ***Dead of Winter*** in 605 theaters, but it could only make $1 million. It won't last long in theaters.\n\nSony also released Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut ***Eleanor the Great*** in 892 theaters, but it was a misfire with just $865,000 this weekend. Ouch.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***One Battle After Another*** debuted with $26 million overseas, for a $48 million worldwide debut. That's just a little bit better than the worldwide debut of ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($21 million overseas, $44 million worldwide). Anderson's biggest debut, but like the domestic market, not a high bar; none of his film has made more than $80 million worldwide. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.4M), France ($3.4M), Germany ($2M), Italy ($1.4M) and Saudi Arabia ($1.3M). Markets like South Korea, Japan, Turkey and China are left.\n\nThe one way to describe these numbers is \"incredibly soft\", but it's also close to \"bad.\" DiCaprio's films are known for legging out, but it's still a huge barrier for the film to reach the $300 million it needs to break even. We'll keep an eye on this one. At the very least, this film should win tons of awards. And with this film, WB has officially crossed $4 billion, becoming the first studio this year to achieve it.\n\n***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** added $19.2 million. As such, the film has crossed $600 million worldwide, the first anime title to do so. The best Crunchyroll/Sony markets are Mexico ($16.6M), Germany ($12.5M), France ($12.3M), India ($9M) and the UK ($8.4M).\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $15.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $436 million. The best markets are Mexico ($28.5M), the UK ($22.1M), France ($18M), Brazil ($16.4M) and Germany ($14.4M). \n\nIn Asia, ***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** added $7 million, for a $26 million overseas run. It will release in other markets through October.\n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse*** opened with a soft $5.5 million overseas, for a so-so $19.2 million worldwide debut. While it still has many markets left, that's not an encouraging sign for its prospects.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Jurassic World: Rebirth* | Jul/2 | Universal | $92,016,065 | $339,640,400 | $867,114,682 | $180M\n\n- Universal's ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** has closed its run with $339 million domestically and $867 million worldwide. Another big success in this dino trilogy, despite the very mediocre reception it has garnered. Universal did everything on its power to make sure the film got finished quickly and released here because reasons. And it paid off profit-wise. Although it didn't really change the fact that the franchise has continued its decline at the box office; going $1.6B &gt; $1.3B &gt; $1.0B &gt; $867M suggests that maybe you should work on improving the writing, you know?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe're getting three wide releases and a limited release.\n\nThe biggest release is actually not a film. It's ***Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl***, a special program for the release of Swift's new album, ***The Life of a Showgirl***. She already had a lot of power with ***The Eras Tour*** making over $260 million, and while this won't perform like that, it will still post some strong numbers. It was reported that the film has already sold $15 million in pre-sales in its first 24 hours across all circuits. But this event will only last one weekend.\n\nThere's also A24's ***The Smashing Machine***, the new film from Benny Safdie. It stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, following the life of former amateur wrestler and MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The film is sold pretty much on \"The Rock is acting\" and has been a point of praise in all the film's reviews so far. Reviews for the film are positive (but not exactly highly acclaimed), and maybe the audience will respond favorably to the film.\n\nIFC and Shudder are also releasing horror film ***Good Boy***, which tells the story of a haunted house from the perspective of a dog. The companies seem confident in the film, considering they chose to open it in wide release instead of starting slow. The budget is insanely low, so the chances of breaking out are on its favor.\n\nAnd in limited release, there's Focus Features' ***Anemone***. The film has one selling point: the return of the GOAT Daniel Day-Lewis after a 8-year absence, who co-wrote the film with his son Ronan (the director). Everyone knows he always delivers, and this is not going to be the exception. The film itself, however, won't. It's currently sitting at a middling 60% on RT and 48% on Metacritic, which is very poor for a platform release. With other adult dramas this month, it's likely that it will get lost once it expands wide next week.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "I can't believe I actually have something to add to this because I usually find something good to say about any movie that I choose to watch but holy shit my dad put on **Unsung Hero** the other day. Very misleading synopsis, that talked about faith but we assumed it meant faith in a more general, spiritual sense of endurance and perserverance, not actual religious faith, and we had imdb giving it a 7.0 so we gave it a go. We're not americans so we had no idea about the people the film was actually about. \n\nJust basically a movie about filthy rich, extremely religious white (australian) people that get some (~~debatably minor~~) setbacks in life but they endure with the help of their equally filthy rich, extremely religious white (southern american) friends. I get that they go from million dollar home to a middle class house with no furniture and they all have to chip in and help out with paying the bills and groceries but that's literally most of the lives of people I know lol. And then everything gets better because they are religious and have religious friends helping them out, giving them a car, giving them gifts for christmas, paying their hospital bills, etc and eventually getting the daughter a label deal basically. Oh and the absolute corniness of it all didn't help one bit. \n\nI don't know, I feel like a very specific group of people would enjoy this movie (~~christian southern americans~~) and that's completely fine if you do like it. But I don't see anyone else enjoying this movie.",
