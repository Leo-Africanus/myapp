        "content": "Just thinking about the 90s recently. Twister for example is a big budget film starring a guy used to supporting roles in James Cameron films and a popular tv star. No legit A-listers yet it was a hit because the story was enough. Sure, maybe if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were in it, it may have been a bigger hit or maybe folks would buy it less with the performances.\n\nAlso, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.\n\nWhat are some other big budget films that have practically no stars in the lead role?",

But time passed and this film began to be considered the best science fiction horror film.\n\nAnd I wondering if some modern films of this decade would happen the same way. It will be criticized by the audience and critics, but in the future it will be considered a good film. It doesn't matter how long it takes from now on.\n\nP.S. English isn't my native language",

Something about it has really just stuck with me, maybe it\u2019s the creepy imagery of the villain and twisted 90\u2019s tv show aesthetic. \n\nJustice Smith\u2019s characters narration about being young then suddenly growing old really just hit me like a brick wall. I'm a nostalgic person that grew up with 90's shows and that sequence just broke me, especially thinking on how quickly life has moved these past few years. \n\nThe entire theme of his character not being able to embrace who he truly is or wants to be and living a life suppressing himself haunts me. I\u2019m a straight male and I know the film is about trans identity yet it really connected with me. The entire ending sequence was so casual and yet so horrific. I know this movie isn\u2019t for everyone, but man I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I feel like there's so many different interpretations and things you can take from this film.",

A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.\n\nI went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.\n\nI've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.\n\nI also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.\n\nI felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director. Maybe it's because I was very busy this year, but I didn't know he had directed this (shameful for an Italian). I guess that explains the eroticism of it.",

The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin\u2019s parents. \n\nIt begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin\u2019s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films? \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses.

        "title": "Favorite movie by european country: Norway",
        "content": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in North Macedonia, and although there weren't really that many suggestions and votes, we were still able to find an interesting winner: ***You Won't Be Alone*** is an australian movie. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).\n\nBut what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - You Won\u2019t Be Alone\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;",
