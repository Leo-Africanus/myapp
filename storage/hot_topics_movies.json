        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/caught_stealing): 87% (from 55 reviews) with 6.70 average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/caught-stealing/): 69/100 (19 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Despite all the bloody violence, there is a buoyant feel to the film. Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky\u2019s constant and brilliant cinematographer, makes the city glittery bright outside and the look is vibrant even in the dingy bar. Caught Stealing is an anomaly, a dark soap bubble of an entertainment. And that weirdness makes this unlikely film sparkle.\n\n-[Caryn James, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-darren-aronofsky-1236353041/)\n\n&gt; Mostly, the tension between the film\u2019s increasingly dark story and its love of rudimentary gags \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be so funny if this guy who mostly subsists on booze physically couldn\u2019t drink anymore? \u2014 doesn\u2019t abate until the film\u2019s final act. That\u2019s when things click into place, when the big swings come together, and \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d nearly finds its way to (insert your favorite positive baseball metaphor here). A wild card? Not wild enough, really.\n\n-[Kate Erbland, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-austin-butler-1235147500/): C+\n\n&gt; \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d might feel like a break from the \u201cPi\u201d director\u2019s intensely subjective character portraits, which range from \u201cThe Wrestler\u201d to \u201cThe Whale,\u201d but in fact, Aronofsky brings us as close to Hank as he has to any of his other characters. For Butler, it\u2019s not as flashy a role as the ones he played in \u201cElvis\u201d or \u201cDune,\u201d and yet, seeing the actor stripped down to his heather gray undies, his stardom is all but undeniable.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-1236496926/)\n\n&gt; At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed \u2013 and an old-timer tells him he has \u201cone hell of a swing\u201d. The film has it too.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/27/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-mother-the-whale-baseball): 4/5\n\n&gt; Some part of Aronofsky may want to evoke the darkly funny mishaps of a vintage crime comedy, but something else keeps coaxing him halfway down dark alleyways, before the movie scrambles back into more comic-adjacent urgency. It\u2019s that run-and-stop-short rhythm that makes Caught Stealing feel more like a fraught, imperfect recovery than a Requiem-style spiral into hell, and an unusually balanced New York portrait. The city of Aronofsky\u2019s early career is neither a paradise lost to gentrification nor a metropolis of the damned. It\u2019s just a bustling microcosm of a pitiless world with plenty of places to hide.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/caught-stealing-review): B\n\n&gt; For as much good as there is in \"Caught Stealing,\" there's never that moment where it somehow rises from good to great \u2014 but hey, that's okay. It's just good and stays good until the credits roll, which is more than enough. Not every new movie needs to be an event. Sometimes, you just want to watch a handsome guy try to get out of trouble while taking care of an ornery, fluffy cat. We could use more modern movies like \"Caught Stealing.\" \n\n-[Ryan Scott, /Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/1944676/caught-stealing-austin-butler-movie-review/): 7.5/10\n\n&gt; The result is a movie that\u2019s very fun, but weirdly unambitious for Aronofsky. If any up-and-coming director made this movie, it\u2019d be seen as a promising breakthrough. For the guy known for Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother! and The Whale, it feels like he\u2019s slumming a bit. In a way, though, it\u2019s refreshing to see an Aronofsky movie that, for once, isn\u2019t bursting with more ideas than it can reasonably contain. It would still be nice in this instance to have a thematic through-line that wasn\u2019t just based in nostalgia for a bygone New York. It\u2019s doubtful Caught Stealing will make the same impression its director\u2019s other films have. Fortunately, though, its rewatchability factor is just as high.\n\n-[Abby Olcese, Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/caught-stealing/caught-stealing-review-darren-aronofsky-austin-butler-matt-smith-crime-plot): 7.5/10\n\n&gt; As much as the film is Aronofsky\u2019s least characteristic to date, with its Guy Ritchie-esque rogues gallery of crooks and killers and Coen-esque bursts of wry violence, it\u2019s Butler\u2019s performance that makes it feel of a piece with the director\u2019s other work. There are few filmmakers more interested in putting their characters in a vice grip, so as to bring them someplace where their physical traumas become a way for them to know themselves beyond the limits of the body.\n\n-[Rocco T. Thompson, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-darren-aronofsky/): 2.5/4\n\n&gt; It\u2019s thin material for such an impressive cast to be working with, and even Butler, who\u2019s made all the right choices post-Elvis when it comes to compelling and varied work, can\u2019t really imagine Hank beyond the mould of tender-hearted victim. He takes all the beatings \u2013 and there are a lot of them, which is where Aronofsky\u2019s taste for the brutal slips in \u2013 with a noble tear in his eye, haunted as he is by a traumatic accident in his youth that put an end to his baseball career.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/caught-stealing-review-austin-butler-b2814868.html): 2/5\n\n&gt; For the most part, Caught Stealing is a riotous, rollicking ride studded with New York\u2019s concrete grit \u2014 but its sharper edges prove more difficult to endure.\n\n-[Ben Travis, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/caught-stealing/): 3/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nHank Thompson was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl, tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nDarren Aronofsky\n\n**WRITER**\n\nCharlie Huston (based on his novel)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nRob Simonsen\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nMatthew Libatique\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nAndrew Weisblum\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\nAugust 29, 2025\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n107 minutes\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Austin Butler as Henry \"Hank\" Thompson\n\n- Regina King as Detective Roman\n\n- Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Yvonne\n\n- Matt Smith as Russ\n\n- Liev Schreiber as Lipa\n\n- Vincent D'Onofrio as Shmully\n\n- Griffin Dunne as Paul\n\n- Benito A Mart\u00ednez Ocasio as Colorado\n\n- Carol Kane as Bubbe",

        "title": "Anyone else feel a little underwhelmed with Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning?",
        "content": "Mission Impossible has long been one of the best, most consistent series of Hollywood blockbusters. The first \"trilogy\" was pretty solid, and the 2nd run of Ghost Protocol/Rogue Nation/Fallout is legitimately some of the greatest action movie filmmaking ever. Dead Reckoning was good enough but didn't really hit the same highs - although maybe COVID is to blame for that.\n\nI was pretty excited for Final Reckoning given that it's the closing chapter of this generally awesome series, and it's almost 3 hours long - couldn't wait to see all the amazing stunts and set pieces we'd be getting, considering this is the end and the amount of time Christopher Macquarrie has to play with.\n\nIn reality though, I was pretty underwhelmed with what the movie delivered. The pacing is seriously wonky - it starts off very slowly and the first 40-45 minutes is all exposition and flashbacks...but it also feels like it resolves way too quickly at the end. The editing seemed a little off too, with scenes jumping from one another with some rather choppy transitions.\n\nI'm somewhat mixed on the action set pieces we got. The 2 big ones - Ethan's exploration of the downed submarine and the aerial chase at the end - are both really good in a vacuum. The sub escape goes beyond even the level of disbelief you need for these movies though, especially near the end with Ethan swimming like 300m through freezing cold water without a gas mask. And the plane chase felt too reminiscent of the climax in Fallout although admittedly it was way more intense and edge of your seat with Tom Cruise hanging off the planes themselves. \n\nOutside of these 2 though, the movie felt oddly free of the excitement and intensity the MI series typically has. It's weird but it felt almost kind of small considering the stakes were end-of-the-world? Like it didn't really give off \"closing chapter\" vibes to me. And I actually think we could've done with one or two more big set pieces. They kinda did Gabriel dirty as the final big bad too. He was menacing and sinister in Dead Reckoning but he came off as a Looney Tunes cartoon villain here and &gt;!his death scene was ridiculous.!&lt;\n\nIt was still fairly enjoyable but maybe I just expected more considering the high bar movies 4-6 set, as well as this being the final chapter of the series.",

That was the excellent Barry Sonnenfeld who went on to do Men in Black. What other films are there that feel like one directors work but is actually by another?",

From its acidic take on Hollywood and the movie business, OTT characters, Murphy's versatility as he goes from the narcissistic paranoid movie star Kit Ramsey to his dorky brother, Jiff. The highway scene is one for the books. \n\nSteve Martin's writing gives us plenty of zingers that are genuinely funny, Heather Grahame is likably dumb as an aspiring actress willing to do anything to get ahead, Christine Baranski is hilarious as an aging actress who can't wait to get into Kit's pants and Robert Downey Jr in a small but instantly cameo as a movie executive. \n\nI don't know this isn't referenced just as much as Tropic of Thunder. It's so much wittier. \n\nAlso, Chubby Rain, or the fact that the movie project's plot would probably be greenlit today.",

No kidding!\"\n\n\nFrom his review of Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke: **\"I go to the movies for many reasons. Here is one of them. I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world, in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play. Animation opens that possibility, because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible. Realistic films show the physical world; animation shows its essence. Animated films are not copies of 'real movies,' are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.\"**",
