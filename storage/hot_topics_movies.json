Especially when this was the extended version, that would be almost 4 hours. They are both kids of today with all that entails. It's sometimes hard making them keep attention for a short amount of time without any brain stimuli going on or them checking their phones.\n\nDuring todays movie none of them were on the phone one time, the only time they spoke it was about something happening in the movie. We had just one break during a 4 hours movie and it was a short pee break.\n\nThey were captivated. I'm impressed, this has never happened before and we are talking about a movie from 1990 and it is a 4 hours movie, slow even at that time. If this is not peak storytelling and a Grand Slam for the movie I don't know what might be.\n\nIt surely has it flaws we could discuss up and down, but from me to you a highly recommended movie to see with teen children!",

Everything I\u2019ve seen her in, from her small role in Justified, to starring in Booksmart, to the heartbreaking roles of Unbelievable and Dopesick, to frustratingly captivating roles in Apple Cider Vinegar, she's just incredible and sooo underrated, I cannot wait to see her get own storyline in The Last of Us 3rd series. I\u2019m just hoping that she gets that big breakthrough theatrical role(s) that really gets her career going, but man she\u2019s a very underrated stellar actress that I\u2019m always captivated by even if the project she\u2019s in isn\u2019t strongest, she\u2019s always the stand out, love her looks aswell.\n\n",

Where would you rank it? For me the best scene in the movie was when Samuel Jackson talks Chris tucker into the trunk of the car, if you have seen the movie you\u2019ll know, the music is perfect setting the tone just right the song is by the Johnston Brothers ",

        "content": "Basically as far as I am aware, using real company logos in movies generally is fine especially if the logo is something random in the background like when companies are shown in the background on a scene where the character is driving down the road. But in Deepwater Horizon, BP is portrayed very negatively (rightfully so) and their logo is used pretty front and center on the uniforms of some of the main actors in the show. Considering to prominently use a logo like this typically takes permission from the company, why would BP agree to this? Or did the movie just decide to deal with the legal consequences after the fact?",
