I\u2019m talking primarily about Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King. Afterwards the 90s run is still good but these four movies aren\u2019t just classics, they\u2019re arguably the finest children\u2019s films ever created. \n\nLike sitting here right now watching Beauty and the Beast (for the hundredth time lol) and \u201cBonjour\u201d may be one of the best musical numbers I\u2019ve ever heard. The quality of these movies is just off the charts. Makes me wonder - has there ever been a similar run where a studio just releases consecutive smash hits in such a brief period of time?",

That being said, what he does i feel is intangible. \n\nHe isn't super funny, his \"acting\" isn't especially spectacular, he doesn't pull some DDL or Meryl Streep shit, he doesn't take his shirt off or have a sex scene or anything. He's just...magnetic and highly watchable.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Hill, PSH, Pratt, all the supporting cast and the script are great, but Pitt delivers a movie star performance. What is the best example of this you can think of? A good movie elevated to phenomenal solely because a movie star was a movie star. Pure charisma. I'm thinking Clooney/Pitt in the Oceans movies, Newman in Cool Hand Luke and Butch Cassidy, Leo in Titanic. \n\nWhat's the best example you can think of? ",

        "content": "A long-lost piece of media is finally coming to the screen after 25 years.\n\nHouston Cinema Arts Society presents the world premiere of Dreams in the Attic, a never-before-aired live-action television film starring the late Shelley Duvall (The Shining, Faerie Tale Theatre) in one of her final roles. Filmed in 1999 on 16mm in Galveston and Houston, the movie was shelved after being passed over by the Disney Channel and has remained unseen for over two decades.\n\nIn celebration of Shelley Duvall\u2019s birthday, the film will premiere at Houston\u2019s historic River Oaks Theatre, marking its first public screening. Duvall stars as Aunt Nellie, the eccentric owner of a costume shop whose magical attic trunk allows anyone who tries on its costumes to bring their dreams to life.\n\nThe film features a standout cast including Haylie Duff (Napoleon Dynamite, Lizzie McGuire), Mary McDonough (The Waltons), and Vanessa Lee Chester (The Lost World: Jurassic Park). Long whispered about among fans of lost media, Dreams in the Attic has built a cult following based on its mysterious trailer and IMDb listing. Until now, no complete version of the film has ever been released or shown to the public.\n\nThe screening will include a post-film conversation with director Bob Willems, along with additional cast and crew members who will share behind-the-scenes stories and reflect on the film\u2019s unusual journey to the screen. Also joining the conversation is Sarah Lukowski, founder of the Shelley Duvall Archive, who will speak on Shelley\u2019s legacy and her friendship with the actress.\n\nThis special evening will honor Shelley Duvall\u2019s extraordinary career, her Houston roots, and a long-lost film that never got the chance to shine\u2014until now.\n\nTickets are limited. Be the first audience to see this film and reserve your seat today for this magical, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience!",

        "content": "I recently saw a video depicting an unruly child next to his mother who seemed to be ignoring his behavior and I instantly thought of Bebe's Kids.\n\n Bebe's Kids, (FREE on YouTube) is the first black comedy I ever saw as a child growing up. I'm sure there's a plethora of films dated before Bebe's Kids, but as a kid, it obviously stood out above the rest.\n\nIf you have never seen or heard of Bebe's Kids, I highly recommend you take the opportunity to watch what I would call the Citizens Kane of Black Family Comedy. It's a family-friendly film that transcends race and emulates the struggle parents and children have coping with new experiences in the struggle for happiness.\n\nSeriously, BeBe's Kids is Funny as Fuq, and you're missing an unforgettable experience if you haven't had the pleasure of enjoying this film with your friends and family. \n\nIf you watched Bebe's Kids as a youth, I highly recommend rewatching it, like Dinosaurs (1991), it's chalked full of jokes only adults will understand. \n\nHave you seen Bebe's Kids? What did you think? To me, it's a kids friendly version of Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, another Black Comedy Masterpiece, (I'd say it's kids friendly seeing as I watched it when I was 12 years old, but probably not by today's standards) but that's a film for another post.
