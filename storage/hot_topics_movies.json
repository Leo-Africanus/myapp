The story, characters, writing everything seemed so meh that i was shocked by the reception it got and of course people can like and love anything they want, it is art and we all connect to it individually but nomination for the best picture? i don't get it.\n\nand now Nosferatu, this fascinating dark gothic tale. beautifully shot, every frame is its own art and the writing and dialogues, actual depth, touching actual problems and subjects. actually widening an existing world, only Dracula adaptation that feels like to have this magnificent universe where Dracula is a part of instead of it being revolving around him. showing us new perspective and nuanced and strong protagonist. this is the dark and beautiful and magnificent story of toxic love and possession and monsters and i honestly don't feel like it got the love it deserved and people moved on really quickly.",

The work of Sofia Coppola particularly focuses on this troup (Lost in Translation, On the Rocks, Somewhere) but she's far from the only one making these films.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I somewhat role my eyes when I read a synopsis and see one of the main characters has some role in the creative arts (novellist, script writer, film maker etc etc) because it feels so played out.\n\nIs it just the fact that creative types can be naval-gazey? Is it that once you're involved in this kind of world you just write what you know? Or am I imaginging something that isn't there?",

David Jonsson and Tom Blythe were both great, with a few other supporting characters being good too (I knew I recognised one guy as Translucent from The Boys lol)\n\nSurprised it was a first time director too given how well the film was made, shot and wrote. I personally give it 8/10 and think it\u2019s worth watching given the chance",
