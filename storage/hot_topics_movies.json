        "content": "This movie is absolutely excellent in my opinion; I think it\u2019s one of Peter Jackson\u2019s best films, right alongside The Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s perfect in pretty much every way. I love the directing, the acting, the actors, the score, and the locations. The CGI for the time looked phenomenal back in 2005 and still holds up incredibly well today. I know that the film\u2019s length was and still is controversial, but I actually don\u2019t mind it. I personally think that the buildup to Skull Island is well done, and I think the whole movie was paced fairly well overall - with the first hour being in New York City and on the ship, the second hour on the island, and the third and final hour back in New York with Kong causing chaos. What do you all think? I think this is still the best version of Kong; I wish the newer movies had kept the 2005 design.\n\nEdit - this is in no way a diss to the other films. I like King Kong, no matter what. I just personally really enjoy this movie, and to me, it's the best. That's just my opinion. I like having discussions and seeing them; at the end of the day, they're all good films in their own way.",

        "content": "Re-watching the scene with Aurelio and Tarasov: the first few times I watched these scenes I was thinking of it as Aurelio owing John respect, and being disgusted by Tarasov's behavior. But re-watching it now, I realize that Aurelio is absolutely *terrified*. He realizes that if John thinks for a moment that he's helped Tarasov that he's dead, whereas if he humiliates Tarsov and kicks him out at least he has a chance of surviving Viggo's wrath. Both the scenes with Tarasov and the scenes with John he's basically making the case for his life, just in different ways.\n\nIt's easy to miss because John doesn't show any overt hostility towards Aurelio but part of Reeves' performance is he doesn't often show that, and the (apparently) calm drinking scene where Aurelio pours John a drink and they have the brief conversation about Tarasov is still one fraught with tension.\n\nAurelio's anxiousness is most evident when Tarasov first shows up with the car. It's not just Aurelio being disdainful of Tarasov, he's acutely aware that now he's involved, and knows that John's going to show up at some point. And if John thinks Aurelio helped Tarasov that he's a dead man. It's honestly a fantastic performance from Leguizamo, an all time great character actor, demonstrating a mix of emotions that I think often gets overlooked. It's honestly kind of amusing that he's demonstrating less fear during the conversation with Viggo (although not none) than he is when he's talking to Tarasov.",

Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\u201d? \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d?\n\nJohnny Oleksinski, New York Post 1/4 - This sloppy slog is terrible; short, but interminable.\n\nMoira MacDonald, Seattle Times 2.5/4 - It\u2019s not at all unpleasant spending two hours with Ella and her family and colleagues, but it leaves you feeling a little nostalgic for what it could have been.\n\nRadheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - Ella McCay, the movie, feels like we\u2019re being bear hugged by a lovable, slightly boozy old grand-uncle who genuinely hopes to find common ground with a new generation, but also can\u2019t help being a little patronizing.\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast - Its phoniness epitomized by Emma Mackey\u2019s lead turn, it\u2019s the biggest dud of the artist\u2019s career, and the holiday season\u2019s most egregious misfire.\n\nOdie Henderson, Boston Globe 2/4 - Ella McCay never registers as a real person; she\u2019s a collection of tics that Mackey desperately tries to play.\n\nVikram Murthi, IndieWire B - Watching \u201cElla McCay\u201d can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you\u2019re capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found.\n\nTim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) 1/5 - There\u2019s not a great deal more to be said about the experience, except that it is best politely avoided, like a Christmas invitation from neighbours you find chirpy, well-meaning and off-puttingly strange on every collision.\n\nTara Brady, Irish Times 3/5 - At 85, Brooks retains an instinct for human foibles and complex characters, even if on this occasion the material doesn\u2019t always live up to his cast.\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - This comedy-drama contains some of the crackling dialogue and disarming candour of Brooks\u2019 best work. Ultimately, however, this disjointed character study ultimately feels as messy as its heroine\u2019s life.\n\nAdrian Horton, Guardian 2/5 - Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess -- a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way.\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, TheWrap - 'Ella McCay' is a film about American politics in the same way that Pixar\u2019s 'Cars' is a movie about cars. As in yes, these are definitely films about politics and cars. But no, politics and cars don't work like that.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - Almost everyone here is trying way too hard, with the exception of Mackey, who\u2019s appealing and natural even when stuck in a phony world full of phony characters.\n\nTaylor Williams, Slant Magazine 2/4 - As it follows its main character navigating political and personal waters, James L. Brook\u2019s film finds itself poised between sincerity and artificiality\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes page:\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ella_mccay\n\nMetacritic page:\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/movie/ella-mccay/",

In the five minutes that they've been separated, did they jump in their carriage and leave her there!!? It drives me nuts because it makes no sense (and not the way it happens in the book). \n\nWhat scene in a movie makes no sense to you and has you yelling at the screen? ",

        "content": "Not sure if there is a better place to post this. Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.\n\nEveryone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.\n\nThe movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are \"timekeeper\" cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).\n\nBut the movie never fully explains more from there, and then turns generic. Amanda Seyfrieds character is a rich man's daughter who almost immediately falls in love with the protagonist and joins his fight against the system. They fight the system by randomly robbing banks and distributing time.\n\nCillian Murphy also plays the main Timekeeper cop, but is oddly overzealous about enforcing a bizarrely shitty system. Hes shown to have an insane amount of loyalty to the rigid class structure *despite being born and raised in the ghetto*. He \"made it out\" somehow, but then devotes his life to making sure others don't, and then dies from it because he was still pretty damn poor as a cop.\n\nOverall still an interesting watch but just wish we got a lot more. Background on the system and more explanations would have been way better than a generic love story and cookie cutter standoff.\n\nIts been a while since this came out, but anyone else think similar?\n\n\n",
