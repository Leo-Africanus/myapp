        "content": "My example would be Grave of the Fireflies. I'd heard that it was depressing and gut-wrenching and a hard watch, one many couldn't repeat, and I held off watching it for a while because of that. But when I finally did watch it, I wasn't nearly so moved by it. Yes, it was sad, but I wasn't gutted by it nor bawling my eyes out when it ended. (Frankly, it was a little boring.) Plenty of movies have gotten to me the way this one was \"supposed\" to, but this wasn't one of them.\n\nETA: I've thoroughly enjoyed reading everyone's responses (and I do mean all of them, which I will continue to do until it's clear no new responses are incoming). A few things have struck me:\n\n1) I appreciate that quite a few of you have given movies two or even three or more viewings to see if they can be \"redeemed\" in your eyes. Your openness is refreshing and admirable.\n\n2) I'm also grateful a number of you gave generally balanced opinions and allow for the good or bad even when you went the opposite way.\n\n3) Because you provided more reasoned explanations than simply naming a film or saying something sucked/was great, I liked the extra perspective it gave me on some of these movies. I can bring more appreciation for the opposing viewpoint when I, too, was contrarian.",

        "content": "Genuinely curious, I\u2019m not sure what the current consensus on Beau is after it has been streaming for a while now.\n\nI saw Beau in theaters and I thought it was good but unfocused and forgettable. A few weeks ago, I was recovering from surgery and couldn\u2019t do anything to pass the time but watch movies, so I watched some longer films, one of which was a rewatch of Beau.\n\nThis time around, I loved it. It has slowly become one of my favorite modern films. I can always get thoroughly absorbed in the world building, and I love that I\u2019m basically getting a surreal nightmare triptych starring one of my favorite actors in the lead role. \n\nI believe Beau will receive its \u201cFire Walk With Me\u201d renaissance one day.

She was such a talent.\n\nAlso Ron Jeremy aka the Hedgehog makes an appearance as the strip club bartender.",

I\u2019m curious to hear from those born in 1970 or earlier: what movies rivaled or even surpassed a film with the level of hype like Avengers: Endgame?",
