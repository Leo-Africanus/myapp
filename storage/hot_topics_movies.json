It took years for the movie to be reevaluated as a Horror classic. \n\nI got to see the remastered version in theaters a few weeks ago and besides Jack Nicholson's tour de force as Jack Torrance (everybody was good including the kid actor), I must say I got to enjoy Shelley Duvall a whole lot more. Her performance is much more subtle than Nicholson's because her character, Wendy, internalizes everything. She's trying to make the household as tension-free as possible because she's scared of her husband so she comes up with these cookie cutter comments but everything she does or say irritates her husband. \n\nOne scene in particular which had me near tears was when Wendy sees Danny from afar while Jack is breaking down. In her mind, she's trying to keep Danny away so as to not irritate Jack more but as she comes closer to Danny and sees the bruises in his neck, she explodes. She lets Jack have it after weeks of trying to keep the peace. All the fear and tension was gone because now all she could see was her kid is hurt and visibly traumatized and she wanted to rail against the man she assumes hurt him.",

You have really made me chuckle, and I have enjoyed having fun with each of you. I have replied to lost of you but if there's anyone I missed please let me know.\n\nI know fun may not be your natural stance, as your inability to laugh at action movies shows, but you have still brightened my evening with your wonderfully literal and serious comments that completely missed the joke. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI genuinely hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, and that maybe you get a sense of fun from Santa this year.

        "content": "I know I\u2019m very late to the party, but I\u2019ve just finished Octopus Teacher. I remember it being a big deal forever ago, and it\u2019s one of those films I\u2019ve been meaning to get to. I really liked the idea of him befriending the octopus and documenting it. Nature films almost always have a hands-off approach, which makes sense when you\u2019re just trying to capture their life. However, seeing an approach focused on interspecies relationships with a wild creature is quite unique. His daily visits, the curiosity, the way he interacted with her over time it felt like a genuine study of the relationship between a human and an octopus. Watching how she responded, how her behavior changed with his presence, all of that was fascinating, and I think framing it as a relationship makes total sense. That\u2019s what the film really captures well, the give and take, the trust, the exploration of interspecies connection, even calling her his teacher.\n\nBut at the same time, I found it really conflicting. Once you\u2019re part of her world, once she\u2019s used to your presence, you\u2019re already influencing her. So when he refuses to intervene against predators, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s not just philosophy or respect for nature.. it\u2019s ignoring the consequences of your own presence, and I\u2019d argue it\u2019s actually a huge missed opportunity to observe how the relationship changes, if at all, after saving her. From both a human and a scientific perspective, saving her would make sense: it would show how she responds to care, trust, and protection. Not doing it while acting like he admires her comes across as disingenuous, even if she ultimately gets away. It\u2019s an interspecies relationship that\u2019s being studied. A very human response is to protect her\u2026 Just do your part and be a human during these interactions. No human would let that happen to their friend. I get non-intervention when it\u2019s the end of her life, like after laying eggs, but the middle sections felt inconsistent, and that\u2019s what kept bothering me. I also understand the approach to never intervene when OBSERVING nature but that\u2019s not what he is doing. ",

        "title": "Inland Empire (2006)",
        "content": "I can't really explain how much I love this movie, there's just something about it. A strange atmosphere and incredible dialogue that draws you in and ties it all together. This movie is 3 hours long and the deleted scenes are another hour and I always watch them both, back to back. I just can't get enough of this.\n\nMy only gripe is that it was shot on digital, because in 2006 digital did not look very nice. Lynch manages to have it look as Lynchian as possible but there's limits. On film, his stuff always looked so much better. But this project couldn't have existed without digital; film is so much more expensive and what he did was basically get a digital camera and just shoot whatever, writing new scripts from day to day, figuring it would all fit together in the end. Digital gave him the freedom of shooting so many hours of this stuff, making it up as he went along, so it's integral to the project.\n\nLynch may not have had everything worked out as he shot the film, but he clearly had a mood, and possibly an overarching structure (I think he might have worked that out after though). This movie always hypnotizes me and I oddly never feel like it's too long or confusing. I love it.\n\nNow as for the key to the story, I don't want to put all of my thoughts here, but I think Deleuze's becoming-animal offers a way in. Thinking ourselves to be totally other allows escape from a certain reified, oedipalized subjectivity. We can trace the different inchoate, situational, and historical subjectivities that exist within the unconscious. Going inward to schizophrenize, to realize the body without organs. To explore the unconscious and all who reside within as partial, larval subjects.\n\nFilm reflects reality, reality reflects film. It's no wonder that an actress can get lost in a character that thousands of women have played throughout their lives, the stories always the same. Trauma as pure affect, a Joycean literature of experience and difference beyond discrete subjects and representation. The spectator experiences the film in the same way the actress does, beyond representation and as affective relation and intensive individuation. A character is created, a larval self, and it exists alongside many other selves. What is that character doing inside the unconscious when we are not inhabiting it with awareness at the moment? Is she scared, running blindly in the darkness? Is the film the fantasy and the character real? Is the viewer part of the film?\n\nHegel, Deleuze, Buddhism. Going inward may allow us to exteriorize, to realize that there is no difference between the self and the other. This is an exploration of a Hegelian \"spirit coming to know itself\", but in a Deleuzian mode of anti-representation. That's why this is Lynch's magnum opus. All of his other films gave us subjects, traditional stories with psychoanalytic symbolism. The story would break down over time, true, but always in service of a symbolic metaphor. Inland Empire is Lynch's first and only film to go beyond this symbolic mode of filmmaking and enter a Deleuzian anti-psychoanalysis, a minoritarian mode of affect without subject. That's why this film is so difficult, yet entrancing.\n\nTracing trauma across bodies, across space and time, through the bodies of women. A geneology of trauma without respect to subjects or traditional story structure. Representational and symbolic interpretations of this film are doomed to fail. I read a complex and well written hermeneutics of the movie, but I don't think it's entirely correct; there's an excess at the seams. There's an element of a girl going through purgatory, yes, reincarnation, murder. It's overdetermined, it's also an exploration of the unconscious with a psychoanalyst. But it's also every woman's story, the shared trauma of womanhood. It traces affect across bodies. There are multiple stories, vague structures that cohere and collapse. It's Deleuzian, Hegelian, Buddhist, psychoanalytic. It's art. Pure art, and at its core it's about giving us feminine trauma and then going through it, killing the negative, and emerging above it. Accepting the unity of difference or negation and purging ourselves of the bad, flying away. It's a beautiful last film.",

        "content": "I finally watched TENET, and I'm blown away how one of my favorite directors could make such a poor film.\n\nWhen TENET first came out, I missed in in theaters, but tried to watch it at home. I lasted maybe 30 minutes, but was so confused and bored, I stopped watching it.\n\nI finally decided to watch it in full, properly, thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right headspace at the time.\n\nAnd for those that might say the film would have been better if it was experienced in IMAX or theatres, I did watch it on a fairly decent setup. 4K Bluray/UB820, LG G5 Oled + Q990D. I fully appreciate the theater experience, but I don't think it would in any way change my feelings.\n\nAnd after 2.5 hours, I think it's the worst film Nolan has ever made, a director who's films I've generally loved.\n\nInterstellar is one of my favorite films of all time, and I've loved his other films like Memento, Dunkirk, Inception, Batman Trilogy, Oppenheimer, etc... Almost without fail, his films have been complex spectacle with fantastic writing and an emotional core that carried the films.\n\nTENET was none of those things, IMO.\n\nTENET is far too complex for it's own good, and even after fully understanding the different flows of time the characters are going through, it's just a bad story. It's complexity for the sake of complexity, without serving the actual story.\n\nThere are precisely 0 characters you care about, there is no emotional core to the film, at all. The final \"idea\" of the film that Neil and the Protag had this great friendship in two different directions was cool, but it was never earned.\n\nI thought John David Washington's performance was pretty awful, he has the charisma of a wet paper bag, and the writing of the film does him no favors. I've liked him in other roles, so I would put more of this on the writing than him to some degree. The writing in general for all the dialog was AWFUL. People talk like CHAT GPT robots, in unnatural ways.\n\nI at least thought the action spectacle would be worth the price of admission, but I thought it was pretty disjointed and unemployable to watch. The fights where people going forward through time were fighting people going backwards just looked disjointed, and unappealing to watch.\n\nSome of the music was kind of cool, but it felt more like soundscapes than a true OST.\n\nOverall, the entire film felt more like an \"idea\" than an actual film, it was insanely disappointing.",
