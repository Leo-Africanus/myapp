Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first \u201cSonic\u201d in 2020.\n\n[io9.com](https://gizmodo.com/sonic-3-movie-review-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-paramount-sega-2000540156):\n\n\n&gt;Full of electric spectacle and action-packed adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 completes the best video game movie trilogy yet.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.\n\n[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)\n\n&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (8/10):\n\n\n&gt;Clever jokes, a noticeable reverence for the source material, and some fantastic antagonists make the Blue Blur's latest race an entertaining ride from start to finish.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;The outcome is a \"Sonic\" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\n[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Carrey\u2019s antic madness \u2013 elsewhere often too much to digest \u2013 is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.\n\n[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):\n\n&gt;Whether it\u2019s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):\n\n&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.\n\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):\n\n&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project \u2026 well, it\u2019s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The MVP of the first two films, Carrey dials down the physical comedy in both his roles, amping up punning (\u201cDorkupine!\u201d) to hit-and-miss effect. For all the actor\u2019s gurning and the film\u2019s visual busyness, few images pop or lodge in the memory.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):\n\n&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn\u2019t as fast as its blue protagonist.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before. With their abilities outmatched in every way, Team Sonic must seek out an unlikely alliance in hopes of stopping Shadow and protecting the planet.\n\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog\n* Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower\n* Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna\n* Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog\n\n**Live-action cast**\n\n* Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik\n* James Marsden as Tom Wachowski\n* Tika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski\n* Krysten Ritter as Director Rockwell\n* Natasha Rothwell as Rachel\n* Shemar Moore as Randall Handel\n* Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone\n* Tom Butler as Commander Walters\n* Adam Pally as Wade Whipple\n* Alyla Browne as Maria Robotnik\n\nDirected by: Jeff Fowler\n\nScreenplay by: Pat Casey, Josh Miller, John Whittington\n\nStory by: Pat Casey and Josh Miller\n\nProduced by: Neal H.

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nit's more or less 2 months ago, that I started a special journey through the filmised Europe. Inspired by an idea of u/CWKitch, who asked [for your favorite movie set in a certain U. S. state](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e1yi2e/movies_by_state_hawaii/) every day in this sub for a while, I wanted to find out how the individual European countries are portrayed in films. And so I began to ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. This journey has now come to an end - at least here on Reddit.\n\nAlthough I was never able to achieve the reach here that the original had right from the start, I would still like to thank everyone who took part with suitable suggestions, upvotes and downvotes as well as in various discussions. Some of you have participated on a very regular basis, while others have proudly presented internationally lesser-known films from \u2018their\u2019 countries with unprecedented vigour - u/robsonmb even created a [Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/), which has now received its last entry: **Conclave** wins the title as your favorite movie set in Vatican City.\n\nThis results in a few interesting facts and figures for the overall list, which are also provided by the above mentioned user that I don't want to withhold from you here:\n\n    Release dates: \n    \n     * Mean Year: 1997\n     * Median Year: 2001\n     * Mode Year: 2006 (4 films)\n     * Mode Decade: 2000s (15 films)\n     * Earliest: The Halfway House (1944)\n     * Newest: Conclave (2024)\n     * Fun fact: Each decade from now to the 1940s has at least 2 films\n    \n    Most frequent languages:\n    \n     * English: 7 films\n     * French: 3 films\n     * German: 3 films\n     * Fun fact: The films cover 38 different languages\n    \n    Most frequent genres:\n    \n     * Drama: 83% of films\n     * Comedy: 30% of films\n     * War: 17% of films\n     * Crime: 11% of films\n     * Romance: 9% of films\n     * Fun fact: No films are categorised as Documentary, Music, or TV Movie\n    \n    Film length:\n    \n     * Longest: Satantango (1994) at 7h12m\n     * Shortest: The Color of Pomegranates (1969) and The Dream (2001) at 1h20m each\n     * Mean: 1h52m48s\n     * Fun fact: The amount of time required to watch all films is 99h12m\n    \n    Country:\n    \n     * Top 3 most frequent origin countries:\n       * Soviet Union: 6\n       * UK: 6\n       * France: 4\n     * Top 3 most frequent production countries:\n       * UK: 10\n       * France: 9\n       * Germany: 9\n     * Fun fact: There are 40 origin countries and 46 production countries\n    \n    Directors:\n    \n     * Directors with multiple films:\n       * Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski\n         * A Short Film About Killing (1988)\n         * Three Colours: Red (1994)\n       * Sergei Parajanov\n         * Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1965)\n         * The Color of Pomegranates (1969)\n     * Gender:\n       * Women: x2\n         * The Girl from Monaco (2008)\n         * Hive (2021)\n       * Men: x53\n    \n    Watches by Letterboxd users:\n    \n     * Top 3:\n       * Trainspotting (1996) at 1.2m\n       * Pan's Labyrinth (2006) at 1.1m\n       * Hot Fuzz (2007) at 1.1m\n     * Bottom 3:\n       * The Burning Cold (2023) at 132\n       * Unknown Men of San Marino (1948) at 53\n       * Children of the Mountains (1958) at 4\n     * Fun fact: \"Unknown Men of San Marino\" is so unknown that the film name has a typo on Letterboxd\n    \n    Ratings by Letterboxd users:\n    \n     * Top 3:\n       * Come and See (1985) at 4.63/5\n       * La Haine (1995) at 4.51/5\n       * Cinema Paradiso (1988) at 4.47/5\n     * Bottom 3:\n       * The Halfway House (1944) at 3.32/5\n       * The Last Ashes (2023) at 3.31/5\n       * The Girl from Monaco (2008) at 3.04/5\n\nI'm sure thanks to the Letterboxd list you can still play some statistical tricks - and you might want to do that with [the earlier \u2018favourite movie by state list\u2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fpkzac/favorite_movie_by_state_fin/) , or maybe - I hope - with another list for another continent.

Going in without knowing anything about the story, I thought this film was going to be a Sly action film going wild on bad guys (which is also a fun time) but when it started progressing, I was surprised when he is actually getting into a long spanning fight with the police. \n\nI loved how this film was more reflective and character work is done so smoothly through dialogues and flashbacks. A soldier isolated and ostracized by society riddled with PTSD getting pushed around with no limits. I am not saying he is not at fault too but the first blood was not shed by him. A troubled man getting troubled further. \n\nThat monologue at the end of the film was just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking. It also puts into perspective the mental anguish of the character in broad strokes. Overall, First Blood is a triumphant film in all the right ways\n",

Really one of those \"you'll laugh, you'll cry\" films. \n\nAre there any other movies that deal with heartbreak in such a way? I haven't been much for pure romance movies lately because I have had a hard time digesting a lot of the imagery (what's that meme about \"I don't care something good happened to you, it should've happened to me\"?) so I think more empathetic meditations on loss of love is what I'm looking for.",

        "title": "My Take On Smile 2",
        "content": "So, I watched Smile 2 and\u2026absolutely loved it. I\u2019m still a fan of the first movie, but the sequel\u2019s cinematography, acting, and depiction of psychological suffering were spot on. I\u2019ve never heard of Naomi Scott before but was blown away by her acting. It felt as if I was inside her mind the whole time and feeling her misery. *\u201cI feel like my brain is this really f\\*\\*ked up place, full of all this chaos and noise. And I\u2019m trapped there, all alone, in this darkness. And, I just want to quiet the noise, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d* For these reasons, I think I prefer this film over the first one.\u00a0\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how I would like the whole pop star theme, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it brought depth to Skye\u2019s character. Namely, how famous people struggle amidst their high-profile status. Skye had substance abuse issues and a mother who only cared about fame and money, which helped emphasize the fact that she was alone in her suffering. Very tragic in a way.\u00a0\n\nThe opening scene was fantastic with good eerie music that sent chills down my spine. Out of all the scenes in the film, I think the creepiest one for me was Gemma smiling in Skye\u2019s bed (*\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a horrible person\u201d*). Another one was when Skye was at the mental health center and her mom turned into the Entity. Definitely some well-acted scenes.\u00a0\n\nThe only issues I felt with the film were that there were too many hallucinations so that I was constantly confused by what was real and what wasn\u2019t, which was obviously the point. Also, I *did not* like that Skye died. It didn\u2019t seem right with her strong-willed attitude, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized she didn\u2019t have much of a chance considering her background. Did anyone else feel the same way?\n\nI do have a couple questions that I\u2019m still not quite understanding with the movie. How did Joel pass the Entity onto Lewis? What if the infected person smiled back at the person smiling at them? Would the entity then leave them alone?\u00a0Also, my guess is that the third movie will reveal that the entity has gone global, but can it only infect one person at a time? There were so many of Skye\u2019s fans who witnessed her death, but if it can\u2019t go worldwide, maybe whoever runs onto the stage to her aid becomes infected with it?\u00a0\n\nI'd love to hear everyone's thoughts!\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give this film an 8/10.",
