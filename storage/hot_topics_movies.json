Super proud of it for the idea, it's done fully analog, shot on Kodak Gold, enlarged onto Fuji C-Print paper by Tricolor in Switzerland and then a friend of mine drew the titel with a silver pen onto the printed images.\n\nI like it because it represents the film quite well, it's set in the 80s, in a wooden shed where a scientist tries to build a time machine. Being in a cold, uncontrolled shed, it's hard to get perfect development of film, so the colors and exposure is a bit wanky, it really feels like a slightly rushed selfie.\n\nWe made 6 enlargments which we later on handed out to cast &amp; crew, which was pretty cool.\n\nThe film is now also finally on YouTube (You can find it by the title, by Faultea Films), after touring a couple Film Festivals and even winning two of them :) Not the easiest film to understand though.\n\nHappy for feedback!",

I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid and there's a bunch of stuff I have zero memories of (the bus movie begins with an elevator shaft rescue scene??).\n\nMy favorite part of this movie is Dennis Hopper, though. This has got to be the most unintentionally funny villain in all cinema. The guy will not shut up; he constantly yells JACK (Keanu's character) and its in Hopper's very specific accent so it just all sounds hilarious. I don't think there is a single moment in the film where he has a neutral expression on his face.",

The rest of what turns out to be a very shallow romantic comedy of remarriage just drained the life out of me! \n\nI got wondering, what are some other movies that start off really strong and then just kinda fizzle out? I'm thinking more a long opening sequence vs a smaller scene (like when they recipe the previous films in the Planet of the Apes series or the MCU).\nThe wilder the swing the better!\n",

Apart from it being a bloody amazing blockbuster, I\u2019d forgotten just how great Bill Paxton is in the everyman role.\n\nIt got me thinking about how you don\u2019t really see that kind of actor in cinema these days. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Bill Paxton was a good-looking guy\u2014but a lot of actors today are too manicured, shredded to the absolute lowest body fat percentage, and just don\u2019t feel like someone you'd see on the street who could pull off the same role.\n\nObviously, Glen Powell was the male lead in Twisters, and he was really good, but he wasn\u2019t aiming for that everyman role\u2014instead, he went for the YouTube influencer type.\n\nThere's still everyman actors out there, but they're from generations before and a lot older now (Costner, Keaton, Quaid, William H. Macy, for example). So who do we have as the next crop to take the mantle?\n\nEDIT: There's a lot of good actors being mentioned below but I think they're too old to be considered this generation's. For example, Bill Paxton was 41 at the time of Twister. A lot of the actors mentioned are already way past that, into their late 40s and early 50s.",

        "content": "This is the first Terrence Malick film that I've ever seen, and from looking at his filmography and reading about his projects, it seems I may have started with his very best work.. something that I'm inclined to believe because of just how much The Thin Red Line impressed me, though obviously I can't say that for certain without diving into the rest of his stuff.\n\nIt's a beautiful film, and it really skillfully balances highs and lows in the way that it takes time to appreciate the joy of life while also facing down the creeping specter of death. Throughout the entire story, it keeps its focus firmly on the exploration of its characters, and it devotes just as much time to their internal struggles as it does to their external ones. Ultimately, it's a story about what war does to the human soul, and the way that it acts as a catalyst for people to face horror, pettiness, and the harsh realities of their own existence.\n\nBut despite that ever-present existentialism, the film does manage to find shreds of hope and peace amongst the chaos of the battlefield, and that bittersweet mix is what will make its story really stick with me for a while.\n\nThere are several impressive performances in the movie, but Nick Nolte is undeniably the MVP here for me; he brings fantastic nuance to a challenging, very flawed, very human character, and it's awesome to watch.",

        "content": "In the 1980s and 1990s, we had some great action heroes: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme,....\n\nYeah, yeah, we make fun of them now, but they were great at the time. Then slowly, superhero movies dominated everything and we lost the old macho energy these guys used to bring to the screen. Chris Hemsworth is probably the closest we have to those guys right now, but generally, they have been replaced by boyish-looking dudes who just don't radiate the same masculine energy. Nothing wrong with the actors themselves, it's just they are who they are, and for people looking for the old action heroes, especially after you watch a movie from the 80s and kind of miss that energy, they come up short. \n\nAnybody feel the same? Or are you glad we are done with the old action guys?",

        "content": "Question, Why did Oskar Werner appeared so infrequently in films?\n\nOskar Werner is one of those actors that I wonder why he didn't do more films. He was outstanding for the roles he did do, Decision Before Dawn, Jules and Jim, The Spy Who Came In Cold, Ship Of Fools, Fahrenheit 451, The Shoes Of The Fisherman, and Voyage of the Damned.  If you wonder why I pick these roles, it is because, other than his German films, these roles are quite literally his entire career in film.\n\n It seems after Fahrenheit 451, he was really infrequent with his film roles and I just wonder why. I do remember reading that he was considered for Kubrick's Napoleon &amp; Barry Lyndon (for the roles, Napoleon Bonaparte, &amp; Captain Potzdorf) and was supposed to appear in Michael Cimino's unmade film, Perfect Strangers. I will say for the roles he did appear; he was great in them and probably the best part in them.\n\nAll in All, Why did Oskar Werner appeared so infrequently in films?",
