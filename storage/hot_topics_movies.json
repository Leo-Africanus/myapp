She actually seemed pretty cool, and really tried her best to make sure she was keeping the kids safe and watching over them while Claire was too busy to spend time with them. \n\nThe worst part is, is that even after she dies, Claire never asks about her whereabouts or mentions ever again.

You are mesmerized by literally the greatest car chase in movie history, bar none. No CGI, just real cars doing real car shit. \n\nThe hot lesbian sex and the hot cop sex also wows you. And don't forget John Turturro being a total scumbag. The action is relentless and every character is grimier than the next. Honestly one of the greatest, and most under rated, movies of the 80s. \n\nBut here is the thing! its literally not until the very last line of dialogue that you realize Friedkin's genius in this flick. What you thought was the C story was actually the A story all along. \n\n\"You're working for me now\" \n\nholy shit! Then it hits you - this movie was really about Vukovich being slowly, methodically corrupted and turned into another psycho just like his partner was. Bit by bit, step by step, he is lead along the way until its too late and now he has become the monster. \n\nFriedkin you son of a bitch!",

        "content": "This came to mind after viewing \"Final Destination: Bloodlines\", which not only features Tony Todd in his final role, but which also gives him a deeply moving and memorable farewell onscreen (which they let him write himself no less). As hard as it can be to watch a clearly ill Todd, there's no doubt he's afforded a luxury actors don't always get, a curtain bow worthy of them. Many actors have their final roles in subpar films, either by necessity, choice or cruel fate. (One would think Peter Sellers, had he known his fatal heart attack was coming, would have much preferred \"Being There\" as his final role and not \"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu.\") There's two in particular, however, who come to mind who really got sent off in grand style.\n\nBurt Lancaster in \"Field of Dreams.\" He did do some TV work afterwards, but Lancaster's turn as Doc \"Moonlight\" Graham was his movie farewell and what a beautiful one it is to see. Namely thanks to his departure into the cornfield accompanied by Ray Liotta's parting words.\n\n\"Hey rookie!...You were good.\"\n\nEdward G. Robinson in \"Soylent Green.\" This one is especially similar to Todd; a terminally ill actor in what he knows is will be his final role gets a grand showcase to say goodbye. Robinson's final act assisted suicide (\"going home\" in the words of the dystopian future society of \"Soylent Green\") is essentially a Viking-style funeral for the legendary actor and highly emotional (helped by co-star Charleton Heston's genuine reaction, who'd been told by Robinson of his terminal condition and thus his tears in that scene are not acting).\n\nAny other examples?",

One thing that really struck me is that, despite all the chaos and violence, it took its time. It lingered on specific images, and let quiet, still moments speak for themselves. Each character was brilliant and I absolutely adored the dialogue. And the ending! I can imagine there were probably many people who felt unsatisfied but I personally loved it. Nobody wins, nobody gets out on top. The story concludes itself quietly and calmly. \n\n- Enjoyment: 9\n- Plot: 9\n- Visuals: 10\n\n**Overall: 9.3/10**\n\nDoes it deserve a top 100 spot? Totally \n",

        "title": "Lynne Ramsay's 'Die, My Love' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*In a remote forgotten rural area, a mother struggles to maintain her sanity as she battles with psychosis.*\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Pattinson, LaKeith Stanfield, Sissy Spacek\n\n(couldn't seem to update the last post so I'm making a new one, hoping it works now)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: [89%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/die_my_love_2025)\n\nMetacritic: [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/die-my-love)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[BBC - Nicholas Barber](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250517-die-my-love-review-jennifer-lawrence-is-better-than-ever-in-a-searing-portrait-of-motherhood) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Die, My Love should probably be shown to teenagers as a warning of how repetitive, exasperating and alienating it can be to look after a baby. Ramsay makes expert use of countless techniques \u2013 detailed sound design, insistent music, mixed-up chronology, bizarre dream sequences \u2013 to convey the sense that Grace is becoming blearily adrift from reality: she may be even more unstable than the traumatised protagonist of Ramsay's last film, 2017's You Were Never Really Here.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/die-my-love-review-jennifer-lawrence-robert-pattinson-1236401527/)\n\n&gt;Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s performance feels so explosive but, at the same time, so emotionally reined in. In \u201cDie My Love,\u201d you feel the power of her presence, the hellbent quality of her rage. When it comes to chewing out a blabby cashier, crawling around like an animal, trashing the bathroom and pouring soap products all over the floor, or bashing her head on a mirror, she\u2019s an ace wastrel. But the very force of her destruction makes us want to go: What is happening?\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/die-my-love-review-jennifer-lawrence-lynne-ramsay-1235124227/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;Seeing \u201cDie My Love\u201d at Cannes, European critics will be unfazed by Lawrence\u2019s unvarnished and very naked turn, though in the U.S., she will be commended for her \u201cbravery.\u201d If enough people see it at all to make such an appraisal. Her performance will shock the baser public. What Lawrence achieves here is extremely impressive, a marquee movie star throwing herself with abandon into a filmmaker\u2019s warped and demandingly miserable vision. A last visual metaphor, however strained, forces us (and Jackson) to finally see Grace for who she is: a woman beyond the pale, beyond reproach, beyond help. Lawrence is committed to the insanity. She\u2019s never been better, and she needs no help getting to where this film takes her. Lynne Ramsay, wind her up and watch her go.\n\n[Independent UK - Monks Kaufman](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/die-my-love-review-cannes-jennifer-lawrence-b2752523.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1747514822) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;MVP here is Robert Pattinson, whose layered performance contains both the man that Grace cannot abide and the one who is worried about his wife. His expression when she asks why he is stressed is so despairing that it deepens Jackson in one fell swoop. It\u2019s a shame to single out a male performance in a tale of primal femininity. There is simply no one for Lawrence to bounce off and no structure against which to craft an emotional trajectory. She is dancing on her own.\n\n[The Wrap - Chase Hutchinson](https://www.thewrap.com/die-my-love-review-robert-pattinson-and-jennifer-lawrence-are-outstanding-in-haunting-domestic-horror/)\n\n&gt;Even as it\u2019s not Ramsay\u2019s best film, even a minor work from the filmmaker is still better than just about any other director. There remains a haunting power that she\u2019s able to wield over her audience. Both Pattinson and Lawrence are outstanding in their roles \u2014 the latter becomes a protagonist of sorts while the other is a pseudo-antagonist. We can see the anger, fear and isolation in their every move, with the vacancy that exists behind their eyes proving to be the most chilling part of the whole affair.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/05/die-my-love-review-lynne-ramsay-jennifer-lawrence-robert-pattinson-1236402485/)\n\n&gt;America knows very well how good Jennifer Lawrence can be, and this could well mean a fifth Oscar nomination if it lands in savvy hands. It could also be the film that takes Ramsay into the next stage of her career. As producer Martin Scorsese well knows, she\u2019s a genius. And now, it turns out \u2014 goddammit \u2014 she can sing too.\n\n[Collider - Emma Kiely](https://collider.com/die-my-love-review-jennifer-lawrence-robert-pattinson/) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;*Die, My Love* feels like Ramsay\u2019s way of showing how versatile she is. It\u2019s not as hopeless and disturbing as something like *We Need to Talk About Kevin,* following the optimism of her last film, the desolate crime thriller, *You Were Never Really Here*. But what it has in common with all of her work is that it draws out the little ways humans can be so destructive to themselves and each other. *Die, My Love* is further proof that no one is doing it like Lynne Ramsay, whose technique and style continue to evolve, as she draws out a career-best performance from Jennifer Lawrence in a must-see thriller spectacle that turns a single woman\u2019s experience into a brutally honest psychological epic.",

Antonio Banderas repeating to himself \u201cit\u2019s a man\u2026\u201d while he is mowing down savages dressed as bears alongside a bunch of Vikings while a village burns is just top tier action filmmaking. They just don\u2019t make movies like they used to. I couldn\u2019t name a single other actor in this flick but the whole cast is just draining 3\u2019s from the logo. Not much of a surprise though. Saying McTiernan is good at directing a monster movie in the jungle/woods is like saying Spielberg is good directing kids or Tom Brady is good playing football. The dude is in his element. \n\n\u201cLo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers. Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning. Lo they do call to me. They bid me take my place among them in the halls of Valhalla, where the brave may live forever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "My personal pick is Tron: Legacy. It was an OK movie, with good effects and questionable CGI characters, but the score was superb. Daft Punk did a great job, and the film is remembered primarily for its soundtrack rather than the film itself. Nine Inch Nails faces a major challenge because their work can't avoid being compared to the musical legacy Daft Punk left us.\nhich other movies do you think Another movie worth mentioning is Sucker Punch. While not particularly memorable as a film, its music selection is excellent, which, at least for me, often happens with Zack Snyder\u2019s movies.",
