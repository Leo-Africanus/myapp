Other examples come to mind?",

        "content": "St. Elmo's Fire is referenced all the time, and is considered to be in the same league as John Hughes comedies. But it really is a shitty movie.\n\nIf it weren't for the title song and the very good musical score by David Foster, there wouldn't be many redeeming qualities about it.\n\nDemi Moore gives the most realistic performance. Ally Sheedy is high-school play level bad in every scene, and seems coked up with her nervous delivery.\n\nRob Lowe jumping onto stage yelling, \"Let's rock!\" is cringeworthy. Judd Nelson has none of his appeal from \"The Breakfast Club.\" Demi Moore's gay friend is a stereotypical, flouncing flamer, and she refers to Kevin being gay as a problem. Mare Winningham is the most bizarre casting, and doesn't fit with any of them.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was originally considered for Rob Lowe's role. Other actors considered or turned down roles: Brooke Shields, Tatum O'Neal, Jodie Foster, Joan Cusack, C. Thomas Howell, Jamie lee Curtis, Melanie Griffith, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Elisabeth Shue, Bridget Fonda, Anthony Edwards, Lea Thompson\n\nDid you see this movie when it came out and what do you think of it now?",

        "title": "Rewatching 'Seven' yesterday really made me realize how weak 'Longlegs' was",
        "content": "They did a re-release of Seven in IMAX this past weekend, and even though it's not the most obvious contender for the format, I was able to go with my subscription, having only seen it on TV previously, and goddamn did it hold up.\n\nThe sound design, especially the music used in the opening titles, felt so grimy and real. The way the story unfolds as it slowly creeps towards an inevitable conclusion, even going so far as to have Somerset say \"you know this isn't gonna have a happy ending.\"\n\nThere were a lot of details I picked up with seeing it at that scale; one moment that stood out to me is when they have dinner together, the moment Somerset sees Tracy, there's this momentary darting-of-the-eyes that almost looks like a brief moment of recognition of what's to come, or at least a grizzled detective who's seen enough to know that a young detective with a beautiful wife investigating a vicious serial killer isn't going to end well, and that there's a reason the people who end up in that field for so long generally don't have anyone that immediately close to them.\n\nCompared to last year's *Longlegs*, which like many of you I was excited for based on the marketing - visually, it seemed creepy, the weird symbols, the grainy crime scene photos, the billboard with the phone number, it was all a brilliant way to get millions of people to watch something with a paper-thin story.\n\nThe biggest issue with the film is that it seems more intent on capturing the \"ambience\" and \"vibe\" of the genre, which it admittedly does well, but once you actually realize how thin the story is and how little there are to any of these characters, it begins to resemble the turkey from *Christmas Vacation* turning into dust.\n\nThere's a scene in *Seven* of the two detectives on the couch pouring over evidence; Mills says he's getting a second beer, and asks if Somerset wants one as well. Somerset says he'd prefer wine. Right away, this tells us not only did Mills start drinking first (which feels very in character), but that Somerset would prefer something slower, so as to not get too drunk while working. Mills proceeds to pour an absurd amount of wine into a tall, regular drinking glass, and only a minute later does Somerset pick up the glass, notice how full it is, and briefly look at it in befuddlement. Almost all of this exchange occurs visually.\n\nThere's more characterization in this scene than literally the entirely of *Longlegs*.\n\nA phrase I've heard used in comedy (but that I also think applies to many forms of storytelling) is, \"don't put a hat on a hat.\" Aka, the context I first heard it was in relation to writing a sketch for SNL that had Natalie Portman in it, where the initial setup was going to be something about a tutor teaching a student, and then halfway through they said \"wait what if she's also her character from Star Wars\", and then the whole thing fell apart. This kept ringing true the more *Longlegs* continued its descent into silly contrivances, with four separate plot elements that all feel as though they could've independently been the vessel for a story; the mother being forced to make a pact with the killer (which in itself is already absurd; the idea that maybe she would've turned a blind eye towards *one* as a way to save her daughter would've been interesting and slightly believable, but the idea that she ends up taking this gig for twenty years is laughably dumb).\n\nWe then proceed to learn the full extent of it, that the plan was for Longlegs to get the mother to delivery dolls to these families that had metal orbs in their heads that caused the families to go crazy and kill each other. It's like reheated Mike Flanagan gumbo. I was shocked at how not 'cool', smart or interesting this reveal felt in comparison to how sleek and Fincher-y the first hour of it felt. It's a cinematic Krabby Land.\n\nAnyways, I don't mean for this to just be another \"muh old is better\" as much as it is a hunger for more films with real characters that act and behave like real people, who do things unrelated to the plot while they're waiting for something, who occasionally sit down and talk about their lives, and who don't just feel like sterile vessels for the delivery of plot devices. Something as simple as the wine exchange is all it takes to turn a basic scene of exposition into something more flavorful and 'complete'.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I'm going for with this; I'm not simply saying \"X is better than Y\". Asking any film to live up to *Seven* would be impossible, I'm saying \"X feels lacking in a way that Y does not, here's one example of how Y does this correctly\".\n\nThe point of this was not to shit on *Longlegs* but to demonstrate how much a few very minor changes can turn what would be a boring exposition scene into something that gives us an entertaining insight into the differences between the two, which gives the experience a lot more meaning beyond just \"atmosphere\".\n\nalso muting this now because i wasn't expecting seven hundred notifications i thought this might get ten comments lmao",

        "content": "This is an amazing film and my second rewatch, what i don\u2019t understand is how anyone can come to the conclusion that the story is about Father Flynn\u2019s actions and that the ending was about his guilt?! The entire film is a beautiful culmination to the very final words delivered by Meryl Streep \u2018I have doubts\u2019. She is so clearly talking about her faith, from the very first scene introducing us to this journey, when Father Flynn\u2019s sermon talks about a crisis of faith  - to the final scene showing the sister clutching her cross as she delivers those words. Meryl Streep again and again talks of her CERTAINTY about Flynns guilt, that certainty is vital to her entire character and motivations. She even says \u2018but i have my certainty\u2019 and then later on \u2018his resignation was his confession\u2019 - you can argue the film doesn\u2019t make it super clear wether Father Flynn is guilty, its no accident the words \u2018but did you prove it\u2019 are repeated, no solid proof just as there is no solid proof of God etc. but her final line is clearly about her doubts over the church, her faith - not Father Flynn. Amy Adams re-enforces this as her character is the easy way out, as pointed out by Meryl Streep \u2018you just want to have simplicity back\u2019 and \u2018he convinced you did he?\u2019 at the final scene on the bench. Father Flynn was used as a tool to tell the story of a devout nun and her battle with faith and DOUBT. ",

        "content": "These two films are not necessarily great films, Supergirl is more of a campy bad movie, but Helen Slater is the best thing about these two movies. I don't think we'll ever get another Supergirl as Helen Slater. Slater didn't just look like Supergirl, she was strong and likable. You rooted for her, evenm if she had some woeful lines. \n\nAnd in \"The Legend of Billie Jean\", the teen feminist film about a teen girl who becomes an inspiration for the youth after she and her brother accidentally shoot the sleazy dad of a bully who tried to rape her and they run from the cops. When Slater cuts her hair in honor of Joan of Arc, you can see why she'd have people follow her. \n\nI still think she should have had better offers. She was pretty popular for a few years, with movies like Ruthless People, City Slickers and The Secret of My Success making bank, but I don't think she ever got that big breakout part in a hit movie. She'll always be remembered as either Billie Jean or Kara/Linda Lee.",

        "title": "The Reggie payoff in Bad Boys: Ride or Die is quite possibly the best use of a side character in a lega-sequel I've ever seen. Are there any other examples of this?",
        "content": "For context, Reggie was in one scene in Bad Boys II from 2002. He's a 15-year-old taking Martin Lawrence's daughter on a date. Literally one scene where Smith and Lawrence lay into him. He has no bearing on the plot, no arc, nothing. He's just a joke. They could've cut the scene and it wouldn't have taken much from the movie beyond a bit of length (it's 2.5 hours.) Bringing him back in Bad Boys For Life to marry Lawrence's daughter was a fun nod back to II given that 18 years had passed. It's a simple, easy callback, and I was happy they got that actor to come back for one scene. \n\nThen in Ride or Die, he gets a full on action scene that is one of the most fun, well-choreographed John Wick-esque sequences in the movie. But that's it. He doesn't join them in the final showdown, he's not brought into any other action. It's literally just an action showcase, and an epic payoff for anyone who's watched the franchise over the years. To add to that, I can only assume that it wouldn't have the same impact for anyone who doesn't have the nostalgia of watching that scene in Bad Boys II 22 years ago. ",

I've never been so moved by an on screen relationship like this, idk if anyone else felt like this but I can't place my finger on what it is either. I read somewhere Lean mentioned the relationship was romantic but more generally it was just the simple infatuation about their dynamic. I don't know what it is about them but the feeling after their final scene I can't put it out of my mind. \n",

It ended striking me deeply as a depressed teenager that was dealing with some of the things presented in the movie.  \n\nThe 2nd drop of Sleep Song by Rooney was pretty intense.  \n\nDid anyone else see this movie?
