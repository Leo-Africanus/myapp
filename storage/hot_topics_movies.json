        "title": "Introducing the Fantasy Box Office Game: Two years ago I met a redditor who was running a Fantasy Box Office League game from an Excel spreadsheet and now it\u2019s a fully functional website. Get ready for the 2026 Box Office year with us!",
        "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

        "title": "Good Fortune (2025) Achieves the Opposite of What It Tries to Do, and Makes Me Feel Even Worse",
        "content": "Good Fortune (2025) made me hate my life even more and is officially my last straw with Hollywood\u2019s anti-capitalist cash grab trend.\n\nThere\u2019s been a growing wave of \u201crich billionaire (usually white) bad\u201d movies in the past few years. Off the top of my head: Death of a Unicorn, Alien: Earth, and now Good Fortune.  \nAnd look, I'm a middle to low class guy from a third-world Asian country (not the three cool ones people like to romanticize), living on about $300 a month. You don\u2019t need to explain to me that billionaires are bad. I live that reality.\n\nI watched Good Fortune by Aziz Ansari, and honestly it\u2019s a good movie. Seth Rogen, Keanu Reeves, and Aziz are all great. The writing is funny, smart, a bit pretentious but never condescending. It captures our current socio-economic mess pretty well:\n\n* more people becoming homeless\n* inflation rising way faster than salaries\n* people needing multiple jobs just to survive\n* job hunting becoming a nightmare even before AI\n* governments taking a chunk of your money while giving barely anything back\n\nBut then the movie drops a line that completely slapped me out of the story:  \n**\u201cYou\u2019re in a house with a huge pool telling me not to give up, to fight.\u201d**  \nAnd suddenly I'm thinking, who is this movie even for? In the end, Good Fortune basically tells us that yes, money will solve all our problems, but still, don\u2019t give up. Keep living your mediocre, struggling life and maybe, just maybe, a billionaire will grow a conscience.\n\nThe people being criticized will never watch it. They won\u2019t suddenly care about workers, or stop replacing people with AI, or stop squeezing profit out of everyone. At best, this is the court jester entertaining the poor so they don\u2019t revolt against the ruling class.\n\nWhat really sickens me is how online reviews always praise these movies just because rich white villains get k\\*lled, even though the companies making these films are run by the same rich white people.  \nNetflix, Apple, Warner Bros, Paramount. None of these are altruistic. Whoever wins the next big acquisition war will just hike streaming prices again by a ridiculous amount. And we\u2019ll keep getting more \u201canti capitalist\u201d movies to shit on them while the system stays exactly the same.\n\nI genuinely agree with the message. Maybe it is good if more people start thinking about this and awaken some kind of class consciousness. I think the first few films in this trend were genuine, maybe even risky. But now it feels like a brand. A trend. A formula. Just another way they profit off people\u2019s frustration with the same system Hollywood is built on.\n\nWe really need to think harder about the next hundred movies like this. Is it really still a net good that more of this kind of movie being made and well supported by the audience?",

        "content": "In its first released footage, Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d promises to be the director\u2019s most expansive vision yet.\n\nA six-minute clip from the film is playing before this weekend\u2019s Imax 70-millimeter screenings of \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d The clip depicts the story of the Trojan horse \u2014 ironically, not a major plot element in Homer\u2019s Odyssey, though part of the mythology around Odysseus in general. For those unfamiliar, the story is one of warrior Odysseus\u2019 canniest strategems: He ordered built an enormous, hollow horse that could be occupied by soldiers. If the Trojans accepted it as a seeming peace offering, the men within could breach the impenetrable walls of Troy and wage war from the inside.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2025/film/news/the-odyssey-prologue-matt-damon-trojan-horse-christopher-nolan-1236607580/",
