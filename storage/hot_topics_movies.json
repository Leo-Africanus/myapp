        "title": "I've probably watch Dead Poets Society over a 100 times during my adolescence, but I only realized some crazy details today",
        "content": "I just realized something kind of wild. I've probably seen Dead Poets Society a hundred times, but only now do I feel like I'm really understanding certain scenes. Maybe I was too young the first times I watched it, but on rewatch, things hit differently.\n\nFor example, the scene where Keating pushes Todd to improvise a poem in front of the class. For years I just thought it was an inspirational teacher moment, but I didn't get the deeper meaning. Keating tells Todd to look at the picture of W.W, a grim old man staring back, and says, \"Close your eyes. Describe what you see.\" Todd ends up saying: \"...a sweaty-toothed madman... his hands reach out and choke me...\" Back then I didn't realize this was Todd describing himself. His fear of expression, his anxiety, his self-loathing, all of that comes through in the words. Keating didn't just make him speak; he made him reveal himself.\n\nThat blanket image itself takes on a deeper symbolism the more I think about it. Todd says: \"You push at it, stretch it, it will never be enough. You kick at it, beat at it, it will never cover any of us. .\" At first it sounds abstract, but it\u2019s really about truth and acceptance. Keating uses this moment to push Todd to face who he really is. The blanket being too small for everyone becomes a metaphor that truth and self-expression can\u2019t be confined or limited, it\u2019s bigger than any of us. And then the haunting line: \"\u00a0From the moment we enter crying to the moment you leave dying.\", hich suddenly makes me think of birth and death, the painful but inescapable bookends of existence.\n\nThen there\u2019s Neil\u2019s suicide. When I was younger, I understood it was tragic, but I never really thought about the fact that Neil was only seventeen. That\u2019s still a child, and the pressure from his father, the crushing weight of not being able to live his own life, feels even heavier when you remember how young he is. It wasn\u2019t just about the play or his father forbidding him to act it was the loss of hope that he could ever be himself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Todd and Neil relationship. For the longest time I thought the idea of people shipping them was just fans being over the top. But looking back, there\u2019s real tension between them. I don\u2019t necessarily think either of them would have consciously recognized it, especially in 1959, but the intimacy is there. Todd\u2019s shyness breaking down under Neil\u2019s encouragement, Neil\u2019s obvious care for Todd, the way their interactions carry more weight than typical school friendships  there\u2019s something more, even if it\u2019s unspoken.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because the movie hasn\u2019t changed, but I have. Now I see layers that were invisible to me before. Dead Poets Society really is one of those films that grows with you.",

The trailers I've seen definitely spoil it, but curious if the marketing made it impossible not to know or if people still went in blind.  I think James Cameron did such an amazing job in the first 20 minutes of the movie leaving it ambiguous and hope it had that type of impact on some people.",

        "content": "I miss Adam Sandler movies. \n\nWhen he got his deal with Netflix to making movies on their platform, I was thrilled at the thought. Unfortunately I would safely say the majority of his movies on Netflix just doesn't carry the weight of his previous theater films. \n\nSo many of us have memories and can quote his earlier works and when we talk about Adam Sandler movies, it is never the Netflix films, it is almost as if they do not exist. \n\nSo when The Wrong Missy came out in 2020, I didnt pay it any attention, it was thrown in with the mix of Netflix films that were garbage. \n\nOne day I recently saw a social media post of The Wrong Missy, and this scene (the airplane flight) had enough raunchy humor, and the co-star Lauren Lupkus had a humor and cute character that drew me in immediately. Plus I love David Spade! \n\nThe scene was good enough that I wanted to give this movie a chance, and I was not let down! David Spade, Lauren Lupkus, Nick Swardson, even a small bit from Bobby Lee! So so good!\n\nDavid Spade and Nick Swardson tend to play the same characters in all their movies, and it was very welcome humor here. I really needed and enjoyed this film, anyone that has not yet seen the movie and enjoys classic Adam Sandler production, should give this movie a chance.",

I also loved the movie\u2019s style and I especially loved how all of the advertisements looked when Nada looks through the glasses. What do you think of They Live?",
