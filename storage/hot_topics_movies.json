IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).\n\nTrailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.\n\nAfter having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.\n\nSadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. \n\nOne way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.\n\nBy no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. \n\nBut overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, this might sound harsh but whoever done the marketing and trailer deserves to be fired. Whoever you were, you ended up dooming this amazing movie to fail.\n\nP.S.: I didn't think Brian Tyrian Lee of all people could have pulled off a great Megatron.",

        "content": "A recent strange phenomenon is how Hollywood goes out of its way to hide the fact that musicals are musicals in the marketing. The trailers won't show any of the characters singing and will make it look like it's a normal movie. The reason for this seems to be that marketing teams know that some people don't like musicals, so they think they can get them to buy a ticket by tricking them into thinking a musical is not a musical and I guess hope that they won't bother doing any research beforehand. Wonka and Mean Girls are some recent examples of this.\n\nBut Hollywood does this kind of deceitful marketing all the time. Most infamously, the movie [Kangaroo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyLeUjuT_k)'s marketing made it look like a fun family movie with a talking kangaroo that raps, but in reality it's a comedic crime movie for adults and the kangaroo barely appears and only talks in one scene where a character is hallucinating. In fact, the movie was originally R-Rated and was going to be called Down and Under, but then was retitled and edited to a PG rating by producers because the kangaroo scene was the only think test audiences liked.\n\nSo what other movie marketing campaigns tried to basically trick audiences into thinking that the movie was going to be about something else or even of a different genre?",

That's without talking about his hit-making run in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, or his TV show resume, which is arguably even more impressive (he's literally about to come out with a show that has near-universal critical acclaim pre-release)\n\nUnlike other leading men who have a lot of well regarded stuff in their filmography, Rogen isn't really playing a numbers game. The man hasn't really been in a whole lot, it's just that a large portion of what he does do, is some version of good\n\n",

How much time needs to pass for you?\n\nWhile we are here, let\u2019s pretend you all are celeb\u2019s being asked this on the red carpet and tell me what are your current four favs ? ",

About 1/3 into Act III, a beloved character very suddenly dies. \n\nI hated either character passing, but narratively I think it is brilliant as all your characters, literally set for 'a last stand', you are no longer sure who or if any will survive....\n\nSo, my Q is movies that set up everyone or most could die in the finale? \n\n",

        "content": "This has been one of my favorite films since I was 18 years old, it hit me at just the right age I think. I love this movie. I don't find it slow at all. I love the pace of the opening and the wedding sequence. It feels like a documentary. It gives us time to get comfortable with the characters as real human beings, not just movie characters. The acting is so naturalistic. Every scene in Clariton feels very much like an Altman ensemble film with its wandering camera, overlapping dialogue and the very naturally realistic acting style. The characters aren't given big monolgues to express themselves, they do it all in a look. Character interaction and quick expressive moments build the characters and their stories without pandering to the audience. It's an exceptionally subtle piece of filmmaking. The fact that Michael and Nick are in love with the same woman is pretty clearly set up in the wedding sequence. Nick is very often framed with a stuffed deers head on the wall, foreshadowing his death by \"one shot\" later in the \n\n\nThe film deals with so many themes that are crystallized in the famous POW sequence. The gambling over death defying acts of masculinity is set up earlier in the film with Michael and Nick gambling over the car race. Their focus on guns and the 'one shot' philosophy is set up during the deer hunting sequence. The idea of never leaving a friend behind is set up when they jokingly leave John the bartender on the side of the road when driving to hunt the deer. Michael's use of a flamethrower is set up in the opening scene when he's making steel in the hellish factory. The death of SPOILERS Nicky is foreshadowed by his repeated framing with a stuffed deers head and a photo of JFK.\n\nThere is quite a bit more subtle foreshadowing and callbacks throughout the film but I'll stop here. It's a very subtle, emotional, beautifully atmospheric small town epic. It feels like a novel that gets better on repeat viewings. ",

My observation on the first movie stands by itself in a vacuum. End edit\n\n\nI'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, he's done some good films, shadowed by his involvement with Scientology, but whatever. He's a decent actor.\n\nI was channel surfing and came across this first Jack Reacher movie. So, first of all, I don't understand the criticism that he wasn't this huge muscle-bound macho guy. He played the role well and was a good fit for it, I thought.\n\nMost of all, holy Hell! This was a great movie. A solid thriller with a well-thought mystery behind the premise. There was enough action to keep it moving along, without going over the top, and only one car chase scene, which had a funny conclusion. That's Pittsburgh for you!\n\nI'd watch it again and if you haven't, it's worthwhile.",
