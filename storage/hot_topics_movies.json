        "content": "There's some comedies from my childhood and teens that I watch now that I still have nostalgia for, but I look at them and I go yeah this is dated or this isn't as funny as I remember. I had that feeling a few years ago with American Pie where I watched it again and it really started to feel dated which is alarming for me because it seems like yesterday I was watching that movie as a kid on HBO behind my parents back. Superbad to me from start to finish is as perfect of a comedy as you're going to get. A very funny, relatable script from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Really cool locations and sets by Greg mottle and all the characters are so perfectly cast and portrayed. Not one missed joke in the entire movie and it's genuinely a movie that even at 32 I still laugh at damn near every frame now as I did at 14 when I saw it in theaters. ",

It was a great ending in my opinion, and if they wanted to make more they should've done prequels instead of sequels to be able to keep the ending, how do yall feel.about this?

I loved the dichotomy between the Sheriff and Foster, where they both reach a breaking point with bullshit and go past the point of no return.\n\nAlmost all of the points are still relevant today.  The overpriced goods, the screwed up politics and bureaucracies, liars prospering, Nazis, people getting rich off useless and empty services, wasting land and wealth on the few while the majority are suffering.  \n\nWhat a great goddamn movie.",

In particular, there's the scene in \"Eclipse\" where Nikki Reed's Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her fianc\u00e9e and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her fianc\u00e9e for last. Frankly, a vampire mix of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" and \"Kill Bill\" sounds a lot more interesting to watch than anything around Bella, Edward or Jacob.\n\nYour example?",

        "content": "First off, what an incredibly beautiful and stylish film. The cinematography, heavy saturation and overuse (in a good way) of split diopter shots really pull you into this one. \n\nThe script uses one of my favorite writing techniques, which is to show you glimpses of the wider story &gt;!like the opposing politicians who ordered the expose on McRyan, Burke's meetings with them (the very concept of a meeting with a pro-assassin is hilarious), Jack's backstory with the cops, how the death is impacting the presidential race, Manny &amp; Sally's schemes and so on!&lt;, but never letting you get distracted from the fact that *this* is the main storyline. It makes the world of the movie feel so real.\n\nAlso, and I said this in the past about Serpico (1973), I love how grimy and \"un-movie-like\" the setting is. Manny's apartment, the train station, the streets, everything is very much as-is. \n\nJohn Lithgow with a performance for the ages, probably my new favorite movie sociopath. He's far from the cartoony portrayals you normally see, with the silly \"dropping the smile when the victim isn't looking\", he is just always *on*. \n\nAs soon as the movie ended, all I could think of was that I will definitely watch it again.",

My entire family quotes it all the time, and I have yet to ever meet a single person outside of my parents and sister who have ever even heard of it. ",

It is incredible. The way the lighting switches from illuminating the Germans face to the face of Brody as he plays Chopin perfectly, and the face of the German realizing how he has been part of a force that has possibly taken away talent such as this. You see him realize the horror of the Nazi regime as the song plays. I just came here to say that I always loved that scene but the recent rewatch cements that as an all timer for me.",

I must\u2019ve missed something but I didn\u2019t get that part. Stan\u2019s character seemed incredibly happy to see her\u2026 I know it\u2019s subtle, but how does that woman contribute to the story? ",

All the other melee scenes are pretty brutal too despite the quality of the movie overall. \n\nAny recommendations for more movies with brutal combat like this?\n\nThanks!",

She had this spunk and comedic timing. I would have liked to have seen her develop outside of her usual quirky characters and if she tried dramas. But, it looks like she'd rather stick with fashion. Just hopefully her mental health is a priority to her because she still doesn't look so good right now. ",

But sometimes...there are announcements from the moment you read them, you're like, \"Yeah, ok...I'll believe it when I see it\". Has anybody else experienced this and if so, what are your favorite examples? Some of mine are...\n\n  \n\\*To be clear, I'm not taking about fake news. I'm talking about real announcements that either didn't make sense logically or just sounded like pipe dreams\\* \n\n*  Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War will open on the same day \n* Quentin Tarantino is making a Star Trek film\n* The next Friday the 13th film will be produced by LeBron James\n* A 21 Jump Street x Men in Black film is in the works \n\nAnd I'm just gonna call my shot with this one...I don't think that Luca Guadagino/Daniel Craig Sgt.
