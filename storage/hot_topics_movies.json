They must overcome past grievances and work together to survive, but ultimately, it's a battle of wills and wits to make it out alive.*\n\nCast: Rachel McAdams, Dylan O'Brien\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [93%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/send_help)\n\n**Metacritic:** [73/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/send-help/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[IndieWire - Alison Foreman](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/send-help-review-rachel-mcadams-sam-raimi-1235175473/) - 'A-'\n\n&gt;Wickedly lovable with the potential to be timeless, \u201cSend Help\u201d is controlled delirium microwaved on high heat. At 66, Raimi reminds us who he was when he made horror-comedy history with \u201cEvil Dead II,\u201d and more importantly, why his voice still matters. Watching McAdams snarl and strategize, you can practically imagine how much fun Raimi would\u2019ve had handing her a chainsaw in the \u201980s.\n\n[IGN - Tom Jorgensen](https://www.ign.com/articles/send-help-review-rachel-mcadams-dylan-obrien-sam-raimi) - 9 / 10\n\n&gt;Sam Raimi drives the survival thriller genre to some amazing and sadistically giddy ends, with Rachel McAdams and Dylan O\u2019Brien along for the ride in the back seat cackling and stabbing each other the whole way through. Linda and Bradley\u2019s ordeal creates immensely fertile ground for Raimi to interrogate the validity of first impressions with twists and turns of the plot and of various sharp objects that seldom tire. Sure, drag me to hell, but let's stop at this island on the way and have a freakin\u2019 party with Linda and Bradley!\n\n[HighonFilms - Liam Gaughan](https://www.highonfilms.com/send-help-2026-movie-review/) \\- 3.5/5\n\n&gt;To characterize \u201cSend Help\u201d as a standard \u201ceat the rich\u201d satire would be slightly dismissive, as the film is more centered on workplace culture than it is on class. The narrative kerfuffles in \u201cSend Help\u201d don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a highly watchable cinematic experience that is intended to be experienced with a crowd that can wince, jeer, laugh, and cover their eyes in equal measure. O\u2019Brien and McAdams are two actors who can find emotional truths in the characters, even if they\u2019re incorporating idiosyncratic traits that feel entirely original. \u201cSend Help\u201d won\u2019t go down as one of Raimi\u2019s defining achievements, but it makes the case that he\u2019s back within his comfort zone.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/send-help-review-1236637527/)\n\n&gt;Essentially stripping all that\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d from the psychological thriller genre, Raimi doesn\u2019t seem especially concerned with plausible human behavior, preferring to keep audiences guessing as the characters\u2019 motivations keep changing. Once the master of extreme practical effects (with then-accomplice Tom Sullivan), Raimi now relies far too heavily on digital tools \u2014 and that\u2019s one thing that has no business on a desert island, where everything from fire to fresh water must be cultivated by hand.\n\n[InSession Films - 8/10](https://insessionfilm.com/movie-review-send-help/)\n\n&gt;This is a return to form for horror-fare Raimi, including a stellar performance from Rachel McAdams\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/2085042/send-help-2026-movie-review/) - 7 / 10\n\n&gt;I had oodles of fun watching Raimi go wild and give McAdams a chance to play the type of unhinged weirdo she hasn't really played before. This is the type of sturdy, bloody, silly January genre programmer we need on the big screen again.\n\n[Micropsiacine](https://www.micropsiacine.com/2026/01/send-help-review-rachel-mcadams-and-dylan-obrien-in-a-brutal-survival-duel/) \\- Diego Lerer\n\n&gt;Pessimistic and biting, violent yet undeniably entertaining,\u00a0***Send Help***\u00a0functions as a kind of metaphorical capsule for the \u201cevery man for himself\u201d ethos of the contemporary world. For Raimi, it also represents a reboot of sorts\u2014a return to form. The catch, perhaps, is that what once played as cynical, absurdist black comedy in the \u201990s now feels uncomfortably close to reality.  \n",

        "content": "\n\u2e3b\n\nWilliam Friedkin\u2019s To Live and Die in L.A. is one of his best films. It features strong performances by William Petersen, Willem Dafoe, John Turturro, and Dean Stockwell. The film showcases Friedkin\u2019s trademark realism and follows U.S. Secret Service procedural detail, based on the novel of the same name by real-life secret serviceman Gerald Petievich. I love the pacing, the violence, and the passion of a man hell-bent on settling a score.\n\nFriedkin brought in real ex-con counterfeiters to replicate the process onscreen. Some of the printed fake money actually leaked outside the production, leading to a federal investigation that Friedkin and his crew narrowly avoided. The freeway car chase ranks alongside the best, including Peter Yates\u2019 Bullitt and Friedkin\u2019s own French Connection.\n\nI own the Shout Factory blu-ray, which features deleted scenes and an alternate ending. The film was released in late 1985, but younger generations owe it to themselves to see it. Friedkin has said that this film, along with Sorcerer(1978), is the closest he ever came to realizing his true vision for a movie.\n",

        "content": "Where do I even start, one of the, if not the most beautiful picture I've seen in terms of storytelling, editing, mesmerising cinematography, plot, etc. I can continue for days. The idea of having so many relevant characters in the film and everything still being connected and portrayed so perfectly was my favourite part of this film. Leandro Firmin (Lil Ze) had one of the best actings for a antagonist i've ever seen, by the end of the film i truly developed hatred for him in a way i wanted him gone by the end of the film, hes pure psychotic evil and a sadistic character and has only one motto in one life which is honestly pretty respectable, The contrast between Lil Ze and Rocket is honestly amazing, from both of them being young at the time of the Tender Trio to their lives completely contrasting one another. With Lil Ze having a completely different approach in his future, more towards gun violence and being dominant, to Rocket having a far different approach to violence and never getting into the cycle.\n\nThe young actors did amazing portraying the lives of those in favelas, they are born in a warzone with guns and gangsters all around them, and ultimately growing up with a gun in their hand. Death is almost meaningless towards them as they've witnessed it ever since they had conscious. The film executes it all so complacently, with no glamour and no meaning. This is the life they were born into, and there's no way to escape it. Either hunt or be hunted is what I would say is the pure motto of this film and how the favelas are depicted.\n\nBenny you deserved a farm of your own.",

        "content": "Just re-watched Terminator Salvation and I've got to say, I didn't get the hate that movie received when it came out. It's so awesome! It's the only one that sets it during the War, it doesn't rely on time travel nonsense in a lame attempt to soft reboot the franchise, the Easter eggs and links to the 1st &amp; 2nd are well placed, and the action is badass. And Young Arnie as a T-800 looked amazing (as far as de-aging goes)! Yes, the marketing spoiled the twist (if you want to even call it that). I would honestly put it as the best of the franchise, after 1 &amp; 2 of course. T3 and everything since salvation has been a joke. I would rank this franchise as follows:\n\n  \n1. T2\n\n2. Terminator\n\n3. Terminator Salvation \n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6. T3, Genisys, Dark Fate\n\n\n\nThoughts? Who's with me??",
