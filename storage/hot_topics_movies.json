        "content": "Just rewatched American History X after a few years. The thing that struck me the most, is how well it's aged. Everything about it is carefully and artfully crafted. The two most powerful bits, in my opinion, are the dinner table discussions. The first with the mother's boyfriend, and the second with her late husband. Showing how racism and hate is often twisted and packaged behind pseudo-economic and perceived inequality tinged hatred, and then, how it begins. Learned at home. And throughout the film, you see where that gets you: absolutely nowhere. And the ending is just heart wrenching, the cycle never ends. Highly encourage a rewatch. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the use of monochrome, it's all funneled into an ugly look of America's dark side. And it's more poignant in these times that it's ever been.",

        "content": "*Bad dreams haunt 15-year-old Gwen as she receives calls from the black phone and sees disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp.*\n\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\n\nCast: Ethan Hawke, Mason Thames, Miguel Mora\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100% (9 reviews)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_phone_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [73 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-phone-2/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Slashfilm - Rafael Motamayor](https://www.slashfilm.com/1974280/black-phone-2-review/) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;The most impressive feat Black Phone 2 pulls off is finding a way to bring The Grabber back that feels coherent and actually adds to the character. We get some backstory on the child-abductor that comes across as deepening the character rather than just answering questions that no one asked.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-phone-2-movie-review-2025) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a tick too long and has a section that\u2019s far too expository for a film that\u2019s at its best when it leans into surreal nightmare logic, but this weird movie works its fear factor in unexpected, creative ways.\n\n[IndieWire - Katie Rife](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-black-phone-2-horror-movie-review-1235152348/)\n\n&gt;a complaint that\u2019s also common to contemporary horror films nags at \u201cBlack Phone 2,\u201d in that all of the best things about this movie come from other movies, whether they be the creative team\u2019s previous efforts or iconic titles from decades past. These elements are enjoyable, which is precisely why they\u2019re recycled here. And maybe that\u2019s good enough for a horror sequel. But good enough will never be more than just that.\u00a0",

        "content": "My absolute favorites have probably got to be The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Se7en, and Spider-Man 2(2004). The best part about them is they are not merely a way to credit the cast and crew, but they actually propel the story in different ways.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly has a title sequence that is more or less a teaser for what\u2019s the come in the film. The illustrations are great, the use of the airbrush to reveal the principal actors is extremely creative, and the theme song needs no introduction. One of the most iconic of all time and some of Ennio Morricone\u2019s best work.\n\nSe7en might be the most visually creative opening sequence of all time. The combination of the dark, disturbing imagery, the visceral editing, and the use of the song Closer by NIN is absolute perfection. They could not have set the tone any better. \n\nSpider-Man 2 thrives in simplicity. A quick recap of the first film with the theme song playing over it, while introducing the musical motif of the film\u2019s villain. Again, this credit sequence has great illustrations. They are incredible to look at and it very effectively recaps the first film in a short amount of time. Another key element is the great musical score by Danny Elfman. \n\nWhich title/credits sequence would you say is your favorite or the best?\n\nEdit: After some thought I\u2019d also like to add Casino Royale and The Devil\u2019s Rejects on here. Great opening credits and music from both films. ",
