Im speechless really. \n\nAlso, the way it was made is absolutely stunning. Stop motion is awesome, sad that its not used a lot nowadays. \n\nIm not going to spoil much here, and Im going to say to go watch it yourself. Amazing movie. \n\nIts about a Fox and his family getting into a conflict with three \"corporate\" food giants, that eventually evolves into a full blown war between the two, and even drags other animals into the conflict. \n\nThere are also some elements of philosophy too, so yeah. \n\nAll in all its a solid 8.5/10. The only bad thing was that its short, but then again its based on the book, so yeah. Go read that too if you would like.",

Trailer makes her role seem larger than it actually is. \n\nThe daughter from Hereditary. They even added deleted scenes from the movie and put it in the trailer to make it seem she had a much bigger part than she had. \n\nSteven Seagal in Executive Decision, though rumor has it, his character was only killed off because the director and writers couldn't stand him any more and they decided to rewrite his character's role and have him die in the first 30 minutes.",

I think a lot of movie fans don\u2019t understand that musical fans hate a bad film adaptation of a musical even more than they do. I am personally offended by Russel Crowe as Javert in Les Miserables. \n\nAnyway, I think we should take a second to appreciate how good movie musicals can be. What is everyone\u2019s favorite movie musical and why? Also, if anyone has more thoughts on why musicals get hate from movie lovers I would love to hear it. (Other than the classic excuses about realism vs. corniness that don\u2019t apply to the good stuff)\n\nMy favorite is Cabaret (1972). I highly recommend movie musical skeptics give it a shot. It is serious and political with eight Academy Awards (it was up against the godfather too!). It is especially relevant to the climate in America right now and the musical numbers are diegetic if you are picky about people breaking into song.",

Are there any others that rival these three or other honorable mentions? ",

But look at Kevin Bacon and Sarah Jessica Parker, they became a big movie stars having their films and their own sitcom like Sarah had Sex in the City show. \n\nWell what do anyone think about this and for those of you who love Footloose film and the 1980s era.",
