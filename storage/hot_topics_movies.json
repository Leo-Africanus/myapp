Anyone care to share their thoughts on this movie I'm happy to discuss your opinion.

        "title": "Friendship pissed off my whole family",
        "content": "Back when the movie released in theaters, I watched it in a crowded AMC with a friend and absolutely loved it. I was not familiar with Robinson\u2019s work, but I loved the absurdity and awkwardness. I think my initial reaction was also influenced by the energy of the theater, which was full of cackles and laughs throughout most of the movie. \nI got home and thought \u201cman, my husband would have loved that.\u201d\n\n\nSo 2 months ago I made him watch it with me, thinking he\u2019s for sure going to be laughing the entire time just as me and the whole theater were - and he absolutely hates it. Halfway through he\u2019s like, \u201cdoes it get better?\u201d And I was like \u201cI mean\u2026 No\u2026 but it\u2019s good!\u201d\nBut by that point I was also feeling completely different about this movie too. The experience of watching it in my apartment next to my extremely unsettled husband was of course a big vibe shift, but I admittedly was also more uncomfortable this time around. But I\u2019m thinking \u2018no it\u2019s good I remember laughing so much we HAVE to stick it out.\u2019\nAnyways, it ends, and my husband is just sick of it. Like it emotionally drained him, and ruined his mood. And I felt terrible, and weirdly similar. \n\n\nWhat I had forgotten was that I had messaged my family after my experience watching it in theaters, of course giving it a glowing review lmao\n\nWell now it\u2019s on HBO Max, so my mom tells me she sat my brother and dad down and watched it - and they all had the same reaction as my husband. Just HATED it.\n\n \nMy mom is messaging me through the whole thing going \u201cyour brother couldn\u2019t stand 15 months and went to bed\u201d, \u201cyour dad is taking a break - does it get any better?\u201d, \u201che just licked the toad\u201d, \u201cthis is an extremely weird movie why did you tell us to watch this\u201d, \u201cyour dad is genuinely mad\u201d,\nand finally, my favorite message\n\n\n \u201cThat movie put everyone in a mood \nWe are all moody  now \nI\u2019m going to bed \u201c\n\n\nThe last time a movie got a reaction like this from my family the movie was Hereditary. \nAlthough I feel bad for pissing everyone off, I do find it pretty incredible that a comedy movie could make so many people feel so deeply uncomfortable that it psychologically impacts them to such a degree, and I just needed to share this with someone. What did you think of this movie lol?\n ",
