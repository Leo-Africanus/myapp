        "content": "Around Christmas time my mother was visiting my family and just casually we started talking upcoming movies. She then proceeded to get excited about the \"new\" twilight movie with all the original cast. She showed this trailer to my wife and myself and it was blatantly fake so we informed her. \nWith that context in mind of both my wife and me being able to spot it, my wife today sent me a trailer for \"The Conjuring: Last Rites\" and she was convinced it was real. There are tell tell signs like clips from previous movies, completely unrelated movies such as \"The Woman in the Yard\" and most egregiously, shots of the cast, alone, just kinda motionless or the camera panning slowly. \n\nMy main issue is the people posting these having no indication it's fake, or a concept trailer or anything, just very misleading. \n\nI don't necessarily have a problem with their existence, creative liberty and all that, and with AI it give people a chance to easily put ideas out there, however, is preface that fake trailers, regardless of intention, should give the watcher the knowledge, easily accessible, to know it is indeed not real.\n\nAm I alone on this?",

The continuation of a beloved franchise?\n\nWhat movie has you marking your calendar and saving your opening night ticket money? And what specifically about it has captured your imagination?

        "content": "*One year after her sister disappeared, Clover and her friends head to the remote valley where she vanished to search for answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they soon encounter a masked killer who murders them one by one. However, when they mysteriously wake up at the beginning of the same night, they're forced to relive the terror over and over again.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [47%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/until_dawn_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [53/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \\- D+\n\n&gt;Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.\n\n[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)\n\n&gt;Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \\[Using\\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \\- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop &amp; raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling &amp; dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\\*\\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\\*\\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \\- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. \"Until Dawn\" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, \"Until Dawn\" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.\n\n[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \\- [Manuel S\u00e3o Bento](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/manuel-sao-bento) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.\n\n[IGN Movies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/811) \\- [Chase Hutchinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson) \\- 5/10\n\n&gt;Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing \u2013\u00a0to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension \u2013\u00a0particularly in the way he shoots darkness \u2013 the lackluster script he\u2019s working with isn\u2019t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn\u2019t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema\u2019s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;Given that the game was co-penned by indie-horror icon Larry Fessenden (*Wendigo*), it\u2019s somewhat baffling that *Until Dawn* ditches his story in favor of something this run-of-the-mill and half-baked. Despite an under-30 cast that\u2019s perfectly capable of running and screaming when necessary (which is often), there\u2019s no personality to this pandemonium, its evil beasts generic and its relive-the-night structure under-exploited.",

Afterwards we were talking about it, I don't think I really liked it at the time, my complaint was the tone they gave Ultron not being menacing, but a guy we were with said he hated it. I asked why, and he said \"Because every car in it was an Audi\". He was completely serious, that was his only take away, which I have to admit, was something I did not notice, and would have been fairly ambivalent to if I had.",

But sharks and monkey fights it's like my 6 year old wrote this. I know this isn't the place for this sort of rant but I need to vent. ",
