        "content": "When I think of movies from the 1970's, the first thing that pops into my head is that brown, film grained, dirty look that everything had, especially films like Rocky, The Jerk, and Taxi Driver. That sleazy, 1970's look of adult theatres, liquor stores, litter, exhaust fumes, and LOTS of brown/wood everything. Ironically enough, the movie that I think encapsulates that specific style the best is a film that almost wasn't even released during the 1970's at all.\n\nBlues Brothers is a pretty obvious parody/homage of a lot of the tropes that went on with a lot of 1970's action films, specifically the over-the top car chases, and it got me wondering if that also carried over into the visual style of the movie as well? There's so many shots in this movie that nail the look that if someone asked me \"what do movies from the 1970's look like?\" I could just show them stills from Blues Brothers and they'd understand what I meant immediately, like when Elwood is parking the Bluesmobile at Jake's in that dirty alley with that red light. Such a cool shot. But it got me wondering if it was done on purpose to pay homage to the style (and take it over the top) like how someone like Tarantino would do years later, or if it was just a product of its' time?",

It was the Sci-Fi/Horror aspects/special FXs of the film. \n\nBut as an adult, I loved it even more when I grasped what a tragedy it was. Seth Brundle, a good man by all accounts, finalized his life's work. An invention that will change the world. He also meets the love of his life at the same time. \n\nHe seemed to be peaking in all facets of life, but he ruined everything by carelessly putting himself through the telepods and turning himself into a monster. \n\nA good person, reaching the apex of life only for everything to end so tragically (for everyone involved).\n\nI cry almost everytime I really think about what happened to Seth in that movie.

        "content": "I just re-watched small soldiers for the first time in probably 25 years and the first thing I wanna say is how great it still looks. Occasionally, the CGI is a bit wonky, but they use so much practical effects that it really sells . \n\nIf they did do a reboot or a legacy sequel, my guess is the first way they would screw it up is by abandoning the practical effects.\n\nthe premise was also avery ahead of its time and our current AI and machine learning world actually works really well with it. \n\nI know the idea of rebooting old media never letting anything die is a very real criticism, and a lot of us are getting kind of exhausted by it\u2026 but I feel with this movie it kind of works because it\u2019s not a beloved classic that holds a lot of importance\u2026 it\u2019s a barely considered cult, classic that got mediocre reviews, and is mostly forgotten by the general public. I think these types of movies are the best ones to revisit since it\u2019s not really going to tarnish any kind of legacy.\n\n \n\nRegardless of all of this, if you hadn\u2019t seen this movie in a while, I suggest giving it a rewatch. I think it holds up really well.\n\nDid anyone else really enjoy this as a kid for those of you who are adults in 1998? What were your opinions on it?  It definitely feels a bit torn like it wants to be for teens and kids and doesn\u2019t quite know where to land.",

I've been wanting to watch The Thing but I don't know what would go well with it. I'm hoping for something from the late 70s or early 80s and in the horror or action genre. My parents suggested the first Terminator movie but idk if that pairs well.\n\nThoughts?",

One sentence quietly tells you the rabbit hole goes all the way down. This goes well beyond Dr. Charles Nichols and a few rogue actors. Makes me wonder: was the movie actually less about a wrongly accused man\u2026 and more about how impossible it is to beat a corporation once it decides on a narrative?",

Besides the franchise what is the best dinosaur movie?",
