        "title": "Rewatching The Prestige and caught a few things I have never noticed before",
        "content": "Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, \"But where's his brother?\", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.\n\n- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.\n\n- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. \"Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic.\" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of \"There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!\" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.\n\n- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (\"I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box\"). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the \"real\" prestige.\n\nGreat fucking movie. Any other things you have picked up on after the 12th time through or so?",

        "title": " Park Chan-wook's Decision to Leave and how it embraces modern tech ",
        "content": "This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.\n\nDecision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and \"smart\" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.\n\nThis is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.\n\n1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices\n\n* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.\n* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.\n* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners\n* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app\n* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)\n* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to \"point\") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.\n* The \"captain's log\" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app\n* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up\n* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.\n\n1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.\n\n* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.\n* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband\n* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband\n\n1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices\n\n* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.\n* I like the \"switch\" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks\n* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear\n* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.\n\nEDIT: word choice",

        "content": "This is highly impressive debut by Francis Galluppi, who's set to direct the next Evil Dead movie. It's a single-locatio thriller that takes place in a diner in the middle of a desert highway. Two of the guests are bank robbers who are on the run but their car has run out of gas, and one of them is played by a truly menacing Richard Brake. It's similar to movies like Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Hate, and The Standoff at Sparrow Creek in that it's only a matter of time until the tension erupts into violence, but Galluppi does a great job at squeezing tension out of the littlest moments until the poop hits the fan.\n\nAfter seeing this, I'm interested to see what Galluppi brings to the Evil Dead franchise, as he knows how to build simmering tension, unleash violence, and sprinkle it with some dark humor.

It's especially bad when there is a daughter/single dad dynamic. They always write the daughter like she is the only thing holding the dad together and is always much smarter and emotionally stable. They almost never write kids like an actual kid. \n\nWhat's your eye roll trope these days? ",
