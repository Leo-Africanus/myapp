        "title": "'The Electric State' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_electric_state): 0% (from 8 reviews) \n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-electric-state/): \n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take full ownership of their boys-with-toys mojo in this slick but dismally soulless odyssey across the American Southwest in a retro-futuristic alternate version of the 1990s. Following Cherry and The Gray Man, the brothers continue their post-Avengers streak of grinding out content for streaming platforms, amassing big budgets and marquee-name stars for quick-consumption movies destined to leave zero cultural footprint.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-russo-brothers-netflix-1236157136/)\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is emotionally incoherent because the moral of its story is contradicted by the emphasis of its telling. It\u2019s no wonder the filmmakers appear to side with their villain. As Skate puts it: \u201cOur world is a tire fire floating in an ocean of piss.\u201d Despite all of the clout and capital at their disposal, the Russo brothers can think of nothing better to do than stick our faces in it.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-electric-state-netflix-movie-review-1235101527/): D\u2013\n\n&gt; There\u2019s no rule that says book-based films shouldn\u2019t diverge from what\u2019s on the page. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d and Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cStarship Troopers\u201d certainly did, and those stories found their audiences in both mediums. In this case, however, the filmmakers have diluted the source material, showing a clear lack of interest in making their creation just as haunting, searing and satisfying as the original product.\n\n-[Courtney Howard, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-electric-state-review-1236330760/)\n\n&gt; I\u2019m not surprised that Netflix and the Russos want to tell a story about how humans and machines can live together in peace, but I struggled to find much humanity in a picture so gleefully soulless.\n\n-[Matt Goldberg, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/)\n\n&gt; There is a gallery of wacky individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing some undemanding work for voice-artists including Brian Cox, Woody Harrelson, Alan Tudyk and Colman Domingo. But there\u2019s no soul, no originality, just a great big multicolour wedge of digital content.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-simon-stalenhag): 2/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State is somehow both punishingly obvious and completely incoherent. Ultimately, however, the only real point is that pop culture should be revered as humanity\u2019s prime sustenance. Cosmo is based on a children\u2019s cartoon that\u2019s presented as the only real emotional bond between Michelle and her brother; the surrounding landscape is nothing but malls and fairgrounds, temples to consumerism where characters practically salivate while listing off menus items from Panda Express; and there\u2019s a searingly earnest piano cover of \u201cWonderwall\u201d at the end. The Electric State isn\u2019t about dystopia. It\u2019s the dystopia itself.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-electric-state-review-netflix-b2710157.html): 1/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nIn a retro-futuristic past, orphaned teenager Michelle traverses the American West with an eccentric drifter and a sweet but mysterious robot in search of her younger brother.\n\n**DIRECTORS** \n\nAnthony &amp; Joe Russo\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nChristopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely (based on the novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nStephen F.

DeNiro and a young DiCaprio on the same film antagonizing each other in phenomenal performances in a incredible story. \n\nThe movie is the real story of writer Tobias Wolff during his teenage years when his mother was married to his abusive stepfather. Based on the synopsis I thought that would be a great moment of revelation when we find Dwight (played by DeNiro) is abusive but it starts simple, we see a positive side of the character consistently while we still realize how awful he is. It's also the most realistic portrayal I've seem of bullying from an authority figure. When I finished the movie, I knew there would still be some people who think Dwight was a good guy who was just parenting simply because the movie doesn't exaggerate his abuse.\n\nI'm amazed by the fact I never heard of this film considering the big names attached to it.",

I\u2019m actually in pre production. I don\u2019t have any money because I invested all the money, that I borrowed, to make Megalopolis. It\u2019s basically gone. I think it\u2019ll come back over 15 or 20 years, but I don\u2019t have it now. So I don\u2019t have any money. I have to do this film very cheap which is what I\u2019m doing.\"\n\nInteresting.",

Following Rona as she reconnects with her past, her parents and the atmospheric isolation of the islands on which she grew up, this is a raw but lyrical and uplifting story of recovery and redemption.

Which has held up better?\n\nEdit: Fun fact - Tommy Boy was originally called Billy the Third but was changed when they found out Sandler had a movie coming out named Billy Madison. ",

And while it is cool to see the year by year winners, it is also pretty easy to get burned out. As I\u2019m not only watching them but reviewing and rating every single one as well. Plus the B&amp;W and outdated filmmaking over and over isn\u2019t necessarily ideal for a marathon, not for me at least. So throwing a \u201cfun\u201d movie in there between every few films helps with the burn out. \n\nThe only one I\u2019ve watched so far has been Game Night (2018) and that one fits what I\u2019m looking for perfectly. A fun, interesting, but not too serious movie. What other ones are there?",
