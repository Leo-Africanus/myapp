        "content": "Hi Reddit.  I\u2019m Rob Sarkies, New Zealand director of Pike River (starring the wonderful Mel Lynskey).  Pike River is a drama that depicts a mining tragedy that affected an entire community and their fight for justice and accountability.  It was made in close collaboration with the real subjects so questions around process of working with real people to tell their stories in a dramatic form might be of particular interest to some.  But it's an AMA so happy to answer any questions at all, of course, including random questions about New Zealand! Can\u2019t wait to connect with you all on Monday - Rob Sarkies\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4)\n\n  \n**Synopsis:**\n\n&gt;On Nov. 19, 2010, a coal mine explosion in New Zealand kills Anna Osborne's husband and Sonya Rockhouse's son, along with 27 other men. The two women soon embark on a quest for truth and justice, leading to change they never thought possible.\n\nThe movie is out on digital now.\n\nAsk me anything.

        "content": "It\u2019s a pretty common trope for an adult man to travel with an unrelated young girl, often for the purpose of her protection on a dangerous road trip. TV Tropes calls this the \u201cBadass and Child Duo\u201d trope. Notable examples include Paper Moon, Logan, True Grit, The Last of Us, Les Miserables (partly) etc.\n\nThere are also examples that partially gender swap the trope. For example, Civil War had an adult woman protecting an unrelated young girl on a dangerous road trip. Aliens similarly has an adult woman paired with a young girl.\n\nI\u2019m curious if there are any movies that gender swap both roles: an adult woman travelling with and protecting a young boy (who is not her son). Terminator 2 almost works, but the woman (Sarah) and young boy (John) are mother-son, and there is an additional male protector in the group (The Terminator).",

Although not anywhere nearly as great as 2001, I'd say 2010 is also a superb film! Perhaps they could have done better with the cinematography, but I really like the story, which explains a lot of the unexplained mysteries of 2001, like what made HAL malfunction and also shed a bit more light on the nature of the Monolith. But I'd say the main thing I like about 2010 is the ending (no spoilers here!), which I'd say is a great message for us today, which I hope we learn from, much like the message at the end of the original version of The Day The Earth Stood Still, from 1951.",

        "content": "I'm 4 episodes into ***Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia***, an animated Netflix original series. Anton Yelchin voices the main character (Jim Lake) across S1-2 and the opening 2 episodes of S3 before he passed away in the tragic car accident. It's very obviously Anton's voice and while I'm loving this animated series, it also makes me a little sad. I really enjoyed his movies.\n\nFrom Anton's Wikipedia filmography, I loved him in:  \nCharlie Bartlet  \nFright Night (2011 remake)  \nOdd Thomas  \nStar Trek (2009 reboot)  \nStar Trek into Darkness (part 2)  \nStar Trek Beyond (part 3)  \nTerminator: Salvation (part 4)  \nTrollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (animated series)\n\nHas anyone seen the documentary film **(*****Love, Antosha*****)** about the life of Anton Yelchin?  \n",

        "content": "Just watched F\u00fchrer und Verf\u00fchrer, the film about Joseph Goebbels and Nazi propaganda. \n\nWhat makes it so powerful is its historical accuracy. Dialogues are often pulled directly from real quotes and archives.\n\nAn example: Goebbels initially sold Hitler as a peacemaker, but when war came, he flipped the script. The invasion of Poland was suddenly framed as \"self-defense\" against \"Polish aggression.\" \n\nThe film shows how he controlled the narrative, used emotional triggers, and erased contradictions. Tactics that feel alarmingly familiar today.",

When the teaser trailers started appearing, I saw them all like 10 times to see if there where any details i missed.\n\nI watched every MCU film leading up to that film and when the time finally came, i saw it like 5 times at the movie theatre. I loved it and the soundtrack might be one of my top 10 movie OST's of all time.\n\nWhat was the most hyped movie you wanted to see? I'd like to hear your thoughts.",

        "content": "We all have that one film. It\u2019s not necessarily a 10/10 \"masterpiece\" that critics are falling over themselves to praise, but it\u2019s the one you put on when you\u2019re tired, sick, or just want to turn your brain off and feel okay for two hours.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s\u00a0**Back to the future**. There\u2019s something about the pacing and the fact that I know every line by heart that makes it impossible to turn off and It\u2019s not a \"chore\" to watch. In a world of three-hour prestige dramas that demand your undivided attention, there\u2019s a specific kind of magic in a movie that just wants to entertain you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the movie you\u2019ve seen fifty times that\u00a0never gets old, and what is that one specific scene that still hits even when you\u2019re barely awake?\n\nedit: I didn\u2019t realize the \"pacing\" debate was such a hot-button issue. My bad if the \"chore\" comment touched a nerve I\u2019m just a guy who values a tight script and a Saturday morning vibe. Let\u2019s get back to the movies. Whether it\u2019s a 90-minute comedy or a 4-hour epic, what\u2019s the one film that *always* makes you feel better?",

The Godfather (1972): 94.7 (9/9 sources)\n2. The Godfather Part II (1974): 93.8 (9/9 sources)\n3. Stop Making Sense (1984): 93.7 (8/9 sources)\n4. 12 Angry Men (1957): 93.6 (9/9 sources)\n5.
