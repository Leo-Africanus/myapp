        "title": "Introducing the Fantasy Box Office Game: Two years ago I met a redditor who was running a Fantasy Box Office League game from an Excel spreadsheet and now it\u2019s a fully functional website. Get ready for the 2026 Box Office year with us!",
        "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

Your dad comes home from work with a random DVD he grabbed from a discount bin at the supermarket for like, 5 bucks. You pop it in, and instantly it becomes one of your favorites movies, you watch it 20, 30, 40 times through your whole childhood, then, poof, it slowly fades from your memory as DVDs go out of style and you grow up go to college and move out.\n\nYears later, you\u2019re scrolling through YouTube, and suddenly a trailer for that same movie pops up in your recommendations, and all those memories your ADHD brain somehow made you forget come rushing back.\n\nFor me, that happened today with two movies: Secondhand Lions (2003) and Little Nicky (2000).

But after the amount of flowing WoM i kept reading for the first two, along with craving for martial arts material, I went fuck it and gave them a shot.\n\nLike. Deadass. Some of the funniest yet genuinely thrilling comedy-action shit I've watched in a WHILE. The incredible chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker couldn't by understated enough, after wondering how they could top Rush Hour 1 I almost didn't think rhey had it in em'.....yet here we are we Rush Hour 2 which somehow managed to defy expectations. \n\nThe Massage Parlor fight from 2 alone IMHO deserves a seat in one of the top best cherographed fights ever among duos.\n\nAdmittedly I'm kinda scared to proceed with Rush hour 3 given the mixed opinions I've seen, despite being willing to give things a shot regardless. \n\nBut otherwise yeah, Rush Hour 1 &amp; 2 fucking slaps, and oh my god the fucking legendary bloopers lmao. Now I'm even more sad about finishing these. Any recommendations for anything similar enough?\n\n",

Even Red, his closest friend, had no idea. No speeches. No drama. Just consistency and belief over time.\n\nI\u2019ve watched *Prison Break* before, and it used to be my favorite. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 it was brilliant in its own way. But after watching Shawshank, *Prison Break* now feels\u2026 a bit messy \ud83d\ude05  \nStill great, still iconic \u2014 just very loud in comparison.\n\nShawshank reminded me that sometimes the most powerful moves are the ones no one sees coming.",
