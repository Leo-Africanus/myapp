But those movies became huge box office success\n\nHas there been any recent movie that went through this? Production hell, but turned into a huge box office success? Or do the hollywood directors get whatever they want nowadays? Or are movies nowadays not as ambitious that would have production hell?",

Sunshine (2007). first two acts are tense, beautiful, brilliant sci-fi about saving the sun. and then the third act shows up and\u2026 suddenly it\u2019s a slasher flick with a burnt zombie mutant. it just jumps from genius to B-movie nonsense in a blink and almost ruins everything i just watched. seriously, my brain was like \u2018wait, what\u2026\u2019",

        "title": "how wizard of lies deconstructs the sympathetic anti hero.",
        "content": "one of my top 5 favorite HBO original movies is wizard of lies, a movie about the bernie Madoff ponzi scheme. the film takes what's already a very interesting story and compounds it with good acting, good writing, and some of the best cinematography for a made for TV movie. robert de niro gives one of the best performances of his career and i'm baffled that he didn't win all the awards for it.\n\nhowever, in my opinion, one of the best things about wizard of lies is how it deconstructs the sympathetic anti hero trope. and it does this by simply making madoff an absolutely irredeemable bastard. \n\nat first, it seems like the movie is going to try to make us sympathize with madoff. he's signing end of the year bonuses for his employees and fully plans to turn himself in for what he's done. while the film doesn't condone what he did, the movie at first tries to make us feel bad for him.\n\nhowever, as it goes on, madoff becomes less and less sympathetic. he's an asshole to his children, treats staff like shit, and screws over people who are loyal to him. hell, at one point, he makes his granddaughter cry. making children cry is such a cartoonishly evil thing to do and yet, this movie unironically has madoff do it. \n\nand that's in addition to being the mastermind behind the biggest ponzi scheme in the history of american finance. this is a man who stole from widows, families, and even a fucking holocaust survivor. \n\nthen, towards the end of the movie, he absolutely refuses to take responsibility for his actions and tries to downplay them. the woman interviewing him tells him that, had he died before he came clean, his sons would have inherited the business and thus would have gotten in big fucking trouble if the ponzi scheme had been uncovered. madoff tries to say that they wouldn't have gotten in trouble but the woman shuts that shit down and asks him if he was really willing to let his sons, who used to think the absolute world of him, go to prison for his crimes. madoff doesn't respond but his refusal to answer says more then an actual answer ever could. and then, in the final scene, in one of the craziest examples of victim blaming i've ever seen, madoff is so deep in his refusal to take responsibility that he fucking blames his victims for \"letting\" him scam them. no, i'm not joking.\n\nyou know, in the adventures of rocky and bullwinkie, de niro played a super cartoonishly evil bad guy. THAT character was more likeable then his character in wizard of lies. \n\nnow, i don't hate the movie because madoff is unlikeable. quite the contrary, it's clear that the film intended for madoff to be unlikeable. and the film does a brilliant job at showing the audience that madoff is a piece of shit. first, by pulling the rug out from under us. and then, by constantly twisting the knife and making it clear that there will be no redemption in this story. of course, actually showing the consequences of madoff's actions helped as well. \n\nwizard of lies is a brilliant piece of cinema that will leave you absolutely sick to your stomach.",

        "content": "I finally watched 'A Real Pain' as one of those films I feel I should watch but could never get round to starting. I just finished it and now I'm desperate to talk about Kieran Culkin's performance so here I am. \n\nCulkin's portrays a character who rampages through extreme emotions from scene to scene, one moment he's calm and in control, the next he's angry and confused, the next he's hurt and vulnerable, the next he's pleading with the world to make sense. He wraps all this together into a believable character that is magnetic to watch. I've watched performances  before that I thought commanded the screen but I'm not sure I've ever seen a performance that showed such range and craft. I didn't know he won the Oscar before watching the film, afterwards I checked to make sure he had as anything else would have been a travesty.\n\nThe film ends with a close up of Culkin's face that brings everything together that  we've been watching for the last 90 mins and instantly explains who he really is. It is simply magnificent and I can't recommend A Real Pain enough.\n\n",

The concept was presented in a way that not a single word or gesture was out of place. Every conversation propelled the story. \nCinematography was stunning. For the first time I noticed how many time an actor\u2019s profile was shown against a perfectly placed dark background element to striking effect. \nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, do. And pay attention to how well everything works. \n",

And it\u2019s not mind-blowing, it\u2019s just\u2026 dumb. Like the whole thing got reverse-engineered just to mess with you.\n\nFor me it was Oldboy (2003) I know i know its a hot take but look, I get why people ride for it. But the reveal never felt earned to me. Gorgeous craft, great performances, sure. But that last turn? Felt less like payoff and more like misery-for-shock.",

Not terrible, just not my kind of movie. The best thing I took from it was a good laugh, during the interrogation scene... Mel Gibson scooting down the halls in a wheelchair with his eyelids taped open, screaming at the top of his lungs. OMG I haven't laughed that hard in a long, long, long while. My sister and I were suffocating on giggles and wiping away tears. I was seriously questioning if we were watching a comedy at that point.",

        "content": "On its original broadcast, on Sunday, November 20, 1983, more than 100 million people, watched the film when it first aired on the ABC television network.\n\n**The Day After** received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide. ABC and local TV affiliates opened 1-800 hotlines with counselors standing by.\n\nABC then aired a live debate on Viewpoint, ABC's occasional discussion program hosted by Nightline's Ted Koppel, featuring the scientist Carl Sagan, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elie Wiesel, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Brent Scowcroft, and the commentator William F. Buckley Jr. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, but Buckley promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe film was broadcast on Soviet state television in 1987, during the negotiations on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n\nCensors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. \n\nIn July 2018, a rough cut of the film appeared online, although rumors had long circulated that a second, even more dramatic version of the film existed, but it had never been released. The rough cut contains several new scenes as well as longer takes of scenes already included in the film. The rough cut contains almost fifteen minutes more footage.\n\nThe film received 12 Emmy nominations and won two Emmy awards. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the film received the Goldene Leinwand Award for reaching three million viewers in the cinema.\n\n\n\nThe same theme was also the subject of the British film Threads in 1984 and When the Wind Blows in 1986.",

The worst part is the belief she holds that she's finally going to be given a better life. My heart is empty. This movie is the pure essence of despair. The even worse part is that these tragedies are still a modern day issue in this world. We all seem to see the world through our own lenses and find tragic stories sad. However, this film does a good job of forming a connection with the characters and the empathy subsequently hits harder in my soul. I am empty after viewing this. Very good movie. Despite the fact it kills me inside.",
