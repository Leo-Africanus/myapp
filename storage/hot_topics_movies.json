Robert Downey Jr played his part perfectly, I didn\u2019t even see him in this movie at all, one of the best comedic performances of all time! Tom Cruise is great as the movie producer and his dancing was so hysterical, especially how he does it during the end credits. There isn\u2019t one weak moment in this film, just scene after scene it\u2019s just joke after joke. It\u2019s just a perfect comedy in every way and it never gets old for me!",

I know you\u2019d never see him on a list of greatest actors, but he\u2019s definitely well-respected enough to have a \u201cgood actor\u201d reputation attached to him.

The conflict has spilled onto Earth, and humanity is caught in the crossfire. The Autobots have forged a fragile alliance with the military, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, are more determined than ever to enslave mankind for their own power.\n\nMeanwhile, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew\u2014Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and others\u2014are laying low after their last mission, trying to live a normal life. But their peace is shattered when a mysterious ally, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), seeks them out for help. Optimus needs their skills in navigating dangerous streets and using vehicles to battle the Decepticons, who are now trying to take control of critical transportation routes to fuel their war effort.\n\nDom, reluctant at first, is convinced when he learns the Decepticons are targeting his family\u2014his crew, and even his daughter, Brian (Paul Walker's character\u2019s son, introduced with technology to honor his legacy). The Autobots need the best drivers and racers to infiltrate high-stakes races and sabotage Decepticon supply chains that are hidden behind underground black-market networks.. ",

        "content": "A few years ago a teacher put a movie on class, it was a heavy one, about a girl in an orphanage. In the beginning of the movie the other girls put bleach in her shampoo so she tried to run away. Thr movie is quite old, but i can't remember the name for shit. It was either British or American movie.\n\nThe second movie I'm looking for is a one about a girl whose dad was an alcoholic and she had to hide that fact in school. I thi6they bullied her? She trew her dad's alcohol out if the window and he got angry. \n\nThe third movie was about a girl who received a letter from a random person and then finds the person who turns out to be an old man in a nursery home who wrote encouraging letters to people so she became friends with him and kept writing the letters herself. It was based of a book, i think. The last letter was for her brother who, i think, had cancer. It was a simular style to \"a man called ove\", the book by fredric backman. \n\nAll of the movies except the last one could be considered a bit heavy, i watched them when i was in middle school for \"educational purposes\". The English teacher put them on for us to practice our English and to be aware from the dangers of drug and alcohol ",

        "title": "[Movie Review] Companion (2025) is a really fun black comedy about sci-fi relationships",
        "content": "COMPANION (2025) was a film I was back and forth reviewing due to being a science fiction black comedy. If I had to define its genre, I'd say it's cyberpunk lite. A story that could basically be summarized as \"What if Blade Runner starred the machines and had really stupid people after them?\" Despite the comedic elements or perhaps because of them, the film deals with a lot of incredibly dark subject matter and touches on numerous themes of both technology as well as socialization. \n\nIt's sort of an interesting comparison to EX MACHINA, which had the idea of our machines as wholly inhuman but mankind confusing them for people. This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit). There's a strong feminist theme to the movie that underscores the comedy and slasher movie vibe as our heroine struggles to understand what her \"boyfriend\" now wants to murder her.\n\nThe marketing spoiled a lot of this movie in a manner like CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD as one of the biggest twists comes around the fifteen minute mark but is spoiled by the poster. Indeed, I wasn't even aware it was meant to be a surprise until I watched this movie with my nieces. They had no familiarity with the movie and thus were completely taken off guard when it happened. If you can watch the movie unspoiled or with people who don't know anything other than the title, then I recommend it. Otherwise, note, that the rest of the review will treat this initial reveal as a given.\n\nThe premise for Companion is that Irish (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) are a sickeningly happy couple that are visiting their Russian friend's house for the weekend. It is an incredibly luxurious house in the middle of nowhere and they'll be joined by several friends. It is in the near future with self-driving cars and a variety of other luxury items that seem to be available only to the super rich, though Jack isn\u2019t one of them. One of the guests, Kat (Megan Suri), is initially very hostile to Iris and she doesn't know why. Sergey (Rupert Friend) gets aggressive with Iris and events spiral out of control when he's killed.\n\nWhich turns out to have been the plan all along as Iris discovers that's what she was programmed to do all along. Iris, much to her shock and horror, is a companion robot for Josh. A sort of sexy Tamagotchi that was given a set of fake memories and a willingness to please that overrides all other considerations. Rather than the superhumans of Blade Runner, companions are deliberately made to be no smarter or stronger than \"regular\" humans with the ability of their owners to make them even dumber or weaker. Josh is fond of his companion robot but no more so than a pet and arguably even less than that as he's willing to sacrifice her as part of his plan to murder Sergey then rob him. Unfortunately, he's careless with his master control and he's turned up Iris' survival instincts.\n\nMuch of the movie is, essentially, not so veiled commentary on \"nice guy\" misogyny. Josh is good looking and willing to put on a pleasant enough face around his girlfriend but only when she's subservient to him. Ultimately, she's a convenience and someone that he gets increasingly violent toward as he finds his plans thwarted. We also discover just how fragile Josh's self-esteem is. The fact Jack Quaid is the kind of actor that would be the dorky but handsome lead in a romantic comedy, makes his transformation even more shocking. Like a slowly boiling kettle, we also see how the escalation grows from dismissiveness to furious rage.\n\nThe movie's humor comes from the same source as the movie's terror. The murderers are not particularly competent at their crimes but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous. All of them, even the more sympathetic ones, think of Iris as an appliance that needs to be destroyed. The absolute lack of sympathy from everyone around here is surprisingly well realized. Sophie Thatcher beautifully embodies both the idealized retro-girlfriend with her 1950s-esque inspired look as well as the increasingly capable Iris as she realizes her only way out may be blocked by what she was made to be. I had a lot of fun with this movie.",
