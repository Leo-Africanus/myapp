        "content": "I just haven't seen this mentioned in discussions.   \n  \nIn this film, humans are killer bees.\n\nMichelle says that modified humans were created in a lab, and they were stronger but also more violent. These modified humans escaped the lab and interbred with other humans, spreading their violent genes.   \n  \nThis is what happened in real life with killer bees. Killer bees were created in a lab by hybridizing african and european bees, hoping to make a more productive, heat tolerant bee. Instead they created an extremely aggressive bee that escaped the lab and interbred with other bees (and replaced other bees).   \n  \nKiller bees sting easily and aggressively, but they still lose their stinger and die when they do. So they are more aggressive, but they kill themselves with their aggression. Their aggression also leads people to euthanize whole hives if they think hybridization is occurring, and it leads people in general to be more afraid of bees. \n\nTeddy is a killer bee. He is unusually aggressive and violent, and through his violence he has doomed himself and his whole hive (earth).   \nTeddy is a literal beekeeper as well as being a bee. He cares for his real bees and maintains their living space, but he is also their master.   \nMichelle is a metaphorical bee (queen bee) and a metaphorical beekeeper as well, and humans are her bees.   \nTeddy stung his beekeeper (Michelle) and was harming other bees, so she euthanized the hive. \n\nObviously, Teddy is depicted as a worker bee in the film. Michelle's company is vast, and she is the queen. Meanwhile, Teddy just works in packaging / shipping and has never even seen her in person before.   \nMichelle said that she admires that bees that do their duty and fulfill their roles no matter the adversity facing them. Teddy has suffered great adversity, but he is not fulfilling his duty / role in society.  \n  \nTeddy is relatively respectful to Michelle when he learns she is royalty, showing that he values this kind of hive hierarchy, maybe the way a bee would. However, he never recognizes her as *the* queen. The film mentions that in colony collapse disorder, bees reject or abandon the queen, and it leads to the colony collapsing. He abandoned his duties and attacked the queen, leading to the colony to collapse. \n\nIn this film, earth is also a literal colony, since andromedans came from elsewhere and created humans to populate the earth. They are not native, and are colonizing it. ",
