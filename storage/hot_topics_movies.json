        "content": "*After moving to the countryside, a supernatural encounter starts to transform a couple's love, their lives, and their flesh.*\n\nDirector: Michael Shanks\n\nCast: Dave Franco, Alison Brie\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/together_2025/reviews) (55 reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [76/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/together-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Austin Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/28) \\- [Richard Whittaker](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/richard-whittaker)\n\n&gt;Could a non-married pair of actors have given these scenes such terrifying poignancy? Of course. And there\u2019s no guarantee that a married acting couple would have been able to translate the weight of intimacy to Millie and Tim. If anything, that offscreen chemistry rarely translates and just feels gimmicky. Brie and Franco is like watching Burton and Taylor or Newman and Woodward: as performers who know each other so well, they have synergy but also provide the space for them to reach out and pull back from each other. Their scenes together \u2013 which make up most of the film \u2013 pulsate and breathe. When those elaborate set-pieces start to add in some creatively grisly special effects, they merely clarify the visual component to the established subtext. When *Together* gets weird, it can do so because of how painfully relatable it is.\n\n[NPR](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2070) \\- [Aisha Harris](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aisha-harris) \n\n&gt;*Together* is a fun body horror-comedy about a couple (real-life husband-and-wife Dave Franco and Alison Brie) stuck in a rut but unwilling to do anything about it. When they move to the country, they stumble upon a cursed cave that forces all of their unspoken issues to the forefront in the most visceral and icky ways possible. Writer-director Michael Shanks' third act fumbles a bit in its predictability, but Brie and Franco lock into the offbeat humor of the film's premise, and the special effects are a marvel.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [Kate Erbland](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kate-erbland) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;And, oh boy, does Shanks \u2014 and his very game stars and producers \u2014 take those seemingly trite relationship observations to wild ends over the course of this delightfully unhinged spin on the body horror joint. While it\u2019s easy to poke holes in some of the logic Shanks\u2019 script seems to think is baked right in \u2014 without spoiling too much, we\u2019ve got *a lot* of questions about how much the wider community is clued into what\u2019s really happening\n\n [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;Shanks could stand to develop more finesse (and better writing) in the emotional drama. But even if he\u2019s killing time in his first feature before letting loose a heap of corporeal mayhem, *Together* marks him as a talent to watch. It\u2019s an ideal midnight date movie for the non-squeamish.\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fun (in a rather bumptious way), it stars two very good actors playing a couple who have as many issues as couples do in real life, and it works as a totally unhinged yet far from mindless thriller built around a Big Idea.",

It\u2019s fine for casual viewing, but for film lovers who care about detail, soundstage, and preserving the best version of a movie, what\u2019s the plan?\n\nIf Blu-rays go extinct, is there a future for true high-quality digital ownership? Or are we just stuck with \u201cclose enough\u201d from now on?\n\nCurious what others think. Are we headed toward a low bitrate future or is there hope?\n",

Not what I was expecting, thought it was a silly Adem Sandler movie. But this was something else. I even thought Emily Watson was sexy, and she isn't my type. I really liked the off-beat vibe, it felt like a chaotic dream, just like when you're punch drunk. What do you think? One of the greatest romantic movies or what? (I do admit I was the slightest bit high on a spliff, when I watched)",
