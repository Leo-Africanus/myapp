There aren't any lacking performances and a ton of stand out performances especially from Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce and Patrick McGoohan as King Edward I.\n\nThe real star of the movie is the score. James Horner composed beautiful music to accompany the movie and every time I sit down to watch it I'm immediately hooked simply because of the musical score. \n\nThe film is filled with amazing scenes. My personal favorite moment is the ending when The Bruce has Murron's token and the camera pans to Hamish and Stephen...the look on their faces is just heartbreaking.\n\nit's a 8/10 as a movie...historical accuracy? like a 4/10 lol. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",

I didn't trust any of the click-bait articles I found online, and figured if anyone should be trusted, it's an obscure crowd sourced wiki called [Cinemorgue](https://cinemorgue.fandom.com/wiki/Cinemorgue_Wiki).\n\n  \nTo spare everyone the ironically gory details of manual-entry text clean up, and partially because I wanted to doodle in Illustrator, I made a summary of the top 8. \n\nFor anyone interested in how I created this dataset, the code used to get to this point can be found [here](https://github.com/MDeanLindsay/Cinemorgue).",

        "content": "I like this movie a lot.  I think the cast was pretty amazing and it showed how scary prison can be.  Especially going in with no prior knowledge. One of the things I usually read on reviews is that Money\u2019s climb to power was a little rushed. I happen to agree. Hollywood for you.\n\nOne thing I haven\u2019t seen talked about a lot was Jon Bernthal\u2019s personality differences in the movie. When he is prison, he is serious, focused and intense.  Once he gets out for a while and starts doing drugs, he turns in to a total nervous, sketchy high strung Tweeker.  Having a good friend go through this transformation with drugs, I think it should be talked about and recognized more when discussing the film.\n\nThanks!\n",

The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said \"do you want to go to burger king?\"\n\n\"No Burbank\"\n\n\"Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?\"\n\n\"No Burbank!\" \n\n\"Destination set for baja mexico\"\n\nWow, so funny/s. I've seen this joke so many times but it just doesn't do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it's been so overused by this point that it's overstayed it's welcome.\n\nAre there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?",
