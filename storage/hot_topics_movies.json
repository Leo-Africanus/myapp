Then he basically kinda not bond with his kid for almost 15 years???? His sign language wasn\u2019t even good when his kid was in high school. Eventually they had a big fight, he realized he\u2019s been an absent dad, he sang to his son (with sign language) and everything is good again! \n\n\nI know it\u2019s a movie, I guess it\u2019s because I have kids now, the whole \u201cfather and son quickly bond again\u201d storyline just seems so fake to me. \n\n\nThen there\u2019s the most disturbing part. A student had a huge crush on him, he also seems to have feelings for her too???? The part they almost kiss just made me feel gross. \n\n\n\nEdit: apparently I am wrong about the symphony part so I am gonna delete it.\n\n\nHusband said, I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s so weird when I first saw it, I only remember it was pretty touching. \n\n\nFamily still had a great time. Funny how sometimes our old favorite films are not as good as we remember.",

At the beginning of Interstellar they show the testimonies of older people on tv talking about what it was like on earth before they had to leave. \n\nOne of them is old Murphy. And not only that, the subtitles say it\u2019s her. I just wonder what the thought of this is here. I never realized it was her till like the third viewing, and then recently with the subtitles on it just flat out says it\u2019s her. Is this an accident or on purpose? Like, if you had never seen the movie and watched it with subtitles on (which unfortunately is recommended for Nolan films) and the first 5 mins it gives it away that it\u2019s her, even though it would be hard to catch that or understand what\u2019s going on anyways. \n\nI just wonder if anyone has noticed that or what to think of it I guess lol. I just found it odd, or maybe not put her name in the subtitle. ",

Not looking for plot twists you didn't like but still fit the narrative pretty well, but more like ones that completely made everything before and after worse off. \n\nFor me, it's The Dressmaker. The first 30-45 mins are okay, seems like a romantic drama starring Kate Winslet and Sarah Snook with beautiful costumes. The movie feels light and funny in parts. But then &gt;! Kate Winslet's fortunes go downhill faster than you can say A Serious Man (by the Coen Brothers). Her love interest, Liam Hemsworth, drowns in sorghum inside a grain silo (she witnesses it). Then more people die in gruesome ways, and Kate Winslet ends up blowing up the town at the end. Tone-wise, it is so off...  !&lt;\n\nThe plot choices completely ruin some of the great things it had going for it.",

        "title": "V For Vendetta (2005) is more relevant now that when it was released",
        "content": "It's been nearly two decades since V for Vendetta (2005) hit theaters, and while it was powerful then, it feels downright prophetic now. The film (adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novel) depicts a world gripped by authoritarian rule, where fear and control are used to suppress dissent, manipulate the public, and eliminate those who don't fit a rigid, regime-approved mold. Sound familiar?\n\nOver the past several years, we've seen a troubling global shift toward far-right politics and fascist rhetoric. Governments are cracking down on dissent, scapegoating marginalized groups, and using mass surveillance and propaganda to consolidate power. In America, book bans are rising, protests are being criminalized, and political leaders openly flirt with authoritarianism while spinning their actions as \"preserving democracy.\" Meanwhile, corporations and media conglomerates control narratives just as tightly as the Norsefire regime did in V for Vendetta. The line between fiction and reality is thinner than ever.\n\nTo fans of the original graphic novel, and I am one\u2014yes, I know, the book did a lot of things better. Alan Moore\u2019s work was sharper in its critique of Thatcher-era Britain specifically, and the story had more complexity in certain areas. But that doesn\u2019t mean the film was bad. In fact, I\u2019d argue it made a few changes that I actually like (though I won\u2019t go into spoilers). The movie, despite its differences, still stands as a powerful and necessary story\u2014one that feels chillingly relevant today.\n\nAlso, Alan Moore hating adaptations of work is par for the course. He's entitled to that opinion as an artist, but the film stands on its own.\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t watched V for Vendetta in a while, I highly recommend revisiting it. It\u2019s no longer just a dystopian cautionary tale; it\u2019s a mirror reflecting where we might be headed if we\u2019re not careful. And remember! Ideas are bulletproof.",

It's not just a bad movie, I'm talking about a movie so bad that Mark Wahlberg's brother Paul would have been ashamed to be in it. \n\nA movie so bad it makes The Room look like Citizen Kane. A movie whose set design would be frowned upon by 5th graders. Whose acting wouldn't have gotten them an ensemble role in a stage production of The Room, performed entirely by blind rats. \n\nIf you told me Gods the Deep was a student film, I would encourage failing them and kicking them out of film school.",

        "content": "Happy Valentines Day, everybody! And too celebrate....on my own...as usual (\ud83d\ude22). I decided to watch one of my favorite Disney movies of all time....*Tangled*. This is not only one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, as I said, but also probably tied with *Frozen* as my favorite of the post-2000s Disney Era. Yes, I know there are objectively better films from the modern era like *Zootopia* and *Encanto*. But for my, *Tangled* is my all-time favorite (along with...well, you know).\n\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful, cozy, and still holds extremely, especially with the colors, the comedy also equally still holds up and I found myself laughing at a lot of points, the songs are memorable and catchy, I see The Light and the scene that goes with it is probably the highlight of the movie and one of, if not the most beautiful moment in have seen in any Disney film ever, Mother Gothel is truly the last great Disney (I love King Candy too, but he still got nothing on Gothel) who i am convinced is the Evil Queen from Snow White Years later and i refuse to think any different, the action is surprisingly solid, and not only is Rapunzel the best Disney princess (besides Kuzco, that is, lol), but also her and Eugene's love story is probably the best I've seen in any Disney film.\n\nThe two work off of each other extremely well, and you absolutely buy their chemistry, as they don't fall in love with one another right away, but instead there romance develops throughout the course of the film, and seeing it happen on screen is phenomenal, which just makes the scene when they eventually confess on the boat (in song form!) and when Rapunzel revives Eugene via her act of true love even more satisfying and heartwarming. The emotional/dramatic moments also work extremely well, and don't even get me started on how much of GOATs Maximus and Pascal are as comedic animal sidekicks.\n\nThe only problem I have is that the climax is admittedly the man saving the women again, but I'm willing to let it slide and view it more as a nitpick as it makes sense within the context of the story, and it's Rapunzel who ultimately brings Eugene back anyways. Not much else to say other then such a beautiful and solid film that I highly recommend, that i am surprised though also kindof glad Disney never did a sequel too (the closest we got was the equally fantastic and goated TV series, which i also highly recommend). With that said, if Frozen 3 and 4 are not crossovers with Tangled, I will be VERY disappointed. Maximus and Pacal interacting with Sven, Bruni, and Olaf is too amazing to think about.",

Saw all of them twice in cinemas, I'll probably skip the watch on a TV entirety. The soundscape, the scope in general... It doesn't translate to small. ",

Recently I had a kid and during his long naps I\u2019ve started watching some favorites of mine. I really enjoyed Doctor Sleep when it originally came out a few years back and so I started watching that film this past week. When it got to THAT scene (if you\u2019ve seen it you know what I\u2019m referring to) and while I was impressed with everything about it the first couple times; watching it now with a kid made it so I had to turn it off. \n\nWhat other films are now unwatchable for you due to having kids? Just trying to avoid putting my brain through that again haha ",

        "content": "Recently I've rewatched City of Lost Children (last time having been almost 15 years ago), and I was struck by its aesthetics. It shows up in several lists of steampunk movies, but there's just something else, this grunge and industrial look was present even on non-steampunk media during the 90's and now that I'm older and that particular aesthetic isn't the norm anymore, it's starting to stick out and fascinate me.\n\nIt's very present on games from that era, that much I know for sure, with their overly designed frames for menus with lots of wires and weird tubes, like MDK, Garage: Bad Dream, Planescape, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream and I think, even more impressively in Baroque, which I believe summarizes this feeling of being inside an old, rusty and oppressive machine. Myst or the Longest Journey had machinery or places kinda resembling that, Silent Hill too, of course, etc.\n\nThis is present in some other movies, but not as a whole thing like in CoLC. Like some brief locations in Existenz, The Cell, Darkcity maybe? Jacob's Ladder definitely.\n\nThe point of all this is that I'm looking for more movies like this. Sorry for the long introduction haha",
