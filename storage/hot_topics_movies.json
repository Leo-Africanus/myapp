Vincent is relaxed, joking, eating junk food, while on his way to commit \"a hit\". Through this conversation we learn he has a casual, almost careless personality. Jules is a listener. He's more contemplative, but also more of an authority figure. This scene humanizes them both and makes the following sequence that much more shocking.",

Anyways\u2026\n\nI just rewatched the movie yesterday and I realized one thing that could add to giving away Verbal/Keysers unreliable narrator story. \n\nIn the beginning of the movie, when we open on Dean lighting his cigarette on the boat, he is the one who flicks his matchbook and ignites the trail of oil. However, when Verbal is recounting the story of seeing Keyser Soze in his interview, the scene depicts Soze flicking his cigarette to ignite the oil trail. \n\nIt\u2019s a small thing that adds to the inconsistencies of Verbals story. \n\nSmall detail but I haven\u2019t heard many people discuss it. What were some other giveaways/inconsistencies in Verbals narration?  ",

        "content": "I just watched Scarface (1932) for the first time, and in a few years time this movie will be 100 years old by 2032. It just blows my mind because we've now gotten to the point where movies as we know them have been around for 100 years, right around the end of the silent movies of the 1920's.\n\nBut what's surreal to me like in the movie above, it really does feel like stepping 100 years in the past. I purposely listen to the dialogue to see how things have changed from then till now, and one line in the movie has a police officer say, \"If you play ball, we'll play ball,\" which is still a phrase you hear people say today. Of course I know I'm watching a gangster film so I know some lines will be embellished a bit, but it really feels like a history lesson. Some of the lines of dialogue are still spoken normally today despite this being nearly 100 years ago.\n\nLike just watching a dinner scene seeing the characters talk and pour themselves wine and discuss their day, doesn't seem much different than modern times Then you realize this movie came out before World War II even during the prohibition era and right after the stock market crash of 1929, and it's surreal.",

        "content": "*A Los Angeles detective pursues an elusive thief who teams up with an insurance broker for one last heist.*\n\nDirector: Bart Layton\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crime_101_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [70 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/crime-101/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/feb/11/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-barry-keoghan-mark-ruffalo) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;This is a movie that revs the engine entertainingly and loudly, though it is less convincing when it claims the moral high ground of social comment by perfunctorily showing us LA\u2019s homeless. At one stage, Ruffalo\u2019s detective rides on a city bus crowded with the city\u2019s low-net-worth individuals. (What, no Uber?) But overall, it is a highly watchable spectacle, leaving a sizzling streak of rubber on the tarmac.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-halle-berry/)\n\n&gt;That \u201cCrime 101\u201d comes close to greatness and never quite gets there is not a crime. Even if it was, it\u2019d be a misdemeanor. The flaws in \u201cCrime 101\u201d are only somewhat distracting, and they never ruin the experience, they just get in the way a little. The plot can be humdrum, and it often lacks drive, yet the skilled cast and sleek visual style keep our eyes locked on the screen anyway. So what if Bart Layton\u2019s film doesn\u2019t steal our hearts? It\u2019s still getting away with something.\n\n[Financial Times - Jonathan Romney](https://www.ft.com/content/cf17faa2-d92a-4639-a0ac-2501dfc3974d) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;The film is manifestly aware of its ancestors, among them the Michael Mann canon, Walter Hill\u2019s The Driver and the Steve McQueen titles that are prominently namechecked. That\u2019s some calibre; Crime 101 pretty compellingly measures up to it.\n\n[Awards Watch - Jay Ledbetter](https://awardswatch.com/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-brings-the-heat-in-michael-man-influenced-actioner-as-good-as-its-title-is-bad-b/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;Because of its penchant for imitation, it is hard to argue that *Crime 101* will be remembered as some sort of action masterpiece, but its competence and thoughtfulness are not familiar to the last fifteen, or so, years of action cinema. This is a film that touches on a number of important topics, to varying degrees of success, like sexism in the corporate workplace, police corruption, and the lawlessness of the uberwealthy. Add to that a cast that includes bit players the likes of Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tate Donovan, and you have something that far transcends the run-of-the-mill work clogging the pipes of crime cinema in the 2020\u2019s. This is a movie that deserves to be taken seriously. Derivation be damned, *Crime 101* can stand on its own. If only they could do something about that title\u2026\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/crime-101-review-chris-hemsworth-mark-ruffalo-1236658899/)\n\n&gt;\u201cCrime 101\u201d includes crime aplenty, but at heart it\u2019s a character study \u2014 or, rather, four character studies wound into one. Based on a novella by Don Winslow (\u201cSavages\u201d), the film is just moody and intricate enough to feel the-Michael-Mann-of-\u201cThief\u201d-adjacent, but it\u2019s really a portrait of lost souls working to keep their heads in a corrupt world. Maybe that\u2019s why \u201cCrime 101\u201d plays like a bit of a head game, in a way that may not do it any favors at the box office. Taken as a thriller, it has its indulgences, but by the end it can stand as an advanced course in what underworld dreams are made of.",
