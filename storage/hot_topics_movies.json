Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?\n\nROSE: Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.\n\nLOVETT: Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?\n\nLIZZY: April 14, 1912.\n\nLOVETT: If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.
