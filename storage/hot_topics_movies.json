I\u2019m Elizabeth Lo, director-producer-cinematographer of MISTRESS DISPELLER (Venice &amp; TIFF 2024, 20 awards, releasing via Oscilloscope) and STRAY (Indie Spirit nominee 2021). MISTRESS DISPELLER is a documentary about a woman who breaks up affairs in China. It's out in theaters now. Ask me anything!\n\nIn China, a new industry has emerged devoted to helping couples stay married in the face of infidelity. Wang Zhenxi is part of this growing profession and is hired to go undercover and break up affairs by any means necessary; a \u201cmistress dispeller.\u201d Offering strikingly intimate access to a real, unfolding love triangle, Mistress Dispeller documents all sides of what is usually kept behind closed doors. As Teacher Wang attempts to bring a couple back from the edge of crisis, sympathies shift between husband, wife and mistress while emotion, pragmatism and cultural norms collide in this spellbinding look at modern love.\n\n**Trailer:** \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo)\n\nThe film opens in New York on 10/22 and Los Angeles on 10/23 before expanding around the country in the weeks that follow. The film is currently at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (24 reviews).\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back tomorrow (Monday 10/20) at 3:00 PM ET to answer questions :)\n\n",

        "content": "I have no idea why this movie isn\u2019t considered a classic. It is one of the most stylistically interesting and entertaining movies I have seen a while - and I\u2019m not just talking about Shakespeare adaptations here, I mean literally out of all movies.\n\nIt oozes phrenetic energy, swagger and sheer style in every single frame. The costumes, the sets, the lighting, the editing - you feel like watching an explosion of overconfident late 90s aura that\u2019s injected directly into your eyeballs.\n\nAnd the acting? I\u2019m just gonna say every single actor knew exactly what kind of film they were in and they deliver appropriately scene chewing performances. With young Leo dicaprio at the height of his twink fame, as well as Claire Danes as Juliet (who we all know has insane chops from her TV outings) - their chemistry is just fantastic. Everyone else in this movie is fantastic too (shout out to Mercurio).\n\nLike this movie might have been seen as over the top when it first came out, but I\u2019m not gonna lie it aged like a fine wine. I feel like it is probably more in tune with pop culture nowadays than it was even in the 90s (I literally wanna wear every single outfit from this movie).\n\nNot to say it\u2019s all just bombastic silliness - some scenes, like the balcony scene, feel genuinely sweet, and oddly ethereal. This movie has such a unique vibe (I honestly feel that euphoria was kinda inspired by it in terms of the atmosphere it manages to create).",

Nic Cage is suitably unhinged, and the action scenes and production design are manic and over-the-top in a fun way. Directed by the people who brought the Crank movies, if you watched the behind the scenes they put their lives on the line to pull off the stunts. The story is whatever, but are you there for that or to see Ghost Rider piss fire? The only thing missing was a hard R rating but I was entertained and it didn\u2019t overstay its welcome \n",

Even in the trailer Keanu says \u201cI gave him money and it solved most of his problems\u201d \n\nThen started thinking about how so many movies cannot land that answer. Another one was the movie the materialists. To make it rational to the viewers why she would choose her broke ex over the rich guy they show like 2 scenes of him being mean to her after like 10 scenes of them going to different high end restaurants having an amazing time.\n\nAny movies you guys think answer the question \u201cmoney isn\u2019t everything question\u201d ",

She purposefully made David into a self-aware sentient being instead of the dutiful robot he was which then led him to become attached to her. And then, when her son revived and the brat started bullying David and then causing him to \"misbehave\", the dad was quick to decide in deactivating David. \n\nI'm of the belief David should have been deactivated all along. It was of no use to keep David \"alive\". For what? So he could spend years and years by himself, looking for a mother who never really loved him. Oh sure, she cared enough about David to not have him go to the factory but it was her conscience because she knew it was her own fault, not because she loved this android boy. \n\nIt's such a sad, tragic movie. I felt bad for David but it was a hopeless endeavor. The dream of him playing with Monica comforted him but it was all for nothing. \n\nThe brat human son had the family David never had.",

        "content": "So I recently watched Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein for the first time as part of a Universal Monster movie watch party, and was surprised that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a spoof that made a bunch of jokes at the monsters' expense similar to modern horror comedy movies, instead I noticed that the scenes with the monsters were all treated seriously and played completely straight like they were from any of the previous Universal Monster movies. Only Abbott and Costello's scenes had any comedy, if they weren't on screen there were no jokes, and even when they were on screen, the monsters and other characters were still meant to be serious and/or scary. \n\nThis got me thinking, I admittedly haven't seen that many old comedy movies, but most of the ones I've seen (especially Marx Brothers movies) are similar in that regard. They feel like most of the characters are acting like they're in a normal movie, but then these comedic actors come in and make a lot of jokes. Basically, it seems to me that what sets apart old comedy movies to modern comedy movies, is that in older comedies only a few characters were meant to be funny, while in modern comedies everyone is meant to be funny.\n\nWhy were older comedies like this? What changed? When did this change happen? Or am I completely wrong and making assumptions and the old comedies I've seen aren't representative of everything?",

        "content": "With Scott's upcoming film, **The Dog Stars**, set to be released in theaters on March 2026, it will be the 30th film of his illustrious 49 year career, going all the way back to 1977. Ever since his directorial debut with **The Duelist**, he has directed some of the most memorable films in history. From the ambitious **Blade Runner** to the terrifying **Alien** to the Oscar-winning **Gladiator**, he has some truly great films in his belt. But ever since the Oscar-winning success of Gladiator, his filmography has been up-and-down. He has directed 18 films in 25 years since Gladiator, which is honestly really impressive, and while some have been good, others have not. **The Martian**, **Kingdom of Heaven** (director's cut), **The Last Duel**, and **Prometheus** (despite fans being divided of the movie) have been some of his best work, showing he has no intention of slowing down, even if he's reaching 90. But throughout that great work, there have been some divisive films at best and downright awful films at worst. **Exodus Gods and Kings** was a whitewashed, historically innacurate mess which fumbles its massive potential of retelling one of the most important stories in history. Same with **Napoleon**, and while it's miles better than Exodus, in terms of basically everything lol (expect accuracy, which Napoleon does a bit better, but it isn't saying much), it really didn't live up to expectations as an epic historical biopic about the French commander. And some others like **Robin Hood**, **The House of Gucci**, ect.\n\nI'm a big fan of his work, and I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well, and there will always be his critics. And the criticism he receives is valid, because every filmmaker isn't perfect. That being said, his legacy is undeniable, having redefined the sci-fi genre with Alien and Blade Runner and the attention to detail in his visual style being influential to a new generation of filmmakers who want to approach that same visual style as Scott. But what do you think? ",
