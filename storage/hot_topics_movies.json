        "content": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144381/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk  \n  \nNutcrackers is, without a doubt, the worst movie I\u2019ve seen in years. From the psychotic children to the dull, meandering plot, to the blandest cinematography, this film does nothing but waste your time. I already can\u2019t stand David Gordon Green for what he did to the Halloween franchise, and now I can add this to the list of things he\u2019s ruined.\n  \nIt\u2019s rare for me to finish a movie and genuinely wish it didn\u2019t exist. This is one of those times. The movie\u2019s not entertaining, it\u2019s not dramatic, it\u2019s just pointless. I honestly can\u2019t believe this thing was greenlit.  \n  \nBen Stiller returns to the screen after seven years\u2026 and this is what he came back to? Either he owed someone a huge favor or needed money because this is a complete disaster. I watched it with friends and at one point, I thought it\u2019s probably almost over. There was still an hour left. I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.\n  \nThis movie feels like you\u2019re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I\u2019ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I\u2019m actually angry it exists.\n  \nDo yourself a favor and don\u2019t waste your time. You\u2019ll probably tap out after 45 minutes anyway, so save yourself the trouble. Avoid it at all costs. ",

No, James Bond is the man's actual name and in fact, the events of OHMSS are referenced throughout the Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan Bond movies.",

It's a full circle feature film and made me realize how rare those are.\n\nWhy \"full circle\"? Because in my eyes, everything it does, it does right. \n\nThe setting itself is pretty rich, very interesting and fresh, not used many times before if I recall right.\n\nThe characters are, in my opinion, the closest someone has ever come to Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThe dialogue is vulgar and sometimes pretty deep at the same time. \n\nAnd all in all, the story, centering around three main characters in their small bubble, is a quick but sweet and simple but very interesting affair I loved seeing develop infront of me. There are not a lot of twists and turns, it does not need that, it just needs what it has to entertain all the way through.\n\nIt's darkly comedic and sometimes tragic and it manages both emotions with ease. \n\nAll in all: a fantastic piece of cinema and my personal introduction to the great mind of Martin McDonagh.",

        "title": "Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending",
        "content": "Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. \n\nContact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \\[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. \n\nOne of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \\[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical \"damsel in distress\" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.\n\nI have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. \n\nBack to the ending: the plot holes. \n\n1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.\n\n2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. \n\n3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a \"we'll never know\" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.\n\nThose are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",

Dune Part 2  - No doubt the greatest movie of the year and a perfect balance between  spectacle and detailed world building .\n\n\n2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.\n\n\n\n3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )\n\n\n\n4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .\n\n\n\n5. Smile 2      - A fresh engaging horror flick which lives up to the hype.\n",

Done best when a small group of family members or friends dip their toes into crime and are unable to handle the consequences. Call it schadenfreude or just the pleasure of watching someone else's life go worse than mine.\n\nClassics of the genre:\n\nBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead - One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's* masterclasses with a stunning Marisa Tomei and desperate Ethan Hawke. Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.\n\nA Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).\n\nThe Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.\n\nHonorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.\n\nWhat others?",

        "content": "Just rewatching The Sixth Sense. Anyone think the movie becomes better on the rewatch when you know the ending? I first watched the movie in college, and of course you're watching for the spooky gotcha moments. After knowing the surprise ending, you're watching a human drama. I'm now a mom and see a lot of nuance in Toni Collette's performance, and the drama of a single mom trying to connect with her son without knowing what is wrong. You have Anna's story, not a depressed, cheating wife, but a grieving widow. You have Malcolm trying to come to terms with his failure from years before but communicating his love for Anna. ",

You are the heros of my night \\^\\^  \n  \nMy friend demands a proof to admit that a movie can be made alone and successful. It needs to have made at least like 1 dollars of profit over the money taken to produce it (equipment aquired by other means than buying/already owned doesn't count) and it needs to have been officially critique by some official cinema sources (cause he thinks that a movie isn't successful if it isn't criticised officially for some reason). It can have been published on youtube or anything but needs to be at least an hour long, tho if it's not 1 hour long pls tell me anyways. Thanks, ask me if I forgot some important details to explain.\n\nEdit: He also needs to be the sole actor in the movie (animals count as actor but sounds out cam are fine)",

It ebbs and flows with happiness and the bittersweet human experience and optimism + building connection with children in such a wholesome way. Really soothing to my inner child. This is the kind of movie that can be played while sleeping or cooking or on a movie night when it\u2019s like a slumber party or smth. This is just the best most wholesome and artistically lovely movie everrrrrrrr\n\nETA: I see now why Julie Andrews made it to like Superstar Status after this movie. This is like a cinematic gem. If we could leave movies behind from earth, like 10 movies from each category, this would be up there with Forrest Gump &amp; The Wizard Of Oz for wholesome, nostalgic artistic masterpieces fr",

        "content": "This is a 90 minute documentary about a water park that once existed in NJ, it was open from the early 80s up until the mid 90s and was one of the first major water parks at the time, commercials aired frequently on TV I'm not sure what the range was but I grew up watching them but was never able to go.  The park became infamous for a large number of accidents and numerous deaths from electrocution to drowning.\n\nThis awesome documentary covers everything from the history, to stories of the people who went and worked there, the documentary can range from funny to sad to shocking and some great videos of the looping water slide in action is shown.  It's well worth it to check this one especially if you have heard about the park or went there.",

I saw The Accussed and thought it was a mediocre Tv-movie. To think it was more deserving than Glenn in Dangerous Liasons? Absolutely ridiculous. ",
