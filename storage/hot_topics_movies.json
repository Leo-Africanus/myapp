(In no particular order)\n\nIp Man (1) - when he fights the 10 Japanese fighters after his friend Liu is killed by Captain Sato and Lin being killed by General Miura.\n\nCaptain American Winter Soldier - the elevator scene, of course. This absolutely had to be in my list,  the tension building up as more and more \"big, tough guys\" come into the elevator, Cap noticing small details like the dude visibly sweating and everyone around making small glances at him being nervous... Rumlow making seemingly random small-talk. The fight itself had amazing choreography as well, such a small compact space, Cap having to fight with only one arm for a quarter of the fight. \ud83e\udd0c\n\nMatrix Reloaded - when Neo fights hundreds of Agent Smiths after speaking with the Oracle. The CGI is terribly outdated now, with sequences of the scene looking like they are straight out of a cheaply made video game, but for the time the film was made it's understandable. I still love the fight scene itself, especially when Neo gets the pole and starts knocking all the Smiths out of the circle.\n\n\nHonorable mentions: \nAny of the John Wick movies\nKill Bill vol. 1 (fight against the Crazy 88)\nNaruto: Shippuden - Madara after he is resurrected during the Fourth Great Shinobi War.",

        "title": "Remember When: \u2018Jaws\u2019 Defined the Summer Tentpole | No Film School",
        "content": "This is probably going to be hard for young people to grasp but there was no such thing as a summer tentpole when Jaws was released.  People didn't go to the movies in summer in large numbers so big commercial movies weren't released in the summer.\n\nJaws also didn't create the summer tentpole because there was no big commercial Hollywood release the following year (1976) and, probably even harder for young folks to imagine, Star Wars was released in summer in 1977 because everyone including George Lucas expected it to flop.  Star Wars was released in summer because there was no competition and George Lucas was paying Fox a fee to release Star Wars.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution since George Lucas did not want to go bankrupt Star Wars did not even open in wide release--it opened as a platform release in a limited number of theaters and cities expanded as positive word-of-mouth spread.  Star Wars was also the opposite of what a modern audience thinks of as a summer tentpole because it opened slowly and made its money in theaters across 9 months.\n\nDespite two summer releases being huge commercial successes in three years Hollywood still released nothing in 1978 that anyone would define as a summer tentpole.  Superman came out in 1978 and sure sounds like a classic summer release.  But it was actually released in December, not summer, so even the success of Star Wars wasn't quite enough to usher in the era of the summer tentpole.  ",

        "content": "There's no such thing as a flawless movie, so I'd like to know what people think is the most glaring flaw in their favorite movie is. My favorite's *Apollo 13*, and the flaw that sticks out for me is that I think they pushed too much of an \"unproven rookie proves himself\" subplot with Swigert. It'd bother me less if not for the fact that Swigert was dead so they couldn't get his opinion on his portrayal in the movie.",

I ask because the movie makes fun of the esoteric habits of yuppies, so perhaps those menu items are a part of the overall joke. I honestly cannot tell.",
