        "content": "Last night purchased \"Excalibur\" 1981.  I was 13 when I first saw it in 1981. I remember being riveted to it for some reason. Maybe it was the visuals, the music or the far away place feeling it gave me.\n\nBy the 90s, I had purchased it and VHS and watched it again. Seemed kind of over the top and slow, and confusing.\n\nFast forward 2025. I was sitting here on Thanksgiving even, and remembered a few scenes from it. \n\nStarted watching on Youtube.\n\nBOOM! 10 mins later, I'm purchasing it and starting it alone on my laptop with ear buds. \n\nSome things that stood out to me at 57 that I didn't get until now:\n\n1. Merlin - He's basically a non-human. Multiple times, referred to as such. As a kid, I thought he was just a wizard. He's a pagan. Would not have picked that up as a kid or even understood it. He's got some lines that are literally genius, and I'm not sure the movie would have worked without him.  \n2. Sex and Violence - Wow, didn't realize how sexual it was, almost homoerotic at times.   \n3. The use of light - Never remember noticing how they played with light and reflections to denote power and magic.\n\nThat got me thinking, what other movies could I go back and watch as an aging person from the 70s and 80s and totally see them different.\n\nStrangely enough, \"Falling Down\" just hits different the past few years.

        "content": "Adaptations inevitably make changes to the source material, either adding new elements or cutting out scenes or characters. Sometimes though, these changes create plot holes that weren't in the source material, either contradicting something that was already established, or omitting an explanation (which isn't necessarily a plot hole, but still very annoying).\n\nFor example, the Wizard of Oz infamously ends with Glinda the Good Witch telling Dorothy that she had the power to go back home all along with her Ruby Slippers. When asked why she didn't just say that from the start, she claims that Dorothy wouldn't have believed her, which is a rather questionable assertion. The original book has no such problem, there the Good Witch of the North and the Good Witch of the South are separate characters, the Good Witch of the North is the one that gave her the shoes, and Glinda the Good Witch of the South is the one to tell Dorothy how to go home at the end of the story.\n\nSo what other notable plot holes or weird leaps in logic weren't in the source material but were caused by adaptation changes?",

        "title": "I watched Hugo (2011) with my kids. Great movie, but an even better experience",
        "content": "The movie was very good. But the experience we had as a family watching it was incredible. \n\nMy 11yo kept quoting 'absolute cinema' to me, and\u00a0rather than just say \"You don't know Scorsese\" I decided we should watch the one kid oriented movie he's made. \n\nThe movie itself is a homage to early cinema. Which lead to us having so many great discussions. \"Is it true that when people first watched the movie about a train arriving at the station that they screamed?\" \"Wait, that rocket in the eye of the moon was from a real movie?\" (Yes kids, and that movie not only came out decades before the moon landing, but before the first aeroplane.) We talked about all the real life stunts Buster Keaton nearly killed himself for, we talked about silent film. We talked about physically cutting out frames as film film editing. \n\nAll those fun discussions arose from the plot of the movie. It sent their minds racing about how movies work in a way they've never thought about before.  \n\nThe search function on our Google TV occasionally stops working, so I had to navigate to the movie in the first place by playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon. OBAA (which was on the home screen) to Leo, to Marty, to Hugo.) \n\nMy eldest was shocked, he didn't understand how I got there so easily, so I got to explain to him what six degrees of separation is, and how to play it. I gave him a few easy ones to work out, using his favourite movies, (link FNAF to The Hunger Games, absolute layup) which was a fun way to introduce him to movie trivia. \n\nBut then I got to cap it off by telling him that I could link him personally to this movie within six steps. We live in regional Australia, so we don't have many Hollywood connections. But in 1947, an actress called Jean Simmons (not the one from Kiss) was touring Australia and wanted to see a sheep get sheared, went to a farm in the middle of nowhere, where my great grandfather was a shearer, there's a photo of them together while he's working a sheep. So the link is: Kids --&gt;Me --&gt; Bupar --&gt; Jean Simmons, --&gt;(through Howl's Moving Castle - they play old/young Sophie) --&gt; Emily Mortimer who is in Hugo. His mind was blown. \n\nOne other great movie moment was that my younger child, quiet morbidly, always asks if any of the actors have died since the movie came out. So we got to talk about exactly how cool Christopher Lee was.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, the movie was very fun. But the moments that sprung from it, and discussions we had together, were absolute cinema.

        "content": "It's a movie you can pass off as a silly fantasy where a hot girl like Alice Eve would never fall for a guy like Jay Baruchel's character, but the script does a really good job showcasing why she'd want to stop dating the same guys who break her heart and why someone like Kirk is who she should be with. And I feel the insecurities and the apprehensiveness they give to the Kirk character is something ever guy can relate to who has had insecurity issues and they're dating a really pretty girl. \n\nThe third act scene where they're about to have sex for the first time encapsulates the entire crux of the movie. Kirk looks at himself as boring, unattractive, and not worthy of being loved because he's been bullied and broken down to that point. He doesn't realize that Molly knows he has faults but she wants him anyway. \n\nThis movie and movies released around this time like Celeste and Jesse Forever are the comedies I really wish were still being made today. Just sweet laugh out loud movies you can watch over and over again.\n\n",

        "content": "I randomly saw this movie recommnded on Reddit for being \"gothic\". It grabbed my attention cause otherwise I've never heard of this movie. Initially I was kinda hesitant, seeing it has low ratings and the rotoscoped animation isn't very appealing, five minutes into the movie and it completely grabbed me. The animation and artstlye grew on me.\n\n\n\nIt is super inspired by Fire &amp; Ice, the Ralph Bakshi movie. Both in it's dark fantasy/sword and sorcery themes and the animation style, except Fire &amp; Ice is way better animated, but the rotoscoped artstyle is the same.\n\n\nThe charcter designs and the level of gore and violence reminded me an aweful lot of Metalocalypse. You will see A LOT of detailed, animated gore. And it fucking rules. And there's also a lot of nudity, not in a sexual context though.\n\n\n\nThe story is surprisingly good, but I'm kinda biased cause I love dark fantasy. The pacing is quite leisurely. It takes it's time unwrapping the plot for you, and to me personally it was worth it cause it ending is very satisfying.\n\n\n\nI would just like to shout out this movie for A. Being an absolute passion project which I wish got more appriciation and eyeballs on it. It took seven years to complete this project. And B. The Dark Fantasy genre is not very popular these days so I value anything that brings it back.",

        "content": "I want to be clear that I'm not looking for \"setting as a character\". I was scrolling on Tubi and came across The Great Escape. The description is worded as this:\n\n&gt; The award-winning, high-energy World War II epic about a maximum security Nazi POW camp that three U.S military prisoners attempt to break out of.\n\nI thought it was an interesting way to word it. It frames the prison as the focus as opposed to the prisoners. It feels like the main character is the prison itself.",

If memory serves correct, he was short haired, maybe balding and had a mustache. A lighter complex hispanic person. He opens a package and realizes it's a bomb and yells \"EL BASTARDO\" Or YOU BASTARDO\" or something like that. I never got the name of the movie and when I try to google it.All I get is other movies that don't seem to be right or don't have the scene. If anyone in here knows the name of that movie, I would greatly appreciate it.It's been bugging me for years.",

I find that this movie brings a nice introduction to the whole Hispanic culture into the American mainstream media and for the casual audience to witness the traditional setting of the Mexican family. It definitely portrays a positive representation and influences of Latino pride for the entire children and family to enjoy.  ",

The story was as chaotic and disjointed as any real life.  It really felt like a good a glimpse into that world, peopled by our near ancestors, not so long ago(Not it mention the excellent narration and score!).",
