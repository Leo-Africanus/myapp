        "content": "Hey Reddit! I'm Clint Bentley, director of films like Jockey and co-writer of Sing Sing. I most recently adapted the novella Train Dreams by Denis Johnson with my longtime collaborator, Greg Kwedar. Looking forward to answering your questions! Check out the trailer here: [https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSYNOPSIS: Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th-century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation\u2019s railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality, and newfound meaning in the forests and trees he has felled. An ode to a vanishing way of life, an ever-evolving world, and to the extraordinary possibilities that exist within even the most simple of existences, Train Dreams captures a time and place that are now long gone, and the people who built a bridge to a future they could only dream of. Directed by Academy Award nominee Clint Bentley with a screenplay by Bentley and Academy Award nominee Greg Kwedar, the writing team behind Sing Sing, the film also stars Academy Award nominees William H. Macy and Kerry Condon.\n\n  \nStreaming on Netflix November 21",

        "content": "MILD SPOILERS BELOW:\n\nHow does Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro), who is shown throughout the film to be utterly meticulous and deeply cautious, allow Waingro (Kevin Gage), who is shown to be a serial rapist and murderer (not to mention a loose cannon, literally), to join his crew for the heist at the beginning of the movie? \n\nSince Waingro's actions are the inciting incident for much of the plot, including the critical denouement at the film's climax, this feels like a major issue that you can't just handwave away. It's an unmotivated/inexplicable action by McCauley, and it feels a bit sheisty that Mann starts the script only *after* Waingro has already joined the crew. It's not like he does some critical, irreplaceable job for them that it would be reasonable to take a risk with. Without some additional reasoning, such as when the crew takes a risk with driver Don Breenan (Dennis Haysbert) when under extreme time pressure, the whole thing with Waingro, and therefore much of the film's core narrative, seems totally out of character for McCauley.\n\nI've watched Heat dozens of times, I can quote the screenplay title to title from memory and, as I said, I think this is one of the best crime films ever made... but it may be built on a paper-thin foundation, unless I've missed something. \n\nPlease share your thoughts; I'm happy to be disabused of my misconceptions!",

I hope Hollywood never replaces this trope. ",

I love Pedro Pascal but I\u2019m not really a romance/romcom fan so I waited to watch it on streaming and boy I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay the cost of a movie ticket. \n\nWhy was every character and shot so flat and lifeless and one-dimensional? Why couldn\u2019t this movie pick a tone? Did they think we wouldn\u2019t get the moral of the story after seventeen different monologues about how \u201clove isn\u2019t about checking boxes\u201d? Who thought it was a good idea to have a poorly handled SA-themed plot twist 2/3 into the movie that seems only to serve as a \u201clesson\u201d for the deeply unlikeable protagonist? \n\nThe editing was also so bizarre. There was no reason for this movie to be two hours long and a lot of the scenes felt like there was some kind of time quota they were trying to reach. And in that time, most of the characters don\u2019t go through any meaningful development and in some cases even end up going right back to making choices that the movie already made a point to show didn\u2019t work the first time. \n\nWhat\u2019s wild to me is that the press tour for this movie was delightful and proved these people absolutely can have chemistry together but none of that was present in the actual film. \n\nI haven\u2019t watched Past Lives so I don\u2019t know if this is a director problem or a this movie problem but\u2026yikes.

Apparently it\u2019s more in line with what del Toro had envisioned from the start.\n\nThe black &amp; white treatment gives the whole film *so* much more texture and depth.

It really feels like a classic noir film.\n\nAnd while there are \u201conly\u201d 9 minutes added, along with some mild scene shuffling (in both cases mostly in the beginning), those both give a ton of added context to the plot as a whole, and to specific scenes, and address many of the typical complaints with the film.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a  \u201cFury Road Black and Chrome let\u2019s make it look cool\u201d treatment; this is how it should\u2019ve been released in the first place.",
