Then I did precisely that - 3 grams of edibles later and I rented \"Portrait of a lady on Fire\"\n\nThe movie had good reviews, and I'm still treating it like a joke at first. It's about 5-10 minutes into the film I realized every assumption I MAY have had about the movie was far, far off. and any notions of it being like a joke turned into a joke themselves.\n\nThe shots of the movie were\u00a0**so utterly beautiful it sometimes felt like I didn't even have the right to look at the screen.**\u00a0The\u00a0**characters were so utterly realistic it sometimes felt like I was genuinely invading their privacy simply by watching them.**\u00a0I related to them. I liked them. It is the only film I have seen where\u00a0**the cinematography was so good it provided a theater-like experience at home.**\n\nMy point is, I went into a movie expected a joke, and instead got a masterpiece every film student in creation should analyze thoroughly.\n\n**By the end, I was left thinking \"Jesus, that was so, so much better than it had any right to be.\"**\n\nWhat movie was this for you?",

I never noticed it before, or if I did, I just took it as a friendly nod to his buddy but after rewatching it several times it stood out to me in a different light for some reason and I think it's brilliant \n\nWhat are examples of this happening to you with movies you love to rewatch?

In every kind of movie whether it\u2019s an action movie, a rom-com, a mystery. Everything. \n\nI need a movie that will genuinely stump him. Something so out of left- field he didn\u2019t even see it coming. \nNothing super scary though, we\u2019re not horror film people. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to give a list of movies we have watched bc there are so many. But to give an instance of how wide across genres it goes: we watched \u201ccrazy, stupid love\u201d the other night and he pretty much guessed some of the ending. We watched the first \u201cKnives Out\u201d last night. He guessed it too. Granted these may not be too hard to follow and predict, but he does it it nearly every movie.\n\nThanks in advance! ",

He had lied to her about which movie because I was not allowed to watch Rated R movies that my mother had not seen and pre approved of me watching it. It made the experience more exciting from the very beginning.my uncle and I have always been close. My father was an OTR truck driver at the time and was gone for long periods at a time. That resulted in me spending more time with my uncle.\n\nT2 was important to me for reasons that go beyond just the movie itself. It made me interested in bodybuilding which started a life long and ever continuing desire to remain in shape and be as healthy as possible. I never have been bodybuilder level of ripped, but I have always been in much better shape than most me my own age. Reading books on bodybuilding and bodybuilders spawned a love for reading in general, that continues today. I have read thousands and thousands of books on various topics that have helped educate myself and made into a better person than I likely ever would have become otherwise. The experience also gave me a strong love for story telling across various mediums. I have acquired movie liscenes and held screening for many movies in various venues bout inside and mostly outdoors. It helped me realize the importance of family and that the experiences you share with them can shape and moldnyou into the person you will be, even though at the time it is almost impossible for you to recognize the importance that moment will have on you in the future. It also showed me how one important moment/experience can have a domino like effect that can lead to you finding other things or people that to will become to have a big impact on your life.\n\nWhat is the one movie/ theater experience that impacted you life unlike any other?",
