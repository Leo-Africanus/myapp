        "content": "I saw in the news today that Tarantino said *There Will Be Blood* isn\u2019t his favorite film of the 21st century because *\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a 2-hander, but Dano is weak sauce, man\u2026 He\u2019s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. The weakest fucking actor in SAG.\u201d*\n\nHonestly, I thought this was an incredibly classless thing for Tarantino to say. First of all, I actually thought Dano was great in the film \u2014 he genuinely made me *hate* the character, and when an actor manages that, it usually means they\u2019re doing a damn good job. And from what I\u2019ve read, Dano barely had any time to prepare for the role anyway.\n\nTarantino was one of my favorite directors from the 90s \u2014 *Pulp Fiction* is in my top 25 movies ever \u2014 but the truth is, as an actor he\u2019s pretty weak himself. Whenever he shows up on screen, he sticks out in all the wrong ways. Even in *Django*, every line he delivers feels forced and unnatural.\n\nToday I lost a lot of respect for Tarantino.",

But man oh man, this will always be one of my all-time favorite movie scenes, especially as a history lover. I don't even care if people say that it is historically inaccurate. It is such an amazing scene, beautifully acted and filmed. It doesnt' matter how many times I watch it, every time I see Achilles riding up on his chariot with that eerie score playing in the background, it always gives me goosebumps. And everything about the final showdown where he takes Hector out is absolutely top-notch, in my opinion. That winning move where he ripped the broken spear out of Hectors hand when he lunged at him with it, dodged his last desperate sword swing with some freakish instincts, and then slammed that broken spear right into the top of his pectoral/shoulder area, all in one unbelievably smooth motion, was absolutely astonishing. Hector just had nothing left in the tank, and Achilles was, well, Achilles; one of the greatest warriors ever born on Earth.",
