        "content": "The other day I was thinking about the teaser trailer for the 1992 film Toys. (Here for context: https://youtu.be/jFNdcCqYgBg?si=38f-2BM6uROQ5QHD) There\u2019s no footage from the film, it\u2019s weirdly liminal and unsettling, and it\u2019s just a minute and a half of Robin Williams riffing. It\u2019s better than the movie itself.\n\nTeaser trailers are a lost art form. They don\u2019t exist to showcase the plot, but to intrigue people into finding out more, or to get them thinking about the movie long term. The teaser trailer eventually died, mostly because with the internet, you can announce when a movie is coming much easier than putting together a minute of unrelated footage, but it lives on in my heart.\n\nThat got me thinking, what are other people\u2019s favorite teaser trailers? What trailers got people excited for a movie without revealing too much information about the movie itself?",

        "content": "Dumb and Dumber To was a terrible sequel, and made way too late, like most other comedy sequels recently. However, there is a scene where Harry imagines life as a dad, and the way that he imagines Lloyd in his fantasy is just so funny. It's peak Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey, and I remember this specific moment bringing tears to my eyes. It starts at 1:25 in the video linked.  What is a genuinely funny moment from an otherwise awful comedy movie? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/EJFm05MPSDQ?si=hGHHAVxEzKVUHxGu",

        "title": "Alice in wonderland (1951)",
        "content": "I have just rewatched Alice in wonderland  for the first time in years, I\u2019ve heard many people talking about how it has no plot, is all a dream etc. \n\nI completely disagree, I think the plot is Alice\u2019s journey from doing as she it told, to realising her true potential  by following her intuition and do what she wants to do rather than following rules set by everyone else. \n\nIn the beginning, she speaks about what her world would be like, everything would be opposite. This is Alice expressing her feelings of confusion and discontent with the expectations forced upon her in life, wishing she lived in a world where she is free to be her true self which is imperfect but not rejected or questioned for being herself.\n\nThroughout the story Alice questions what she is supposed to to do, following the lead of others, chasing after different characters. At the very end, when she meets the queen who symbolises external expectations, social rules and the pressure to be perfect. She finally listens to her desires rejecting all expectations forced upon her by \u2018beating\u2019 the queen. In this moment she is freed and wakes up. I believe this is the moment she realises her potential, realising that her life journey is up to her, accepting her self fully which is why she wakes at that moment from the \u2018dream\u2019.  \n\nAs a child I adored the book and all the movies. I am also autistic and I think the reason I loved this story so much is because i saw elements of myself in Alice. I know allistic people are negatively affected by the worlds expectations but for high masking autistic people especially- we know there are expectations but we do not understand them, they confuse us and we fail to meet them far more, feeling constantly rejected and resentful towards the expectations, yearning to understand and to be understood. Alice subtly shows us that we don\u2019t need to make sense of this, when we finally listen to what we want and need and accept that it\u2019s okay to do so- telling us that we will be free when we accept our selves as different rather than accepting the expectations that we do not understand.",

        "title": "The Jurassic franchise makes me sad",
        "content": "I think the first film is a masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films of all time. Maybe not number 1 but top 5 if not 3. I watched it last year for the first time in years. I didn\u2019t think it would be all that good anymore with how lifeless the series felt in the modern age. But no. It\u2019s still an amazing movie that lives on its simplicity. Dinosaurs are brought back. At first it seems magical. Then it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nAnd now with the seventh movie in the franchise coming out I\u2019m feeling that same tired and apathetic feeling I felt before I re-experienced the original. This really feels like it was not meant to be a franchise. The first film is very simple and the minute you try to stretch it beyond that you lose the appeal. It\u2019s not like Indiana Jones where you can have multiple adventures. That\u2019s why we have Dial of Destiny a chance because a fifth movie could\u2019ve worked. But with Jurassic I just can\u2019t see it. \n\nAnd I feel like with how lifeless the series feels now it\u2019s easier and easier to forget how amazing the first one actually is. Which is why I\u2019m not even bothering to see this one. I saw some reviews of it and that was enough for me to learn this wasn\u2019t worth my time or money. We should listen to the ending of the first one and let these creatures stay gone and not try to bring them back because it never works.\n\nNot sure how anyone else feels about this. For anyone who has actually seen it is there actually something in Rebirth that\u2019s worth while?  ",
