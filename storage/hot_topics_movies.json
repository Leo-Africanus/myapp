I can suspend disbelief to think it threw on a tattered robe or something, but a well-made vivid red cloak had me scoffing. Suddenly the Simpsons joke clicked and was humorous to me. \n\nThat's all.

I didn\u2019t watch trailers and incorrectly assumed Conclave was a horror movie, which would be my type of thing.  \n\nI was not prepared for what I watched.   \nThe best word I could come up with:       \n\nGRIPPING.      \n\nThe theatre was 1/3 full at best, but I swear that not a single person left to use the washroom or gets refreshments in the first hour of the film.    The characters, the process, the intrigue pulled you in to such an extent that  there wasn\u2019t a moment to quickly step out that you might find in other movies.    \n\nThe movie challenged social and religious conventions.   It managed to have you suspect virtually every major character of skullduggery at some point in the film.        \n\nThe church and its warts were on display, from treatment of women to racism, regionalism, and modernity.        \n\nIt was the weaving of so many individual stories, the unknowns of a dead man\u2019s thoughts and intentions, the political intrigue\u2026.. all together drawing you in like so many strands of spider silk making it impossible to look away.         \n\nSo there it is.   My first post to this sub, all because I absolutely loved a movie I had no preconceived notions about.   \n\n10/10, would conclave again.    ",

        "content": "Everywhere you look, Hollywood seems obsessed with looking back\u2014sequels, reboots, and endless reimaginings of classics. While it\u2019s comforting to revisit the worlds and characters we love, has this nostalgia-fueled wave come at the cost of originality?\n\nWhere are the bold, groundbreaking stories that once defined cinema? Are we clinging so tightly to the past that we\u2019ve stifled the creativity needed to move forward? Or is nostalgia a necessary ingredient in connecting generations through storytelling?\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014are we celebrating the art of filmmaking, or are we just endlessly chasing the echoes of what once was? Is this love for the past enriching cinema, or quietly suffocating it?",

        "content": "I sometimes think about which movies had a deep effect and meaning to me as a kid and wonder what I might share with my own kids some day. A lot of them continue to effect me to this day into my adulthood, so I take seriously that whatever I choose would also leave a permanent mark on them. There is crossover, but it's also significantly different than my plain old \"Top ten movies\" list.\n\nI think my list would be, in no particular order:\n\n1. Homeward Bound (DOGS)\n\n2. Angels in the Outfield (Best most heartfelt kids sports movie)\n\n3. Back to the Future (It will be hilarious to show them a movie about the far off future of 2015)\n\n4. Just blanket all the Disney movies from the 90s (I miss 2d)\n\n5.  Independence Day (Gotta teach them how to be patriotic and not go quietly into the night)\n\n6. Die hard (They need to grow some hair on their chest too, a little action is a must)\n\n7. Star wars, original trilogy (Yeah its basic, but its also important to me)\n\n8. Singing in the Rain (Every kid loves \"Make 'em laugh\", no exceptions)\n\n9. Galaxy quest (the best Star trek movie lol)\n\n10. Iron Giant (\"I go. You stay. No following.\" tell me you didnt just tear up right now)\n\nWhat about yours?",

        "content": "This film was an academy winner and a huge box office draw and did extremely well in rentals, but in the past 20 some years it's become more famous for how widely unavailable it is in the states.  It's a really heart warming sci fi drama with touches of comedy.  It was previously released on DVD and blu ray but they are both long out of print and have never been given another release, it's not even available for streaming.\n\nSome people believe it may have something to do with music clearance rights with the soundtrack but there is no definite answer as to why Disney and 20th Century Fox haven't given this gem a new release.
