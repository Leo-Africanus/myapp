        "content": "I was watching parts of the Bradley Cooper movie *Burnt* the other day, and there's a scene in which he's speaking to a rival chef with whom he used to work, and the other chef asks Cooper's character (named Adam Jones) something to the effect of \"what happened to your angelic face?\" and Jones basically responds that hard living has taken its toll.  \n\nNow, setting aside whether anyone wishes to describe Bradley Cooper or anyone else as \"angelic\"-looking, in the scene itself there was actually nothing visibly wrong with Bradley Cooper's face!  The chef looked just like Bradley Cooper looks in nearly all of his movies, which is a handsome movie star.  (Later in *Burnt*, he is beaten up, and his face is cut and bruised, but that hadn't yet happened in this scene.)  Doesn't the director or anyone else make this connection?  I know that they don't want to make their pretty-boy movie star *too* ugly, but then couldn't they just tweak the script to say something else?  \n\nAnother example is *The Devil Wears Prada*, in which Ann Hathaway's character is repeatedly described as being overweight or outright fat.  Now, yes, she was working in the fashion industry, where body standards can be unrealistic, but the character at one point describes *herself* as being \"not skinny.\"  Even by fashion industry standards, there's no way anyone would reasonably call her \"fat,\" as Meryl Streep's character does at one point.  The character looked just like Ann Hathaway looks in nearly all of her movies, which is a fit, pretty movie star.  She and Emily Blunt even commiserated on set over how hungry they both were, because she *and* Hathaway *lost weight to play the role*.  ",

Or Mrs. Doubtfire is genuinely disturbing. That moment where vou're watching your childhood favorite and suddenly thinking 'wait... the 'villain' was completely right.\n\nThe killer responses come when people realize they BECAME the character they used to hate. Watching Dead Poets Society and siding with the cautious parents Seeing The Little Mermaid and thinking Triton had valid concerns about his 16-year-old daughter. That vertigo of realizing you've crossed to the other side of the story.",

Scenes that are easily looked over.\n\nMy example comes from the film Ronin. A film renowned for it's epic car chase or the coffee cup ambush. One of my favorite scenes from this film is Jean Pierre enjoying his hobby of making ancient Japan samurai figurines and creating his diorama. A quiet moment between all the action and tension.\n\nWhat are your examples?\n\n",
