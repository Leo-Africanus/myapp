He senses someone is there and crosses over the balcony to a sliding door \u2014 and there's a girl in bed waiting for him.\" \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Frankly, you don't need a star,\" Campbell adds. \"James Bond is the star and the film is the star. **They just need to find a terrific actor who looks right for the part.\"**",

The movie is essentially about a guy who chose a career over staying with his gf and flash forward years later and he's living a very financially successful life but without any family.  Through a series of events he gets placed in alternate life where he's now in a middle class lifestyle married to his former gf and has kids.  \n\n  \nI know theres been plenty of other movies that have done a similar concept of transporting a character to an alternate reality  and seeing what could have been before but for some reason this movie has always stuck with me.   \n\nMakes you think about the path of going down either having a family or choosing not to have that life or maybe wanting it but it just never happened for you and ultimately have to come to peace with either scenario.\n\nAlways thought the ending was interesting how it transports him back to his rich and single lifestyle after he had just begun to enjoy having a family and how he now views his life differently",

        "content": "This is inspired by Novocaine. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all. Using it as the basis for a romantic comedy is certainly inspired, and it's potentially thematically rich. I understand it was liked by critics and general audiences if Rotten Tomatoes is anything to go by: [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine\\_2025](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine_2025)\n\n  \nHowever just thinking about the premise of being injured but not feeling the pain of it makes me wince. Beyond how much Jack Quaid's character is injured and unnervingly unbothered by it from the trailers, it just makes me imagine having his condition and having an injury that might become life-threatening without being aware of it, so I would be paradoxically extra paranoid about getting into any situation where I might be injured. \n\nThis is unusual for me because I'm a horror fan and have seen some really disturbing simulated injuries in movies while still enjoying the experience over all. \n\nIs this unusual in general? Do other people feel this way about Novocaine or have specific movies or general premises that make them unable to watch movies no matter who good or bad they are? ",

        "content": "I was watching The Incredibles (2004) last night with a five year old and was kind of astonished to see the depiction of an attempted suicide toward the beginning of the film. (Mr. Sansweet attempts to jump off a skyscraper, Mr. Incredible saves him, and then he goes on to sue Incredible for \u201cruining his death.\u201d)\n\nNow, I\u2019ve seen this movie at least a half dozen times, and it came out when I was already an adult, but I don\u2019t recall ever being surprised by this depiction before today. Is it me, or in the past twenty years have our cultural ideas of the depiction of suicide shifted so much that in 2004 we could have witnessed a suicide attempt in a kids movie and thought nothing of it, or does anyone else old enough remember this being a big deal when the film was first released, and I\u2019m just forgetting?",

Which film do you think is the best so far, and which one do you think is the weakest? Do you think they are overhyped or underrated? Where would you like to see the franchise go from here?",
