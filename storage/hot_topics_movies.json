        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI\u2019m trying to identify a Yugoslav (or possibly early post-Yugoslav) film I saw as a kid, probably on TV sometime in the late \u201990s or early 2000s. The movie itself felt older\u2014likely filmed in the late 1980s or early 1990s, based on the grainy visuals and production quality. It was in color, definitely not black and white.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I remember, as accurately as possible:\n\n\n\n* A man and a woman (she was blonde, maybe in her 30s) are driving at night in a **red car** (possibly a VW Golf, but I\u2019m not certain).\n* They are stopped at a **border checkpoint or police stop** and the man is **beaten** by the officers.\n* Later in the film, **several men invade a house** where the same woman and another woman are staying. There\u2019s a brief conversation, then a **sexual assault occurs**\u2014graphic and with nudity.\n* After the attackers leave, a **young boy comes to the house**, opens the door, and sees the two women **lying unconscious and naked** on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scene stuck with me because it aired on TV right after a block of children\u2019s cartoons. As a kid, it completely blindsided me. Now I\u2019m just trying to identify the film for peace of mind, to make sense of what I saw. I talked to my mom about how I was raised by my aunts as a kid when we visited our family home over the summer and I mentioned this stuff. My mom does not believe me. She also told me to prove it by telling her the name of the movie. At first I am like \"The fuck? What kind of logic is that? If I know the name of the movie, my claims are true but if not then I am lying?\" TL;DR This is *not* for any sensational reason\u2014just closure and proving my mom that some of my aunt's on my dad's side are a bit messed up\n\n\n\nIf anyone recognizes this or has any idea what film this might be, I\u2019d be grateful.  \n\n\nThanks in advance.",

I can see why it was so groundbreaking.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why Roy suddenly decided to spare Deckard's life.\n\nI know Roy's death is imminent, but why would that cause him to have any less vengeance? Deckard hunted and killed the people closest to him. He had no problem killing Sebastian, who actually went out of his way to help them. So why?\n\nRoy's final monologue seemed to imply that Roy as a replicant has just as much humanity as a human. Yet moments earlier he was cackling maniacally and happily toying with his prey. If there had been any indication of his humanity earlier in the film, his change of heart would make more sense to me. If his motivations against Deckard had been fueled more by a sense of justice for his fellow replicants, rather than his own survival, maybe I would buy it. But to me, it felt purposefully like classic \"final villain fight\" material, and the mercy decision came out of nowhere for me.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Or am I overthinking it?",

        "content": "I already asked other subreddits that specialize in Korean content but received no response so I want to shoot my shot here. Around mid 2000s I watched the first 15 minutes of a Korean film that opened with American women vacationing in Korea. Then the film cuts to a girl (probably high schooler/uni student) walking in the alley of what I assume to be Seoul. I believe she was wearing winter clothes and earmuffs. Then she greets what appears to be the owner of a restaurant and they seem close. Then a couple scenes later she greets them again but he's complaining about his hip due to it hurting. This is all I remember as I wasn't even 5 years old yet when I watched it. I think my parents told me to go away because this movie wasn't for kids and was a potentially a horror movie? But I'm not 100% sure.  We watched it in the garage so my guess is the movie came out early to mid 2000s. Any ideas?",

Ghostbusters, Sully, any cop movie with internal affairs, even freakin' Ratatouille... Those darn bureaucrats just want to make everything worse for hard-working folks!\n\nBut regulations are written in blood. These rules and oversight exist because without them we'd still have lead paint, we'd be eating poison, and deaths in plane crashes would be way more common. So can anyone recommend any movies that show us why these regulations and oversight are actually necessary?",

He has been sober for many years and wrote the screenplay based on some of his own experiences as a heroin addict. \n\nIt is a really beautiful film, sad but also quite hopeful which in itself feels like a rarity in films about drug addiction.  It is also surprisingly romantic, but without glamorizing their lifestyle.  It reminded me a little of Smashed, the movie about an alcoholic couple starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul.\n\nI am surprised I had never heard of the film considering Dastmalchian has been in everything recently.  Found it on Tubi, very worth a watch if you like indie slice of life type films.\n\n",

        "content": "It's hilarious, it's gross, and it's utterly stupid (in a good way).  The protagonist is not winning any beauty contests, and there is no big moral lesson waiting at the end (or worse, lurking throughout the film).  There is plenty of cringe, but it's earned -- not just cringe for cringe's sake.  Is it a flawless film?  No, but if you've been hurting for a 90s-style comedy that doesn't ask too much of the viewer but gives plenty of laughs in return, I cannot recommend *Let's Start a Cult* highly enough.\n\nI went into it blind and, having now watched the trailer in consideration of linking it in this post, I would suggest doing the same for maximum good-times effect.  But [here is a poster if you need something to whet your appetite or give you a vibe.](https://i.imgur.com/GTOA6B3.png)",

Everything was on a budget and yet, seeing a similar helmet in my hands, I am at a total loss for words. \n\nMaybe the escapism\n\nMaybe the fact my dad had been married 3 times. \n\nI loved what TRON stood for. Escapism.  I needed it. I also need it today. \n\nI picked this helmet up yesterday and what is so bizarre for me, is to think someone bought this exact helmet. Took it home to his kitchen table, and overlaid it with Chartpak tape and it became the pivotal movie to my teen brain. Like, this helmet would go on an actor, to make a movie, and that movie would spawn a revolution. \n\nIt's absolutely amazing",
