I watched Anaconda when I was younger maybe once or twice but I decided to rematch it today after I saw the new Jack Black version this past weekend. I am genuinely confused by Jon Voight's character. I understand that he's a big snake hunter amd that he thinks catching the giant anaconda will make him rich, but surely there were other ways to go about it instead of sabotaging a film crew and deliberately getting some of them killed? And what the hell is that accent? It sounds Spanish at times, Italian, Australian, and it's just all over the place. And who's bright idea was it to have him be swallowed whole by the snake, spit out, and then proceed to wink at Jennifer Lopez's character as his limp body falls to the floor? I'm just utterly confused by the thought process both in front of the camera and behind it. ",

        "content": "This is a specific kind of movie, not stuff like *The Sixth Sense* or *The Others* where the whole story gets reframed by a twist. I\u2019m looking for films that specifically hint at something much deeper going on but never explicitly explain it.\n\nA common (and controversial) example is *Eyes Wide Shut*. On the surface it is about a nosey doctor who stumbles upon an elite sex cult. However, many viewers believe it may be pointing toward child sex abuse, based on cryptic dialogue and visual cues allegedly left by Kubrick. I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist, but given Kubrick\u2019s meticulous deliberation I find this interpretation at least plausible. Regardless, the film leaves you with the strong sense that something far darker is going on.\n\nAnother example would be David Lynch\u2019s *Twin Peaks: The Return*, where numerous blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it visual glitches are scattered throughout the entire season, suggesting cosmic disarray and an increasingly fragmented reality.\n\nLastly, in a very different vein the film *Local Hero* appears to be a very straightforward story about an oil man traveling to a remote Scottish village to build a refinery. Yet there are small, almost imperceptible hints throughout that the village may exist in a magical or mythological reality inspired by Scottish folklore. One might interpret these hints as throwaway references if not for a bizarre reveal that one character has webbed feet. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for films like this. Something feels deeply \u201coff\u201d or hidden, but the movie never confirms or explains it outright. ",

He plays a mysterious guy from Jason Bateman character's past (who has just bought a house with his wife Rebecca Hall) who they meet by accident but then who keeps showing up again and makes their life complicated. It's a very nice psychological thriller.\n\nI won't bore you with the various roles he has played and various films he has been (Zero Dark Thirty, The Green Knight, It Comes at Night, etc.) except to say his most recent, Train Dreams, where he plays Robert Grainier, a railroad worker and a logger, is a phenomenal movie ((95% on Rotten Tomatoes, 88% on Metacritic) that really shows how good of an actor he is. That is not the kind of movie I usually enjoy (period dramas) but he carries that whole movie on his back and brings to life Grainier and make him so interesting.",

Even avatar 2009 is still some of the greatest CGI I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nAnd you ca say a lot about the Star Wars sequels but the CGI and visuals were pretty spectacular. Seeing the last Jedi was an amazing theatrical experiences; the CGI and cinematography was breathtaking. ",

        "content": "Occurred to me the other night when my wife and I were talking about the first album we ever bought as kids. I laughingly admitted mine were Kriss Kross and Ace of Base. She had a good laugh, and tried to remember the lyrics to \"Jump Jump.\" I tried to remind her by bringing it up on Spotify and she emphatically stopped me (No! Please no! I don't need that song stuck in my head all week!). So I joked I was going to secretly make it her alarm clock music. It then reminded of the gag from Groundhog day and got me thinking that \"Jump Jump\" would actually be an older song to someone now than \"I Got You Babe\" was to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. And then it reminded me of the cruel march of time... But I digress...\n\nIf Groundhog Day were remade today (please don't Mr Hollywood producer person), what song would our protagonist be waking up to every morning?\n\nEdit Edit: Lotsa folks getting hung up on the exact year difference. Can't change it now, but I didn't mean to sound like it had to be from *exactly* 1997, just that that was the rough era we were talking about. Any similarly old song is fair game.\n\nEdit: Some of my favorites listed so far:\n\nSpice Girls - Wannabe. Just opening every day with \"Yoooooo I'll tell ya what I want!\" would be hilarious\n\nSmash Mouth - All Star. Ditto: \"SOoooommmeBODY Once told me...\"\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Today. How poetic\n\nChumbawumba - Tubthumping\n\nLen - Steal My Sunshine\n\nWho Let The Dogs Out\n\nBittersweet Symphony\n\nGreen Day - Basketcase\n\nSheryl Crow - Every Day Is A Winding Road\n\nBare Naked Ladies - One Week. Starting every day with \"YIIIIITsss beeeen ONE WEEK!\"\n\nCher - Believe. Nice reference to the original.\n\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go One. Fits the sappiness and relevance of I Got You Babe.\n\n4 Non Blondes - What's Up.\n\nCardigans - Love Fool\n\nRembrants - I'll Be There For You.\n\nOasis - Wonderwall.\n\nThird Eye Blind - Jumper or Semi Charmed Life\n\nProclaimers - 500 Miles. \"When I wake up... Yeah I know I'm gonna be...\" Even a bit of a love song to boot. \n\nWhitney Houston version of I Will Always Love You. Imagine waking up every morning to AAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDDD IIIIIIIII eIIIIIIIIIIIII",

        "content": "Today I had nothing better to do than finally watch movies I\u2019ve always meant to see but never got around to. One of them was Being John Malkovich. Yeah, going back all the way to that wonderful year, 1999, when the world still made sense and things hadn't gotten crazy yet. Well, but then the movie did. And how!\n\nI\u2019d resisted the movie for a long time because John Malkovich was never really on my radar as an actor, I didn\u2019t dislike him, I just didn\u2019t particularly care either. But after reading a bit about the movie, I realized the movie didn't have much to do with John Malkovich himself and way more to do with the crazy premise: Cusack plays a puppeteer who discovers a portal that leads directly into Malkovich\u2019s mind.\n\nI mean that made me go, What?!\n\nI\u2019m a fan of surreal comedies (like After Hours), so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot, telling myself I could always switch to something else if it sucked. You know, something intelligent and grounding, like The Waterboy, from a year earlier. :p\n\nBut wow. What an entertaining movie.\n\nFrom the very beginning, you\u2019re in for a whimsical mindfuck, absurd, funny, but oddly still packed with food for thought. I mean, stopping an elevator halfway between floors is just the starting point of the crazy adventure and it gets weirder but I won\u2019t say much more.\n\nWell, except: Malkovich malkovich, malkovich malkovich! Malkovich malkovich?\n\nYou\u2019ll understand if you\u2019ve seen it.\n\nThere are moments where nothing makes sense at all, and then other moments where the strangest things suddenly make perfect sense. It\u2019s weird in that very intentional and thought-out way, like it's crazy but smart.\n\nThere are plenty of \u201cmindfuck\u201d movies out there, so I'm not just asking about that in general, but more specifically about smart \u201cWhat the F did I just watch?\u201d films. Something weird, absurd, and surreal but clearly made with real thought behind it?",
