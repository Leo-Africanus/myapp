Meaning where an actor clearly has no motivation for a role other than financial and therefore clearly doesn't care and is barely trying if at all.",
        "content": "Let's be clear; acting is a job and pretty much every actor will have to take roles for financial reasons alone at some point. Charles Dance put it very well here:\n\n\"I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work.\"\n\nBut there's a difference between actors who take those paycheck roles in lackluster or bad films and give it their all or chew up the scenery in entertaining fashion and those who clearly are not even trying. See the 2000 \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", a terrible film where you have at one end Thora Birch monotonously droning every line and putting in as little effort as possible and at the other end Jeremy Irons (who openly admitted to doing this to pay for his newly acquired castle) tearing through every scene he's in like a mako shark on a cocaine high. You can't get a better example of the extremes of this.\n\nMy personal favorite example of the \"don't care\" approach is Peter O'Toole in the adaptation of Dean Koontz's \"Phantoms.\" Not a bad movie (Affleck is the bomb in it), but one that got a very negative reaction upon release and one you definitely don't expect the likes of O'Toole being in it. Being O'Toole, he isn't bad, but he's obviously putting in minimal effort and his attitude screams, \"Look, I had a bar tab to pay off, sue me.\" It's something I find very entertaining.\n\nYour favorite example?",

And I can't remember her ever putting on a dramatic performance.\nSo I never thought much of her.\n\nBut in The Long Walk with just 5 to 10 Minuets of Screen time she absolutely blew me away.\n\nShe is devastating to watch. She conveys such a raw Terror and emotional Turmoil over the possibility of losing a child.\nI did not know she had it in her. She was for me the best performance with just 5 minutes of Screen time in a movie filled with incredible performances.\n\nI now hope to see her more in leading roles or atleast substantial supporting roles.

        "content": "Movies are meant to be cinematic and look cool, so when it comes to battles, the rule of cool usually prevails over sound military strategies. Realistic portrayals of battles can be interesting when done well, but most directors prefer to go for spectacle.\n\nThe most notable example of this would be 300. They occasionally pay lip service to the importance of military formations, but in practice the Spartans just go out and fight on their own like badasses who each can take on dozens of Persians all on their own.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings movies also often rely on rule of cool for their battle scenes, especially with anything involving Legolas.\n\nIt is also quite common in superhero movies. Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame both end with large armies just charging towards each other and fighting in melee combat, with minimal use of vehicles or long-ranged weaponry.\n\nSo what other movies employ pretty dubious tactics but audiences don't care because it just looks so cool?",

        "title": "How would you explain Robert Rodriguez's career?",
        "content": "I'm always baffled by this trajectory.  He's no doubt successful and surely insanely wealthy.  So whatever works works, I guess.\n\nBut it just seems so not what I would have expected for him.  I don't think today he is a director whose name will draw an audience like so many auteur types, yet he does seem like an auteur director....sometimes.  He's also just super talented.  There's no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Tarantino, Spielberg or Nolan.  But unlike those three, a \"The Next Film from....\" tagline on a poster isn't going to instantly sell out movie theaters.\n\nI think maybe it's easy to point to Spy Kids and the Lavagirl thing and be like, \"Oh, he just wanted to make kid-friendly blockbusters\" or whatever, but it doesn't seem like that's the case because he still did Grindhouse, Machete and Sin City through all that too.  Also, Hypnotic was apparently a recent film of his but nobody saw it, and that's what I'm getting at.  I think Tarantino could do a string of kid movies and as soon as he comes back with a \"real movie\", everyone's going to want to see it.\n\nSo what's going on with Rodriguez?  Why didn't he reach that level of status and fame?  He certainly seems to have the talent and he probably has the money and general financial backing to warrant it.",

        "content": "It all goes back to a post I made on here years ago, where I was asking users on Reddit what actors had the best chemistry in a movie, and Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson in that movie were one of the many actors that were listed. That answer caught me off guard, cause those were two actors that I'm familiar with, but never in a million years would've guessed that they starred in a movie together but also shared a lot of scenes with each other!\n\nWhen I finally watched it, I was certainly impressed with their on-screen chemistry that I needed to see more of it and was disappointed when I discovered that this is the only movie they've worked on together!   \n  \nThe movie itself was also pretty great, and had amazing action sequences that I find it odd how Geena's character isn't mentioned a lot when the media lists 'badass female protagonists done right!' But Geena and Samuel being such great scene partners is what made this movie stand out to me the most! ",
