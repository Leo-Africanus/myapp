They looked absolutely terrified, while Hopkins was just starring down the bear, with a look of complete fearlessness and awe. Anthony Hopkins has pretty much nailed every single role he has ever played. \"The Edge\" wasn't some huge summer blockbuster or one of his most memorable roles, but I absolutely love his character in the movie. A billionaire who you wouldn't think would end up being the total bad-ass that he ended up being when shit hit the fan in such a serious survival situation. Such an underrated movie. ",

Seems to be insult to injury that his family abandoned him at Christmas, and even Santa decided to screw him over as well.
