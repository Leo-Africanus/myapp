I feel the movie should've done more to justify her getting a real redemption than just put a plane on autopilot.\n\nWhat other movie characters get off a bit too easily?",

This is an excellent, chilling movie about a guy who goes crazy due to excruciating circumstances, and I can sort of relate to his predicament! I also lived in LA for about 10 years and I've seen much of the same bad scene depicted in the movie, which is a far cry from the Hollywood glamor typically depicted of it! I also know the feeling of being on the edge, but luckily I'm a nonviolent person, so if I lost it, I'd most likely just resort to verbal abuse, which I'm pretty good at! In any case, I recommend this movie, since I think it depicts a dark part of real life we all must face, for better or for worse!",

        "content": "When I was a kid I loved watching Siskel and Ebert; it was a fun to hear about upcoming movies and what they thought about them. After Siskel passed, it was still must see viewing to see Ebert's reviews (No knock against Roeper; the show's essence didn't change; which is a testament to him.)\n\n\n\nI agreed with Ebert about 90% of the time (overall thumbs up/down), but what mattered most was hearing his reasoning, which when combined with my preferences, it created a super quick heuristic to know whether I would love, like, dislike or hate a movie. For example, his review of Blue Velvet, which he disliked, gave me enough information to want to see it.  \n  \nSince his passing, there has been a void in me and surely others. Changes in cultural and technology are the main culprits, and I don't know of a good solution (for society as a whole).\n\n\n\n/mild rant over",

        "content": "Great movie if you haven't seen it. Truly nothing quite like. The monolog is such a great touch of serenity in an otherwise insane film. Directed by Terry Gilliam and released in 1998. Stars Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Based on the novel of the same name by the journalist and novelist Hunter S. Thompson. \n\n\"The film follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio del Toro) as they embark on a drug-fueled road trip to Las Vegas. The story explores themes of the American Dream, the failure of the 1960s counterculture, and the chaotic nature of their drug-induced experiences.\"",

        "content": "I recently rewatched Se7en, yes, the 1995 thriller with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, and for some reason, I kept laughing at all the \u201cserious\u201d scenes. It wasn\u2019t intentional, and I wasn\u2019t mocking it, the timing, the expressions, even the ominous music made it oddly hilarious to me.\n\nIt got me thinking about how much our own moods and quirks shape the way we experience films. One person\u2019s horror is another person\u2019s accidental comedy, and that\u2019s part of what makes watching movies so unpredictable and fun.",

        "content": "Streaming services are getting to be such a pain that they create a new argument for keeping physical media available.  Every so often, a popular movie or show \"leaves\" a particular service, and fans panic.  Other services sneak ad breaks into inappropriate moments in movies to frustrate viewers into paying extra to \"go ad-free\".  If you own a physical copy, you only pay for it once; you will always have access, regardless of which streaming service it moves to, and you can watch ad-free without incurring additional costs.  If it's a movie or show that you really love and want to enjoy on your own terms, having the DVD or Blu-ray is the way to go.",
