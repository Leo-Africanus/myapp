        "content": "What's a movie you saw you realized was intentionally about a completely different thing than what was on the surface or what it was marketed for??\n\nI'll explain myself, what's a film you saw you thought it was going to be about a thing and instead realized it was about another one?\n\nI'll try to clarify it to you with two examples for me:\n\n\u2022The Brutalist: It was supposed to be an epic about the Jewish immigrant experience after the Holocaust, and the resolution and determination of the self made man against an hostile territory.\n\nAfter the jarring and perplexing ending i realized afterwards that it was a metaphor about the film industry and art in general, about the contrast between art and commerce, and especially the work of the artist and the true meaning behind it versus its external perception.\nLiterally there's a scene in which the patron rapes the artist out of nowhere, for no reason, and it's indeed a visual representation of the artist getting fucked over by the higherups with money.\n\nThe jarring ending is intentional, it signifies that the artist's work will always be misinterpreted by other people for their own personal agendas or, intentionally or not, its meaning will be twisted by future generations according to their perspective, and the artist (played by an old mute Adrien Brody on a wheelchair) can't have any say over that.\n\n\u2022Taxi Driver: On the surface a bleak character study a violent man with PTSD, a sociopolitical commentary about the Post-Vietnam America set in the dark concrete jungle of New York City which gets represented almost as hell on Earth, and the main character is supposedly its saviour angel.\n\nBut you watch the entire film, and realize that underneath all of this there's a certain sweetness in many moments.\nIt's really a film about love, wanting to be loved, and longing for connection, but the outcome of that desire for that main character is tragic or at least left ambiguous as a neverending fever dream.\n\nWhat do you think?\nAgree?\n\nWhat are your choices or examples instead??\n\nSound off in the comments section down below.\n\n",

        "title": "Calling Out Criterion, Arrow, Shout Factory, and Other Boutique Studios Regarding Subtitles or Lack Thereof on Physical Media",
        "content": "I have an extensive collection of movies that I enjoy, including DVDs, Blu-Rays, and 4Ks. I always check to see if they have subtitles, as there are still some movies out there that are still released without them. Because I'm Deaf, I have to have subtitles on at all times, and I understand that even hearing people are having it on too, as not to miss anything. As more movies are being added to the physical formats, a few glaring issues are starting to arise.\n\n\n**Special Features**\n\nAs most of you will know, a lot of these movies come with special features and commentaries from people who worked on the movies. These are great additions to the movies or shows that would make any fan happy to watch; however, releases from boutique studios, such as Criterion, Arrow, Shout, and many others have chosen not to subtitle any of the large swath of special features. Imagine my disappointment when I buy \"The Lighthouse\" from Arrow, and I am extremely curious about the behind-the-scenes of it, only for none of it to be subtitled. Same for my recent purchases of \"No Country for Old Men\" *(Criterion)*, \"Paris, Texas\" *(Criterion)*, \"Trick r Treat\" *(Arrow)*, \"RoboCop 2\" *(Shout Factory)*, and so many more titles in my library. I haven't checked \"Seven Samurai\" from BFI yet out of fear of disappointment that it too will be lacking subtitles. I am willing to bet that 90% of these boutique studios' releases have not subtitled any of them. I have tried not to let it bother me as I am appreciative of owning my favorite movies, but I can't help but grow increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of subtitles on special features, especially if they are used as major selling points on the back of the box or in release announcements. Especially considering it may be baked into the price of the movies.\n\n**Foreign Films**\n\nCriterion's most recent release of \"Godzilla vs Biollante\" is what urged me to finally speak up about this problem. I was excited to finally watch this movie, only for the first few lines of the movie, which were spoken in English, to be translated into Japanese. I was immediately disappointed as a few minutes later into the movie, another conversation is being had, and it is being translated into Japanese rather than English. I turned it off and put it away. I have thought of returning it and getting my money back, but in the end I decided to keep it. I looked around in the hopes of getting in contact with someone at Criterion. There was an email address for a person, so I decided to get in touch with him. Unfortunately, I've had no response. Many foreign film releases have fallen into this trap of not translating any English spoken dialogue, and there were no options to resolve that. Netflix, Criterion, and others have repeatedly done so, leaving me confused about what is happening plot-wise.\n\n**Unnecessary Censorship**\n\nGoing back to Criterion, I recently watched \"Ed Wood\" on their streaming service, and my wife noticed something odd with their subtitles. With \"Ed Wood\" the subtitles were completely replacing curse words with more family friendly versions. This is one of the more common problems with many streaming services where they will often replace or censor curse words as if all of us deaf people are extremely sensitive to harsh language. I understand that most of these services or releases may have accidentally added the TV versions of the subtitles, and it can happen.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith the ever growing library of physical media and more movies being released through boutique studios becoming a far more major player in this, I understand that they may not have the budget, time, or access to provide subtitles. Sometimes, they just don't think about including such accessibility for them. It has grown increasingly difficult to reach out to these studios and have a direct conversation about what can be done in the future, where I don't feel like I'm wasting my money and dissuade me from future purchases.",

        "content": "My partner suggested we watch it and based on his description of it, I thought I was settling in for a thriller/mystery with a lesbian love story. 30 minutes in I\u2019m rolling with it. 60 minutes in there\u2019s some unsettling moments (the espresso scene, the diner alleyway scene, the dead body in \u201cDiane\u2019s\u201d apartment) where we\u2019re like, \u201cDid I understand what just happened?\u201d and had to rewind. \n\nBy the end I felt like my emotions and trust were violated by David Lynch. The edible peaked right as Rita opened the blue box, and my soul left my body. The last 15-20 minutes was the craziest mindfuck I\u2019ve ever experienced in a movie. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. Is Mulholland Drive even real? Are we real?? I had to stop thinking of Betty and Rita as real people for the longest time. It\u2019s officially one of my favorite movies ever made, hands down. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this makes sense but I just need to get this out there.",
