I think Fallout is widely accepted as the best entry, but I'm sure I'll get arguments.  I honestly feel like Dead Reckoning was the weakest entry and I'm really hoping they finish it off on a stronger note.  A series this good deserves a proper finale.  \n\nI'll provide my rankings:\n\n1. Fallout\n\n2. Mission: Impossible\n\n3. Ghost Protocol\n\n4. Rogue Nation\n\n5. MI III\n\n6. MI 2\n\n7.

        "content": "I love how this movie makes you want to be a better person. For me, I sympathized w almost every character, maybe except Freddie lol because he just doesn't feel warm at all. Having a scene with him and some family or other friends would have fixed this. It makes you sympathize, feel bad for Tom when he becomes such a murderer. It's a crazy piece of art. \n\nTom - I totally understand how he got to where he did. Obviously, I would not make those same decisions, but I can also see his logic. It's fascinating. Is he actually a sociopath? Or did he just get into a big pickle and choose self preservation with his skills? In the beginning, I felt his pain, so much especially with Dickie being so hot and cold. Also, the fact he is so incredibly haunted by his actions, doesn't that mean he is not a sociopath? He feels incredible guilt, clearly. Killing gets easier for him the more he does, and I think it also becomes addictive, the power of it. \n\nI empathized with Dickie too, though yes, he thinks with his dick, is an entitled Peter Pan, and probably a Gemeni at his worst and has anger issues. But the whole time, I did not want him to die either. I didn't think he deserved Marge, and I empathized w her also. She could have heard him speaking about other women figured out he was cheating ... Wasn't that hard to figure out, and left, but despite his issues, she did love him too. \n\nThe movie is amazing how it shows that even entitled rich people are still people who love and feel tore apart by their wrong actions usually (Dickie was clearly upset by his treatment of Sylvana). It's amazing how it shows that people without this can become so enthralled by it that they improperly believe they are \"nobodies\". \n\nI do think Tom's mental state breaks down toward the end since he is still lying to Marge about Dickie even though he is about to kill her. The first kill is a real accident, the second one, necessity and logic, then he clearly thinks about killing Marge, and same with Peter. He still sees it all as necessity. \n\nAs for a logic question, he will not be able to continue a relationship with Meredith right because it would eventually come out that he cannot use the Greenleaf identity anymore. \n\nI could say so much more, about how Greenleaf father was so quick to believe something so awful because it is more logical than someone stealing his son's identity.
