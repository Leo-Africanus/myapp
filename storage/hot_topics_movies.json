Even though the movie uses identical portions of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, this integral version omits cliffhangers and introduces alternate angles and additional anime footage. As a result, it alters the tone and experience of the original theatrical cuts. After all, the director intended to release the film as one part--a complete, unrated, epic version of Kill Bill.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 100% (9 reviews)\n\nIMDb score: 8.7/10\n\nDirected by: Quentin Tarantino\n",

If you have, then you probably can't resist revisiting this world again either\n\nIt's not the best plotted film. But the atmosphere, world building, and acting is unparalleled by any other scifi film.",

        "content": "Rewatching the first as me and the partner watch the original series before this after a long time. It made me remember how awful the second movie was, where this couple, representing two very different types of people fall in love. It\u2019s cute but tragic as Kowalski is still a regular human in a magical world of secrecy. So they &gt;!obliviate!&lt; all muggles including him. Queenie falls in love, and *cannot get over* her memory-wiped partner. She is already marginalized by wizard kind as a mind reader yet becomes &gt;!Wizard fascism sympathizer/actor at the end of the sequel.!&lt; While the first movie is downright charming, it is indicative of a different time, when JK Rowling was more revered, people accepted her goofy brand and the Wizardint world was fun. By expanding the movie into its confounding film franchise, it\u2019s amazing a third got made at all (which I\u2019ve probably seen but forget the details).\n\nThey\u2019re only rebooting her Harry Potter series because CB Strike is too adult and not marketable enough. Ugh.",

        "content": "What I mean is: in a lot of recent movies, characters say things out loud that older films would\u2019ve shown indirectly.\n\nInstead of letting the camera linger on a look, a gesture, or a quiet moment, the script often spells out exactly what a character is thinking or feeling.\n\nIt\u2019s like modern films are afraid the audience might \u2018miss\u2019 something, so they explain motivations, backstories, emotional states, and plot developments very directly.\n\nBut when I watch older movies, there\u2019s often more silence, more visual storytelling, and more trust that viewers will pick up on subtle cues.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just a shift in style, or maybe audiences have changed too.\nI\u2019m curious how others feel?\nDo you prefer movies that guide you clearly, or movies that expect you to interpret things yourself?",
