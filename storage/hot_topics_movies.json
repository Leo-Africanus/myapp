I've watched trailers for the past 40 years and I can assure you trailers today are guilty of spoiling the movie or worse, doing the entire movie's arc through a truncated version in the trailers. \n\nAnd it's like, trailers can attract an audience attention by not showing much but showing enough to grab one's attention. Go see the trailer of \"Little Children\", we only know enough but it makes you interested in the movie. \n\nIf I see a trailer that tells me the whole story of the movie, I'm not going to go see it. Why would I? The marketing team has practically told the entire story for me. Go watch the trailer for \"Ricki and the Flash\". I didn't bother paying a red cent for it after they spoiled the whole movie on the whole trailer. I like to be surprised (even with the more conventional, standard movie). \n\nImagine if they spoiled the twist of The Sixth Sense on the first trailer for it? It would have RUINED the movie. But this seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days because the Talent lacks the creative means to do engaging trailers for the public. Zero idea on how editing works.",

        "title": "'The Electric State' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_electric_state): 29% (from 29 reviews) with 3.60 average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-electric-state/): 30/100 (9 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take full ownership of their boys-with-toys mojo in this slick but dismally soulless odyssey across the American Southwest in a retro-futuristic alternate version of the 1990s. Following Cherry and The Gray Man, the brothers continue their post-Avengers streak of grinding out content for streaming platforms, amassing big budgets and marquee-name stars for quick-consumption movies destined to leave zero cultural footprint.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-russo-brothers-netflix-1236157136/)\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is emotionally incoherent because the moral of its story is contradicted by the emphasis of its telling. It\u2019s no wonder the filmmakers appear to side with their villain. As Skate puts it: \u201cOur world is a tire fire floating in an ocean of piss.\u201d Despite all of the clout and capital at their disposal, the Russo brothers can think of nothing better to do than stick our faces in it.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-electric-state-netflix-movie-review-1235101527/): D\u2013\n\n&gt; There\u2019s no rule that says book-based films shouldn\u2019t diverge from what\u2019s on the page. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d and Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cStarship Troopers\u201d certainly did, and those stories found their audiences in both mediums. In this case, however, the filmmakers have diluted the source material, showing a clear lack of interest in making their creation just as haunting, searing and satisfying as the original product.\n\n-[Courtney Howard, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-electric-state-review-1236330760/)\n\n&gt; I\u2019m not surprised that Netflix and the Russos want to tell a story about how humans and machines can live together in peace, but I struggled to find much humanity in a picture so gleefully soulless.\n\n-[Matt Goldberg, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/)\n\n&gt; There is a gallery of wacky individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing some undemanding work for voice-artists including Brian Cox, Woody Harrelson, Alan Tudyk and Colman Domingo. But there\u2019s no soul, no originality, just a great big multicolour wedge of digital content.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-simon-stalenhag): 2/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State is somehow both punishingly obvious and completely incoherent. Ultimately, however, the only real point is that pop culture should be revered as humanity\u2019s prime sustenance. Cosmo is based on a children\u2019s cartoon that\u2019s presented as the only real emotional bond between Michelle and her brother; the surrounding landscape is nothing but malls and fairgrounds, temples to consumerism where characters practically salivate while listing off menus items from Panda Express; and there\u2019s a searingly earnest piano cover of \u201cWonderwall\u201d at the end. The Electric State isn\u2019t about dystopia. It\u2019s the dystopia itself.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-electric-state-review-netflix-b2710157.html): 1/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State loses some of the quiet profundity of the original text, but as a breezily watchable retrofuturistic jolly, it has just enough juice.\n\n-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-electric-state/): 3/5\n\n&gt; Throughout, the film essentially functions as a plea to its viewers to put technology aside and embrace the power of human connection. It's a noble message \u2013 and one which most audiences members will surely be able to emphasise with \u2013 but in truth it feels hollow coming from a work that seems so clearly to have been made with the Netflix algorithm firmly in mind.\n\n-[Patrick Cremona, Radio Times](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/scifi/the-electric-state-review/): 2/5\n\n&gt; Should we expect more from a Netflix movie by now? Probably. But The Electric State is indicative of too many blockbuster offerings from the streaming service that do just enough to get you to watch, but are rarely good enough to be memorable.\n\n-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a64069135/the-electric-state-review-netflix/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nIn a retro-futuristic past, orphaned teenager Michelle traverses the American West with an eccentric drifter and a sweet but mysterious robot in search of her younger brother.\n\n**DIRECTORS** \n\nAnthony &amp; Joe Russo\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nChristopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely (based on the novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nStephen F.

Many people didn\u2019t thou and couldn\u2019t make it through them.  I saw Midsomer in theater and people were literally laughing coming out of the theater and asking strangers wtf did we just watch?  ",

The contrast between beauty and despair seems to reflect a deeper commentary on life itself: even in the midst of chaos or impending doom, there can be moments of grace, vulnerability, and even hope. \n\nI would love to hear your film recommendations - especially classics.

As soon as he does, he freezes in place and suddenly black leeches, slugs, or larvae start coming out of his eyes and body, devouring him alive. Later in the movie, a worker investigating the hole suffers the same fate.\n\nI watched it as a kid and maybe some details are different :(\n\nDoes anyone know what movie this is?

        "content": "I love Ennio Morricone. His music is so powerfully moving, melodic, moving. He's one of the very few film composers whose music can elevate a movie. It often became the focal point of the films it scored as I can't imagine the scenes being separate from the score he produced. \n\nOne thing I found unfortunate about a lot of film composing today is that music seems more subtle, more restrained, shyer of touching those emotional crescendos. \n\nThe last movie I saw which had a film score that was unapologetic emotional was Gabriel Yared's music for The Life Ahead but that came from the old generation. I worry about the new film composers. \n\nWhat do you think? Are there any film composers that give you the same feels as Ennio Morricone's music did?",

        "content": "At the end of the film, it is shown that Kim goes hiding into the  bunker. But I have some questions regarding this. \n\n1. Given that two murders took place in the mansion, it can be assumed that there was a proper investigation of the whole incident. So, how come the police didn't find out the bunker? The basement was full of Kevin's blood, so it is very possible that a blood trail can be found up to the basement. It shouldn't be very hard for the police to find out about the bunker. But they never do. \n\n2. At the end, it is shown that kevin and his mom are convicted of fraud and placed on probation. As they were convected, they must have been interrogated by the police. Up to that point, they didn't know that Kim hid in the bunker. So, they didn't have any reason to hide the actual things that happened on that night. Then, how come the police didn't find out about the bunker? \n\n3. A possible explanation can be a scene shown after Kevin wakes up. He sees a very young police officer asking him some questions who doesn't look like a police officer. So this scene may mean that the investigation was not handled properly by the police. But, I don't see in any way that given the blood trail up to basement and possibility of interrogation of two convicted criminals (Kevin and his mom), the police were unable to know about the existence of a bunker in the house.\n\nCan someone explain this? \n\nTL;DR: How come the police didn't find out about the bunker at the end of 'Parasite'?
