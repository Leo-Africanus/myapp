        "content": "Hey\u00a0[r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/)! We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.\n\nSynopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father\u2019s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.\n\nTrailer:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M)\n\nWatch on MUBI:\u00a0[https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024)\n\nAsk us anything!

        "content": "X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). \n\nIs there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? \n\nEdit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense \u2014 but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman\u2019s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don\u2019t discount it. ",

        "content": "I decided to jump into Richard Linklater's well-regarded Before trilogy as I recently finished the Normal People series and have been in the mood for melancholy romantic stories. Before Sunrise was really, really good - charming, romantic and captured that exuberance of doe-eyed youthful passion so well.\n\nBut Before Sunset, man, it's just on another level. Maybe it's because I'm the same age as the characters now, in my 30s and married and with some life experience but it felt so resonant. Jesse and Celine have grown and changed over the past decade - they're more jaded and cynical, and not the hopeless romantics they used to be. But this growth is what lends so much more depth and complexity in both personalities and the current state of their relationship, and how much that one night steered the course of their lives in the ensuing years.\n\nAs with Sunrise, the dialogue is really the star here and it's even better than before. Whereas in Sunrise, Jesse and Celine's conversations leaned more towards more fun and youthful and often idealistic, sometimes pseudo-intellectual (makes sense given their age), here they're tinged with a melancholy and occasional bitterness that can only be brought on by experiencing more of life. In Vienna, Jesse and Celine talked about art and love and literature and all these grand, human-condition concepts. Here, they talk about global warming, crime and broken romances. It's actually crazy just how well the script captures just how I've myself been feeling in my 30s.\n\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy's chemistry is as amazing as ever, and really sell the whole concept and premise.\n\nAnd that ending? Absolutely perfect. Jesse knows he's going to stay. He's probably known it all along.\n\nCan't wait to finish off the trilogy with Midnight",

If a young actor is cast to play the earlier version of an older actor (say in a coming-of-age story) do you personally feel that they need to physically resemble each other for it to feel believable?\n\nOr are things like energy, voice, and performance enough for you to buy into the transition?",

Ya  know, in the past, my favorite movie use to be \"HOLES,\" Where the kid named Stanley Yelnats gets sent to Camp Green Lake for stealing a pair of sneakers. THAT use to be my favorite movie! NOW It's \"National Lampoon's Vacation!!!\" It all started with my research on the old vibrating beds. As you know, in this movie, Clark puts a quarter into the coin box on the bed, and the bed goes rogue, vibrating like crazy, and Rusty and Audrey come into the room and they're like, \"We thought you were fighting.\" And it was the bed. \n\n  \n   Here's the thing. That's the whole entire reason I BOUGHT that movie last May, but I've fallen in love with the whole dang movie. I watch it EVERY SINGLE DAY!! Has anyone read the little story behind this movie? The story is called \"Vacation 58,\" and IT IS HILARIOUS!! If you read it as many times as I have, you'll get what I'm talking about!",
