But like, there's already plant life on the planet, &amp; humans share something like 50% of our genes (much less of our total DNA content) with plants, due to gene conservation. So were the Engineers speeding things up, like \"hey, let's skip to fish\"? If so, that would presuppose that the genes we share in common with plants &amp; other non-animal life are actually conserved across the galaxy, which would be pretty cool. But of course the movie doesn't get into any of that, &amp; eventually forgets how cartographers &amp; biologists work, or that you should run in a 90-degree angle when a giant donut is rolling toward you. Is there any \"expanded universe\" content that explained this better than the movie did (or didn't)?",

        "content": "For me, Kirikou and the Wild Beasts is one of the most iconic animated films in France, directed by Michel Ocelot, who has made several Kirikou films and many other magnificent animated films. If you ask anyone in France if they have heard of the Kirikou cartoon, it is very unlikely that they will say no. I remember seeing it when I was little, and a few years later I realised how visually stunning it is, one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen to date. The details of the leaves, tree trunks and sand are so well crafted, and the colours are vivid, bright, brilliant and beautiful, reflecting a sense of harmony. I would be thrilled if director Michel Ocelot were to release a 4K re-release. And you guys, what is the animated film, or non-animated film, with the visuals that have most impressed and blown you away, and why?",
