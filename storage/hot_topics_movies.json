I always thought the premise, the ending, the entire plot could have made a really fantastic movie. Rumor is that Bruce Willis got all \"Hollywood\" and messed a lot of it up, but I think his casting was good. This movie could have been really great. It's still...entertaining, I guess. But I always feel a little sad about what it could have been.",

        "content": "For me, it\u2019s Ryan Reynolds, many people think he\u2019s bad and plays the same character over and over again, and I definitely agree that he\u2019s typecasted.\n\nBut in my opinion, he\u2019s genuinely a really good actor, his performance in Buried (2010) was fantastic and honestly worthy of an Oscar nomination. It was such a realistic performance and it would be exactly how I would be acting if I was stuck in that situation.",

        "content": "Recently watched Silent Hill 2006. Once things get rolling in the ending that organ really elevates it to another level. It quickly brought to mind the organ sting at the end of Pirates: Dead Man\u2019s Chest when the kraken starts decimating the ship. Another super powerful moment is the Phantom of the Opera Overture. \n\nBasically imo the organ is one of the most powerful stand alone instruments we have, yet it feels criminally under utilized today. \n\nSo I ask all you movie buffs. What\u2019s your favorite use of organ music in a movie?",
