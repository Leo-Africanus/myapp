        "title": "I finally got around to watching Oldboy - and it was not the kind of movie I was expecting",
        "content": "It can sometimes be a little difficult these days to appreciate well-regarded classic cinema with truly fresh eyes and perspectives. Even if you haven't seen a particularly acclaimed movie, the prevalence of Reddit movie subs, YouTube move discussion channels and the popularity of Letterboxd means that you will almost inevitably absorb a lot of information on a popular classic just by osmosis. I think Oldboy definitely falls into this category of movies, where its towering reputation and sheer quantity of discourse in online film circles creates an almost outsized sense of expectation before you even start watching it. \n\nWhat I knew about Oldboy from said reputation was the following: dark, brutal, badass, iconic hallway fight scene, crazy twist and generally adored by young filmbro cinephiles. Going in, I kept my expectations in check as I thought I would probably get a dark, well-made revenge thriller and maybe not much more. \n\nBoy oh boy, was I ever wrong. I waited a bit to post my thoughts because after finishing the movie last night, I needed some time to process it, especially after those final 30 minutes.\n\nFar from being \"just\" a revenge thriller, Oldboy actually turned out to be a grand human tragedy, a dark and bleak narrative of entwined fate and cycles of love-hate-love.\n\nWhat stood out to me first and foremost is just how offbeat the whole atmosphere of it feels. Like it almost takes place in an off-kilter world just a bit removed from our own. The dark and moody visuals, with some truly inventive cinematography and shot composition, add to the overall atmosphere. The now-classic hallway fight scene is still amazing, and years of other media ripping it off hasn't really hurt it even a little bit. \n\nThe story is fantastic, and where I was impressed the most. I kinda had the impression that the narrative would be really about Oh Dae-Su finding the people that imprisoned him and getting bloody revenge, but it's truly compelling in the way it keeps adding new wrinkles to the plot and then finally pulling the rug out from under you in the final act. In fact, up until the 3rd act, the movie was more along the lines of good-to-great to me. It really gets elevated to another level though when you find out the truth.\n\nAnd man this was some dark, sick shit lol, just operatic and grandiose in its sheer twistedness. The discovery that this is all &gt;!actually Lee Woo-jin's revenge!&lt;, and not Oh Dae-Su's, and the sheer scope and extent of it, is breathtaking. A minor, careless sin committed by a clueless young boy that spiralled into a toxic ball of death and hate, consuming multiple lives into itself. It's rare that a movie will make me go \"holy shit\" these days, but Oldboy really managed it. It's not even the fact that &gt;!Oh Dae-Su was made to commit incest with his daughter!&lt;, but more everything that led to it. \n\nThere is no catharsis here. No satisfaction from a well-planned and executed plot of righteous vengeance. It just leaves you feeling dirty and emotionally drained. \n\nLee Woo-jin was just foreshadowing his own death in the end - revenge will heal you for a bit but the pain will never go away. You can cry and beg and self-mutilate all you want. The man walks away and the Monster remains. And Oldboy lives up to all of its hype. ",

        "title": "What's that one movie(s) you watched as a young or preteen on TV in the early hours of the morning that was VERY clearly too gory or mature for your little virgin eyes?",
        "content": "I have a few, must have been between the age of 10-13 and I had an old analogue TV in my room; this must have been back in 2008-2010. I remember watching predator, but it was more epic and cool to a young boy than gory. I think I watched predator 2 too, which I distinctly remember being quite mature. \n\nAs horror movies go; I remember watching 'thirteen ghosts'. No idea what was happening and I remember hiding under my sheets most of the time but I didn't want to stop. \n\nMy mum used to watch the saw movies on TV and while I never actively watched them, I would just casually pay vague attention in the corner of my eye while I was on my DS or something. \n\nDonnie darko was a BIG one that stuck with me. I had no idea what was happening (and to this day I haven't seen it properly as an adult). I just remember forcefields, someone saying they like someone's boobs, pills, a knife, a cinema, weird water orbs coming out of people's chest, and getting jumpscared by a rabbit costume that was more creepy than scary. I was captivated though and couldn't take my eyes off it, even if I don't remember much. \n\nAnother one I had NO idea what was happening (a common theme) but there was a guy on a sail boat watching a girl rub an ice cube on her body. I was too young to understand the sexualisation of it but it was definitely just before the puberty hormones hit. To this day it sticks in my mind but I have no idea what movie it was. \n\nThe cube 1997, that was disturbing but I didn't watch much. Saw 2 too, I remember the needles scene. \n\nDreamcatcher; this is an interesting one. I was on the computer in my parents bedroom and it was the weekend so my dad had gone fishing. Mum was lying on the bed with my brother who must have been 5 or 6 at the time, and put the TV on for an appropriate pre-watershed (9pm) movie. I thought \"cool, I can play games as long as I want!\". It got to like 1am and various movies came and went, and I turned around to face the TV and dreamcatcher was on, so I watched it. All I remember is aliens and worm things that crawl up your bum from the toilet (I didn't want to sit on the toilet for a week). Mum woke up, saw what was on the TV, and blamed me thinking I put it on and was up way past my bed time. I didn't even touch the remote. I used to confuse this movie with \"slither\" until I figured out the differences.\n\n\"The thing\", the original 1982. That was wild, but I don't have anything to say. I think it was SO disturbing that my undeveloped brain couldn't identify what was so disturbing about it. It was just a mix of abstract non-gory flesh for me. It's interesting how me as a kid wasn't afraid or disgusted by it, but myself as an adult is. I honestly cannot watch that movie because of the body horror. \n\nFinal fantasy: spirits within. I still need to watch this as an adult, I just remember it being sci fi on an alien planet with big dragon alien things or alien ghosts. I have no idea. Was I scared? I think so. I don't even know if it was a horror movie but It felt like it. \n\nFinal destination, I don't remember much. Something about a fence wire cutting someone up, a man with a hook in a shadow, someone getting decapitated with an elevator, and a BBQ exploding. \n\nVan helsing and hell boy; but they are both fairly comical by today's standards so I remember enjoying them and they weren't disturbing at all. It was a \"hell yeah\" vibe. \n\nChucky was weird. But that's it. All I remember is it being weird. It never scared me. \n\nThe blade movies. Gory, but in a fun way. I'll also add the \"underworld\" movies in this category since it's vampires Vs werewolves. Don't remember anything about them though. \n\nFlight plan. All I remember is a little girl missing and it being more of a drama/thriller, but I think I got bored and turned it off. I've been meaning to watch it though as an adult.\n\nThe island. I remember quite a bit from this because I think I saw it a few times. Ewan McGregor was familiar because I'd seen him play obi wan in the star wars prequels, so that's probably why I paid attention because it \"had obi wan in it\". I know it's about clones, organ harvesting, the island &gt;!doesn't exist!&lt; , Michael Clarke Duncan crawling on the floor covered in blood being dragged away or something, they escape to the real world; I don't remember much else. I remember it being good though. \n\nPan's Labyrinth. This was a SUPER weird one to be watching at 1am as a kid, but at least I could read subtitles because it's in Spanish. It's what started my adoration for practical effects in movies and specifically Guillermo del Toro. It was familiar because of hell boy, that I liked. \n\nHollow man, 2000. This was definitely a weird one but I don't remember much, just the mirror scene and him being a pervert. \n\n30 days of night. All I remember is vampires and blood. \n\nAVP1, AVP2, and all the Alien movies. I remember watching them as a kid because my dad had the alien box set, the one with the green plastic. I watched all of them. Had no idea what was happening but it was satisfyingly scary. I was expecting my dad to say no because it might be too mature, but he just asked if I was sure if I wanted to watch them and I said yes. In retrospect as an adult, I understand why he wasn't that bothered because they're quite tame by today's standards.\n\nDog soldiers. Werewolves. Blood. Simple. I think that was one my mum put on again and I just watched in the corner of my eye in the living room on my DS. \n\nI think this phase stopped around 2009/2010, but it's something I just randomly became nostalgic for. That feeling as a kid watching and discovering something you feel you're not supposed to, just the thrill of watching something scary or disturbing at 1am on the TV. It's a feeling I'll never have again and if I didn't make this post, I'm afraid I might forget those formative memories and the nostalgia. \n\nSorry it's a long post, if you made it this far thank you for reading. I just wanted to project my nostalgia into the universe and share it with anyone who was interested and had a similar experience growing up. :)",

Lord of the Rings, The Northman, Dune (for me at least)\n\nEven if it takes time and a bit of research to fully process and understand the world the movie transports you to, you feel invited and welcome to explore the world.
