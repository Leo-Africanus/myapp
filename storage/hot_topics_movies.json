        "content": "This discussion is based on a recent viewing of The Flintstones Movie, a film that despite everts review of as a hallmark of my childhood and easily understood. \n\nThis might be in my mind the most underrated adaptation of a cartoon right next to Speed Racer. If you google it you find it holds a 5/10 IMDb rating, a 2.5/4 star Ebert review and a 23% rotten tomato score. \n\nFirst of all this might be the best casting I\u2019ve seen in any adaptation ever. The writing is so on point it feels like a perfect blend of nineties satire and 50s humor. The star of the show is the effects, costume and set design. \n\nEbert says in his 2.5 star review: \u201cThis is a great-looking movie, a triumph of set design and special effects, creating a fantasy world halfway between suburbia and a prehistoric cartoon. The frame is filled with delightful and inventive notions, all based on the idea that modern America might somehow be reconstructed out of rocks. Just watching it is fun.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \n\n\u201cStill, there is a lot to praise here. The best way to describe the look of this movie is to say that the physical world of the cartoon series and the comic strip has been translated to live action with no compromise. The cars that run on foot-power, for example, look as clunky and heavy as in the original drawings, but somehow plausible, too (and there\u2019s a great early scene where the Flintstones motor out to the drive-in to see a movie \u201cTar Wars,\u201d of course). All sorts of consumer products and office equipment and supplies are reproduced in stone, and the costumes are a combo of caveman chic and suburban ready-to-wear. On the heels of \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d it\u2019s also fun to see a variety of prehistoric dinosaurs.\u201d\n\nAnd yet we lived in an era where these great achievements weren\u2019t enough to be a great film, but going back today with the vision of hindsight it does. \n\nIt\u2019s a magical film that captures the imagination purely through world building.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Overrated? Underrated? ",

        "title": "'28 Years Later' - Review Thread",
        "content": "Director: Danny Boyle\n\nCast: Jodie Comer; Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Ralph Fiennes; Alfie Williams\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/28_years_later)\n\n**Metacritic:** [82/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/28-years-later/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Manila Bulletin - Philip Cu Unjieng](https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/the-28-legacy-continues-a-review-of-28-years-later)\n\n&gt;What\u2019s nice to note is how Boyle has cast consummate actors in this film, the type who could read off a label of canned sardines and still find depth, emotion, and spark in the delivery of those lines. Initially, it seems that Taylor-Johnson will be doing the heavy lifting. Still, it merely misleads us, as the narrative then focuses on Jodie Comer\u2019s Isla and onto Fiennes\u2019 Dr. Kelson. I want to give a special shout-out to the young actor Alfie Williams. He is the one carrying the whole film, and this is his first feature film work, having previously done a TV series. Boyle teases out an excellent performance from the lad, and I won\u2019t be surprised if many film reviewers in the forthcoming week will single him out as being the best thing in this film. And what\u2019s impressive is how he manages this with the three heavyweight thespians who are on board.There\u2019s the horror and the suspense as a given for this cult franchise, but look out for the human drama and the emotional impact. It\u2019s Boyle and Garland elevating the film, and rising above its genre.\n\n[AwardsWatch - Erik Anderson](https://awardswatch.com/28-years-later-review-danny-boyles-iphone-shot-zombie-sequel-is-audacious-disjointed-and-bewildering-b/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;Most of the time, *28 Years Later* is frequently begging to be rejected by general audiences, even as it courts the admiration of longtime fans, who may nonetheless find themselves put off by the film\u2019s turn toward unearned emotion, its relatively meager expansion of this universe, and its occasionally jarring tonal shifts. (The abrupt sequel-teasing stinger feels like it\u2019s from an entirely different strain of the zombie subgenre.) Much like the virus at the series\u2019 center, it\u2019s a film whose DNA is constantly mutating, resulting in an inconceivable host subject\u2014one that is both corrosive and something of a marvel.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/06/28-years-later-review-danny-boyle-jodie-comer-zombie-horror-1236436839/)\n\n&gt;Most threequels tend to go bigger, but *28 Years Later* bucks that trend by going smaller, eventually becoming a chamber piece about a boy trying to hold onto his mother. It still delivers shocks, even if the sometimes over-zealous editing distracts from Anthony Dod Mantle\u2019s painterly cinematography\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/28-years-later-review-jodie-comer-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236294541/)\n\n&gt;One of the chief rewards of *28 Years Later* is that it never feels like a cynical attempt to revisit proven material merely for commercial reasons. Instead, the filmmakers appear to have returned to a story whose allegorical commentary on today\u2019s grim political landscape seems more relevant than ever. Intriguing narrative building blocks put in place for future installments mean they can\u2019t come fast enough.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Josh Parham](https://nextbestpicture.com/28-years-later/) \\- 7/10\n\n&gt;Boyle\u2019s exuberant filmmaking and Garland\u2019s incisive script sometimes clash when forced to muddle through laborious exercises that feel borrowed from the previous films anyway. It\u2019s a scenario that reminds me of Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cPrometheus\u201d and \u201cAlien: Covenant,\u201d two films with intriguing ideas that struggled to fashion them within the framework of the established franchise. Perhaps the continuation will find more clever avenues to explore further and enrich this text. As is, what is left is imperfect but still an enthralling return into a dark but provocative world.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/28-years-later-review-1235133645/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;While Boyle isn\u2019t lofty enough to suggest that the infected are beautiful creatures who deserve God\u2019s love or whatever (this is still a movie about wild-eyed naked zombies, after all, and its empathy for them only goes so far), \u201c28 Years Later\u201d effectively uses the tropes of its genre to insist that the line between a tragedy and a statistic is thinner than we think, and more permeable than we realize. The magic of the placenta, indeed.\u00a0\n\n[Rolling Stone - David Fear](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/28-years-later-review-danny-boyle-1235353364/)\n\n&gt;Taken on its own, however, Boyle and Garland\u2019s trip back to this hellscape makes the most of casting a jaundiced, bloodshot eye at our current moment. Their inaugural imagining of a world torn asunder surfed the post-millennial fear that modern society wasn\u2019t equipped to handle something truly catastrophic. This new movie is blessed with the knowledge that something always rises from the ashes, but that the risk of regressing back to some fabricated mythology of a Golden Age, complete with *Henry V* film clips and St. George\u2019s flags, is there on the surface as well. If postapocalyptic entertainment has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the walking dead aren\u2019t always the gravest threat. It\u2019s those who sacrifice their soul and sense of empathy that you have to watch out for.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/28-years-later-review-danny-boyle/)\n\n&gt;For now, though, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d stands on its own \u2014 or at least, as its own temporary capper on this multi-decade series \u2014 and it stands tall. The filmmakers haven\u2019t redefined the zombie genre, but they\u2019ve refocused their own culturally significant riff into a lush, fascinating epic that has way more to say about being human than it does about (re-)killing the dead.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/28-years-later-review-1236435361/)\n\n&gt;Where the original film tapped into society\u2019s collective fear of infection, its decades-later follow-up (which undoes any developments implied by \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d with an opening chyron that explains the Rage virus \u201cwas driven back from continental Europe\u201d) zeroes in on two even most primal anxieties: fear of death and fear of the other. To which you might well ask, aren\u2019t all horror movies about surviving an unknown threat of some kind? Yes, but few have assumed the psychic toll taken by such violence quite so effectively as \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d which has been conceived as the start of a new trilogy, but towers on its own merits (part two, subtitled \u201cThe Bone Temple,\u201d is already in the can and expected next January).",

The rodent is believed to have survived, but **that didn\u2019t stop groups like charity The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) from taking steps to have the scene removed 36 years ago.**\n\n&gt;The scene was **subsequently cut by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) under the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937, which means it must be cut for any theatrical use**. The BBFC **also cut the scene under the Video Recordings Act 1984, meaning it must not be included on releases on formats such as Blu-Ray and DVD. Similarly, the scene should also not be aired on traditional TV in the UK.**\n\n&gt;Despite this, a **version of the film that included the banned scene was added to Disney+ a few months ago in April**. In response, the RSPCA called out what it described **as a \"loophole\" that enabled the banned rat scene to make it onto Disney+ in the UK, pointing out that streaming platforms are not bound by the same standards as film releases in cinema, DVD, or on traditional television.**",

        "content": "Just rewatched this movie alone in silence at home (recommended ). It\u2019s definitely a film that loses a bunch its nuances when watched with others, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t fully absorb their characters with distractions. \n\nI\u2019m so glad that I had knee surgery and got bored enough to rewatch.\n\nColin Ferrall and Hugh Grant in god mode. McConaughey gave the perfect \u201cLion\u201d signature role. Best of all was the unassuming and unique acting chops in Charlie Hunnam. Everyone gave this script their best and it shows \n\nAnyone else have a similar experience with this film?\n\nP.S. yes I know it\u2019s a Guy Richie film but that doesn\u2019t make it automatically a great picture, it\u2019s underrated ",

        "title": "Ghostbusters 2 has always had the \u201cIt\u2019s kid friendlier\u201d label but I always found it WAY more frightening. As a kid Vigo was nightmare fuel. The subway scene? The Bathtub? The slime?",
        "content": "I\u2019m not going to sit here and say the sequel is a better film. It\u2019s awesome, but it\u2019s not overall better. The climax is far too rushed. But I do find it scarier. GB1 has the Dana gets possessed scene. That\u2019s as scary as things get. Ghostbusters 2? Let me introduce you to my boy Vigo The Carpathian. Died at 105 years old. Didn\u2019t die of old age either, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, hung, disembowelled &amp; drawn &amp; quartered. His last words, just before his head died was \u201cDeath is but a door, time but a window, I\u2019ll be back\u201d. Holy crap this guy terrified me as a kid. When he leaves the painting, his snarls, his face? His freaky voice? And that\u2019s all before his final form which is holy shiiiit scary. When his face does that twisty thing? I wonder how they did that before CGI. \n\nThe movie also has a Subway sequence where decapitated heads on pikes appear after Vigo calls out Winston\u2019s name in the dark like a racist ass. Of course he picked Winston. \n\nThen we get the bathtub scene. Oh man. This shit traumatized me. Everytime I saw water running out of a faucet I was convinced mood slime was going to come out and get me.  \n\nMy grandma also had a mink coat and everytime I saw this thing, I poked it wondering if mink heads weren\u2019t going to pop out and bite me. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think the first film has a sequence as intense as the dark room scene when Ray and Egon are looking at pictures of Vigo and his pictures spontaneously combust while Ray and Egon get locked in. We don\u2019t see Egon or Ray ever panicked as much as they are in that sequence.\n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s gotten Ghostbusters right since the second film. All these sequels and reboots, they just don\u2019t have that secret sauce(the cast &amp; Ivan Reitman as director).  \n\nAs a kid, I had no conception Ghostbusters was suppose to be a comedy. I remember seeing it in the comedy section of our local video store and thinking \u201care these people insane? Comedy?\u201d Of course as we grow we began to understand the dry sarcasm and jokes. \n\nBut somewhere, maybe because they don\u2019t smoke or swear as much, the sequel got labeled as more kid friendly and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.",

        "content": "Just caught this movie last week on a flight. I\u2019d heard about the film for the longest time and was quite fond of its title track from A Clockwork Orange. Anyways, Singin\u2019 In The Rain rocked my world. Everything was immaculate and immensely entertaining from performances, script and cinematography.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of musicals at all, but Singin\u2019 In The Rain masterfully knew how to not overstay its welcome with the song and dance bits. Although seeing Gene Kelly, Donald O\u2019Connor and Debbie Reynolds tap dance and choreograph their way around the set was magnetizing. I got the feeling that humans were cut from a different cloth in those days and took the word \u201centertainment\u201d very seriously. \n\nMost surprising was just how hilarious the movie was. Very witty and not a single dull second in its 1hr43min run time. My eyes were glued to the back of the airplane seat. Singin\u2019 In The Rain was as close to movie magic as it gets for me, and I\u2019ve watched too many movies to count. It immediately made it into my top 10. Whether you\u2019re a 4 year old or 84, Singin\u2019 In The Rain will make you smile. ",

        "content": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but by the movie's first heist (the truck robbery), Neil already seemed wealthy enough to buy gear and a nice suit and have a nice apartment (though not much furniture, it looked upper-class). With that kind of wealth it seems easy enough to just sock away in stable investments and live modestly until you can figure out legal ways to make a lot of money (no risk of blood, bars, or concrete anyway).\n\nI don't remember much said about his wealth before or after prison, but it seems if you get busted robbing a lot of money from a heist, you're not gonna keep it if it's found, and could possibly lose anything already owned to pay restitution.\n\nSo, is there anything known about Neil's wealth during the truck heist planning? Is it just leftover from whatever he had and could keep since before prison? Or did he get out and do small jobs to build himself up? I don't know how relevant it even is, but I imagine a big heist is gonna cost a lot of... \"investment\".",
