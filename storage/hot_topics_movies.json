        "content": "I rewatched The Other Guys for the first time since it came out, and I liked it way better than the first time I saw it. In 2010 I was kind of Will Ferrell'd out after being a big fan in the Anchorman era. \"Aim for the bushes\" is an all-timer, Michael Keaton kills it, and I had a blast whenever Ray Stevenson was on screen (RIP). However, the biggest impact for me was the end credits. \n\nSince the main plot point revolves around financial fraud, the credits are a series of infographics displaying the basics about Ponzi schemes, government bailouts, and CEO compensation contrasted to worker salaries. These numbers have only ballooned further in the last decade and a half, as have the societal frustrations. It was a really clear and effective way to get a message about class inequality across at the end of a great action comedy.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't seen it or doesn't remember much about it, it's definitely a solid watch, and it's under 2 hours, which is always appreciated.",

        "content": "I just finished seeing this movie, I remember when it came out two years ago, but for some reason I didn't pay it much heed. I wish I went back to undo it. Oh this movie is incredible. As the title says, I was extremely satisfied with what I got. Culture, magic, myth, violance.\n\n\nAnd it has that usual Robert Eggers weirdness and silliness that everyone loves.\n\n\n\nWhat can I say about the story? A well played out revenge epic. I love how creepy the whole thing feels. Idk why but I felt like things kinda started getting wobbly near the third act. It wasn't bad enough to damper my enjoyment.\n\n\nI love the atmosphere of this movie, really creepy and pagan feeling. I love how the supernatural element is consistant through the movie but really lowkey and eerie. Always just crouched in the background.\n\n\nThe acting was great, the music was great, the cinematography was artistic af. I loved the shooting location, the long shot scenes are so good.\n\n\nThis was totally Shakespearean right? I realized the guy is called Hamlet and he meets three witches that tell him his fate.\n\n\nThe moment that cemented my opinion and the climax of the movie for me was definitely the &gt;!Valkyrie escape dream!&lt;. What an incredible visual.\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of things in this story reminded me of Berserk. The whole revenge plot, the savegry, the creepy magic, the protagonists journey etc.",

        "title": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is an apocalyptic film just as much as it is horror.",
        "content": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, aside from the obvious slasher/exploitation flick, a film about the decay of society and the breakdown of systems.\n\nListen to the radio news broadcasts: Grave-robbing, murder, cholera epidemic, city wide fires, suicide, building collapses, oil reserves burning, and heat waves with no end in sight.\n\nNotice how *nothing* goes right or according to plan.\n\nSally wants to check on a relatives grave, only to be led off by a stranger. Franklin cannot take a piss without getting hurt. They pick up a hitchhiker, he\u2019s bad news. They want to go see the old family house, it\u2019s condemned. They want to go swimming, the swim hole dried up. They want gas, there isn\u2019t any. Franklin and Sally want to drive away, the keys are gone because Jerry took them. The Sawyers need food, it\u2019s scarce so they resort to cannibalism. The Sawyers dinner doesn\u2019t go over well, etc.\n\nSystems are breaking down. \n\nThe authorities are incompetent, linking the grave robbing to an organized crime ring on the west coast - according to the radio broadcasts.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest most important system which is shown breaking down, the family unit.\n\nThe Hardesty\u2019s are a dysfunctional family. Sally is annoyed with and burdened by her invalid brother. \n\nMirroring that dysfunction is the Sawyer family. Composed of three brothers and a centarian grandfather. Wrought with abuse, mental illness, and poverty.\n\nNo semblance of a nuclear family. \n\nYou see, art is, always has been, and always will be reflective of the times it was produced in. TCM was created at the height of Vietnam, the first energy crisis, Watergate recently happened so distrust in authority was at an all time high, and the youth of the 60\u2019s witnessed their decade end with the Manson Murders. Which terrified a nation and arguably robbed a generation of its innocence way too early.\n\nThe fears of a terrified nation, the sense of doom and hopelessness, bleeds through this film.\n\nIt\u2019s arguably the quintessential apocalyptic film.",

        "content": "I think the cinema is sacred. Some of my best memories have been based around a theatre. I used to work at a theatre in High School and it was some of the best times of my life. There were so many good times back then, which lead me to thinking: What\u2019s the most unforgettable experience you\u2019ve ever had at the movies?\n\nFor me, it was the opening night of The Avengers with my closest friends. The theater was completely packed, and the energy in the room was unreal. People were cheering, clapping, and reacting to every big moment like we were at a live event. It wasn\u2019t just about watching a movie, it was about sharing an experience with an entire crowd of people who were just as hyped as we were to see the culmination of the first phase of the MCU.\n\nThat\u2019s what I love about the theater experience. There\u2019s something special about seeing a movie with a group of strangers who are all there for the same reason. Midnight premieres, surprise audience reactions, that moment when you realize you\u2019re watching something truly great, those are the memories that stick with you.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories from people who were there for The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and were able to experience the biggest twist in Cinema History firsthand. I've heard others talk about theaters full of people running out of the theater for The Exorcist. Some of my best experiences have been at the cinema, First dates, nights with the homies, and catching a movie on a hot day to cool off. For me, I live for the summer movie season where there's a new blockbuster every week. I love being hyped up for a film and then being able to see it with a packed audience.\n\nSo, what\u2019s yours? What movie experience will you never forget?\n\nEDIT: Grammar",

        "content": "Both Kingsman and MIB\u2019s first film brings in new blood, and we have a seasoned veteran getting out of the way so the newer generation can take the next steps forward.\n\n\u2026and then in the sequel, they decide to sideline the new guy, and bring back the old one as the lead, let alone just disassemble so much of what was set up already.\n\nI feel there are other films that pull this in their sequels. Can anyone name any others?",

I'm glad I decided to give it a try. As someone who liked but could never bring myself to buy a single Star Wars DVD, a Blade-Runner DVD, or a Back To The Future DVD, this movie felt like everything I was looking for in those films. The only movie I can think of that I own close to it is the first Matrix movie, and Terminator 2 which I could barely even bring myself to buy as well. I was surprised to have liked it more than Terminator 2, given all the praise that one gets, and I expected it to be similar to Terminator 2, which prevented me from wanting to watch it, but it turns out it being not too similar to Terminator 2 is what made me like it so much.",

I think it\u2019s super underrated, I love dark comedies and I think this film is absolutely hilarious, directed by Oliver Stone, great performance by Sean Penn, probably one of my favorite Sean Penn films, and it has a great cast including Nick Nolte, Jennifer Lopez, Joaquin Phoenix, and Billy Bob Thornton! If you like dark comedies and/or weird films, definitely check U Turn out!",

I thought it had great potential for a franchise. I'm not sure of any details that may have derailed any sequels. It may be too late for a sequel at this point. It's a good movie to put on if the kids are around or to just watch for myself. I grew up with the TV show, but too young to remember much. I think this was part of the slew of movies from TV shows, but it stuck out. Did I mention the cast? They just had great chemistry. One of my favorite movies overall. ",
