        "title": "I rewatched Am\u00e9lie after 20 years. It\u2019s still one of my very favorite films, which surprised me when I realized how \u201ctell don\u2019t show\u201d it is.",
        "content": "Am\u00e9lie has got to be one of the most accessible foreign films out there to an English speaking audience. I was around 13 when it released, and my experience watching it wasn\u2019t all that different seeing it again at 37. People even show it to young children and they get it, too (despite puritanical ratings boards getting their knickers in a twist about the comedic and rather brief sex scenes).\n\nWhat really leapt out at me this time was something that I guess can only come with 20+ years of film literacy since my first watch: that the film takes *every* opportunity it can to be as crystal clear as possible about what is going on, to the point that it becomes \u201ctell not show\u201d at a baseline level. Or at least, \u201ctell AND show.\u201d\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet has his actors speak from the heart (while they emote so bombastically and delightfully you could understand their mental state from watching this on a vaseline-smeared TV set), and any time Am\u00e9lie has a big moment of change, a narrator is there to guide us through an exact breakdown of her thoughts and beliefs. Many important characters get an entire origin story told to us and a quick bullet point list read off about how they think. There are amazing visuals and stagings and editing and all of it is very clever language of its own, but it is all so on the nose and makes for what\u2019s probably the least challenging \u201cgreat movie\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. And I love that it succeeds so thoroughly in spite of that\u2026 or perhaps, more interestingly, because of it.\n\nPart of me has been almost conditioned by challenging cinema and video essays that demand a viewer pay close attention and do a lot of mental work to fully enjoy cinema, and there sometimes seems to be this belief going around in film circles that anything that doesn\u2019t require deep thought is somehow a lesser form of art\u2026 but here is Am\u00e9lie, cheerfully and lovingly doing the opposite, bringing viewers to happy tears whether they\u2019re analyzing it or not. And I love it for it. Especially now. I needed that escape yesterday.\n\nAnd I want to remind others that yes, there is a ticket to happiness that you can have too, and it exists in the form of a doe-eyed lead on a quirky green DVD box (or I guess, stream it too) and it doesn\u2019t require you to be at your most tip-top shape as a viewer to just deeply connect to it on a soul level.\n\nMagnifique.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*Edit: some have pointed out that Am\u00e9lie is very tell **AND** show and I have to agree with that. Telling without showing would actually mean having things like empty backstory and inauthentic dialogue that gives unnecessary and unbelievable exposition dumps, and conveying information in a way that actively makes the emotional viewing experience worse. So the film deftly sidesteps all those common pitfalls in its rulebreaking.*",

        "content": "First things first, I am ***MAD*** that no one in my life had told me to watch this movie. I spent some time on HBO Max looking for something to watch this evening and this was on the home page. Obviously I had heard about the movie, but literally all I knew was that it starred Pacino as a bank robber, had the \u201cAttica! Attica!\u201d quote, and it is one of the 5 John Cazale films. \n\nThat is literally all I had before I found myself completely captivated by the script and acting. It had several comedic moments, so I found myself laughing between scenes of varying intensity. I\u2019m not sure what I found funniest, but it might have been Sal thinking Wyoming was a country.\n\nPacino truly gave a masterclass in \u2018How to Act\u2019 in this film. Cazale\u2026 he told so much from just his eyes. And in an unintentional moment of heartbreak for me, his line about not smoking due to not wanting to \u2018get the cancer\u2019 hit me really got in the gut. If it wasn\u2019t for his cancer, we absolutely would have seen him continue to star in great films and be on \u2018Best of\u2019 lists. I only knew Chris Sarandon from \u2018The Princess Bride\u2019 and \u2018The Nightmare Before Christmas\u2019, and this performance was incredibly ahead of its time.\n\nI was not expecting the cultural relevancy that this film has on current events. I know this was a random watch for me, but it felt incredibly timely.",

Love Mad Max as well- great performance considering the lack of speaking.\nI\u2019m not a fan of  the Venom movies themselves, but it\u2019s sort of a fun change to see him be goofy and play a less serious role.\n",

        "content": "Just had a conversation with my wife, and we asked ourselves what was the last movie that made us go, \u201cwow, that was really good\u201d?\n\nFor context, we\u2019re millennials who grew up on 90s, 2000s, and 2010s/2020s films. We were just watching the Hans Zimmer concert DVD, and when they played themes from Batman, Inception, Interstellar, and some of his other classics, those brought back some great memories. But in the last five years, we honestly can\u2019t think of many films that gave us that same \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\nThe only recent one that really stood out was Top gun 2. Outside of that, nothing else really comes to mind.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have movies actually declined in quality, or are we just getting older and harder to impress?",

        "content": "Recently tried rewatching some childhood favorites and was shocked how terrible they seemed as an adult. Either my taste has completely evolved over the years or nostalgia was doing some seriously heavy lifting back then. The dialogue felt cheesy, the plot holes were glaring, and I couldn't believe I used to watch these movies on repeat. What movies from your youth absolutely don't hold up anymore when you try to rewatch them? Did you have that same jarring experience of realizing something you loved was actually pretty bad?",

Both characters need to be in on it, so nothing like in Snatch where a character \"throws a fight\" in order for another character to get ahead. Looking for a \"stage a fight to get out of a sticky situation,\" like if the characters are friends and are trapped somewhere and they trick the guards by play-fighting then turning the fight on the guards. Things like that. Thank you.",

[Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7YVBmCOIys) \n\nIn Goodfellas, the song (by Billy Ward and his Dominos) was used in an organized crime montage.  [Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ivfLTxsoGA)\n\n  \nA bit later in the movie, they used [\"And then He Kissed me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPiSB8fSviE)\" by the Crystals, which, for me, was a very prominent song in 1987's \"Adventures in Babysitting\" [Link. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrecN_dsPc)\n\nAre there other songs that have been used in contexts as far apart as romantic comedies or comedy/adventure movies and mob/crime movies?\n\n",
