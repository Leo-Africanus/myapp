Because that changes his character. Is he just yelling and intimidating because he thinks it'll make them better even though they're already flawless? Or does he hear imperfections?",

In the film, there is a scene with the 2 door riddle (2 doors and 2 guards, one guard only tells the truth and the other only tells lies, you get one question posed to one guard to determine which door leads to the castle). Jennifer Connolly points at one door and asks one guard \"Answer yes or no - would he (the other guard) tell me that this door leads to the castle?\" Making it a yes or no question while referring to one of the doors specifically in this way would NOT work, right? As far as i can tell, the question needs to be \"Which door would the other guard tell me leads to the castle?\"",

Upon rewatch - each scene seemed not just to be funny but compelling. All the way through the end with the Malakalaka board and i find myself actually getting teared up when Coop gets the replacement Lazy boy from the kid.\n* The team gimmicks are amazing.\n* A movie of its era but still feels relevant - the soundtrack is silly and the house band is Reel Big Fish - Cuz ska was having \"a moment\"\n* Watching the first scene with the voiceover about how sports suck now cutting to coop peeing in the bushes is actually great... especially with the one football player jumping around that stuff has obly gotten more prevalent.\n* The idea of the players moving around so much creating instability for the sport is\u00a0*an ideal*\u00a0that feels lost nowadays... Kinda like how we root for the Scabs but the whole movie is antiplayer empowerment... but they come together anyway\n* The invention of the game and the psyche-outs keep the game fun\n* Al michaels and bob Costa's are fucking hilarious in this.\n* Jenny McCarthy is in her bag\n* Ernest Borgnine is in his bag\n* Robert Vaughn feels born to play these types of characters\n* The Thematic teams are kinda hilarious\n* The thematic cheerleaders are : D\n* The hospital scene is hilarious. them drinking at the bar with the kid. Fantastic.\n* honestly it feels anything that didn't age well (it all did minus all the lil bitch jokes somewhat) all counterbalances with the Coop/doug Kiss at the malakalaka board\n* Also the \"Sports Scenes\" are fun to watch\n\nIf you don't go to bat for this movie - \"Your mother is a terrible cook\"\n\n  \nEdit: i forgot the \"massive Egos' scene and the car drive song.\n\nDouble edit - they didn't write it - David zucker and co did",

The chemistry between Praetorian Jack and Furiosa felt organic and not forced and it was entertaining to watch. We get to see a glimpse of Furiosa\u2019s mentor and that was interesting.\n\nTom Burke was so familiar but I cant put on where I saw him before. Google said that he was in the BBC Three Musketeers and that is when it finally clicked. Hope we see more of him. He kinda looks a bit like Diego Luna too. ",

But the way they approach these themes seems pretty different.\n\nIn The Substance, you\u2019ve got this almost sci-fi body horror take where someone literally creates a younger version of themselves to stay relevant. And then with A Different Man, it\u2019s more grounded but still haunting, with a guy getting reconstructive surgery and trying to figure out who he really is after everything changes.\n\nThey\u2019re both about change, sure, but is one more psychological while the other leans physical? Or do they actually end up exploring the same truths in different ways? If anyone\u2019s seen both, I\u2019d love to hear your take on how they compare\u2014are they more similar than they seem, or just exploring overlapping themes in totally different ways?",

Did any of you feel the same about it when you first watched?\u00a0\n\nI personally saw the humour in it pretty early on but I know others found it more scary. \n\nDo you feel differently about it now that years have passed? \n\n",
