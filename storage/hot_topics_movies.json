        "content": "I watched it for the first time after getting a little sloshed sitting my my living room on Friday night. I watched it again today... That said...\n\nRoad to Perdition blew me away. I went in expecting just another mob movie, but it\u2019s honestly so much more than that. Yeah, it\u2019s got gangsters, guns, and double-crosses, but at its core it\u2019s really about fathers and sons, and what kind of legacy you pass on. The movie hooked me.\n\nTom Hanks is not the guy you usually think of as a mob hitman, but he absolutely kills it here. He\u2019s scary when he needs to be, but you can also see the love he has for his kid in every scene. Paul Newman, in one of his last roles, just commands the screen. Every line out of his mouth feels heavy, like he knows the end is coming. And then there\u2019s Jude Law\u2026 holy hell. He plays this weird, creepy photographer/hitman who made me uncomfortable every time he showed up. \n\nBut honestly, the thing that pushes this movie from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat\u201d is how it looks. The cinematography is insane. Every frame could be a painting. The way they use rain, shadows, and silence is unreal. That big rain-soaked shootout? One of the coolest scenes I\u2019ve ever seen. No music, no flashy editing\u2014just raw atmosphere. It\u2019s beautiful and brutal at the same time.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was how emotional it is. By the end, I wasn\u2019t just watching a mob story\u2014I was thinking about family, choices, and how hard it is to break cycles of violence. It\u2019s tragic but also kind of hopeful in its own way.\n\nThe movie left me feeling... I don't know. You know that feeling when you're sitting by yourself, late at night, in the quiet, rain outside, with a drink in your hand? Not necessarily worried about anything, but a small feeling of sadness? Thats what this movie felt like. And I love it.",

        "content": "I was quite certain that I was not going to like Taxi Driver and avoided it for a long while. I knew it had to be a good movie, of course, but I was sure many of the things Scorsese is great at weren't going to be up to the level of his later works. \n\nOnce I got to watch it I realize what a masterpiece the movie is on some many aspects. Not only that, but realized it is another of those movies that either invented or highlighted stuff that are still imitated today. \n\nNow, my expectations were low and maybe that why I could appreciate it better, but I still think that I was going to appreciate this masterpiece either way.",

The movie is a generic zombie uprising movie with CGI fast zombies and ridiculous product placement that misses just about everything that made the book so immersive and compelling. No Battle of Yonkers, no LOBOs, no blind Japanese swordsman, no downed pilot scene, no Tiger Singh fighting square... It's almost an achievement how badly they messed this up.\n\n  \n",

My parents love Tom Hanks, and I remember them obsessing over his performance in \"Cast Away\" and \"Captain Phillips\".\n\nBut, I finally watched \"Monster\" (2003) a few years ago in high school and was completely gagged by Charlize Theron's performance. Her Oscar win was the \"ah ha\" moment for me. I mean... her acting and transformation was SHOCKING and incredibly enjoyable to watch on screen.\n\nAnyone else experience this with other actors/actresses?\n\nEdit: Just thought of another performance that gagged me. Javier Bardem in \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d was extraordinary.",

The Space Race was such a great period in our history, even though it was part of the Cold War and largely inspired by it. I just wish we still had the same pioneering spirit of venturing into outer space as we did back in the 50s and 60s. Like they say on Star Trek, space is the final frontier, whether or not it's motivated by competition.",
