        "content": "I must say I was a bit skeptic when both of my sons (15 and 17) said they would join me watching Dances with wolves today. Especially when this was the extended version, that would be almost 4 hours. They are both kids of today with all that entails. It's sometimes hard making them keep attention for a short amount of time without any brain stimuli going on or them checking their phones.\n\nDuring todays movie none of them were on the phone one time, the only time they spoke it was about something happening in the movie. We had just one break during a 4 hours movie and it was a short pee break.\n\nThey were captivated. I'm impressed, this has never happened before and we are talking about a movie from 1990 and it is a 4 hours movie, slow even at that time. If this is not peak storytelling and a Grand Slam for the movie I don't know what might be.\n\nIt surely has it flaws we could discuss up and down, but from me to you a highly recommended movie to see with teen children!",

But in Deepwater Horizon, BP is portrayed very negatively (rightfully so) and their logo is used pretty front and center on the uniforms of some of the main actors in the show. Considering to prominently use a logo like this typically takes permission from the company, why would BP agree to this? Or did the movie just decide to deal with the legal consequences after the fact?",

I enjoyed it, but I didn\u2019t really get why people called it one of Nolan\u2019s best.\n\nRewatched it this week after almost 10 years, and it honestly felt like a completely different movie.\n\nBack then, I was in college, mostly watching movies for plot twists and spectacle. Now, after working away from home for years and seeing how fast time actually moves, the whole father-daughter storyline hit hard. The scenes where Cooper watches decades of missed messages, and Murph growing up without him \u2014 those moments felt way more real than the space travel itself.\n\nI also noticed details I missed before: how lonely space feels, how desperate humanity\u2019s situation is, and how every decision costs someone years of life back home. It felt less like a sci-fi movie and more like a story about time and regret.\n\nMade me realize sometimes it\u2019s not the movie that changes \u2014 it\u2019s us.\n\nAnyone else had a movie completely change for them on rewatch? What was it, and why did it hit differently the second time?",

Or is it simpler: is Nate's last name one of the fences? AFAIK, Nate's last name isn't revealed.",

And by the ending, they have a huge impact on each other in some way or another. Whether it be falling madly in love, saving each other\u2018s lives, showing each other a new perspective on life, or becoming best friends. \n\nAnd often we as the audience don\u2019t initially realize just how short they actually knew each other before the arc happened. \n\nWhat are your examples of this? \n\n",

An actor who when you see them listed among the cast of a movie you know that they will elevate it. \n\nFor me it\u2019s Michael Shannon. He\u2019s been in bad movies but he is never bad. He can play any type of character and always gives it his all. He\u2019s had some starring roles but he really shines as a support character. ",

        "content": "Holy shit. I just watched this movie for the first time and I\u2019m sitting here unpacking it and I\u2019m falling more and more in love with it.\n\nI enjoyed the movie but wasn\u2019t blown away\u2026until I started thinking about what every little thing meant, and damn it touches on so many things.\n\nGRIEF\n\nObviously the movie as a whole explores coping with grief, or rather avoiding grieving, and each of the brothers avoids this in a different way.\n\nSEARCH FOR ANSWERS/MEANING\n\nInteresting how they all missed their dad\u2019s funeral but have come all this way to figure out why their mum never went. Almost as if that will help them understand why they themselves never went. But we see that she herself doesn\u2019t have the answers. We also kind of see how we inherit things from parents (in a psychological sense).\n\nFRANCIS\u2019 BANDAGES &amp; NEED FOR CONTROL\n\nHe\u2019s so focused with being in control and hiding his vulnerability. Cool how it\u2019s when he loses control (the train literally getting lost) that he has his most spiritual moments. Love that he chooses to take his bandages off and show his scars. At the end, he\u2019s bandaged again but he\u2019s healing now.\n\nPETER &amp; ALSO HIS DAMN SNAKE\n\nTrying to contain something dangerous but then it gets out. Metaphor for negative emotions? Also him wearing his father\u2019s glasses the whole time that he can\u2019t even see out of because the prescription is wrong. Also is that why he had headaches?\n\nLUGGAGE\n\nLiterally carrying their dead dad\u2019s baggage with them on this spiritual journey until the very end when they choose to let go and move forward.\n\nIDEALISATION OF EASTERN CULTURE\n\nBut having no real respect or understanding of it.\n\nJACK EXTERNALISING EVERYTHING\n\nHaving his depresso soundtracks playing, his short stories that have \u201cfictional characters\u201d, his freaking mace.\n\nSEE NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL ETC.\n\nMight be a stretch, but the bandaged head, the glasses and the stache?\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed so much but just wow.",
