My new horror movie Pig Hill is based on the real life urban legend of the Meadville Pennsylvania \"pig people\" and stars Rainey Qually and Shane West. It's available on PVOD everywhere!  Ask Me Anything!\n\n  \n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT6aGrXVlAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT6aGrXVlAQ)\n\nPig Hill follows a young author who investigates the disappearance of local women in the community of Meadville, Pennsylvania, quickly becoming entwined in a strange local legend about the creatures that live on Pig Hill. The film is based on the Nancy William novel \u201cPig.\u201d The film stars Shane West (A Walk To Remember, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), Rainey Qualley (Ocean\u2019s Eight, Mad Men), Shiloh Fernandez (Evil Dead, Red Riding Hood, Poker Face) and R.A. Mihailoff (Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Hatchet II).\n\n**Bio:**  \n\nFilmmaker Kevin Lewis planted his cult flag on planet horror with Willy\u2019s Wonderland (starring Nicolas Cage in a dialogue free performance) and quickly followed it up with the horror film The Accursed starring Mena Suvari. Cineverse (Terrifier 3, The Toxic Avenger) just released his new Southern Gothic tale Pig Hill which premiered at FrightFest earlier this year. After almost succumbing to Covid back in 2021 (two weeks before Willy's release), Kevin jas committed himself to not stop doing what he loves... making horror movies. He's three upcoming films in various stages of post production; Oak, Misdirection, and I Am Your Driver starring Jeremy Piven.\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/kevinlewisofficial/](https://www.instagram.com/kevinlewisofficial/)\n\nAsk me anything!

Seems to be insult to injury that his family abandoned him at Christmas, and even Santa decided to screw him over as well.

I love reading about the topic and books, I love YouTube videos on the subject, documentaries, etc. So obviously, I am a member of most of the subs on those topics. \n\nThe teaser trailer for Steven Spielberg\u2019s new movie \u201cDisclosure Day\u201d has absolutely broken the brains of about 90% of the users within those subs. It has become endless long-winded post dissecting each scene in the teaser, what Steven Spielberg is \u201ctrying to say\u201d, what they think the cardinal means. \n\n\u201cTHE ALIENS ARE BIRDS AND US AT THE SAME TIME \ud83e\udd74\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE CARDINAL REPRESENTS CONSCIOUSNESS AND SHE IS WEARING A RED DRESS SO SHE IS CHANNELING CONSCIOUSNESS \ud83e\udd74\u201d\n\nLike\u2026&gt;!JUST FUCKING WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT GOD DAMN.!&lt;\n\nWhy on earth would you want to sit there and obsess and rack your brain about what you think a movie is going to mean or what you think a tiny two second scene is trying to convey when it comes out in six fucking months. Also, what makes you think you know what is going on in the brain of Stephen *fucking* Spielberg. \n\nHe is not a CIA asset. He is not a disinformation agent. He had his finger on the pulse of the alien abduction movement with Close Encounters of the Third Kind because he\u2019s interested in the subject and he read books on it and he talked to J Allen Hynek and other researchers. \n\nSHUT UP WITH FAN THEORIES AND JUST WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT. FUCK. ",

        "content": "Watched It\u2019s a wonderful life for the very first time last night \n\nI always heard this was a well loved Christmas movie. Not when it first premiered, but starting in the 1970\u2019s for tv. But for some reason I never got around to watching it like I did Home Alone, The Polar Express or The Nightmare Before Christmas. It pleasantly surprised me.\n\n One of the reasons I avoided it for this long? Was because I thought it was going to be one of those movies that was mostly forgettable. Except for the most popular \u201cEvery time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings\u201d quote. Wasn\u2019t expecting it to also be funny. For example, I loved the scene at the dance where the floor splits to reveal the swimming pool and everyone just decides what the heck, and jumps in anyway. \n\nGreat acting from James Stewart and Donna Reed. If I have one gripe, it drags in getting to the plot. George doesn\u2019t make his I wish I\u2019d never been born wish until the second half of the movie, for about the length of a 30 minute tv  episode. But I\u2019m still glad I watched, and can see why this remains a well loved Christmas classic. I also learned whenever a modern character makes a wish in a show or movie, they most likely got the idea from this movie. It\u2019s also been remade plenty of times. ",
