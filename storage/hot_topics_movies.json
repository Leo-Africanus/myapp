        "content": "Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett is an undeniable highlight of both \"Pirate\" movies that he's in, both because of his relentlessly evil actions (the guy hangs a kid at the start of the third film and that just is one example of his vile behavior) and his non-stop air of smug self-satisfaction. So it is EXTREMELY satisfying at the climax to see him and his ship get blown to bits by the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, especially because of his reaction to his demise. Does he panic or rage at his defeat? No, he completely shuts down in shock and disbelief, unable to believe that his plans have gone astray and he's doomed. All he can do is whisper \"It's just good business\" while practically going catatonic as his men abandon ship and leave him to his fate. And then you get the spectacular sight of him numbly walking down the steps as the ship is blown apart around him until a final explosion engulfs him. The movie itself is an overlong and unwieldy mess, but that sequence is worth the wait as it's a completely satisfying end for an arrogant A-hole who simply cannot handle defeat.",

I never would have thought that he would get to level of popularity that he is at now. It seems like everything I watch has him in it lately. Not only in it, but the standout character in each.\n\n\n\n He's my favorite part of Sinners as an Irish dancing vampire. I just binge watched SAS: Rogue Heroes and he is by far the driving force in it as Paddy. Lastly, I just went to watch 28 Days Later. And who pops up at the end, looking like a madman out of a fever dream, but my good ol' friend Mr. O'Connell. He makes the most of his screen time even when he is not in it a lot.\n\n  \nHis emergence is akin to Pedro Pascal's ascendence a couple of years ago. I have a feeling we are going to see him for years to come in many more projects. I just hope we get to see him play some goofy characters, though. Really looking forward to 28 Days Later: Bone Temple! ",

        "content": "In the beginning of the movie Psycho (1960). Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, is working at a real estate office in Phoenix Arizona. While she is chatting with a coworker. Her employer and a wealthy business man walk in from the hot Arizona sun. As they enter the building, the business man lifts his hat and exclaims...\n\n\"Wow, it's hotter than fresh milk\"\n\nEveryone in the scene seems to just take this saying in stride. But this is a saying that I have never heard in my life and causes my to pause until my laughter subsides.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite sayings in a movie that just aren't used anymore. Maybe you'll try and bring them back. \n\n",

        "content": "So, dude gets dropped off on Earth &amp; presumably seeds the planet with the basic building blocks of life. The CGI bit shows the black goo facilitating new DNA molecules. But like, there's already plant life on the planet, &amp; humans share something like 50% of our genes (much less of our total DNA content) with plants, due to gene conservation. So were the Engineers speeding things up, like \"hey, let's skip to fish\"? If so, that would presuppose that the genes we share in common with plants &amp; other non-animal life are actually conserved across the galaxy, which would be pretty cool. But of course the movie doesn't get into any of that, &amp; eventually forgets how cartographers &amp; biologists work, or that you should run in a 90-degree angle when a giant donut is rolling toward you. Is there any \"expanded universe\" content that explained this better than the movie did (or didn't)?",
