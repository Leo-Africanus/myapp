Ask us anything!\n\nWatch the trailer for the 35th anniversary theatrical re-release here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67rRgzw0vi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67rRgzw0vi4)\n\nGet tickets now to see TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES back in theaters starting tomorrow \u2014 Aug 15 thru August 21:\n\n\u200bhttps://hubs.la/Q03xRw3z0\n\nTurtlemania lives!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nFour baby turtles come in contact with a mysterious substance called ooze and then are transformed into human-sized crime fighters. The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze. The rat was a former pet of a ninja master and therefore uses his skills to train the four turtles in martial arts. They befriend a local journalist and with her help attempt to find the group behind a crime wave in New York City.\n\nAdapted from the early \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics\u201d with characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the movie achieved the then-seemingly impossible feat of bringing its reptilian heroes to full live-action with a team of puppeteers and a voice cast led by Brian Tochi (Revenge of the Nerds, Police Academy 3: Back in Training) as Leonardo, Corey Feldman (Stand By Me, The Goonies) as Donatello, Josh Pais (The Station Agent, A Beautiful Mind), as Raphael, Robbie Rist (Balto, \u201cDoc McStuffins\u201d) as Michelangelo and Kevin Clash (\u201cSesame Street,\u201d Muppet Treasure Island) as Splinter, the Turtles' master. The film also features Judith Hoag (Zodiac, Fallen) and Elias Koteas (Armageddon, Cadillac Man).\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* \u2022 Judith Hoag\n* \u2022 Elias Koteas\n* \u2022 Brian Tochi\n* \u2022 Corey Feldman\n* \u2022 Josh Pais\n* \u2022 Robbie Rist\n* \u2022 Kevin Clash\n* \u2022 James Saito\n* \u2022 David McCharen\n* \u2022 Michelan Sisti\n* \u2022 Leif Tilden\n* \u2022 David Forman\n* \u2022 Sam Rockwell\n* \u2022 Scott Wolf\n* \u2022 Skeet Ulrich\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAsk us anything!

        "content": "\n\nHonestly, I was quite disappointed. I expected a movie revolving around the cloning plot. Specifically, the idea of two Mickeys existing at the same time due to an error. That would have been a great movie! Instead, what was advertised as the main concept feels like a subplot in the movie. Essentially the entire thing revolves around the intelligent aliens. And then there was also the plot with Mark Ruffalo being an obvious stand in for Trump. But then there was also the subplot with Steven Yuen.\n\nI finished the movie feeling incredibly confused, because how did they mess up the initial concept like this? The idea of a guy who is constantly sent on deadly missions and is revived is an absolutely golden idea. It also leads to an interesting discussion about consciousness and if a copy of you is still really you. But that\u2019s barely even brought up. The whole plot with two versions of Mickey is completely sidelined. Which makes no sense at all. That should have 100% been the main conflict in the movie, like it was advertised as. Instead, we got a mess.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the movie horrible, but I definitely didn\u2019t like it as much as I hoped I would.",

Peter's vague and hand-wavey explanation of it is almost insulting:\n\n&gt; \"It can analyze, design, construct basically anything.\"\n\nThat's it. Magic box can just do everything, no questions, no issues. The story needs Peter to develop a cure for everyone's villainy, so here's the Box That Develops Cures for Everyone's Villainy.\n\nWhat other examples are out of there of outstandingly lazy plot devices?",
