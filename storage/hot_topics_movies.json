        "content": "There are many people that argue that a guy and a girl can\u2019t JUST be friends, especially if both parties are heterosexual. Because depending on how close they become, it is usually inevitable that they will become sexually and emotionally attracted to the other. \n\nHowever, I personally believe the opposite and that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be very close without there being any hints of romance. \n\nOne good example that I can think of is the friendship between Jess and Leslie from the Disney film; Bridge to Terabithia (2007)! Their friendship was the heart and overall story of the movie, and it was so heartwarming to watch that friendship develop before it took a devastating turn with Leslie\u2019s death. \n\nSure it could be argued that Jess was realizing that he was romantically falling in love with Leslie, and there were some hints of a romance sparking between them before she died. But it was still a great friendship, where there was a great deal of love between them without needing to become a couple. ",

I love how this is combines horror, sci-fi and action. I like Arnold in this movie especially the 'GET TO THE CHOPPA' line. \n\nI like the final fight between Arnold and the predator, I like the score, I like the design of the predator. I also like how this is kind of a slasher movie with the crew getting killed off one by one, it seperates it from other action movies. \n\nSo overall this movie is like a solid 10/10. \n\n(Also just a note in case people are getting confused between horror and scary. Childs play is horror because what else could it be, I don't find it scary.)",

The emotional core of Interstellar \u2014 a dad separated from his daughter with time slipping away \u2014 and the heart-wrenching choices in Arrival hit so much deeper now.\n\nIt made me wonder: what are some other films that take on a whole new emotional weight and dimension after having kids? I'm especially curious about stories that explore the parent-child bond, sacrifice, fear, or hope through a new lens once you're on the other side of it.\n\nWhat movies have you rewatched as a parent that just destroyed you emotionally (in the best or worst ways)?",

There are some movies where I\u2019ve had to admit to myself that I actually liked a scene in it, despite me hating the rest of the film. \n\nOne film that comes to mind is Batman V Superman. It\u2019s an abhorrent pile of dogshit, but my god, the warehouse fight scene might be the best live action Batman fight scene we\u2019ve ever gotten. I would\u2019ve loved for a solo Batman movie with more of that. Instead, we got the abysmal turd that surrounded it. \n\nWhat films come to mind for you guys?",
