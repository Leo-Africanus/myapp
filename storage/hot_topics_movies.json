        "title": "I watched Pacific Rim and it's now my favourite monster movie",
        "content": "So, i spent some time without watching any movies, months in fact, then, some days ago i opened Max and watched Godzilla vs kong, the new Empire. I loves this movie, and watched the rest of the monsterverse. My favourite were the skull Island and king of the Monsters. Skull Island for its story and human character and the Vietnan war feeling of the movie (its almost an horror movie - i think, i don't watch horror movies - venturing in a unknown land and slowly losing members), and King of the monster for its destruction and action scenes. \n\nI say this because what i feel my favourite thing about PR is the mix of these elements. I initialy thought that the humans would be boring, and that too much time would be spend on the base with nothing happening. And while we spend a lot of the movie in that base, i actually liked the characters. I feel some things in this movie were resolved top fast, i'm thinking about Chuck, we don't spend enough time with him to care about his daddy issues or even which issues he has, so i feel the scene where he says goodbye to his dad and they make amends to be lacking. And the sacrifice at the end only has any weight because Pentecost. \n\nI liked Mori and all her drama, and loved the scene on her memories,\n\nThe fights were epic, and it was this combination of a good story with the epic scenes and fights that made me like this movie. But i also will say that there's a high chance that the story isn't even good and full of plot holes, but i rarely gets any plot hole, i rarely notice them, so i say i liked the story, but i won't say it's good. \n\nOne think i disliked was Hannibal's death, The baby kaiju appears, scares everyone, dies, kills him and then dies again, it felt so pointless to do that, they could just had killed the characters the first time the baby gets out the mother. I think i didn't disliked the death in itself, just that the kaiju goes back to life to perform It and then dies again. \n\n\nI didn't really liked the Cancel the apocalypse speech, not that i could write something better, but it felt too short and not epic enough. \nI didn't care for the doctors though,and disliked their introduction. \n\nBut i prefered the one that goes on a missison to get the brain, and only because of the worldbuilding, which i loved, i liked seeing how the world worked, even If the focus was on the black market and selling kaiju's shit and ticks. \n\nThe sound track is awesome. \n\nI don't have a lot of things do say about this movie other than i liked it and feel that it mixed very well human character and their dramas and stories and epic fights, but it's what makes me like this movie more than the monsterverse ones, it mixes, kong was good because of its characters, and Godzilla 2 because of its Epicness, and Pacific rim had both\n\n",

        "title": "What About Bob is a psychological horror movie told from the perspective of the psycho",
        "content": "Spoilers for a 34 year old movie, I guess.\n\nSo, What About Bob is a classic Bill Murray comedy and I always loved it growing up. Bob, Bill Murray's character, is endearing, silly, and a great vehicle for Bill Murray's brand of comedy. The interplay with Richard Dreyfuss's character Dr. Leo Marvin as Bob's psychiatrist and Bob is great. The dynamic is fun and their character arcs are a fun reversal of one another where Bob learns to function and thrive despite his many mental disorders (which were somewhat problematic but portrayed pretty well for a comedy in the 90's) while Dr. Marvin descends into madness trying to get rid of Bob from his life. A delightful film and still watch it sometimes when I'm craving something lighthearted and fun.\n\nHowever, the actual events of the plot are the events of a horror story. Bob enters Dr. Marvin's life at Marvin's triumphant moment; he's a successful psychoanalyst/psychiatrist, his book got published and he's getting serious acclaim for it, his colleagues respect him, and he's about to go on a lovely vacation with his family. Bob gets foisted on him from a colleague who Bob literally convinced to give up his career to get away from, but Dr. Marvin is confident he can help him after he gets back from vacation.\n\nThen Bob calls him on vacation using a fake suicide and police investigation as a premise. Shook up, Dr. Marvin sets a very clear professional boundary: \"don't call me or approach me when I'm on vacation and we'll get to your mental health care when I'm back in the office.\" He figures that'd be the end of it; a clingy patient is annoying but he's probably dealt with that before even if the whole fake suicide approach to get his number was a bit extreme. Then Bob shows up in person. He's not even supposed to know what *town* Marvin is in, but now he knows where he and his family live. He tries to dissuade him again but then Bob shows up to his house and approaches his family. \n\nHe starts befriending Marvin's kids, going sailing with his daughter and diving with his son. His wife finds him charming and cute. He stays over for dinner and sleeps in his son's room overnight. He hijacks his once-in-a-lifetime interview that could have made him a celebrity psychiatrist, his ultimate career goal. Every step of the way Dr. Marvin sees these major boundaries being crossed and the unhinged nature of his nightmare patient *and nobody will listen to him.* \n\nHe doesn't know what to do; no reasonable options seem to work. He's scared. His family is more and more siding with Bob over him and he feels like he's being replaced as a father. Bob is even comforting his wife *about him, her husband.* He's getting more and more frustrated and desperate, and in so doing is more and more making himself look like the bad guy. He goes to colleagues who respect him for help and they act like he's the one who's crazy.\n\nHe's acting like he doesn't usually act; sure he was a bit smug before and maybe a little full of himself, but this can't really be *him,* could it? He's not seriously contemplating killing this patient of his, *is he?* He's a healer, a person who helps those suffering from mental illness; he's not a guy who breaks into a store at night to steal a gun and explosives, *right?*\n\nThen he does it. He kidnaps Bob at gunpoint and takes him out in the woods, straps bombs to him, and sets a timer for the detonator. He's using the language of his career of healing to kill. He even starts talking to himself, imagining cannibalizing Bob's fish in his triumph. He's long past the point of caring whether he sounds crazy now, but at least. he's. gone.\n\nThen he sees him. Bob is standing next to his beloved sister. He's still here. He's...never going away. It finally breaks him. He descends into catatonia and psychosis. He's one of them now; a broken mind who can't be fixed. He summons the will to scream one last protest of Bob marrying his sister at their wedding in a futile attempt to stop this final grafting of this man into his life forever. In that last moment of failure the comfort of catatonia leaves him and he knows this is his eternal damnation.\n\nSo, yeah. Horror movie.",

        "content": "To make a long story short I've managed to get several of my staff into watching \"classic\" movies (2000's is classic now, It hurt to hear lets move on) instead of the dreaded cycle of rewatching the same netflix series over and over which they very much prefer to do. It's been going very well!! I've never forced the discussion but brought it up casually though lately it's been something they've been bringing to me more and more without promting, sparking discussion and what to watch next and then, the biggest wall since my teens hit me like a brick. \n\nEvery time I've gotten into this discussion before with older peers I would always say \"Well, here! Borrow this and these dvds and let me know what ya think!\" and as that moment presented it's usual self and I was struck. I can't share these amazing movies anymore.. \nI can vaguely point at where they might be if they maybe have a subscription to a half dozen things but half the time I know I'll be met with glazed over eyes knowing their pursuit of the thing just isn't worth the time, back to binging I guess. \n\nThe passing-over of collected movies is just gone and It hurts that such a ceremonial thing is gone. I loved so much giving little treasures to my friends for them to discover for the first time and the bond it created letting them discover a thing you've discovered for yourself. Now that age feels gone. I remember so vividly my older sister giving me Nightmare on Elmstreet on vhs behind my parents back and hording it like Golem.. Maybe It's just the physical? Maybe the limited nature of it. Maybe the personality of this hand given gift of something they let touch their hearts be then hand given to you that they hope will touch yours. I don't know exactly but it hit different.\n\nMaybe it's for the better? I guess if you sail the seven seas you can still quite easily find all these things but man.. It's just not the same.",

The would be step dad is earnestly trying his best to connect with his would be step son and gets tossed out like all step dads (do Hollywood types have parental issues or what, that's rhetorical). The idea that someone's entire life can be turned around and they're suddenly not an ass just because they have to tell the truth for a day is just kind of dumb. The director ended up with a few successful movies solely because Jim Carey liked him and he let Jim Carey do his thing, his other movies include such hits as \"The Nutty Professor\". The writers never wrote anything close to noteworthy before nor after.\n\nBut damnit Jim Carey turns the whole thing into the Jim Carey show, that's hilarious. Him freaking out over the pen or in the bathroom IS the movie and is funny as hell, regardless of what else there is.",
