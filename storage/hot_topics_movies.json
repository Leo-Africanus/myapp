        "content": "Hey r/movies! We're Anna Maguire &amp; Kyle Greenberg, a British-Canadian-American filmmaking duo behind HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED (2024), the dog-friendly screening series and zine CANNES DOGS, underground one-day Vancouver film festival OFF-VIFF and the new FRENCH LESSONS (2025). \n\nAfter visiting one of LA's \"Valley\" neighborhoods for a period of time (and enjoying a joint or two), Anna and I began to feel the menacing reality of surveillance cameras not only surrounding us, but speaking to us and were compelled to make a short film about it called HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED.\n\nThe short played over two dozen festivals across the globe like Fantasia, Morbido, SXSW Sydney, but as we started to approach the digital release, we knew it was important to do something different than just simply throw the film up on Vimeo or YouTube. Instead, we've decided to create a never-ending surveillance loop where the film could live online in a new form: [hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back Thursday 5/8 at 6:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\nWatch HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED online as part of the ENDLESS LOOP today for free - \n\n[hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nTeaser Trailer\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1019440725](https://vimeo.com/1019440725)\n\nSynopsis: On a trip to Los Angeles to visit a new flame, Anna finds herself lost, stoned and alone\u2026 or is she?",

As dark as moat of the movies ive seen, Requiem for a Dream is completely unsettling. It is meant to be. The score is incredible. The use of sounds to create unnerving feelings is powerful. The split screen and use of disturbing images really sets the tone for the absolute nightmare of addiction.\n\nThe movie feels like a made for after school documentary but just keeps descending into a pit of hell.\n\nThe mother character made me feel sorry as a son and decent human for an elderly woman. Fearful of how I would be vulnerable as I got older.\n\nLetos absolutely depraved character shows what a selfish and self destructive person will do to get to where they think they want to be. At any means necessary.\n\nConnellys character made me hyper aware of women in compromising relationships and the absolutely disgusting behavior of people who wish to exploit it.\n\nWayans character shows what a man with some promise and a dream can be horrifically compromised. \n\nThis is a film that should be required viewing for high schoolers to show the horrors of addiction. Addictions to everything. Drugs, alcohol, sex, TV, Weightloss, food, public opinion, peer pressure, self esteem, sex work... ",

        "content": "I just saw someone in movie suggestions say it is not, their main reason being that you'd never kiss your mom like that. Fair point. I would not, but I wanted to get some other opinions on the subject. \n\n\n\nI feel it is. It's a kiss goodbye. Platonic means intimate and affectionate but not sexual. That actually almost perfectly describes the kiss.\n\nThey know no matter how good the kiss feels or how strongly they resonate with each other that a kiss is all it will ever be. It's not leading to sex, it never could have, but it's almost more intimate because of that.\n\nIts not about sexual attraction it's about real human connection. To me it's not a movie about love. It's a movie about loneliness and how sometimes you find a cure, however fleeting. ",
