        "title": "Finally watched \"Requiem for a Dream\" after years of putting it off. I just feel empty inside.",
        "content": "Watching the gradual deterioration of the characters is a ride as it feels like you are there with them but feel hopeless unable to help. The ending montage accelerates like a nightmare in real time, and I couldn't quite process what I was seeing. It happens so fast, that while what was happening was horrifying, I just felt like I was numb to it. Trapped in an endless cycle too.\n\nThe real horror of this movie isn't the uncanny visuals. I was really freaked out by how grounded in realism it all is. Characters become unrecognizable and do depressingly repetitive tasks and chores. It is so much a reflection of real life, that while I was disturbed, I find myself just feeling that's just how life goes for some.\n\nEllen Burstyn's monologue about being alone and wanting to matter was the highlight. It floored me. Got the ultimate point of the movie across better than the surreal images.\n\n\"I'm somebody now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me and they'll all like me. I'll tell them about you, and your father, how good he was to us. Remember? It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow all right. What have I got Harry, hm? Why should I even make the bed, or wash the dishes? I do them, but why should I? I'm alone. Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got, Harry? I'm lonely. I'm old.\"\n\nAfter watching it, I get why people are uncomfortable by it. I do believe it is brilliantly made and \"Requiem for a Dream\" should be required viewing because we could make drugs obsolete in no time. But I will never watch it again!",

But the entire time all I can think of is how much Woodward and Bernstein fight for the truth and justice to bring down a president and how incomparable the crime is in regards to the US today. Bradley has a line \u201c You guys are about to write a story that says the former Attorney General, the highest ranking law enforcement officer in this country- is a crook\u201d\n\nWe obviously live in a time when not only the attorney general, but the entire cabinet and administration are committing corruption and crimes no one in our democratic history has ever seen. I live in the UK. But I feel a hinge of pain every single day watching your country allow itself to succumb to the criminals that rule you.\n\nI guess the post is asking. Does this film no longer hold relevance? It\u2019s a masterpiece in its acting, its writing (RIP Goldman) and its set design and cinematography. I see myself watching this film every year. But how can something considered \u201cone of the greats\u201d and a piece of American history stand for something so pure when its country is being outed as a place ripe for authoritarianism. Maybe it always has been corrupt. Us in Europe have always thought so. It\u2019s sad to see it but it makes me wonder how irrelevant these pieces of art now mean.",

The Dino action scenes are filled with tension ( the trick with the phone is well done) and the whole thing wraps up in a neat 90 mins.\n\nSam Neil really reminds me why he is my favorite character in the series. Dr Grant is calm, experienced and has his shit together.\n\nYeah, the lower quality CGI shows as well. But I think it mostly looks okay.",

        "content": "Train Dreams is such a beautiful, soul crushing, and inspiring movie. After it ended, all I could do was try to recompose myself before even saying \u201cthat was such a good movie,\u201d as the emotional toll of purpose, loss, guilt, and meaning lay heavy upon me.   \n\n  \n\nThe dichotomy of our insignificance in it all against the significance of every moment we experience, to ourselves and to others. The blips, alone in the scheme of time, can feel silent, but together they create the harmony of us, the human tale of unremarkability and finding beauty in the gaps. The beauty of everything. Don\u2019t you hear it?   \n\n  \n\nThe interconnectivity of nature, how within a forest the trees, the roots, the shrubs and grubs, you really cannot tell where something stops and starts. It is all alive. And if we are a part of it, we are alive. The dead tree is just as important as the living one. We are alive. When our story ends and we return to the silence that created us, we are alive. We, us, it, everything, it is alive.   \n\nThe resonance of silent bonding between strangers of different lives and cultures. The harsh reality of hatred that lives in others, that disrupts and mangles the lives of those who do not belong to their creed or race. The invisible trauma of inaction in injustice, even before you understand the injustice. The casualness of violence.   \n\n  \n\nThe futility of plans and timing. Unrecognized dreams laid to waste. The passing of a second becomes the passing of a lifetime, and no matter how aware or unaware you are of that passing, one day it is over. Everything you ever wished to accomplish becomes a relic, an inspiration of the past, never again to feel spring\u2019s warmth.   \n\n  \n\nWhen he talks of the whispers in the forest all I could think was that when a bird sings, I hear my grandmothers voice. I dare not look for I wish to not scare her away. All I can do is listen until she once again fades into silence.   \n\n  \n\nWhere \u201cEverything, Everywhere, All at Once\u201d explores absurdity on a larger than life scale, \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d explores absurdity on a grounded plane. Ultimately both speak volumes, one just shouts and the other whispers. I wish I was able to further articulate just how powerful this movie was.",
