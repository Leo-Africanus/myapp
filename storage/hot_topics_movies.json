        "content": "Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. \n\n  \nIn the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.\n\n  \nThe first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2. \n\n\n\nI think it's such a crazy, bonkers idea that people would eat up, World War 2, based on a true story, Hollywood, celebrities, all in the same movie, I am absolutely shocked that nobody has made a movie about it, it seems like a perfect idea.

        "content": "Everywhere you look, Hollywood seems obsessed with looking back\u2014sequels, reboots, and endless reimaginings of classics. While it\u2019s comforting to revisit the worlds and characters we love, has this nostalgia-fueled wave come at the cost of originality?\n\nWhere are the bold, groundbreaking stories that once defined cinema? Are we clinging so tightly to the past that we\u2019ve stifled the creativity needed to move forward? Or is nostalgia a necessary ingredient in connecting generations through storytelling?\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014are we celebrating the art of filmmaking, or are we just endlessly chasing the echoes of what once was? Is this love for the past enriching cinema, or quietly suffocating it?",

        "content": "I went into this only knowing the 3 actors listed on this poster and that the setting was coming out of the housing recession. \n\nThe story follows Dennis Nash, played by Andrew Garfield, a recently unemployed construction worker that gets evicted by Rick Carver, played by Michael Shannon, because his house that him, his mom Lynn, played by Laura Dern, and his son Connor, played by Noah Lomax, was foreclosed on and is owned by the bank and Rick Carver is the one in charge of the evictions issued by the bank. Dennis and his mom and son had to move into a motel, and they immediately find out that others who were evicted moved into the same motel complex. Dennis is taking inventory of his tools that are in his toolboxes and notices some are missing, and goes to Carver's business to accuse one of the guys who was taking Dennis' stuff out of his house after he was evicted. Carver comes out to inform the guys of another eviction he has to serve and is impressed by Dennis' gumption and offers him a job to work as a repairman on properties Carver gets evicted, and Dennis accepts. Over time, Dennis becomes Carver's assistant and starts carrying out evictions himself. It's revealed over halfway through the film that Carver and Dennis have similar backstories with their fathers having worked hard for nothing in return. Dennis is then issued to serve an eviction to Frank Greene, played by Tim Guinee, who is his son's best friend's dad but Greene fights the eviction and says the court will overturn it. Dennis asks Carver to take his checks as payments for his old house, and Carver tells him he will buy the house from the bank then Dennis will owe him what he pays for it, with the caveat that he can't move in for a few weeks but he can make repairs and repaint. Dennis surprised his mom and son with the house and they start working on getting the house repaired and repainted. There's then a big argument between Dennis and one of the homeowners Dennis had evicted, who moved into the same motel, all the while Dennis denies knowing him, because his mom and son don't know how he was able to get their house back. It eventually comes out that Dennis works for the man who evicted home, after Dennis presents his mom and son with a new house that he bought after selling their old house, his mom and son not wanting to live there and leaves Dennis to stay with Lynn's brother. Rick then gets his hands on a multimillion dollar deal, but it's in jeopardy when it comes to light that Frank Greene's fighting the eviction and the file is missing a crucial piece to solidify the eviction, which Mr. Freeman, played by Clancy Brown, and Carver draw up and have Dennis get to the court to get the eviction finalized. When Dennis shows up to evict Frank, and finds out he's armed, Dennis explains to Frank that he gave a forged document to the court to get Frank evicted, which causes Frank to surrender. The movie ends with Dennis sitting in a police cruiser while cops talk to Carver in the distance and one of Frank's children coming up to Dennis, who smiles then runs off.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by this movie. It's a little under 2 hours long, and once Dennis and his family get evicted, the drama is pretty much nonstop. Michael Shannon is phenomenal as Rick Carver, you feel like he's up to no good instantly when you first get introduced to him. Andrew Garfield playing an unemployed single father, and Noah Lomax looking like he could be his son, were great castings. Laura Dern, as always, is great in this! I do love the backstories on both Dennis and Carver, even if we don't get Carver's backstory until the last 30 minutes or so. It's one I'm gonna have to watch again to see things I missed. \n\nMy rating: 4.5/5\n\nDo I recommend? Yes.\n\nBest performance: Michael Shannon\n",

        "content": "Mild spoilers for The Village. \n\nSo in one Treehouse of Horror episode, everyone dies in Springfield except Homer because he's testing out a bomb shelter. After enjoying the empty town a while, he discovers that not everyone died, but some were transformed into hideous mutants. His first response is \"Where did you get those cloaks?!\" I thought this was a lame/lazy joke and didn't snicker at all. \n\nWhen I watched The Village and the monster is chasing Bryce Dallas Howard, my reaction while it was stalking her through the forest was, \"How can a monster die fabric such a bright red?!\" That bothered me more then the fact it had a cloak at all. I can suspend disbelief to think it threw on a tattered robe or something, but a well-made vivid red cloak had me scoffing. Suddenly the Simpsons joke clicked and was humorous to me. \n\nThat's all.

This all just seems so god damned meaningless sometimes. This movie gets that. \n\nSome stupid stick figure shot on 35mm film so perfectly embodies that emptiness inside all of us.
