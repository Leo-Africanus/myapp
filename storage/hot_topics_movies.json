        "title": "Jojo Rabbit, a comedy about a 10 year old Nazi.",
        "content": "Jojo Rabbit\n\nA comedy about a ten year old boy who loves being a Nazi. That shouldn\u2019t work. When I first saw Jojo Rabbit, I didn\u2019t know much about it. All I saw was a quick summary along the lines of, \u201cA boy in Nazi Germany towards the end of WWII discovers that his mother has been helping a young Jewish girl hide out in their attic.\u201d I thought I was about to watch a serious drama, but then it kicks off with a little boy and his imaginary friend, Hitler, and their banter. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d I told myself.\n\n\n\nThis movie is very funny. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson at the youth camp are hilarious. Not only is the writing witty, the physical comedy hits the right notes of goofy. My favorite side character is Yorki. He gets to have the best lines:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m going home to my mom. I need a snuggle.\u201d\n* \u201cGuess I\u2019m just a kid trapped in a fat kid\u2019s body.\u201d\n* \u201cSomehow I just keep staying alive.\u201d\n* \"The Japanese are our only allies left, and between you and me, they don't really look that Aryan.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the movie does with tone throughout the runtime is what I believe makes it a great film. The first time we see Jojo looking upon people hanging in the square, and is told that what they did is what they could, this hilarious comedy lets us know that the reality of the situation is extremely bleak. We also find out that Jojo\u2019s father is in the war, and that his mother is having the hardest time raising a young boy who has been brainwashed by the Nazis\u2019 propaganda. When Johansson pretends that she is her husband, it really makes me feel bad that she is alone in trying to raise a boy amidst the war, a war that she hates and knows how her country is in the wrong.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cshoes scene\u201d, as I like to call it, may be the largest gut punch any comedy has ever put to screen. We just had seen the most tense scene, where we think that Elsa has been found out by the Gestapo, but then gets away. There is a butterfly and nice music, and it feels like maybe everything is going to be alright. But then we see the shoes. Again, how a comedy can turn the mood so fast is where this movie earns its greatness.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma Jojo finds himself in, where he wants to be a good Nazi and turn in the hiding Jewish girl, but he knows if he does so, he, and especially his mother, would be in trouble, is quite unique. If Jojo wasn\u2019t ten years old, I don\u2019t think this plot would work. How can we have any feelings for someone who loves Hitler? It makes me feel bad for any youth who are raised to hate others.\n\n\n\nSo how did Taika make a movie about Nazis funny? He made sure to let the audience know that Nazis are stupid. It has a repeating gag of Hitler offering him a cigarette. If you watch this movie and get nothing out of it, at least you will know, Nazis are stupid.\n\n",

Awesome story with awesome and entertaining characters.\n\nI loved the chance to see Immortan Joe and the Citadel again, and it gave us another fantastic scene of how much authority he holds over his minions. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even bother to respond to Dementus\u2019s comments, he has the people eater do it for him.\n\nThen that leads to a fantastic scene of a random war boy being chosen to represent how all of them would willingly blow themselves up in the Immortan Joe\u2019s name, or as the people eater words it\n\n\u201cAmong us, are 972 devout warriors. Any one of them, if chosen, would\u2019ve done the same. Each would die historic for the Immortan Joe. That\u2019s why you\u2019re fools, you\u2019re all fools for coming here!\u201d",

It\u2019s about a land owner with ties to Hawaiian ancestral owned land as he tries to come the grips with his wife\u2019s tragic motor boat accident and developing a good relationship with his daughters before finding out about an act his wife has committed before the accident. \n\nAlexander Payne has become bigger on my radar thanks to The Holdovers which is one of the best Christmas movies i\u2019ve seen in years and just all around fantastic. I\u2019ve wanted to venture out into his filmography and with this being the first one i\u2019ve seen, my god what else has this man made?\n\nThis has honestly gone down as a personal favorite all-time for me, I mean it really struck a cord with me. Go check it out if you can.",

        "title": "Movie endings that pissed you off?",
        "content": "I\u2019ll start first. Predators from 2010. This movie got a lot of mixed reviews and tbh, I always thought it was a alright movie. Actually I think it\u2019s one of the better Predator sequels if you compare it to the others. It still had its problems, but not a bad movie at all. However, I always fucking hated how this movie ended. Basically, a group of skilled people ranging from ex military, the yakuza, the cartel, and murderers are kidnapped and thrown into a alien planet where they\u2019re pitted against Predators where they have to battle and survive. The whole movie, these characters are trying to find a way to make it off this planet and go back home. Once you reach towards the end, Royce and Isabella are the last two standing and they manage to defeat the predators. However, the ship that they needed to go home is destroyed and now they have no way to leave the planet. Royce then grabs Isabella and says \u201cLet\u2019s get tf off this planet\u201d, and then the both of them walk off, ending the movie. I hate this because wasn\u2019t that literally the whole point of the movie? So basically nothing was accomplished and everything that they went through and those people that died was for nothing. Big waste of time. I guess it was a sequel bait but it was never made, and no I\u2019m not counting the comics. What is your thoughts on this if you have seen it and name a movie that pissed you off with its ending.",
