I've seen clips from Helms Deep at the end and I think I've made the right decision only watching the first 2/3 and stopping.",

Felt completely disconnected. Barely any mention or meaningful continuation of Pearl\u2019s story, and her presence in the movie was basically non-existent. Just a few brief appearances that didn\u2019t really do anything.\n\nI was expecting something deeper \u2014 like tying it all together, or at least acknowledging Pearl more. Instead it went in a totally different direction and didn\u2019t land for me at all. I kept waiting for it to feel like a proper sequel or conclusion to what X and Pearl built, but it never did.\n\nAnyone else feel like MaXXXine just didn\u2019t belong in the same trilogy?",

Super proud of it for the idea, it's done fully analog, shot on Kodak Gold, enlarged onto Fuji C-Print paper by Tricolor in Switzerland and then a friend of mine drew the titel with a silver pen onto the printed images.\n\nI like it because it represents the film quite well, it's set in the 80s, in a wooden shed where a scientist tries to build a time machine. Being in a cold, uncontrolled shed, it's hard to get perfect development of film, so the colors and exposure is a bit wanky, it really feels like a slightly rushed selfie.\n\nWe made 6 enlargments which we later on handed out to cast &amp; crew, which was pretty cool.\n\nThe film is now also finally on YouTube (You can find it by the title, by Faultea Films), after touring a couple Film Festivals and even winning two of them :) Not the easiest film to understand though.\n\nHappy for feedback!",

I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid and there's a bunch of stuff I have zero memories of (the bus movie begins with an elevator shaft rescue scene??).\n\nMy favorite part of this movie is Dennis Hopper, though. This has got to be the most unintentionally funny villain in all cinema. The guy will not shut up; he constantly yells JACK (Keanu's character) and its in Hopper's very specific accent so it just all sounds hilarious. I don't think there is a single moment in the film where he has a neutral expression on his face.",

        "content": "Going thru random 90s stuff I haven't seen, I just made it thru The Parent Trap. The stuff at the very beginning of this are ELECTRIC. But after they make the switch, the whole movie operates in a lower key. The rest of what turns out to be a very shallow romantic comedy of remarriage just drained the life out of me! \n\nI got wondering, what are some other movies that start off really strong and then just kinda fizzle out? I'm thinking more a long opening sequence vs a smaller scene (like when they recipe the previous films in the Planet of the Apes series or the MCU).\nThe wilder the swing the better!\n",

Motorbikes, light glaive (my fav weapon in my fav game), fantastic scifi game (the arena battle), hot girl with big eyes, and light themed battle jets, oh and escaping the real world.\n\n2010's 8yo me would've gave this movie a ten and downloaded malware instead of the sequel.\n\nMe personally i gave it an 8 because it delivered on most of my expectations. \n\n I expect Tron Ares to be corny as this one but marvel style since that seems to be a trend these days. And I'm gonna love it. I've watched over 300 movies and this will be my 3rd time going to a cinema and only my 2nd movie ever to watch in a cinema.\n\nexcited!",
