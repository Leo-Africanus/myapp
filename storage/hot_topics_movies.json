But I don't think hanging off cliffs or holding his breath for 10 mintues are his true forte. \n\nFor me, Cruise's best roles have always been men who are deeply broken and fight vigorously and belligerently to deny that reality. Collateral, Magnolia, Minority Report, Eyes Wide Shut, War of the Worlds, all of these performances, I find to be the most compelling in his career, because they all carry that contradiction of an emotionally and psychologically broken and stunted man, fighting vigorously to maintain a facade of having it together.\n\nIf Cruise is hanging up the parachutes and helicopters for good, now, I think he should look past Xenu and revive that Seminarian guilt, and maybe finally get that Oscar.",

It was the best animation I\u2019ve ever seen, and it was quite a journey.\n\nThe reason I am glad we didn\u2019t watch that at the last sleepover, is that it wouldn\u2019t have been the right setting, right time, or most importantly, right place. Just me and mom, crying like full grown adults, at this movie. If you want to watch it, you can, but brace yourself, it has a safer end then you would expect.\n\nThe thumbnail and the trailer throws you off guard. You think it\u2019ll be a movie that, this cat makes friends, figures out how to drain the flood; happy ending. YOU WOULD BE WRONG\n\nI won\u2019t spoil unless you want me to, but holy.\n\n(Sorry I vented a little lol)",

I initially thought the film was glorifying corporate culture, but as it unfolded, it revealed a much deeper commentary on its toxicity\u2014both for those who enforce it and those who suffer from it. I loved how it emphasized the importance of human connection.  \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the contrast between Clooney\u2019s and Kendrick\u2019s characters. He\u2019s a loner who avoids attachment yet insists on conducting layoffs face-to-face (perhaps because it allows him to keep traveling). Meanwhile, she values connection but prefers to handle things remotely, through a screen. It almost feels like the movie is making contradictory points.  \n\nAnd Vera\u2019s character\u2014that completely took me out. I still don\u2019t know how to process that revelation.\n\nIdk if anyone else has seen this movie. It was released in 2009, and Im just seeing it NOW! How\u2019d I miss it? What do you guys think?",

        "content": "So I really like the movie, I think it does a good job translating some very challenging source material. It\u2019s got its flaws, but I think overall it\u2019s an entertaining movie.\n\nI do see a lot of people claim it misses the point of the book, specifically in how the heroes are portrayed, but I think that\u2019s a little unfair.\n\nIn my opinion, the heroes are still very much portrayed as incredibly flawed individuals. Rorschach is still a homophobic psychopath (I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say that was cut out of the movie, but he definitely still says bigoted stuff), the Comedian is still a douche, Dr Manhattan is increasingly apathetic, and Nite Owl has to fight crime just to get hard rather than out of the goodness of his heart.\n\nI think a lot of it comes down to how people perceive Snyders style in the movie. The main argument is that the way he frames action and the camera makes the heroes look too badass. I can kind of see that criticism, but it doesn\u2019t change what kind of people they are. Just because Rorschach has a cool shot in the rain doesn\u2019t make him any less of a nut job.\n\nAs for the action, I feel like it\u2019s deliberately shot in an exaggerated violent way to make the characters look even more irresponsible and messy, like in the alleyway mugging. I feel like it makes Silk Spectre and Nite Owl not look very heroic to see them getting excited over the prospect of breaking bones out of peoples arms. It may be shot in a cool way, but it also demonstrates how that lifestyle might seem intoxicating for the characters ",

        "content": "As a child, I adored this movie, and upon rewatching it last Sunday, I found it even more hilarious than I remembered.\n\nThis time, the famous Gauls embark on a new adventure in Egypt, tasked with helping an architect construct a grand palace for Cleopatra who was in a dick mesuring contest with Cesar\u2014in just three months. Naturally, their mission is far from simple, as adversaries lurk in the shadows, ready to thwart their efforts.\n\nWhat makes this film truly exceptional is its relentless humor, with an impressive density of jokes per minute. The clever wordplay in the characters' names\u2014Num\u00e9robis, Amonbofis, Itineris, Feudartifis, Antivirus\u2014adds a layer of wit, while the visual comedy is equally remarkable. The inventive animated sequence set in total darkness, the martial arts-inspired fight between Jamel Debbouze and G\u00e9rard Darmon, and the slow-motion chase of a Roman soldier by Id\u00e9fix are just a few examples of the film\u2019s brilliant comedic timing.\n\nEven though some of its stars are no longer as widely appreciated today\u2014and for valid reasons\u2014the film was also carried by an impressive cast of A-listers, including Christian Clavier, Alain Chabat, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Monica Bellucci. Their performances contributed significantly to the film\u2019s charm and enduring appeal.\n\nA true delight, this movie remains a timeless masterpiece of humor.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Just got done watching this film and it\u2019s a classic, it\u2019s one of the funniest films ever made. A spectacular land race from New York to Paris in the early 20th century is planned, the two main competitors being the handsome, dashing hero in white, The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis), and the dastardly, black-suited Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). While Fate's sidekick, Max (Peter Falk), attempts to sabotage Leslie and the other racers, Leslie finds an unlikely ally in Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), a suffragette and journalist-turned-racer whose car breaks down halfway through the event. Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood are awesome together. Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk come off likable even though they are the villains of the film and their chemistry is great. It also has one of the best pie fights in cinema. I also loved how the film played out like a live action cartoon.",

        "title": "Pixar absolutely cooked with The Incredibles (2004)",
        "content": "More than 20 years and dozens and dozens of feature-length superhero movies later, I still think that **The Incredibles** sits at the top of the list by a fairly wide margin. \n\nThis movie has so much to say about personal and familial growth. Every member the family is well-written in their struggle with finding their place in the family and in the greater world. On top of that each one of their superpowers perfectly reflects their character\u2019s *personal* strengths and weaknesses without being hamfisted about it! You get to see how both suppression and expression of their powers affects each family member differently. \n\n\nIt\u2019s really a masterclass in movie writing and I only scratched the surface: the retro-futuristic setting, the surprisingly emotional and intense story beats, the villain\u2026 all of it is so thoughtful and well-executed.\n\nThen there\u2019s the music, the voice acting, and the creative *action*! \n\nBrad Bird\u2019s fingerprints are all over the action set pieces. From the kids discovering the broader range of their superpower abilities while under extreme pressure, to Bob\u2019s strength paired with his brute force tactics, to Helen\u2019s ingenuity and quick-thinking skills in both the plane and hallway sequences, all of it is so clever and entertaining. \n\nThe absolute worst thing I can say about this movie is that the animation looks 20 years old, because it is. But otherwise this movie has been both a blessing and a curse all these years for me because I hold every other superhero movie to this standard. Unfortunately 95% of them have not been even close to this level of excellence. \n\n\n\n",
