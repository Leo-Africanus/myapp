Every character felt charming and fleshed out enough for their role in the story. I really was rooting for Inigo, hoping Westley and buttercup would find a way to end up together. There were funny enough gags to get a chuckle out of me like the mawwage part towards the end. I just wanted to get a short rant off about how much I love this movie",

I even found Principal Mullins (Joan Cusack) to be over the top in all ways. And despite this, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) absolutely steals the show and magically brings along a bunch of kids to fit in perfectly.\n\nWhile watching it, I couldn\u2019t help but think ANY other actor on earth as Dewey Finn and this movie is very quickly just horrible. Who else can do what he does? Or has their own version that fits here?\n\nWhat are some other movies that would seemingly be awful with a different actor/actress, but are actually really great because a special talent pulled it off?",

There are at least two scenes that no matter how many times I have seen the film cause tears to fall down my face.\n\nThe movie itself is unique in that there are no true antagonists, except for the past and the pride and bitterness that keeps us from forgiveness. There are two heroes you are equally invested in. \n\nIf you have held out on seeing it because you aren\u2019t into MMA, don\u2019t short change yourself, I am not into MMA either.

Since my parents had a lot of kids, they took every chance they could to send us to Grandmas for a few days visit whenever possible. She was my guide to the  wonders of cinema.\n\nWith her, I would often be taken to the Hollywood CineramaDome and saw a number of films that deeply imprinted on me, a thirteen year old: Thunderball, How the West Was Won, Grand Prix and others. I am very sure that Grandma enjoyed them just as much, in their 70mm CinemaScope goodness and awesome sound for the time.\n\nWho was this person for you?",

Doesn't even have to necessarily be a break-up movie as long as it covers these themes of self-exploration and improvement. Thanks.",

        "content": "It can be anything, happiness, sadness, dread, loneliness, love, hate, any type of unique and distinct emotion that the movie can give you in a special way.\n\nMine is Fantastic Mr. Fox. I don't know how to explain it, but the movie feels familiar and cozy to me in a weird way, it is like a warm blanket. The movie is the only one that I personally consider perfect and a 10/10. \n\nEverything from the dialog, comedy, soundtrack, animation, voice acting, everything makes me feel so good. The color palette in specifc makes me feel... Happy? Cozy? It reminds me of home, even though my home never had that color palette. It reminds me of autumn, the unquestionable best season of the year.\n\nI have watched Fantastic Mr. Fox about 30 times now, and I think I will watch it again today. It's so weird how good it makes me feel, sometimes I catch myself crying a bit at random scenes that aren't even relevant, mostly establishing shots for some reason. \n\nIt is truly fantastic.",

But outside of the campfest, Aprile is a natural onscreen. Maisie is a shy but lovely child who yearns for a stable family and finds that in her mother's boy toy and her dad's girlfriend.",
