        "content": "I rewatched this movie for the first time in a while yesterday and was reminded of how much damn fun this movie is. Each part of the anthology has something else going on it, and carries the energy through, which is hard to do in a collection type work like this.\n\n\n\nAnthology pieces invite comparison, and I think the short pieces collected here work well together.\n\n\n\nStandout moments for me:\n\n\n1. Steven Root chasing James Franco down in a homemade suit of armor as Franco tries to shoot him. \"PAN SHOT.\"\n\n\n2. Everything in Meal Ticket. Neeson plays such a convincing sleazebag. This one packs a punch.\n\n\n\n3. Tom Waits in the one about the prospector hunting for gold. The land itself is a character here. I could watch him work in the wilderness all day.\n\n\n\n4. Every. Dang. Second. of the Oregon Trail love tragedy. The stuff about her brother's dog, named President Pierce, holds a special spot in my heart. \"President Pierce is a nervous creature, and excited by animals larger than himself.\" \"Almost all animals are larger than President Pierce.\"\n\n\n\n5. The last sketch is the only one that doesn't pack quite a punch, and whose ending is telegraphed early on, but watching Tyne Daly and Brendan Gleeson play off one another in the coach is pretty great.\n\n\n\n\nI think this movie deserved more notice than it got, celebrated in some circles though it was.",

        "content": "Did anyone else feel like American Assassin was a completely different movie in the first half? I thought it was brilliant when Mitch was first getting recruited\u2014gritty, intense, and personal. But then, once he started working for the government, it felt like a more generic action film.\n\nHonestly, I think it would\u2019ve been way more interesting if he had gone rogue, hunting terrorists on his own while also being pursued by the government. The grounded, raw style of the first half just hit differently, and I wish the movie had stuck with that vibe.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way?",

        "content": "There are movies from the late great Gene Hackman that everyone has seen and there are ones few have seen.  \u201cNight Moves\u201d seems pretty obscure.  It is a nod to film noir.  Gene Hackman is great in it plus it features two very young but famous actors in Melanie Griffith and James Woods.  The plot twists hold up pretty well in terms of realism and believability.  The movie is super 70\u2019s down to the fondue pots.  I strongly suspect that the final confrontation on the boat was an homage to \u201cKey Largo\u201d with Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson.",

        "content": "I'm trying to remember the movie, it is a modern action movie, where two people were camped out behind a wall ready to infiltrate something. One guy asks the other to look and see how many people there are. The other turns his head really fast and takes a look and when the first guy asks \"how many are there\" he says \"I don't know I looked too fast.\"\n\n  \nPart of me thinks it's a Kevin Hart movie like Central Intelligence, but I cant find any references to it on the Google.",
