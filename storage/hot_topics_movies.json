My take:\n\n\\- Had the third film been good, Reloaded would have probably got a pass as a 'shaky' middle act in a great trilogy\n\n\\- Most of the bitter after taste comes from Revolutions\n\n\\- There were enough interesting ideas to have it be more than one great film, but the execution collapses\n\n\\- Neo and Trinity would be better as friends\n\n\\- Smith's character falls apart after the first film, he goes from delightfully cold and efficient, to gimmicky, then weirdly angry\n\n\\- Morpheus feels like a passenger with nothing to do, which was a critical mistake\n\n\\- We need to care about Zion, but there's no one there that we like. Morpheus could be there, but instead he's flying around on a ship for some reason\n\n\\- The architect scene made a surprising amount of sense, if your attention span is on\n\n\\- Rehashing the iconic lobby scene in Revolutions was baffling\n\n\\- The Zion council is unbearable and speak as if they have access to the film's script\n\n\\- The machines don't feel too threatening... they fly around in octopus swarms a lot\n\n\\- You could rewrite both Reloaded and Revolutions into great films if you took a different direction",

        "content": "**Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sinners_2025): 100% (30 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/): 83 (15 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/):\n\n&gt;It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):\n\n&gt;*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star. Word to the wise: the end credits are more like a Marvel movie as they are interrupted by a longish extra scene that includes all of special cast member, Blues legend Buddy Guy\u2019s role, plus yet another musical number at the end of credits.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/):\n\n&gt;The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It\u2019s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):\n\n&gt;\"Sinners\" is several things at once \u2014 a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original \"Assault on Precinct 13\" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography \u2013 but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/):\n\n&gt;\u201cSinners\u201d is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema \u2014 epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It\u2019s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):\n\n&gt;If cinema weren\u2019t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*\u2019s electric fusion of genres \u2013 historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner \u2013 would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I\u2019m one of them; I\u2019d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness\n\nVanity Fair (80):\n\n&gt; Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film\u2019s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by Ryan Coogler:\n\n&gt;Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.\n\nCast:\n\n* Michael B. Jordan\n* Hailee Steinfeld\n* Miles Caton\n* Jack O'Connell\n* Wunmi Mosaku\n* Jayme Lawson\n* Omar Benson Miller\n* Li Jun Li\n* Delroy Lindo",

You\u2019re pretty much placed in an arena with the most abominable creatures imaginable whilst essentially being on hallucinogens. ",

Like true examples for everyone imo.\n\nThey are kind, as in their offer support and want to help their children. They even adopted one.\n\nThey are humorous, they continuously joke around to their kids and to eachother and constantly smiling. The 'I am adopted' joke was hilarious.\n\nThey show love, they are concerned about their daughter but not in a dramatic way. They ask if something is wrong and if they can help and when their daughter says no they drop the subject but still keep an eye on her. Also they show love to eachother.\n\nThis kind of parenting style isnt for everyone of course, but imo it's near perfect! What are more perfect parents in film?",

It's not going to win any academy awards for sure, but I feel the Rotten Tomatoes score of 9% isn't a fair rating. The sequel maybe, but that's a different story.\n\nFor me this is another comedy that doesn't take it self too seriously and is a fun watch with a ton of quotable scenes.",

        "content": "Here are some of mine:\n\n\nCruel Intentions: https://youtu.be/UzlKsS-IhEo?si=73QEZnZkFHTsKmat\n \n\n- I like the way they blend music, and SMG is such a snake in this ... I love that it comes through in the feel of the movie. And gotta love that end cap scene, like trailers do. It's so representative of the movie and how tawdy and scandalous these characters are\n\n\nBlack Snake Moan: \nhttps://youtu.be/j7Z7Cf9IDGw?si=CFIIrIOBp9Zm0jSr\n\n\n- I know a lot of people think this trailer gave the wrong impression of what the movie was actually about, but after seeing it I think it perfectly encapsulates what it's about. And the music is really well interwoven in it. But in particular I absolutely love the montage of Rhey giving into her vices, which I think a lot of us can relate to in one way or another for a lot of reasons. It's so colorful and punchy, and it's really cool how they edited it to mirror Rhey, giving it that pulpy vibe that's inherent in the movie's set up. Lastly, I think it's representative of how we glorify/romanticize hedonism (if that's the right word), despite how it might negatively impact our lives. \n\n\nSuicide Squad:\nhttps://youtu.be/PLLQK9la6Go?si=wRjC2ZoWobUiK5dw\n\n\n- Who didn't like this trailer? There's something special about it, with the song they used ... You can sense how impactful it should have been. But I personally suspect the reason people really vibe with it (and as is evidenced given the popularity of the character) is because it plays as though it's a story mainly revolving around Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. I think there's something endearing about seeing people who exhibit different styles and qualities, which you get a wealth of here. It deepens people's sense of mystery and a person's complexity, but overall I think it's because she's high spirited, wild and free, while being kinda crazy that people see themselves (or who they wish they could be) in her ... A life force of epic proportions, going through the motions, but beautiful in their own peculiar and unique way. It's too bad the movie couldn't live up to this trailer. \n\nHigh Tension:\nhttps://youtu.be/ZsfqXekOvJQ?si=5KxgKkZHuIdRNAHN\n\n- This is a great little trailer for a relatively obscure horror movie. The cover song really makes it, as does the editing. \nNote that this isn't the exact trailer I was looking for, which lessens it's impact as an audio-visual wonder in my book. There's something missing right before it cuts to the chorus and things ramp up ... The original trailer was less jarring than that. ",
