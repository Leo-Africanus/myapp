Just a straight up action thriller with a no nonsense plot.\n\nLoved the overall screenplay of the movie, it was an edge of the seat thriller in the 2nd half. The craziness turns upto eleven in the final third. An engaging popcorn flick for the afternoon",

Now I\u2019m intensely aware that they\u2019re fake, and that this is a movie, and whatever deaths or danger I see from now on are all just pretend.

        "content": "That movie seems like a pure perfection in many aspects and it should have got a proper marketing and recognition back then. It is not just \"parody\", it is a great sci-fi movie but with a huge heart, with actors having an absolute blast. It is also much better than many movies it actually digs into. Characters develop, and you see them grow also as a group.\n\nI just rewatched it and I think the older I get, the more and more I can appreciate how brilliant and well done some scenes are.\n\nThe shuttle landing scene is so funny....you have ACTORS flying to an unknown planet, where  \"Laredo\" obviously has no idea how to fly that thing, then Sam Rockwell\u00b4s Guy gets hysterical and yells for mum, holding Gwen\u00b4s hands (who is disgusted), Jason trying to encourage them, Fred Kwan (hilarious Tony Shalhoub) eating something, totally unbothered by all of it and Alan Rickman (God, I miss him!) saying \"Are we there yet?\"\n\nI think it is actually one of the most hilarious scenes ever - followed by even more hilarious scene on the planet itself.\n\nI loved the fact that Rickman played the \"classically trained\" actor (who was supposed to be smart thanks to it, according to Laredo) who got caught in the green screen (sort of) world. We look at it differently today, of course, you have many British actors with Shakespearen background playing superheroes or action heroes but this was of course a different time. And it is obviously aimed not only at Shatner/Nimoy relationship but Patrick Stewart as well, with him being respected stage actor. But it is done respectfully and Stewart himself said he laughed so much that he had tears in his eyes.",

        "content": "I truly liked Ming Na's casting as Chun Li and I appreciated the fact they were faithful to her story and that, even though she doesn't fight much in the movie, you do see she's a force to be reckoned with when she breaks those handcuffs and beats the living daylights out of Bison. \n\nWhat's more to like? Raul Julia goes ham and plays Bison in the only way which could work, a cruel dictator but also had a debonair side about him. I enjoyed seeing him whenever he was on. Raul Julia knew how to play bad guys. Andrew Bryniarski is hilarious as Zangief, I always think a big bearish Russian man who's really a softie at heart is the way to go. The movie is never boring, it's fast paced and the fight scenes are exciting to watch. \n\nNow, I have to be honest. I thought Jean Claude Van Damme was miscast as Guile. Maybe the blonde Bart Simpson hair would have been too much but I don't know, I didn't feel Van Damme gave Guile any distinguishing features. This is a character that is interchangeable from any of his previous characters. \n\nI was disappointed that Ken and Ryu were made out to be bumbling  clowns. They were supposed to be the main leads and while they do have a goofy side to them, they're not incompetent and I thought this movie made them out to be morons who were nerfed because this was really a Van Damme vehicle since no way is Guile the protagonist of a Street Fighter movie. I think they spent more time getting beat up than saving the day. \n\nOverall, a decent video game martial arts movie, enlivened by nostalgia, but 90s Mortal Kombat or the animated movie of Street Fighter are a lot better.",

        "content": "The guy has really been becoming one of my favorite actors in the past couple years. The guy is just so watchable and he is great in everything. Juror 2, Nosferatu, The Menu etc. I watched the new Superman trailer and I can tell that he\u2019s gonna crush this role as Lex Luthor! He\u2019s one of those actors now that when I hear that he\u2019s in something, it immediately peaks my interest. Dude just has a likability and a charisma. He might be the best Lex Luthor since Gene Hackman!",

        "content": "My number one is La vita e bella. I just love Roberto Benigni's work. It's a classic you remember for the rest of your life and the movie that has a truly great impact on you. Generally speaking I adore Italian cinematography and love their comedies. It's very similar to my type of humor and it makes me relaxed. Every Italian movie I've watched has got a deeper meaning of life behind it so I find movies like that precious. Which one is your favorite and why? ",

        "title": "'Final Destination: Bloodlines' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Plagued by a violent and recurring nightmare, a college student heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle of death and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.*\n\nDirector: Zach Lipovsky, Adam Stein\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_bloodlines)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/final-destination-bloodlines/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Schech](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236214028/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not whether but *how* the victims will die that gives these films their juice, and *Final Destination Bloodlines* doesn\u2019t disappoint. It does get bogged down in a tedious plotline revolving around dysfunctional family dynamics that makes you impatient for the deaths to start coming. But once they do, the grisly fun resumes. The gory set pieces, involving such things as a lawnmower, a garbage truck, and, most spectacularly, an MRI machine, are so cleverly orchestrated that the audience at the preview screening applauded each one as if they were song-and-dance numbers. The combination of CGI and practical effects works seamlessly, and the sequences are sadistically edited for maximum tension, which is thankfully relieved by frequent doses of mordant humor.\n\n[DEADLINE - Gregory Nussen](https://deadline.com/2025/05/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236394628/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a raucously good time, replete with enough subtle nods to previous entries and cheekily placed music cues for the most loyal of the franchise\u2019s fans. That it also includes some genuinely heartfelt moments, including a nicely written farewell to the series\u2019 lone consistent member William Bludworth (the late, truly great Tony Todd), is a delicious cherry on top of this reliable, horrific recipe dripping in blood and guts.\n\n[IGN - Tom Jorgensen](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-destination-bloodlines-review) \\- 8/10 (Great)\n\n&gt;In Final Destination: Bloodlines, death is the life of the party. There\u2019s little novelty to the boilerplate family trauma plot of this sixth Final Destination movie, but what its comedy-forward take on the franchise\u2019s established formula lacks in thematic depth, it more than makes up for with delightful, well-designed kills and boundless gallows humor. A testament to the powerful, simple joy of a well-executed setup and payoff, Bloodlines\u2019 lethal Rube Goldberg machines are tactile and satisfying, benefiting from a solid blend of goopy practical and visual effects. It\u2019s a fantastic jumping-on point for new fans, but the Final Destination faithful are well taken care of with cheeky references to previous movies and a truly poignant farewell from one of the horror genre\u2019s late kings, Tony Todd.\n\n[The Guardian - Radheyan Simonpillai](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/13/final-destination-bloodlines-review-horror) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;Where Bloodlines excels is in the clever and often diabolical storytelling craft and visuals. There\u2019s a decadence in the film-making that isn\u2019t at odds with the campy nature of Final Destination but instead realizing its full potential.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller ](https://www.avclub.com/final-destination-bloodlines-review)\\- B-\n\n&gt;As the *Final Destination* films have continued on, they\u2019ve gotten meaner, less superficially concerned with survival and more explicitly giddy at the prospect of a nasty death trap or a jumpy \u201ccrushed by a huge thing in an instant\u201d reversal. *Final Destination Bloodlines* embraces this late-period slasher-minus-slasher construction, with Lipovsky and Stein eagerly constructing deaths into applause moments celebrated with the same bursts of bloody confetti. These movies are built to be splattery supercuts showcasing the warped imaginations of horror filmmakers and special effects professionals, exploiting the call of the void that everyday objects can sound throughout our lives. *Bloodlines* does so playfully and lightly, without getting bogged down by franchise lore or pesky cinematic tropes like \u201ccharacters.\u201d The long gap between series entries means the film doesn\u2019t need to subvert expectations, but merely play into them\u2014in doing so, it\u2019s a success as simple as its death traps are convoluted.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Josh Parham](https://nextbestpicture.com/final-destination-bloodlines/) \\- 7/10\n\n&gt;This franchise loves to utilize the wind as an element to signal death\u2019s encroaching presence. It was easy to fall into parody before, but there, it was deployed in a manner that is both unsettling and ludicrous. That is the perfect summation of this film. It swerves towards originality in some places and doesn\u2019t break the mold in others, but it has a firm grasp on exuberant violence that will captivate a cheering audience that revels in a character being squashed under a falling piano. If you\u2019re that type of sicko, then this one will be one of the better rides this series has to offer.",
