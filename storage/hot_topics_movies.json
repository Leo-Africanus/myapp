What is that movie for you, and what is it about it that holds up so well on the tenth, or even twentieth, viewing? Is it the nostalgia, the characters, the soundtrack, or something else entirely?\n\n",

I also LOVED Prey...and I can say it's better than Prey.\n\nI'm not going to go into any story details unless someone asks, but I'm just going to say this...this ISN'T a \"reboot/remake\" of the Predator story. It's not \"Group of tough humans get hunted by an unkillable monster until they figure out to fight back.\" There are very few \"horror\" elements...this movie is hard Sci-Fi.\n\nThis is \"Young, inexperienced Predator who is still learning to Predator has to prove himself....and then goes on a surprisingly endearing buddy adventure with an android on a planet that is actively trying to kill him.\"\n\nIt is very much a new story...not like Prey that was sort of a remake. It's very much Deks story...he's a REAL character, and actually has a character journey that's surprisingly endearing. Like...you actually CARE about him...which is really unexpected.\n\nIf you're looking for a remake of Predator, you're not going to get it. If you're looking for something new that expands on the      Predator lore and universe that's never been done before...you're really going to enjoy it.",

To me it\u2019s the pinnacle of the dumb 2000s action movie, with all the ridiculous tropes, style and zany performance that one could ask for.\n\nJames McAvoy is so much fun in this movie - the way he throws himself into the role, and constantly looks like he is about to have some sort of breakdown is absolutely hilarious. You also got Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and Chris Pratt, which is just a killer combination.\n\nThe story is for the most part laughable, but honestly I think the movie is aware of it. And there is a still a little bit of heart there, in the sense that it is about a person struggling with anxiety attacks and depression, who manages to escape his crushing life and actualise himself. For what it is, it\u2019s actually nicely done and McAvoy really sells it.",

I felt like I was going crazy while watching it and honestly loved it. Are there any other movies like this? I'd take shows as well. Just something that has that tone and vibe and principal where you don't understand what's going on And it's scary and it makes you feel like you're going insane while watching it you really feel that panic and confusion with the protagonist feels. Big plus if it's also kind of scary and as weird creepy stuff going on like Jacob's ladder did or like silent Hill the game does. Thank you guys I'm kind of new here so just kind of trying to broaden my horizons to something that's not sci-fi and traditional horror movies",
