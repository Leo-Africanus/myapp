        "content": "I randomly decided to rewatch Children of Men the other night and I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for how hard it would hit. I remembered it being good, but I had forgotten just how immersive and intense it is.\n\nFrom the very first scene the world feels completely lived in. The long takes, the grime, the handheld camera work. It doesn\u2019t feel like a movie, it feels like you\u2019re there. That car scene in the woods is still one of the most jaw-dropping sequences I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how relevant it still feels. The fear, the hopelessness, the way people cling to whatever\u2019s left. It\u2019s all eerily familiar now. And yet there\u2019s something deeply human at the heart of it. That moment with the crying baby floored me.\n\nIt\u2019s not a loud movie but it says everything it needs to. Just pure cinema.\n\nCurious if anyone else has revisited it recently. Did it hit you as hard as it did me?",

I ended that movie DEPRESSED, and with a single thought haunting me: The Wasteland is *fucking hell*. Like, no hyperbole, if I die and go to hell, I would not be surprised that was it. My absolute worse fucking nightmare. \n\nWomen being reduced to breeding stock and exploided like cows for their breast milk. Healthy people being hunted down to be used as blood bags for soldiers that die in the thousands in an extremely violent war for resouces among diseases and cults and cannibals. A burning hot, endless, dead, inescapable desert ruled by the worse of the worse, the most perverted, sadistic, selfish, power hungry, evil men humanity can create. I know Furiosa strong as hell because I would have killed myself.\n\nBut I am curious what other people consider the worse ones.",

When your rowboat gets close to shore, you hop out and help drag it the rest of the way to land\u2026 Completely soaking your socks and shoes in the process. We (the audience) never heard your shoes \u201c*squick-squick-squick*\u201d while you walk, we never hear you complain about how uncomfortable it is to walk in wet shoes for 3 hours, we never hear a comrade mention the musty smell emanating from your waterlogged footwear.\n\nWhat are some other real-life annoyances that our characters silently suffer through?",

The atmosphere, the music, the emotional weight... it's incredible how Spielberg captured that sense of wonder, loneliness, and friendship all in one story.\n\nThere\u2019s something timeless about the way it blends sci-fi with deep emotional storytelling. No crazy CGI or fast pacing, just heart. It inspired so many filmmakers and still feels relevant today.\n\nOut of admiration for the film, I recently created a short cinematic tribute \u2014 I\u2019ll leave it in the comments if anyone\u2019s curious. Would love to hear if *E.T.* had a similar impact on any of you.",

Pacing doesn't drag at all, especially for the time. \n\nDefinitely one of Chris Cooper's all time performances. All four of the kids are great. I'm surprised that it doesn't get more recognition. Absolutely worth a revisit if you haven't seen it in a while.",

        "content": "It's interesting in the age of internet and on-demand trailers that movie posters are still relevant.  The best manage to convey the genre, vague elements of the plot, perhaps highlight some of the characters, and offer something visually stimulating to hold your attention.\n\nI'd love to hear about some examples, but for my money the original Star War poster is both iconic and a delight.  Rather than photography, they used an artistic interpretation.  In it you'll see our protagonist looking heroic in a traditional fantasy pose, the main villain looming in the background, a few side characters sprinkled in, and the setting of the denouement floating in the top corner.  The tagline \"In a galaxy far, far away...\" is intriguing as well.  The entire package communicates this is a sci-fi epic.\n\n[Star Wars](https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/image_b81aed27.jpeg)\n\nSo, what do you think?  What are some other great movie posters that set the bar for modern films or have stood the test of time?",

        "content": "I've seen a fair few posts about movies people think have a reputation for being better or worse than their reputation would suggest, so I thought it would be interesting to discuss reputations about aspects of the movie beyond its quality. \n\nSome examples of what I'm talking about based on my own opinions:\n\n1. Inception: This movie has a reputation for being confusing or hard to follow, but tbh I don't think it's either of those. The movie does a lot to explain the rules of the world and the mechanics of dreams, and each dream level has a distinct enough setting that it's clear which level a scene is taking place in. The only thing about the movie that I think could be considered confusing is the ending, but to me that's not so much confusing as it is deliberately open-ended.\n\n2. Sinister: This one is interesting because it's not really a reputation that cropped up naturally, but rather it came from a study on horror movies, but the movie is sort of branded as the scariest horror movie ever made, and I don't think that's the case. I really like Sinister, I think it's a good horror movie with some tense moments, but it's never one that's jumped out at me as especially scary in the grand scheme of the genre.",
