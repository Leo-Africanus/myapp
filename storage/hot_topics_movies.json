        "content": "Hey r/movies! We're Freddie Gibbs and Ryan Prows, here to answer your questions. \n\nSome info about us:\n\n&gt;Freddie Gibbs is an American rapper who has made a name for himself with a series of self-released mixtapes throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. Following his first properly distributed release, the Str8 Killa EP (2010), he began releasing proper studio albums, including the well-received Madlib collaboration Pi\u00f1ata (2014), Shadow of a Doubt (2015), and You Only Live 2wice (2017). After he issued the commercial mixtape Freddie (2018), he reunited with Madlib for Bandana (2019), and with the Alchemist cooked up Alfredo (2020). The latter became his first LP to crack the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and subsequently earned a Grammy Award nomination.\n\n\n\n&gt;Ryan Prows is an American filmmaker. He won a Student Academy Award for his AFI thesis film NARCOCORRIDO, and his cult debut feature film LOWLIFE (2017) was hailed by audiences and critics alike as \"a seriously nasty treat\". He also directed a segment for \"V/H/S/94\" (2021).\n\nWe worked together on NIGHT PATROL. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J\\_pMGZScB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J_pMGZScB8)\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nAn LAPD officer discovers a police task force is harbouring a horrific secret that endangers residents of the housing projects he grew up in.\n\n**Cast:** \n\nJermaine Fowler, Justin Long, Freddie Gibbs, RJ Cyler, YG, Nicki Micheaux, Flying Lotus, CM Punk, and Dermot Mulroney.\n\nIt's out in theaters starting this weekend via Shudder!\n\nAsk us anything.

But most of its richest pleasures come down to Fiennes going balls to the wall with a truly memorable character \u2014 half lunatic and half visionary. He elevates the movie whenever he\u2019s onscreen.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/01/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-nia-dacosta-ralph-fiennes-1236680553/):\n\n&gt;Key to this is Fiennes\u2019 commando performance, a *tour de force* with so few f\\*cks given that the film\u2019s astonishing, electrifying climax could put him back into the awards conversation with a part that couldn\u2019t be further away from *Conclave*\u2019s Cardinal Thomas. O\u2019Connell, too, confirms his villainous chops with a subtle variation on his *Sinners* role, playing a seductive but sick, delusional psycho who kids himself that he has the devil\u2019s ear.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-ralph-fiennes-1236630014/) (90):\n\n&gt;For genre aficionados, it\u2019s bold, mind-bending work which satisfies that so-often-frustrated craving: for a zombie movie with brains.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter) (8/10):\n\n&gt;28 Years Later: The Bone Temple picks up the same plot but tells a very different story in a surprisingly funny, exceptionally brutal new chapter for the franchise.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (84):\n\n&gt;Nia DaCosta\u2019s smart, freaky sequel zooms in on the ongoing battle between sense and senselessness until it finds strong, connective tissue between science and religion.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-1235172860/) (83):\n\n&gt;A strange, hysterical, and thrillingly audacious continuation of a saga about the nature of faith in a godless world, \u201cThe Bone Temple\u201d might appear to be a more traditional genre offering than its immediate predecessor, but don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that it wasn\u2019t shot on an iPhone: This is very much the part two that 2025\u2019s smartest and most humane studio horror movie deserves.\n\n[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/28-years-later-bone-temple-movie-review-8108fc8e8882a28ef0a26fd9f187d92e) (88):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s plenty of good music in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, including Radiohead\u2019s \u201cEverything in Its Right Place\u201d and one of the most gloriously unhinged uses of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d ever conceived. If the previous film had a Fellini-esque vibe, this one has punky, anarchic feel.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple/) (80):\n\n&gt;Simpler, but also bolder and bloodier, than its predecessor, The Bone Temple is a more-than-worthy sequel.\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;Nia DaCosta turns things up to 11 with an energized take on the 28 Years Later world. Come for the gore but stay for the surprisingly frequent jokes and a pair of astonishing performances from Ralph Fiennes and Jack O'Connell, whose sadistic Jimmy Crystal is utterly hateful but always compelling.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/28-years-later-bone-temple-review-jack-o-connell-b2899743.html) (80):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s rich thematic territory for the series, and slowly amps up the audience\u2019s anticipation for the moment these two finally cross paths. When they do, it\u2019s spectacular and audacious.\n\n[Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-jack-oconnell-ralph-fiennes-fuel-blistering-horror/5212640.article) (90):\n\n&gt;Bold, bloody and blisteringly brutal, this exhilarating follow-up to last year\u2019s 28 Years Later grabs its audience by the throat from the off and never loosens its grip.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/2074962/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;I left 28 Years Later nervous about what might come next. After The Bone Temple, I'm thrilled at the prospect of where this story could go. That's what I call progress.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nDirected by Nia DaCosta:\n\n&gt;Taking place after the events of the previous film, Spike (Alfie Williams) is inducted into Sir Jimmy Crystal's (Jack O'Connell) gang of acrobatic killers in a post-apocalyptic Britain ravaged by the Rage Virus. Meanwhile, Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) forms a new relationship with potentially world-changing consequences.\n\nRelease Date: January 16",

He is so immersed and central to the feel of the work, that often you don't even recognize the impact that he has.  He's like a spice that immediately disolves in a sauce when it's added, but the taste is exponentially changed.  \n  \nI am open to debate this, but you will lose \ud83d\ude0e.",

        "content": "Holy shit. I just watched I Saw The TV Glow, and I barely even know what to say. I have never in my life been so moved by a movie before. I felt like I was on the verge of tears for the entire runtime. By the final scene, I couldn\u2019t hold them back, and tears were just streaming down my face and falling onto my shirt. I didn\u2019t know it was possible for a movie to encapsulate the queer experience so perfectly.\n\nThe target audience is obviously trans people, and I am not trans. However, I am lesbian and asexual. I have long since come to peace with being lesbian. I like girls, who cares? Not me. Being asexual is\u2026different. When you\u2019re not interested in sex in such a sex obsessed society, you\u2019re naturally going to feel wrong. Inhuman. And this movie evoked that feeling perfectly.\n\nThroughout the whole movie, there\u2019s such a feeling of unease. What you\u2019re seeing is not right, things aren\u2019t supposed to be this way. Nobody around you understands. So you push it down and down, until you can\u2019t take it anymore. That\u2019s why this movie is classified as horror. Not because of cheap jumps scares or gore, but the dread looming over you for 90 minutes. If you\u2019re a queer person, it\u2019s not just for 90 minutes. It\u2019s your whole life.\n\nI think that\u2019s why there\u2019s such middling reviews on this movie. Before actually watching it, I looked at the plot for and reviews of the movie. And yes, I did spoil the entire plot for myself. But that barely even mattered, because nothing in the world could ever spoil the experience of actually watching it for the first time for me. Anyways, the reviews. People either love or hate this movie. And I genuinely think it might come down to queer vs non-queer people. If you are straight, I honestly don\u2019t believe you can truly appreciate this movie. Of course, that\u2019s a generalization. But I Saw The TV Glow was made by a queer person, for queer people. That almost never happens.\n\nIn the end, whether the TV show was real or not doesn\u2019t even matter. I personally believe it is, but your interpretation of the story doesn\u2019t change the experience, or what it\u2019s actually about. This is a horror film about what it\u2019s like to be queer, and that feeling of wrongness that comes with it. It\u2019s not an eldritch horror like some people seemingly expected. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not. It means more this way. You can always watch another movie about eldritch horror. You can\u2019t watch another movie like I Saw The TV Glow.",

Well darn my socks! And mend my boots! This is GREAT ( so far ...).)\n\nTo be honest I though the beginning was a bit Pythonesque, in the vein of The Holy Grail ( 1975 ) , and Jabberwocky (( 1977 ) by Terry G: A python. ) and looked a bit silly. Loads of crash bang stuff with knights and even some mud. No giant rabbit so far... almost felt like the coconuts were missing... and then I was starting to fade a bit. Things were not looking good. I was concerned. Was the idiot really going to be a twit ?  Is this film going to be be a let down, do I have to get prepared to be, erm, dissatisfied ? and then... them ....  slow intake of breath...\n\n...the film takes a turn! I was glued, to the action. It was electric. It's a great turn.  Even Merlin is impressed. ( oops ... ignore that. ) It's brilliant ! Wow ! \n\n**Say no more !** \n\nTLDR : Merlin. Arthur. A special Sword ( Excalibur ). Loads of knight on knight action. etc etc. The lady of the lake. \n\nSpoiler: &gt;!The scene where Arthur, son of Uther, becomes king is magic !!&lt; ( I stopped to jot this down before proceeding further. I was excited...) \n\nNeed to satisfy an itch that involves loads of extras in black full plate armour bashing into things, other armoured extras, and actual castles ? !  This film is for you ! \n\nI recommend this film !  \n\n\n\n ^(( PSA: I am) *^(recommanding)* ^(this film Not reviewing it. Please don't tell me you think my review is insane nonsense) ^(twaddle) ^(. Thank you. )) \n\n",

The cinematography was out of this world too.\n\nFunny enough, the reason I watched The King, was because of Robert Pattinson and my respect for his acting ever since I watched Remember Me\u2026 another movie I didn\u2019t want to watch, but was blown away by. \n\nWould love to hear a movie you didn\u2019t want to see, but it blew you away!

Volunteers like Rita, a resourceful but lonely young woman who does not fit in with her peers, are dispatched to help clean up and rebuild. But one day, Darol suddenly emits a deafening signal, and its surrounding fruit bursts, revealing hordes of creatures that quickly slaughter everyone. Rita makes a valiant attempt to escape but dies in the attempt. Then... she wakes up again, only to witness the same tragedy. And again. Stuck in an inexplicable time loop, Rita struggles until she meets Keiji, a shy young man who is also experiencing the loop alongside her. Based on the worldwide best-selling light novel and manga, ALL YOU NEED IS KILL is a thrilling and big-hearted vision of what it means to live for tomorrow.*\n\nCast: Ai Mikami, Natsuki Hanae, Kana Hanazawa, Mochugakusei, Hiccorohee\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88% (9 reviews)\n\n2 reviews on Metacritic (one 80 and one 90)\n\nSome reviews:\n\nGregory Nussen, Screen Rant 6/10 - Kenichiro Akimoto's brisk film is a more faithful adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's book than Doug Liman's was, but what it gains in authenticity it loses in propulsion.\nhttps://screenrant.com/all-you-need-is-kill-movie-review/\n\nAlan French, Sunshine State Cineplex 9/10 - This is a must-watch experience for sci-fi fans, especially given the epic scope Akimoto delivers.\nhttps://sunshinestatecineplex.com/2025/08/04/fantasia-all-you-need-is-kill/\n\nAndrew Mack, ScreenAnarchy - The action sequences are amazing, and the main reason why you shouldn\u2019t miss this when the chance arises.
