        "title": "November 7-9 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Predator: Badlands' debuts with a great $40M domestically and $79.2M worldwide, the best ever in the franchise. 'Sarah's Oil' and 'Nuremberg' debut solidly with $4.2M and $3.8M. But 'Die My Love' and 'Christy' flop with $2.6M and $1.3M, respectively.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/ok99bh6mbi0g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e990da9512f2b8d0e742c716a71720383df928\n\nAfter a very slow October, the box office reignited with the beginning of November.\n\nThat was mainly due to ***Predator: Badlands***, which posted the best ever debut in the franchise, showing that this IP still has a lot of life at the box office. The rest of the newcomers, however, were a mixed bag. ***Sarah's Oil*** had a very middling debut, although ***Nuremberg*** over-performed projections. \n\nThe real losers, though, were ***Die My Love*** and ***Christy***. The former had one of the worst ever debuts for Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, while the latter had one of the worst starts in 2,000 theaters.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $74.9 million this weekend. That's up 20.7% from last year, when ***Venom: The Last Dance*** topped the box office for a third week.\n\nDebuting at #1, ***Predator: Badlands*** opened with a great $40 million in 3,725 theaters. That's easily the best debut in the franchise, even dethroning ***Alien vs. Predator*** ($38 million). This debut is also very close to ***Alien: Romulus*** ($42 million) last year.\n\nEven though ***Prey*** and ***Killer of Killers*** were sent to streaming, Disney had enough confidence in the film that they enlisted Dan Trachtenberg to return as director and giving it a theatrical release. To separate itself from the previous installments, the film went on a bigger scale, positioning the Predator to fight large monsters. And despite casting Elle Fanning as co-lead, it was clear that humans were not the focus of the film. \n\nA few weeks prior, it was revealed that the film would be rated PG-13, the first film in the franchise (excluding ***AvP***) to get it. That led to some disappointment from fans, but the rating did not fundamentally impact the film in a negative way. The rating was mainly because the level of violence wasn't aimed at humans, so the MPAA was a bit lenient in that way. And despite the rating, it still had the reception to justify it; it's sitting at 85% on RT and 71 on Metacritic, which convinced everyone that this is the theatrical ***Predator*** film they were waiting for.\n\nAccording to 20th Century Studios, 61% of the audience was male. Despite the PG-13 rating, it didn't really benefit much from it; only 11% of the audience was 17 and under. They gave it a great \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, the best ever in the franchise. Even with some competition on the way, the film should still hold around the same as ***Romulus***. Which means it should be the franchise's first film to crack $100 million domestically.\n\n***Regretting You*** has kept the second place for the third week in a row. The film eased a very light 15%, adding $6.6 million. The film is clearly showing some damn great legs. The film has earned $38.1 million, and it should finish with over $50 million, which is much better than its early prospects.\n\nIn third place, ***Black Phone 2*** eased just 38%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. The film has made $70 million, and it should finish with around $80 million domestically. Not a bad run at all.\n\nIn fourth place, Amazon MGM's ***Sarah's Oil*** debuted with a so-so $4.2 million in 2,410 theaters. It's a soft debut, but it's hard to ask for much better numbers here. On some good news, it scored a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore, which bodes well for its legs.\n\nComing in over projections, Sony Pictures Classics' ***Nuremberg*** opened with a solid $3.8 million in 1,802 theaters. Its $2,155 per-theater average was also the second best in the Top 10, just behind ***Badlands***. That's a very surprising result, considering that the film didn't have particularly great reviews (69% on RT, 61 on Metacritic) and both Russell Crowe and Rami Malek have struggled in the past few years. Not a bad start, especially compared to two other newcomers we're about to talk about...\n\n***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** is holding surprisingly well for an anime title. It dropped just 45%, for a $3.4 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $37.8 million.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos' ***Bugonia*** added $3.4 million this weekend. That represents a very light 32% drop, signaling some great word of mouth. Through its first 2 weeks in wide release, the film has amassed $12.2 million (Lanthimos' third highest grossing film) and could crack $20 million, assuming it continues holding well.\n\nIn eighth place, MUBI's ***Die My Love*** flopped with just $2.6 million in 1,983 theaters. In comparison, MUBI's buzzy title ***The Substance*** earned $3.2 million in 1,949 theaters last year. It's one of the worst ever wide debuts for both Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.\n\nA film like this was always going to be a tough sell; a film focusing on post-partum depression is not on many moviegoers' minds. Upon premiering in Cannes, MUBI bought the film for a record $24 million (far more than the $12.5 million they spent on acquiring ***The Substance***), which guaranteed at least 1,500 theaters. But it seems like they over-estimated the appeal and its reception; the film is sitting at a 76% on RT, which is solid, but not particularly glowing for an adult drama. It just doesn't have the buzz that ***The Substance*** achieved. So even though MUBI tried an extensive marketing campaign by having many press junkets, the film just didn't attract any interest.\n\nAccording to MUBI, 51% of the audience was male, and 78% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a horrible \"D+\" on CinemaScore, signaling toxic word of mouth. Even though Lawrence has gained some buzz for her performance, it's very unlikely the film can last long with this reception. Especially when there's more Oscar contenders coming up. It would be a surprise if ***Die My Love*** made anything above $6 million domestically.\n\n***Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere*** dropped 44% and added $2.1 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $20.3 million, and it will finish with around $25 million domestically.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 is ***Tron: Ares***. It dropped 40%, grossing $1.8 million. The film has made a meager $71.2 million, and it only has around $5 million left in the gas tank. \n\nFailing to crack the Top 10 was Black Bear's ***Christy***, starring Sydney Sweeney, which flopped with an abysmal $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in 2,000 theaters, and it gets to 11th if we exclude re-releases. That's an abysmal $652 per-theater average.\n\nDespite Sweeney going on a press tour and extensively promoting it, the film just couldn't attract any interest. It was Black Bear's first distributed film, but that just proves the challenge of getting in the theatrical business. The film also lacked an interesting hook or subject matter; Christy Martin may not ring a bell to moviegoers, so they'll be less interested in checking out a biopic. Sweeney's presence has also been marred with controversies over the past months; while it's hard to say it negatively impacted it, it certainly didn't help it. The film's middling reviews (67% on RT) were the nail in the coffin.\n\nAudiences gave ***Christy*** a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is not a sign of great word of mouth. With zero Oscar buzz, adult dramas coming on its way, and theaters absolutely dropping it with such a pitiful debut, ***Christy*** might struggle to hit $3 million domestically.\n\nLet's cap it off with some great news. Neon released Joachim Trier's ***Sentimental Value*** in 4 theaters, and it debuted with a dazzling $200,031. That's a strong $50,008 per-theater average, which ranks sixth best of the year (fourth best with at least 2 theaters). The film will continue expanding over the next few weeks, hoping to capitalize on some Oscar buzz.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Predator: Badlands*** debuted with $39.2 million overseas, for a great $79.2 million worldwide debut. Like the domestic market, it was the best ever debut for the franchise. The best debuts were in China ($7.4M), UK ($3.2M), Mexico ($2.3M), France ($1.8M) and Japan ($1.7M). China did not over-perform massively like ***Romulus***, but it wasn't expected to do that. From early signs, ***Predator: Badlands*** should easily hit $200 million worldwide, becoming the biggest film in the franchise.\n\n***Regretting You*** added $5.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $70.5 million. \n\n***Black Phone 2*** added $4 million overseas, for a $110 million worldwide total.\n\n***Bugonia*** seems to be showing some small power outside America. It added $3.6 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $23 million. There's still lots of markets left.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEKEND**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Weapons* | Aug/8 | Warner Bros. | $43,501,217 | $151,550,044 | $268,042,500 | $38M\n*The Strangers: Chapter 2* | Sep/26 | Lionsgate | $5,806,192 | $15,153,346 | $21,293,765 | $8.5M\n*After the Hunt* | Oct/10 | Amazon MGM | $1,529,394 | $3,258,830 | $7,093,629 | $70M-$80M\n\n- Zach Cregger's ***Weapons*** has closed with a fantastic $151 million domestically and $268 million worldwide, far above its $38 million budget. A huge win for original films, and further cementing Cregger as a box office draw (after all, this was sold on his name). Thanks to an incredible marketing campaign, the film was buoyed by great word of mouth (an \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, not an easy feat for a horror). Now let's see how his ***Resident Evil*** version does next September.\n\n- Bravo, Renny Harlin. It takes talent to make ***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** fizzle out with just $21 million worldwide. A very underwhelming result, but it's hard to be surprised after the terrible reception to both ***Chapter 1*** and ***Chapter 2***. And there's still another film left to be released. The floor can get lower.\n\n- One of the year's biggest flops, Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** has closed with a horrible $3.2 million domestically and $7 million worldwide. For some reason, this cost $70-$80 million, with $20 million going to star Julia Roberts. While the subject matter is challenging, the film's reception did not help it. Originally positioned as a possible Oscar contender, the film shocked many with its Venice premiere, where it earned weak reviews. All buzz went down, and the film vanished without a trace. It marked Guadagnino's latest box office disappointment, and he better hope that his next film fares much better.\n\n#**THIS WEEK**\n\nIt's a very busy week, with four films debuting in wide release.\n\nThe first is Paramount's ***The Running Man***, the new film from Edgar Wright. Based on the novel by Stephen King, it stars Glen Powell as a man who takes part in a dangerous game show where he must survive 30 days to win money. The trailers have emphasized action and the big scale of the game, which is very important in a blockbuster. Will that be enough to top the box office?\n\nThere's also the release of Lionsgate's ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't***, the third installment in the franchise. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles, and they're joined by Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt, and Rosamund Pike. The franchise has been lucrative for Lionsgate; each film has made over $330 million worldwide. But the franchise halted 9 years ago, which is a long time to release a sequel. Will the audience still show up or they did just move on?\n\nNeon is also releasing Osgood Perkins' new horror film ***Keeper***, which stars Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland. Perkins is responsible for two of Neon's highest grossing films, ***Longlegs*** and ***The Monkey***, so he's riding on some good will with the audience. With ***Black Phone 2*** slowing down, could this be a main attraction for horror fans?\n\nAnd finally, A24 is releasing ***Eternity***, starring Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner. The film follows a woman who must choose between two men with whom to spend eternity in the afterlife. Reviews have been positive since its TIFF premiere (85% on RT), so perhaps it could surprise.",

        "title": "\"Rango\" is a triumph of meta-modern storytelling.",
        "content": "I recently re-watched the 2011 animated film Rango, and was reminded of how well it incorporates contemporary ideas about constructing one's own identity into the framework of a classic \"hero's journey\" morality tale. To me, it juggles postmodern existentialism, individualist modernism, and (somewhat subversively) traditional morality in a clever way. It starts out as existential because the chameleon character starts out with no identity and has to create one based on the situation he finds himself in. (Obviously, he's a chameleon.) But, importantly, he also has an internal idea of the story he'd like to tell based on his imagination, which defines his lonely fish tank existence, and seemingly inspired by cinema (he fancies himself as an actor). Unfortunately for him, he isn't able to successfully bring that self-constructed (but externally influenced) story into reality by his own volition. He fails, and is left wandering in the desert. \n\nThe movie's core scene is brought into play when Rango (which the chameleon names himself) deconstructs the walls of the story he's set himself in and allows himself to be guided across the road, not by way of his own heroism but by closing his eyes and trusting in something external. There he is confronted by the Spirit of the West, who in one sense represents traditional morality (he is portrayed as omniscient, a \"higher being\" as a human amongst animals, and provides Rango moral guidance), but is also representative of both modernist hero narratives (individualist American Westerns) and, complicatedly, postmodern anti-hero narratives (spaghetti Westerns). It would have been more straightforward to just use John Wayne or something and reinforce modernist individualism, but rather than being on-the-nose, using the Man with No Name incorporates the complications of fractured identity into the movie's resolution.\n\nHe tells Rango that Rango is trying to \"find something that isn't out here\"--that \"something\" being Rango's preconceived notion of what his story should be, or needs to be. For the story to be merely existentialist, the thread would end with that deconstruction of the notion of a traditionally defined goal. But, the Spirit follows with the message that \"it's not about you, it's about them.\" This is traditional morality undermining Rango's self-important, self-constructed role as a modernist hero, and reinforcing that he needs to define himself not by a myopic view of what \"heroes should be,\" but instead define himself by the moral service he is able to provide others. The spirit then symbolically \"boxes in\" Rango, framing him as if on a movie screen, implying that Rango has confined himself by the modernist, classic Hollywood ideal of a Hero narrative. The spirit then rides away with the remark that \"no man can walk out on his own story,\" summarizing the philosophy of the film by submitting that we all inescapably exist within a larger story, but despite that larger framework which is the \"story\" of human existence, it is also *our own* story, in which our individual identity and choices must be guided by both traditional morality, and a sense of the individual talents and limitations that make us ourselves. Not solely what the modernist hero story imposes on us.\n\nSo, rather than being simply deconstructionist and postmodern, it is instead meta-modern, acknowledging the postmodern moral uncertainty of a post-WWII, post-nuclear world, and the utility of modernist hero narratives, but rejecting the naivety of either philosophy on its own, and instead incorporating both, along with traditional morality, towards a more nuanced positive message. \n\nIt's not unique in doing so; plenty of other stories since around the 2000s have been doing similar things. But it does a really good job of it. The surreal presentation serves the philosophy of the narrative as well. The rendering of the environments and characters is scientifically realistic, but the logic the world works in, the way things move and act, is cartoony and dream-like. It marries the grounded, directed certainty of modernism with the absurdity of postmodernism. The genre tropes and Western cliches are at once treated with reverence and also undermined by the subtle, tongue-in-cheek acting and occasional naturalistic dialogue. The mariachi owls reinforce the self-awareness that the movie is playing with narrative presentation itself and examining the utility of traditional storytelling frameworks, which is meta-modern.",

First, 2020 was an absolutely insane year and Eddington captured the feel of 2020 perfectly. The insanity, the anxiety, the constant events that keep piling up on top of each other, the sense of darkness of 2020 etc.\n\nThe commentary of corporations and having the movie end on the shot of the data center is perfection. The way that the characters were all in their own world of hatred and division while at the end, it basically shows how the mega rich get what they want at the end of the day anyway. It\u2019s so nihilistic and perfect.\n\nAlso, Eddington is everything I love about cinema smashed into one film. I love dark comedies, I love westerns, I love political thrillers, I love dark/violent films, I love ominous music cues and a sense of dread, I love meta films, I love long films, and Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor. This film is literally all of those things smashed into one package. My favorite film of the year and I\u2019m happy I was able to see it with an audience in theaters, my only complaint is that it wasn\u2019t as long as Beau is Afraid lol.\n\nPeople criticize him a lot, but Ari Aster in my opinion is one of the most original directors working today and he\u2019s one of my modern favorites!",
