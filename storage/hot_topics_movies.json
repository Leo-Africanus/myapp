The pacing is great, and keeps your adrenaline up. The way they explained technical terms and concepts was great for someone that has basic knowledge of the stock market. I did have to go back a few times to rewatch some parts. \n\nNot being an American citizen, it was shocking to see the reality of what a mess the banks made of the mortgage market. My face must\u2019ve looked more shocked than Steve Carell\u2019s character throughout the movie. The greed and apathy of the top guys is incredible. I especially liked the Mr. Chau character (who is a real person). And the gotcha at the end when they revealed only 1 person got a prison sentence out of this shit show. \n\nThe parallels with what\u2019s going on right now is quite freaky. My favourite part was how they blamed immigrants and the poor. They\u2019re still blaming immigrants and the poor. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, I\u2019d highly recommend checking it out. Gotta go check my blood pressure!",

        "content": "**Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sinners_2025): 100% (37 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/): 83 (15 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):\n\n&gt;It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):\n\n&gt;*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):\n\n&gt;The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It\u2019s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):\n\n&gt;\"Sinners\" is several things at once \u2014 a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original \"Assault on Precinct 13\" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography \u2013 but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):\n\n&gt;\u201cSinners\u201d is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema \u2014 epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It\u2019s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):\n\n&gt;If cinema weren\u2019t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*\u2019s electric fusion of genres \u2013 historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner \u2013 would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I\u2019m one of them; I\u2019d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness\n\nVanity Fair (80):\n\n&gt; Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film\u2019s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):\n\n&gt;Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old \u2014 high and low \u2014 at the same time.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by Ryan Coogler:\n\n&gt;Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.\n\nCast:\n\n* Michael B. Jordan\n* Hailee Steinfeld\n* Miles Caton\n* Jack O'Connell\n* Wunmi Mosaku\n* Jayme Lawson\n* Omar Benson Miller\n* Li Jun Li\n* Delroy Lindo",

My take:\n\n\\- Had the third film been good, Reloaded would have probably got a pass as a 'shaky' middle act in a great trilogy\n\n\\- Most of the bitter after taste comes from Revolutions\n\n\\- There were enough interesting ideas to have it be more than one great film, but the execution collapses\n\n\\- Neo and Trinity would be better as friends\n\n\\- Smith's character falls apart after the first film, he goes from delightfully cold and efficient, to gimmicky, then weirdly angry\n\n\\- Morpheus feels like a passenger with nothing to do, which was a critical mistake\n\n\\- We need to care about Zion, but there's no one there that we like. Morpheus could be there, but instead he's flying around on a ship for some reason\n\n\\- The architect scene made a surprising amount of sense, if your attention span is on\n\n\\- Rehashing the iconic lobby scene in Revolutions was baffling\n\n\\- The Zion council is unbearable and speak as if they have access to the film's script\n\n\\- The machines don't feel too threatening... they fly around in octopus swarms a lot\n\n\\- You could rewrite both Reloaded and Revolutions into great films if you took a different direction",

I wasnt aware 70mm ran through the camera side by side as opposed to up and down. \n\nLooks like there are three ways to watch the film. Curious how home video release will be handled. ",

It's not going to win any academy awards for sure, but I feel the Rotten Tomatoes score of 9% isn't a fair rating. The sequel maybe, but that's a different story.\n\nFor me this is another comedy that doesn't take it self too seriously and is a fun watch with a ton of quotable scenes.",
