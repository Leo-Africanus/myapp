        "content": "*A man tries to befriend his charismatic new neighbour, but it soon threatens to ruin both of their lives.*  \n  \nDirector: Andrew DeYoung\n\nCast: Tim Robinson, Paul Rudd, Kate Mara, Jack Dylan Grazer\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [91%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friendship_2024)\n\n**Metacritic:** [78/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/friendship/critic-reviews/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Chase Hutchinson - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson)[TheWrap](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2205) \n\n&gt;Never could the story be described as a series of sketches haphazardly stitched together as many comedies can fall into being. It looks and feels like a drama that is coming apart at the seams as Robinson careens his way through it.\n\n[Fred Topel - ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/fred-topel)[United Press International](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2795)\n\n&gt;In Friendship, the world around Craig reacts appropriately to his inappropriate behavior. So whereas an Adam Sandler character, or Bill Murray before him, would endear himself to the audience, Craig just digs himself deeper and deeper.\n\n[Marshall Shaffer ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/marshall-shaffer)\\- [Slant Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/821) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;But even for those in the audience whose mileage only goes so far with Robinson\u2019s schtick, *Friendship* has more to offer than cringe-inducing, often bawdy humor. He and DeYoung expertly skewer the rituals that trap men in prisons of consumption and estrange them from their emotions. The film is deeply attuned to male malaise, though it steers away from offering anything resembling an overly academic thesis about its roots. More than anything, *Friendship* makes the conditions of modern masculinity feel as weird to watch as they are to understand\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;Robinson\u2019s brand of middle-class psycho surrealism works perfectly in bite-size sketch-comedy doses. Stretched out to feature length, a character like Craig simply stops making sense.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Jacob Oller](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jacob-oller) \\- B-\n\n&gt;But it all relies on the chemistry between the abrasive Robinson and the too-cool Rudd. Their dynamic, either playing off each other or playing with the idea of each other when they\u2019re not sharing the screen, is strong, and DeYoung keeps them both contained to the right frequencies throughout the film. I certainly wish Kate Mara had more to do, or even to react to, as Craig\u2019s wife, but she makes her moments count. And, for better or for (much, much) worse, *Friendship* is one for the boys.\n\n\n\n",

My god I never expected to be rattled this much. Not by the actual events that take place but the fictional ones. \nThe initial scene where Tony's (Edward's book character/self) family gets run off the road by a couple cars full of seemingly drunk losers and the events of that whole portion have stuck in my mind more than any movie scene has in a while. Aaron Taylor Johnson absolutely stole the show and managed to make me despise his character more than any villain I've seen in the past year or two. Just the pure evil behind his eyes and the way he toys with Tony and his family is absolutely terrifying. He haunts this entire movie. \nI'm struggling to describe the way it makes me feel but God damn if this movie wasn't great. I enjoyed the irl portion as well but the book scenes blew me away. ",

        "title": "Comparing \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" the book to the movie \"Shawshank Remption\" the movie",
        "content": "First I just have to say, Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time. It is a true masterpiece, I can never get tired of rewatching it. If its on, no matter at what point, I will watch it to the end.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'm surprised it took me so long to read the actual source material by Stephen King. King is obviously a master author, and while he's most well known for his horror novels some of his finest work I would argue are outside that genre (the green mile and shawshank sticking out specifically).\n\nThe book is quite easy to read coming in at under 130 pages, but the story as told by Red flows really well, there are no wasted words, and Stephen is masterful in his craft.\n\nI was somewhat surprised that so much of the dialog in the movie, specifically between Red and Andy, is pretty much exactly as written in the book. I mean its hard to beat perfection so its understandable Frank Darabont chose not to change a lot of the dialog.\n\nWith that said there are numerous differences, the big ones being Red was actually irish, Andy was supposed to be short, they went through I think 3 or 4 wardens, a lot of things with timeline either as far as dialog or events sort of get flipped around, but a lot of this I can see why Frank did it. The source material is amazing by itself but if anything I don't see where someone could complain with Franks choices.\n\nThe book did go into a bit more detail about when Andy was being victimized by the sisters, including the sodomy and bleeding which I think was fair to leave out of the movie. Also King talked about some child rapist making beautiful figurines through Red which Darabont also left out.\n\nOne of the biggest set of changes was just having the inmate who would have gotten Andy a new trial just moved to a different prison instead of executed. This was a fine change by Darabont I think as it made it more brutal for Andy. Also in the book the final warden ends up getting off pretty light, only stepping down after 3 years with no seeming consequences for all the illegal things he had been doing. I think Darabont having him kill himself and also having Andy mail the incriminating evidence was a very good change.\n\nFinally perhaps one thing that I believe was an improvement by Darabont was making it so that Andy ended up creating his 'fake persona' by himself instead of needing outside help. This adds a bit to Andy's mystique.\n\nBut man if you like the movie, I HIGHLY recommend reading the book. King's writing of Red is so well done, his writing on the exploits of Andy just makes him so special. I have so much respect for both King and Darabont, usually its pretty clear if the book or movie is better (almost always the book wins), but I think in this case they are both masterpieces.",
