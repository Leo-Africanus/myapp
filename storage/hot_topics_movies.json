They need to plant an idea in this guy's head so they go in a dream within a dream within a dream and Leo deals with some personal stuff along the way, its just a sci-fi heist movie, like Ocean's Eleven but a little trippy. I had always heard about this movies reputation for being overly complicated and if you look up an \"Inception references in media\" video on YouTube, every reference is poking fun at how complicated it is and how nobody gets it but like... it's actually not that hard to understand?\n\nFunnily enough, South Parks parody of it kind of proves my point because they make fun of how characters are constantly explaining stuff but to me that's what made it easy to get. The fact every time they did anything someone was explaining it made it really easy to follow.\n\nThe only part that's really even up in the air is the ending but I believe in happy endings and the evidence points to him being awake.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is, was this movies convulted-ness overblown or is everyone kind of stupid?",

        "content": "I consider the Star Trek reboot trilogy, especially Star Trek (2009) to be among the very best action movies made in this IP era. The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.",

        "title": "Movie that takes place after a super villian succeeds?",
        "content": "I was wondering if there are any movies that are set after a super villain's plot to destroy the world has succeeded. I'm not talking about a sequel where the first movie ends with the villain winning. I'm looking for a movie where it starts in the after math of the villain's win and we learn about what happened and then maybe the protagonists try to fix the world or the villain's story can just be in the background of something entirely unrelated happening. Does this exist or did I just come up with a new movie idea??\n\nEdit:\n\nI appreciate everyone who's trying to keep others to my criteria but it's not that serious. It's fun seeing how everyone interprets my ask. But I do want to add some background and clarification. What initially got me curious about this is I was watching Kingsman: The Secret Service. In that Samuel Jackson's character sets a plan in motion to make everyone hyper violent and start killing each other but the Kingsman come in and thwart his plan. So it got me curious to see what the world would have looked like had they failed to stop him. I don't want any sequels at all. I'd like it to be a standalone film (other mediums are ok too), or the start of a series. I want a majority of the story to be set after the heroes fail. If Avengers: Endgame was a standalone movie, it'd be a perfect example. \n\nHowever, a good example I forgot about is an audio book called Third Eye by Felicia Day. It's essentially the story of if Harry Potter failed to beat Voldemort. In the prologue we get the showdown between the child wizard and the villain and the villain wins and takes over the world. Then it jumps forward like 20 years and we see what how the world looks under this dark lords rule.\n\nHope this clears things up!\n\nAlso, thanks for all the suggestions! There have been a lot of great ones so far!",

        "title": "\"Manchester by the Sea\" is the perfect depiction of how depression kills even when the outcome isn't suicide. A lot of times, there is no escape from mental illness or grief.",
        "content": "I just watched this movie for the first time and I'm both in awe and absolutely devastated.\n\nI've seen a lot of comments from people asking \"What was the point of the movie? There was no progress or character growth\"...yet that was exactly the point of the movie. A lot of movies these days depict depression or mental illness as something that a character wakes up one day and snaps out of it. Movies treat mental illness as something that eventually has a complete resolution and that \"character growth\" is depicted as the character resolving their mental illness. But a lot of times, the reality is there is no escaping mental illness and there is no resolution. You're stuck. You \"can't beat it\".\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder, which is a long-term form of depression with highs and lows, life feels like you have a dark cloud hanging over your head endlessly and permanently. Lee's sunken eyes and spirit and the feeling of a man just waiting to die resonated very deeply with me and which is why this movie affected me to the core. Lee was in a state of psychological paralysis.\n\nThe harsh reality is that depression requires immense effort on behalf of the person to treat. I was in therapy for around 3-4 years and progress was very slow before things got better. Yet even now I don't think I'm cured but depression and mental illness didn't win. Before therapy, life felt exactly like Lee's in the movie. Were it not for therapy and a support system of family and friends, I might have ended things a while back.\n\nIn Lee's case, and in a lot of cases for so many people, depression and mental illness do win. They win even if the person doesn't resort to suicide. Suicide isn't the only depiction of mental illness winning. Lee was a dead-man walking. When Randi tells him \"you can't just die\"...she didn't mean literally. She meant Lee's soul was dying. And Affleck's acting nailed the \"dying on the inside\" reality for so many people. No ambition, no goals, nothing to look forward to, and lack of ability to commit to anything that requires any sort of emotional or mental effort on his part.\n\nI also understand the janitor job. It's a job that doesn't require any degree of investment yet at the same time I think the janitor job gives Lee a sense of helping other people when he himself couldn't help his own children. I don't think picking the janitor job was random. I think the janitor job perhaps made Lee somehow feel better about himself subconsciously because it involves a certain degree of fixing different issues people have inside their homes which could contrast the helplessness he felt not being able to save his children from the fire inside their home. It also gave Lee a sense of organization or routine, which a lot of depressed people need to feel somewhat in control.\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to what many people say, Lee did show character growth and progress. Lee saying that he wants to get a house with an extra room for Patrick to visit is growth. Lee at first somewhat considering accepting guardianship and then seeking out better guardianship for Patrick shows growth and responsibility. Lee taking care of his brother's funeral processions, quitting his old job to be with Patrick, attempting to look for a new job in Manchester before deciding to move back to Boston are all signs of growth. But the reality is that growth with mental illness is very slow that is almost seems non-existent.\n\nNot to mention, the hope his nephew gave him for a better and more hopeful life mirrors my own experience with how my own nieces bring hope into my world despite everything and reminds me of lyrics by Sufjan Stevens: \u201cMy brother had a daughter, The beauty that she brings, illumination\u201d\u2026Nephews and nieces are a blessing to our world and what we carry from our siblings after they\u2019re gone.\n\nIn Lee's situation, continuing to exist is the most beautiful and commendable form of resistance. \n\nWhat a beautiful masterpiece. Easily one of my favourite moves of all time.",

I remember really liking \"Pet Detective\" and feeling let down by \"When Nature Calls\" because it failed to improve upon or at least be as good as it's predecessor.\n\nThe Miami and detective mystery setting of PD lends itself better to Ace Ventura. In PD, Ace Ventura is annoying and strange to everyone around him, but he gets away with it because he is actually a good detective\u200b. Also, Ace isn't as much of a bad ass in WNC. He can catch a bullet with his teeth, but he can't dodge a sphere? His character just seemed inconsistent in the sequel.\n\nDoes anyone agree? Disagree? Let me know!\n\nEdit: I do agree that WNC has a lot of great lines and some great scenes. It did get a few cackles from me. I guess I just prefer PD overall.",

        "title": "Fans of the classic film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, how truly \u201cgood\u201d is Blondie? I\u2019ll leave my analysis below.",
        "content": "Blondie is my favorite not because he\u2019s the fastest or most accurate gunslinger. He\u2019s not even a hero (in my opinion, he isn\u2019t). You could even say he\u2019s a villain too. He has shades of a vigilante\u2014sometimes he does things a vigilante would do\u2014but he doesn\u2019t do them consistently. He is not a vigilante. He scams the sheriffs of a town for his own interest. Basically, this trick allows him to always have a criminal on hand instead of having to look for one, so it\u2019s safe to assume he lives off this\u2014being a bounty hunter scammer, who scams precisely to get the money faster.\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care about the crimes a person may have committed; he only cares about getting his payment by scamming each town into believing he\u2019s turning in a criminal, only to save him afterward.\n\n\nBut here comes the interesting part.\nHe isn\u2019t completely evil like Tuco or Angel Eyes. He is just\u2026\n\n\nThe most decent of the three, that\u2019s all. He seems to care only about money, but he also appears to have a certain respect for human life, since he only kills in self-defense\u2014he only kills to protect his own life.\n\nWhen he shoots the sheriffs\u2019 hats instead of their heads, that means a lot to me, because he takes a risk that one of them might fire back and the plan could go wrong, yet he chooses to risk it so they\u2019re only neutralized\u2014which, with Tuco, worked.\n\nThat makes him more human than the other two. He\u2019s not a hero, not even a 100% vigilante. He\u2019s a cold criminal who respects human life. He kills if it\u2019s to protect his life, but I\u2019ll say this clearly: throughout the entire movie, at no point does he walk up and kill someone just for pleasure.\nBlondie is different despite still being a criminal, with the difference that he takes no pleasure in killing someone. He sees it as something necessary. As a scammer bounty hunter, he\u2019s always at risk of being killed. To him, killing is simply indifferent\u2014indifferent but not pleasurable. Killing someone is necessary to save your life, but it\u2019s not something he seems proud of. He also doesn\u2019t seem to have an ego about being the best gunslinger of the three. For him, it\u2019s something he learned to protect himself, not to show off.\nHe also doesn\u2019t seem to regret it every time he kills someone. As I said, he kills, and that\u2019s it. For him, it\u2019s neither good nor bad\u2014it\u2019s necessary. He might even think it\u2019s wrong, but he still does it because in a world as savage as the Old West, you have to choose between killing or dying. He tries to kill as little as possible while staying alive. He might see it as a necessary evil. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t kill the town sheriffs, but he does kill those who try to kill him. He\u2019s like one of those dogs that won\u2019t bite you if you don\u2019t do anything to them.\n\nAnother thing that catches my attention is how he doesn\u2019t express emotions.\nFor example, I know sensitive people\u2014people who can\u2019t stand seeing others suffer even in movies or TV shows, knowing it\u2019s fictional. They cry when they see torture in a movie even knowing it\u2019s fake. Blondie expresses it differently: he stays silent, he shows respect. He doesn\u2019t mock anything or anyone. He\u2019s serious all the time. Maybe he lived through something traumatic that stripped him of emotion, or maybe he was born that way. Throughout the entire movie, we don\u2019t know who he is, where he learned to shoot, who taught him, where he comes from\u2014not even his name.\n\nAll we know is that he shoots fast and accurately, and that he\u2019s the most decent of the three.\nOne last detail to analyze: Blondie could have killed Tuco in the same bar where the cannon fired and knocked Tuco down. Blondie could have taken advantage of that, grabbed his revolver, used Tuco\u2019s physical instability, and killed him. And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have the second time Blondie respected Tuco\u2019s life. The first was leaving him in the desert\u2014even though it seems like a betrayal of trust, he really could have killed him right there. He chose to let him live, knowing he would carry him as an enemy.\nAnd this second time, he had an even better reason to kill him. Tuco tried to force him to hang himself with the rope. He could have killed him right there\u2014so why didn\u2019t he?\n\nPersonally, I like to interpret it based on everything mentioned before.\n\nI like to think it\u2019s because Blondie doesn\u2019t kill unless it\u2019s in self-defense. It\u2019s true Tuco forced him to hang himself, but when Tuco fell to the ground, killing him would have been like shooting a wounded man. For Blondie, it was probably more ethical to leave him there than to kill him. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t going to save him or check if he was okay, but he respected his life. He didn\u2019t shoot him or try to\u2014he simply vanished.\n\nThat, along with the scene where he shares a cigarette and accompanies a Confederate soldier in his final moments, is what makes me think that this character, despite being \u201cbad,\u201d had a lot of morality and ethics\u2014too much for a criminal. The label of \u201cthe good\u201d really does suit him, even if I\u2019m not sure he truly is.",

It only fell apart because his rookie just so happened to save the right person.\n\nHis actions are inexcusable ofc, and while there\u2019s hints he started off as a good cop with good intentions it doesn\u2019t erase the good people he was willing to step on to get what he wanted.\n\nStill, he\u2019s easily one of the best villains portrayed on the big screen to date. King Kong ain\u2019t got shit on him.",

It lacks the classic Vangelis score and the gritty feel that the original has, but visually wise Denis Villeneuve knocks it out of the park.\n\nJoi and Luv are intriguing creations as well. I can take or leave K.\n\nAnd the ending! I just had chills when I heard THAT piece of music again.",

I'm not sure if it's just how times have changed for horror in the last decade but I was dumbfounded at how bad I considered most of the movie to be. The funniest part to me is they harp on the two paranormal investigators showing people all this supernatural spooky shit (legit exorcisms in grainy cam 4K somehow) but always adding \"Normally, there's a reasonable explanation for things and it's not ghosts or anything.\" Then, they get to the family house and immediately are like \"Yeah, it's ghosts.\" without a single ounce of investigating otherwise. It wasn't all bad with a couple of decently paced scenes but overall, super messy with jarring choices. Any other films you felt like this with?",

The one-shot take where he protects the kids from a barrage of soldiers is well done. I didn't like EXTRACTION 2 as much (though it does have good stuff).\n\nHeads up - 2026 is giving us a spin-off series with Omar Sy and a movie with Don Lee.",

Joel Edgerton did a good job in the role were he plays the coach for the water polo boys in this camp. The lead kid Everett Blunck who plays Ben did a good job as well.
