Inspired by James Gunn\u2019s dog Ozu, we captured every subtle gesture, emotion, and furry leap to ensure Krypto felt like a genuine canine first, only one who happened to have superpowers.\n\n\\-The Fortress of Solitude: We designed the Fortress using more than 6000 reflective crystals, each one a challenge in shading, lighting, and rendering.\n\n\\-4D Gaussian Splatting: A first in feature film, we used 4D Gaussian Splat to create Superman\u2019s Kryptionian parents hologram.\n\n\\-And also the Engineer\u2019s nanite power suit, SupermanRobots, Lex vs Krypto fight scene and more! You can learn about our work here: [https://www.framestore.com/work/superman](https://www.framestore.com/work/superman) \n\nWe\u2019ll be back today (Tuesday 8/16) at 3PM ET to answer your burning questions. In the meantime, ask away, we\u2019re excited to dive into the murk and magic of bringing Superman to life! Ask us anything!",

I am making this post because I think sometimes some people can forget the power of movies.\n\nI just finished a rewatch of Tim Burton's Big Fish after maybe 15 years, which without ruining is essentially a father/son themed film. In the film, Will is estranged from his father for 3 years, and then they get closer as the story goes on. I, myself, have been estranged from my father for a similar stretch of time. As the final scene comes to a close, as the movie transitions to the credits, my phone lights up. It's my father. He hasn't called me in years. Before I could answer, the call disconnects. I stare at my phone for 5 minutes trying to comprehend the situation and I call him back. ...It goes to voicemail.\n\nI can't help but think at the moment the film ended there was a strong cosmic push, an inkling, for my father to pick up the phone and reach out but he quickly ended the call. No happy ending here, but still.....very eerie. The timing couldn't have been spookier. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Movies are magic.",

        "content": "*Through a surprising twist of fate, single strangers Sarah and David get to relive important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present.*\n\nDirector: Kogonada\n\nCast: Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [55%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_big_bold_beautiful_journey)\n\n**Metacritic:** [39/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-b2827639.html) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;Kogonada neither wrote nor edited A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, and so we\u2019re largely lacking in the sophistication department, or the soft musicality he\u2019s been able to construct in his earlier films.\n\n[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/a-big-beautiful-journey-review) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;Is *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* a piece of wannabe creativity with a yawning hollowness at its center, or an A-list romance with some welcome aesthetic sensitivity? Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-and-colin-farrell-play-the-game-of-love) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;This film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well \u2026 or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge\u2019s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no. The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.\n\n[Variety - Tomris Laffly](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-1236520085/)\n\n&gt;The film\u2019s tonal inconsistencies hurt its impossibly talented co-leads considerably. Most of the time, both Farrell and Robbie seem detached and surprisingly cold when they are supposed to be embracing intimate, vulnerable feelings audiences know they\u2019re more than capable of projecting.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-kogonada-1235151392/) \\- 'D+'\n\n&gt;\u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey\u201d is miscalculated as a romance and a fantasy, and while I\u2019m loath to blame a craftsman as intelligent as Kogonada entirely for the outcome, he did, after all, agree to direct this lousy script. A big, bold, beautiful bore indeed.",

        "title": "I disagree with the \"Pile of Stuff\" scene from Devil Wears Prada.",
        "content": "I don't want this to come across as some curmudgeonly rant against the fashion industry. I realise fashion is an art form like any other, and a lot of talented people work in the field.\n\nHowever, there's one scene from the Devil Wears Prada that I never resonated with as much as others seemed to. It's the moment where Andy and Miranda are standing before a pile of clothes and Andy essentially claims that she isn't entrenched in the high fashion world, choosing instead to buy simple clothes from department stores.\n\nWhat follows is a monologue from Miranda, essentially explaining that Andy is actually deeply affected by the decisions made by high level fashion designers which then trickle down into the department stores and bargain bins.\n\nIt always feels like the scene is supposed to prove Andy wrong. It certainly ends with Andy unable to reply, and the sense of a point scored in Miranda's favor.\n\nBut after all these years, I still don't feel the monologue really disproves Andy's point.\n\nYes her sweater is cerulean due to a trickle down of higher level design choices, but it's clear Andy still makes the decision to pick whatever item of clothing is available in the department store.\n\nIf an entire industry is based around promoting Style A, or Style B or Style C, yet it becomes apparent that Andy would pick whatever style is available, it actually paints her as immune to the fashion industry rather than beholden to it.\n\nIf they'd chosen green, she would have picked green.\n\nIt's like someone wanted to buy a watch just to tell the time. Yes I'm sure a million decisions are being made about watch faces and minute hands by incredibly passionate people... but if someone goes out and simply buys a watch, while they might be swayed in their choice by individual designs, they're hardly beholden to those higher decisions.\n\nMiranda's argument seems to be \"a lot of people put a lot of work into this arbitrary decision you made\". But the scale of effort that goes into something doesn't seem convincing on its own; I think Andy would have been right to counter that, just because a lot of people worked on something, doesn't mean the work is inherently valuable to her decision.\n\nThough I'm sure both things are true, and I have to commend The Devil Wears Prada for giving such food for thought after so many years.",
