What's more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I'd say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn't he have been punished for their deaths? And I think there's much more involved during the interim period between lifetimes than looking at a few critical days of your life to see what lessons you learned from them, in particular pertaining to dealing with fear. Sure, we all need to learn to deal with fear, which is a very big part of growth, but I think we need to learn a lot more lessons than just this, in particular, being responsible for the consequences of our actions, intentional or not, though intent carries a great deal more weight. In any case, these are just some of my thoughts, and I'm curious to know some of yours as well.",

        "content": "What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. \n\nI am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",

Then when it was over they'd stay, watch the opening cartoons, then watch the feature film up to the point they arrived.  My mom and I tease him about this and say surely it was never really a thing but he swears that's the way it was done back then.  Anyone heard of or experienced this? ",

After watching him in Season 3 of True Detective, I really wanted to see  more of him. I enjoyed his short-lived show Deputy afterwards as well. I'd like to see more, but a lot of his catalog seems so cheesy, I don't want to waste my time watching them. I feel like he could be acting in a lot higher caliber of movies. He's an actor I'd love to have if I was directing a gritty crime thriller or western.\n\nAnyone else?",

It said that the village where Geppetto lived wasn't even a military objective, but that the italian planes where going back to base after a bombing, and let out the bombs to make the ballast lighter. Did the armies actually do this in WWI, or is it just a way to make Carlo's death sadder?",
