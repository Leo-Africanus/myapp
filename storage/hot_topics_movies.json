And that is a solid commitment for a casual watcher to make.\n\n\nWhat I liked: \n\nAfter minute 55, the movie is friggin rivetting. I didnt want to stop it to get up to pee. \n\nThe acting is excellent. And I mean excellent. There was one point where I teared up a little. And another where I chuckled along with the characters just because it was just a good moment. The character building and relationship building is top notch.\n\nEven the small characters do well. If you dont watch westerns you forget that &gt;!anyone can die. and goodamn it characters drop like flies in this film.!&lt;  And that really sells a story to me.\n\nRussel Crowe. You forget how good of an actor he is.\n\nMusings: \n\n\nI fell asleep watching this movie back when it came out and I just kinda forgot about it. I've heard many people say its a good movie so its been on my list for a long time. Just took me around 18 years to get around to watching it. Oddly enough, I fell asleep watching it this time too. So I watched the rest of the movie today. And I'm happy to have watched it. I'm already excited to watch it again. \n\nThe good part is things makes sense at the end. There were a few things that bothered me after I watched it so I read up the reddit posts about the movie and that cleared it up for me. I watched the scenes redditors talked about and I found that, yeah, it all adds up. In a convincing way. \n\nIf you liked this movie, I will recommend you watch Appaloosa, if you havent already.",

        "title": "Physical comedy is often instantly associated with cheap humor, not because it\u2019s inherently cheap, but because it\u2019s significantly more difficult to create intelligent and subtle humor with Physical Comedy.",
        "content": "This scene from *Young Frankenstein (1974)* is a perfect example of why I think physical comedy is at its best when it\u2019s subtle, clever, and nuanced. What elevates the comedy of this scene into something much more intelligent is not the physicality itself, it\u2019s the way the characters interact with their environment and each other in a perfectly choreographed way. The humor comes from the precision and restraint, not just chaos. That\u2019s what makes it so brilliant. \n\nWhat are some other examples of physical comedy in film that are smart and creative, rather than cheap or overly slapstick? I\u2019d love to hear about moments where physical comedy added depth to the humor instead of just relying on surface-level laughs.\n\n\nAnd just to be clear, I don\u2019t think people believe it\u2019s just lowbrow humor, but it does seem like slapstick or cheap gags are often the first things that come to mind when you hear the term \u201cphysical comedy.\u201d Things like pratfalls, exaggerated movements, or over-the-top antics dominate the perception, and there\u2019s a very good reason why. \n\nIt\u2019s because it\u2019s far easier to make cheap humor from physical comedy because it relies on immediate and exaggerated visual cues that require very little thought to elicit laughter. That\u2019s the reason why 95% of the time, this is how we see Physical Comedy predominantly being used in film. Unfortunately, because of this, the term \u201cPhysical Comedy\u201d has become somewhat synonymous with lowbrow humor. \n\n\n",

        "content": "Just watched *Field of Dreams* and as completely absurd as the film is, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It has that same sentimental magic that you get from Christmas classics like *It's a Wonderful Life*. It's sappy and at times, it's outright stupid, but it makes me wonder when it was that I myself stopped believing in magic. Being a Sunday afternoon and all, I can't help but feel that the Monday blues will be in full swing tomorrow as I clock in to sit in front of a computer for 8 hours while somewhere out there, the ghost of Ray Liotta plays baseball.\n\nOn a side note, it feels like an extended episode of the Twilight Zone or some other anthology series that doesn't concern itself with the rigid truths of the real world. It's very much an exercise of imagination. A \"what if?\" type story. I don't think they make enough of those these days.\n\nAnywho, time to watch *Waterworld.* It can't be as bad as they say, right?",

        "content": "I've seen this a million times but last night I watched it and I had new questions I never thought to ask.  Googling didn't really bring up a good answer either, which makes me wonder if there is an official answer for the film adaptation.\n\nBasically... what's the deal with the terraforming reactor?  Mainly I have two questions:\n\n1. Why didn't the Martians turn it on?  It clearly seems to work perfectly and EXTREMELY quickly, so what, did they die off the second they finished it?  Unless it's some sort of a setup for humans, i.e. 2001 monolith kind of thing (as someone asked years ago and is apparently what might be in the original story?) this seems crazy\n\n2. Why would the Martians need Mars terraformed?  Presumably they evolved there and their bodies would be used to that atmosphere/environment.  Even if they came there from another planet what are the odds they would want to Terraform Mars to an atmosphere that humans could breathe?  Coincidence?\n\nI think the only logical explanation is that they somehow for whatever reason designed and left it for humans to find once they reached the point where they could colonize Mars, but that still brings up the question of what happened to the Martians.\n\nBTW this movie still kicks ass and holds up, and also it's some of the craziest most efficient story telling in all of cinema.  There's like 5 seasons of a TV show you could milk out of this today and they just cram it into a 2 hour balls-to-the-wall action feast that somehow seems coherent despite having some wacky twists and mind bending concepts.",

It has certain \"cartoonishly macabre\" tone to it and \"the snobbish high society is dumb\" social commentary, both of which are pretty typical in Burton's movies.

Whether it be because of the camera shots, the color grading, etc.  \n\nFor example, out of The Lord of the Rings films, The Two Towers and The Return of the King seem visually timeless to me, but The Fellowship of the Ring seems to have a look to it that makes me think \u201cyeah I can tell that this was filmed in 1999.\u201d  (Which is confusing because all 3 films were filmed at once.)\n\nI suppose my question would obviously not apply to recent films as obviously they would be timeless because of their proximity to the current day.",

The shining was awesome too. \n\nWhat else would you recommend that somewhat fits the others?\n\n",
