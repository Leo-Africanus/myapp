        "content": "#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K.

        "content": "We all complain about how modern trailers have a tendency to spoil everything about the movie except maybe the big twist or the ending, and sometimes even those are not safe. Which is why it's surprising when something completely unexpected happens in the movie, not because it's something actually unexpected, but because the trailers and marketing completely omitted it. Sometimes even entire characters will be mostly absent from the marketing but turn out to be more important than some celebrities in the film that got top billing. Often this isn't even intentional, the people in charge of marketing just prioritized other things.\n\nSo what plot points/characters were you surprised weren't spoiled by the trailers?",

        "content": "I'm 40 years old and checked it out this morning, the perfect movie for a lazy Sunday morning. I'm not sure why I avoided this one for so long. Right out of the gate, the opening hostage scene at the grocery store pulls you in with its serious 80's action movie vibes. Whereas a movie like Commando purposely hit you with funny one-liners, Stallone's sleepwalking expressions through this movie allows his one-liners to come across with a more serious intention. We learn absolutely nothing about Stallone's character other than the fact that he means business when taking out bad guys. And the main henchman in this flick, I swear was a bad guy in every other 80s and early 90s movie. At times, this movie reminded me of a horror version of Robocop. Looking it up, looks like it came out a year before Robo. There were some serious horror vibes in this movie, especially the hospital chase that reminded me of Halloween 2 with Michael Myers. Cherry on top is when Brigitte Nielsen's character asks Stallone's character what he will do next after getting through this ordeal, and he says something like, probably work on another case.",

Those crucial years she could have taken advantage of the fame and exposure didn't happen and when she did come back, she got a rhinoplasty which modified her face and made her unrecognizable. \n\nI watch \"Dirty Dancing\", a formulaic yet engrossing romantic dance drama, and as sexy and charismatic as Patrick Swayze is, it is Jennifer Grey who keeps it together. She's the main protagonist, she's playing the \"ugly duckling\" who blossoms as a dancer and sizzles with Swayze onscreen, their relationship going from tense and hostile into affection, admiration and love. Grey's Baby is easily identifiable, any girl (or boy) can connect with her character.\n\nThe more I watch Dirty Dancing, the more I like Jennifer Grey. You don't see many heroines like her on film today. Some of her lines are cheesy and corny but Grey commits to it. I couldn't dislike her. I kept wanting to know what she'd do next, her character's clumsiness made her endearing instead of unapproachable like Cynthia Rhodes' Penny.",

The small monsters are **literally** the Chitauri? \n\nI finished the movie 20 minutes ago and I could not tell you what happens in the first third of it. \n\nIt\u2019s riddled with 2010s era action movie tropes. Hero saying \u201coh come on, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Dafuq. I don\u2019t need him to speak Ancient Greek but can Perseus please not sound like a Will Smith hero circa 2005?

        "content": "Apparently I\u2019m like the only person who loved this movie. I watched it a few minutes ago, and I really enjoyed it. I know I really loved a movie, when it ends and I want to immediately watch more of it. I even loved the sort of trailer type thing they did at the end. The way they\u2019ve introduced us to all of these characters, is very compelling to me. \n\nI liked how they opened the movies and then jumped forward five years, and then told us through other ways that they were indeed in the same settlement as the surveyors at the start of the movie. \n\nI loved the caravan that was being led Luke Wilson\u2019s character, and dynamics that were covered there. \n\nI loved Kevin Costners character, the little we find out about him. Perhaps, if there was one aspect I\u2019d have liked to seen more of it wod have been more Kevin Costner. I can\u2019t think of one aspect that I didn\u2019t enjoy. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll say, is I kind of wish Kevin Costner made a series, instead of a movie, so we can be guaranteed to see all of it. I\u2019m worried we aren\u2019t going to be able to see the last two chapters, and I think he probably could have gotten a TV series done. \n\nAnyway, I am hoping to find some like minded people who also enjoyed the movie. The last thing I\u2019ll say is, I miss this style of movie. It kind of reminded me of the eighties and nineties style movies. I haven\u2019t seen a movie in a long time that I enjoyed so much. I did not expect that coming in, given what I had heard about the movie from critics. I was very pleasantly surprised. Here is hoping they are able to get the funding together for a third and fourth chapter. ",

        "content": "I've been watching all of Scorsese's movies lately. Going through the whole filmography, rewatching films I'd seen many times, and some I'd never seen.\n\nI had never seen The King of Comedy before a few days ago. Now I've watched it like 5 times. I can't get enough!\n\nDeNiro and Jerry Lewis are pitch perfect. It's such an unsettling movie, and yet it really is hilarious throughout. Sandra Bernhard is transcendent!\n\nThe themes of obsession and the dark side of fame are so relevant today. Rupert's delusions, and often the inability to discern delusion from reality, make it such an eerie film, yet, like I said, I can't stop laughing.\n\nIt also defies all expectations. I really think he's going to kill Jerry, I'm convinced of it. I guess he might actually kill him, if what we see at the end is delusion, but we end without any confirmation, and it's perfect. If the end is reality, it's also bizarre, shocking, and yet plausible that someone could achieve fame and success in this way. I just love it.\n\nMy top five Scorsese pictures, with (1) being my favorite, are as follows:\n\n(5) Killers of the Flower Moon\n\n(4) The Wolf of Wall Street\n\n(3) Goodfellas\n\n(2) Taxi Driver\n\n(1) The King of Comedy\n\nMy favorites change almost daily, so keep that in mind before you come for me.",

Mason, the story is set in Sudan during the wars against the Mahdi. British officer Harry Faversham refuses to join an expedition to rescue General Charles Gordon, the British-appointed governor of Sudan, and resigns from his post. Viewing his withdrawal as cowardice, three friends and his fianc\u00e9e, Ethne, give him a white feather, the symbol of cowardice. Ethne then breaks off their engagement.\n\nWhen the expedition is defeated by the Mahdi\u2019s forces and British officers are taken prisoner, Harry travels to Sudan to rescue them. There, he saves his friends, who are hostages of the Mahdi. His friends, acknowledging his bravery, return the feathers as apologies. Ethne also gives back the white feather she had given him.\n\nIf I were the protagonist, I would not accept Ethne\u2019s apology \u2014 she, who never fought in the war, remained comfortably in England, and called me a coward. I would reject her excuses and refuse reconciliation. Refusing to fight in a senseless colonialist war is not cowardice.\n\nJack, one of Harry\u2019s friends, discovers Harry was his savior by touching his face. He releases Ethne from their engagement, as she had become engaged to another friend of her former fianc\u00e9. After a memorial ceremony, Harry and Ethne hold hands and renew their commitment.\n\nI only wish the protagonist had rejected her and left for another country, denying her a second chance.\n\nHeath Ledger plays Harry Faversham, and Kate Hudson portrays his fianc\u00e9e, Ethne",

Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

        "content": "Are bigotry and racism so fundamentally, obviously illogical that there's no need to make a case against it or are they so dangerous that it's irresponsible for a film to present it through a neutral lens?\n\nThe Order is a 2024 crime film about the FBI hunting down an extremist white supremacist splinter group. Directed by Justin Kurzel from an adapted screenplay by Zach Baylin, the film takes a no-nonsense, cops &amp; robbers approach to this chilling story. It's an engaging, well constructed film that moves at a good pace and even has some great cinematography. There is not a lot of cinematic flourishes but what there are are memorable like the shot where a camera attached to a car door reveals a gunman when the door swings open. \n\nBut watching the film I couldn't help but notice the limits of using the outlaw/cops and robbers film language to tell a story about, well, neo nazis. Because the film focuses almost entirely on the FBI doing their job and the villains on their quest, the film doesn't really engage with the ideology. The film gives the villain, played excellently by Nicholas Hoult, the arc of a doomed moral victor dying for his cause. The exact same screenplay could be used to tell the story of some righteous rebel fighting an oppressive regime. \n\nThe character Alan Berg (Marc Maron) is given some space to speak but they're mostly empty platitudes about hope and love and man's inherent kindness. Nicholas Hoult's character, on the other hand, is a competent revolutionary, given the space to actually air his case. His case is insane, unfounded, replacement theory nonsense and his racism and antisemitism is plainly visible. There is definitely a case to be made that these ideas are fundamentally illogical and any debate that could be had is long settled so there's no need for the film to explicitly argue against it. It's plainly abhorrent to most of us, especially the 6 step plan. But at the same time, for anyone who already buys into the villain's political ideologies the film is almost a mythic tale of standing your ground.\n\nI don't want films to be preachy but, as well made as this film was, it was uncomfortable, especially towards the end where Jude Laws's character (the FBI agent) seems to connect with Hoult's who gets a glorious, even mythic ending (the cinematography does a good job of that).\n\nI don't know what the right approach would have been. A Coen brothers esque approach where the villain's incompetence and inherent absurdity are highlighted? A BlacKkKlansman esque mockery and undercurrent of anger in the storytelling? Telling the story from the point of view of Alan Berg and other victims? \n\nIf you haven't seen the film, definitely check it out. It's a really good movie. As much as it raises uncomfortable questions about the relationship between form, content, theme and artistic responsibility, I don't actually think that this one movie is going to influence anything.",
