        "content": "I haven't watched this in many years, but decided to do a re-watch since Brody won again last night. I remembered the brutal parts of the movie, but I didn't remember how casually it all starts. The family is living their lives trying to go on like everything is okay. Szpilman keeps playing the piano as bombs fall outside of the studio. He is flirting with the girl who came to see him. There's the normal sibling banter going on. Then the food starts get scarcer. The neighbors get killed. The ghetto is a rumor that becomes true. Everything starts so small, but then his entire family gets put on the train. It's so sad and so scary to see the world change so quickly- to see people lose everything.\n\nEdit: I intentionally did not bring up America because I did not want a bunch of MAGAts spewing their hate. But, whatever, let them do what they will.\n\nAs an American, when I learned about the Holocaust as a child, I remember wondering how \"regular\" people could let that happen? I wondered why the good Germans let the bad Germans start doing bad things? Why didn't they stop them? Why the Jewish people \"go along\" with it? Why didn't they fight? \n\nAs an adult watching this again, I connect so much with the desperation to hold on to normalcy. When everything you hold to be true is being upended, you so badly want to believe that \"things can't get that bad\". because if you do, how do you keep living your life? I know what's happening right now. I cannot convey the level of hopelessness you feel to watch you country's leader openly align with a murderous dictator.\n\nI am worried. I am scared. I am angry. The people who voted for our current regime are my neighbors, co-workers, and former friends. The \"bad guys\" live next door. They fly their hate flags high. My friends and I are so overwhelmed by the barrage of changes, by the geopolitical horror show, and by the impacts this will have globally for decades to come. We are the ones being targeted by this government: queer folks, immigrants, non-Christians. We are also the ones who work in our communities providing what's needed without bias to who needs it. Now we need all of you- Americans or not. Please keep calling out this regime. Please keep boy-cutting our products and tourism. Please remember that there are many of us who voted against this, who are living our lives every day promoting the values that we want to see in our country. We cannot do it alone. It's horrifying. It's depressing. We need you to carry us when we feel like we're breaking so we can keep finding the strength to resist. ",

        "content": "I rewatched this not that long ago, and even though I know it's pretty standard to watch comedies from this era and see a lot of things that are like 'wow that didn't age well' (even if it's still an otherwise funny movie), but rewatching this, I was surprised at how the overall messaging and way it depicts these characters felt a lot more fair and interesting than a lot of other films from that era.\n\nParticularly, the scene where Jack Black takes the principal out to get drinks and we see a totally different side of her, as well as when we see the barrage of parents harassing her and suddenly we totally get a sense of how this kind of pressure could lead to someone becoming like this. I feel like the trope of 'the stuffy old mean teacher lady' has been a comedy thing for about as long as there have been movies set in schools, but this one just flips it on its head in a way that really stood out to me.\n\nIt also does a really good job at avoiding the overly cartoony cliche ending of \"oh, but look what they learned! it's totally fine!\" I mean, yes, it does that somewhat with the very ending over the credits, but the parents are still very rightfully furious that this random stranger has been with their kids, and the movie treats it more like how I expect people would react to it in real life. It's a tiny thing, but just giving these elements (such as the principal or the parents reactions) a little more believability and less cartoonish one dimensionality really adds to it.\n\nI'm also glad they never did a sequel, because there's absolutely no reason to, although now that I've said that I'm assuming we'll see a headline that it's been greenlit within the next two days.",

I think she stood a slight chance of getting a nomination for Amelia but that didn't pull through. \n\nThe last I heard of her was in that Christian film she did with Alan Ritchson and there was that. \n\nI've always liked Hillary Swank. I was rooting for her when she got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, a major FU for 90210 after they fired her. \n\nIt's unfortunate Hollywood didn't know how to use her properly.

        "title": "Juno is totally different as an adult",
        "content": "I recently watched Juno for the first time since I was about 13 or 14. I was in junior high I believe when the movie first released, and seeing it as an adult really blew my mind. The creators somehow perfectly captured the awkward and intense feelings of not being a kid, but not quite an adult yet either. \n\nFirst note, Mark was a massive creep and weirdo. Kissing a teenage girl when you\u2019re an adult is creepy and gross all on its own. Then you throw in that SHE WAS CARRYING THEIR ADOPTIVE CHILD. What the actual fuck! What a disgusting pathetic man. Watching the scene when he took Juno to the basement to show her the comic of a pregnant super hero was so disgusting. Their relationship in general was coming off very grooming, then he was seducing a pregnant 16 year old girl who was extremely vulnerable. In my young teenage mind, I thought Vanessa was such a wet blanket, suppressing his creative side and making him and Juno both feel like losers. In reality, she was a saint who should have kicked him to the curb way sooner. He deserved no grace. I cannot imagine my partner not only cheating on me, but cheating with a teenager. And not just a teenager, a pregnant teenager who is carrying my adoptive son. Vanessa was such a great person and didn\u2019t deserve anything that pathetic excuse of a man put her through. \n\nSecond note, Juno(and company) is extremely immature and the creators did a great job of showcasing it. I love her quirkiness, but the way she did not understand why it was inappropriate to be popping up at Mark and Vanessa\u2019s house was very telling. There are two sides to that coin, because she may have known it was inappropriate but was too young and naive to see the long term outcome of the situation. She definitely didn\u2019t understand why a man of his age shouldn\u2019t be chumming it up with her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy the fact that he was even giving her attention at all. It helped that he liked the same things, so in her mind it was confirming she was cool. It just shows exactly how immature she was, unable to look past your own bubble to see the rest of your life. \n\nOn another note, it was implied that she and Bleaker were way better friends than what we saw in the movie. It seemed that they were hanging out everyday, had all the same interests and hobbies. But, when Juno came up pregnant Bleaker fell off the map. He never seemed pressed when she would stop and say hey, but he did absolutely nothing to try and help her in the situation. He also didn\u2019t understand why it hurt her so much he was taking someone else to a dance. At that point in the plot, we really got to see how the normally confident and abrasive Juno was becoming self conscious and confused by the weight of her feelings. Highlighting how juvenile everyone was, while dealing with such a serious situation was just top tier writing. The whole movie did such a great job of capturing exactly how it feels to be 16. Too old for childhood, but nowhere near an adult yet. Even though every single 16 year old in the world thinks they\u2019re an adult. It takes growing up to realize exactly how childish you still are at that age. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worth mentioning how great of parents her dad and Bren were. Bren was her step mom and they didn\u2019t seem particularly close, but she didn\u2019t hesitate when it came to Juno. Of the jump, she was getting her to a doctor, coming to her defense when needed, and making sure she had everything she needed. And her father, who was obviously uncomfortable with emotional bridges with his teenaged daughter, made sure she knew she was loved. The scene of her in hospital after giving birth brought tears to my eyes. \n\nAs a whole, the movie is great. I\u2019m not sure what category you could out this movie in, but they somehow captured a vibe of nostalgia I didn\u2019t know I was missing. And just to bring it in again, we should all beat Marks ass if we ever happened to see his character out in the real world. \n\n*Edit Note: \n\npeople are being gross about Elliot Page being in the movie. Elliot is an amazing actor and their gender at any point in their life has absolutely NOTHING to do with the character of Juno. I\u2019m referring to Juno as she/her, not Elliot. You\u2019re weird if you care about someone else\u2019s gender enough to be a dick about it. No one cares what you think. Elliot is happy and that\u2019s all that\u2019s important. Keep your weird ass comments to yourself if you\u2019ve got something nasty to say. You\u2019re the weird one if you can\u2019t just simply respect what a person wants for their own autonomy.

        "content": "I was recently thinking why do Stephen King's books usually make great films, and concluded it probably helps that the books themselves are great (along with having the right director, screen writer etc.). Then I was wondering, are there any films that were great (popular, critically acclaimed etc.) but based on books that were considered bad? I know things are subjective and what some consider bad isn't the case for everyone, but are there books that were considered UNIVERSALLY crap that somehow made a good film?\n\nThis isn't exactly one of those posts about films that are better than the books they were based on, but taking it further that the books themselves were terrible to begin with. E.g. Fight Club is usually the \"go-to \" for a film that was better than the book, but Fight Club the book was still a success. I'm looking for \"how the hell did someone turn this crappy book into this amazing film?\".\n\nJust curious if there even is one.",

        "content": "I was having a discussion with some coworkers today about this and it\u2019s actually kind of interesting \n\nBecause on the one hand in the Truman show you\u2019re living in the world where everything around you is fake nothing in your life is real but every day there\u2019s new adventures and new things happening and unlike Truman, you might not even figure out that everything is fake so to you, life would be normal, but you would still feel an unease, because people would act very strange around you. It\u2019s possible you would figure it out and make an escape but it\u2019s also possible that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nOn the other hand in Groundhog Day, it\u2019s really the opposite because in the Truman show everyone else knows what\u2019s happening and you don\u2019t but in Groundhog Day, you\u2019re the only one who knows that the day is repeating over and over again, you\u2019re the only one that can comprehend what is really happening in a lot of ways you\u2019re the only one who is real, and there would be benefits as Bill Murray\u2019s character found out you could live every day and have no consequences life would have limited things that you could do and you would live in a world where no new things would come into existence, you couldn\u2019t have any real meaningful relationship, I guess if you\u2019re already married or dating your partner would just relive the day with you but conversation would never blossom, and you would eventually know what everybody is going to say\u2026\n\nThe other problem is that you might never figure out the perfect day to end the loop\n\n\nBoth scenarios there\u2019s a possibility of escape but neither is a guarantee\u2026\n\nSo if you have the choice, which one would you choose?\n",

But now, Conclave has become a critical and financial success as a PG rated drama for grown ups, a genre which has seen few hits since the dawn of the PG13 rating. So will Conclave be the start of a new generation of films like Out of Africa and Driving Miss Daisy (PG rated Oscar winning dramas from the post PG13 era) or is it just an outlier?",

I understand that Melissa Leo was the abductor and that Paul Dano was a freak and a weirdo but he kind of didn\u2019t do anything, but who the hell was David Dasmalchian?

I still don\u2019t get that. \n\nI know it\u2019s the Oscars hangover today, but this occurred to me and I still have no idea who the hell he was. ",

Does this trump the convo about last night\u2019s upset? Love that he brings it back to 1951 , putting the Anora/Substance upset into context. ",
