Every shot, every glance felt like it mattered, and the music made the whole standoff even more epic. Without the song, the scene would still be iconic, but not the musical score made it unforgettable. Ennio Morricone is such a great composer for that film and others (A Fistful of Dollars, The Hateful Eight etc.).\n\n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong answer \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear which scenes you think the music made unforgettable.

There are lots of bad movies which still are very beautifully shot, but how about good films where the image on screen are the only element missing.\n\nI would count films like the Dogme 95 movies where there some might say the cinematography is not conventionally attractive, even if it was still deliberate.\n\nA couple of suggestions I\u2019d throw out are the Kenneth Branagh Agatha Christie adaptions which are reasonably entertaining, but have both glaringly bad CGI, and particularly in the case of Haunting in Venice, some super bizarre shot choices. The Hobbit movies also easily lose a star or two each because of how bad the CGI and lighting is in those films\n",

Some movies can instantly lift your mood, make you laugh even though you know every joke, or remind you of a specific period in your life. Which movie do you find yourself going back to again and again? And what makes it so rewatchable for you personally ?",

I laugh in delight all the way through it. It's John Woo at his John Wooiest. \n\nIt's sad that people seem to think it's the worst of the series. ",

        "content": "I'm currently mildly inebriated and watching The Princess Diaries, and my god is Lily just *the worst*\n\n- She harshly criticizes Mia any time she attempts to interact socially with anyone that isn't her\n\n-She says \"I thought we were done talking about that?\" when Mia brings up the death of her father, which happened TWO MONTHS before the start of the film. This implies that Lily is so controlling of Mia that she's dictated how Mia grieves *the death of her father*\n\n-When Mia gets the makeover and looks *stunning*, Lily is so overtly cruel and mocking that Mia, who until that moment was starting to feel herself for arguably the first time in her life, tries to make herself as small as possible.\n\n-When she finds out that Mia is in line for the throne of Genovia, her immediate and only thought is how it can benefit her, and when Mia turns her down because she can't just do shit as a head of state to appease her high school \"best friend\", she crashes out and abandons Mia.\n\nShe's one of the worst movie best friends out there for sure, but there are so many others. So who is your pick for Worst Best Friend In Film? ",

It's such a perfectly done scene and perfect choice of music.\n\nWhat is your pick? and why?",
