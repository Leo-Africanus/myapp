        "content": "It's unfortunate it didn't do as well as some of the more popular Eddir Murphy movies because Bowfinger is probably among his top 5 movies ever. Then again, thank god it didn't do a lot or else we would have had a couple of mediocre sequels. \n\nThere isn't a single flaw in this movie. Even the set-up of the unknown dorky twin works because the writing is so good and Murphy plays it up so well, either as the narcissistic egomaniacal asshole Kit Ramsey with his endless rants about not being appreciated or racist paranoia (he mistakes Shakespeare for Shake a Spear), or the geeky Jiff who's used by the untalented director, Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), as a occasional body double for Kit Ramsey, in his movie \"Chubby Rain\". Bowfinger decides to direct a movie by filming Ramsey without him knowing about it.\n\nHe also has aging actress Carol (Christine Baranski), who doesn't know when to overact and wants to have sex with Kit Ramsey, Daisy (Heather Grahame), an aspiring and ambitious actress who can't act but will do anything to go up in her career (said to be a diss directed at Anne Heche whom Steve Martin used to date), Afrim (Adam Alexi Malle), a Videostore owner who helps fund Bowfinger's ambitions among others. \n\nThe film also features strong supporting turns from Robert Downey Jr (during his \"I'm cancelled Junkie\" phase) and Terence Stamp. \n\nA highlarious movie. The highway scene is a classic. It always gives its audience an uproarious laughter.",

A Weir-Ford collaboration akin to Scorsese-De Niro would have been something. I don't know the behind the scenes of it all and maybe Weir and Ford tried to make other projects but they fell through.\n\nFord was also heavily recruited for the Michael Douglas role in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. I just don't get turning down Soderbergh, you know? And Soderbergh likes to collaborate with his actors he has worked with before. A Soderbergh-Ford pairing over multiple movies would have been something to see.\n\nI just think Ford lessened his dramatic ambitions and retreated to mediocre thrillers and callbacks to earlier roles that sometimes worked (Blade Runner 2049) and sometimes didn't (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.)",

They also tend to only show the best parts of their lives and leave out a lot of the negative stuff. If I'm interested enough I'd rather watch a documentary on them. Its much more interesting.",

Although there weren\u2019t many similarities between his life and mine, it had a profound impact on my thought process moving forward in life.\n\nI started looking at college, career, and friendships as options, and I didn\u2019t really give them the importance they deserved. I did it all, but not wholeheartedly\u2014not with purpose, the way other people did.\n\nJust like Chris, I started finding ways to be alone in any situation. No matter what the situation was, it was only being alone that brought me peace\u2014whether it was being alone in my room, getting on a random bus and traveling without any purpose, writing a journal while sitting in the garden, or going to the roof to look at the stars. It was almost as if, whenever I was around people, I felt lonelier.\n\nJust like Chris realized in the end that \u201chappiness is real only when shared,\u201d I\u2019ve realized in the last two years that friendships, love, and family are extremely important for a good life.\n\nYou cannot live an isolated life if you want to be successful\u2014unless you\u2019re a genius who is so good at what he does and so busy working that nothing else really bothers him. People skills are really important if you want to advance in your career. You need to be a good communicator to have a healthy relationship. You need to have connections with the right people when things get tough. Life has taught me these lessons the hard way.\n\nMy reluctance (unknowingly) to get along with people has resulted in many friendships ending or going stale. My fear of losing people and the belief that someone would take away my personal space kept me away from relationships. My preconceived notions of having zero expectations from others and thinking people are inherently bad stopped me from developing meaningful connections.\n\nI really wish I hadn\u2019t watched that movie at that age. I was just starting to open up to people. I was at a stage in my life where I was still figuring out how life works, and I couldn\u2019t get that movie out of my head for years.\n\nI\u2019m doing well now. I hang out with people. I spend time with my family whenever I can. I\u2019m still learning to make new friends and develop connections, but I\u2019ll get better.\n\nWhat is a movie you wish you hadn\u2019t watched, and why?\n\n\n\n\n",

What a masterpiece.\n\n\n*\"After a shooting incident at the North-South Korean border DMZ leaves two North Korean soldiers dead, a neutral Swiss and Swedish team investigates what actually happened.\"*\n\n\nSong Kang-ho could very well be my number 1 favorite actor. I just love the guy. So damn likable! And he's absolutely fantastic in this...\n\n\nBeautiful, heartbreaking film. Park Chan-wook is a filmmaking genius.\n\n\nDrop whatever it is you're doing and go watch this thing - right now! Haha.",

Stumbled upon that film RIGHT before the first lesbian scene. I was absolutely mesmerized but was also trying to fumble for the remote to turn the movie off. My mom (who ALWAYS jokingly gave me a hard time about that kind of thing, this also happened with movies like Bound and Love &amp; Other Drugs) quipped, as I frantically shut the TV off that I had to have been enjoying it... she wasn't wrong. I'm still so captivated by that whole scene and having the movie's full context later. It's so beautiful.\n\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect this much engagement! I love seeing everyone's answers. Seems like someone needs to make a compilation of a lot of the top answers...",

From Jenny\u2019s abuse, to all the characters suffering so badly that if you put yourself in your shoes for a moment, you wonder how they haven\u2019t gone crazy.\n\nBiggest shock factor for me was the scene at the start where Mrs Gump is essentially coerced into sex with the principal to get her son into school. As a child I had no idea - for some reason I thought the principal was just having an asthma attack in the house, which explained the weird noises he made. \n\nAnyway, any other films you rewatched and were surprised at as an older person?
