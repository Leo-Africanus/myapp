The absurd acting, surreal plot, confusing character actions. I felt like I was going insane watching it. I don't think I'm anywhere near understanding it but I was glued to the screen the entire time. I gave it a 4.5/ 5",

For example killers of the flower moon had both Robert deniro and Leonardo DiCaprio but more people probably saw that film because it was directed by Scorsese than they did for the lead actors. ",

        "content": "I've been casually looking for this film for ages, but so far no luck. I fully appreciate that I'm probably SOL here, but am holding out hope that maybe some archivist, old theatre, or collector happened to stash this one away.\n\nThe film is \"[The Gangsters of New York\"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004002/?ref_=ttpl_ov_i) released in 1914 by Reliance Motion Picture Co.  \n(Not to be confused with the comedy \"The Gangsters\" 1913, with Fatty Arbuckle).\n\n\n\nThis is an early cinema full length drama that was at the time touted as a very true to life depiction of the grit and criminal element in NYC. It was released a year and a half after a major gang-related event, and was believed to have been a direct response to it. In fact, some real-life members of the criminal element at the time filed a defamation lawsuit against the studio for the way some of the characters were depicted. Some articles and reviews from 1914 suggest that many of the secondary and background actors were actual gangsters and criminals, to give the film more \"authenticity\". If that's the case, it would be a massive help for a 10-year-long research project I've been working on.\n\n\n\nThe film was originally distributed on 4 reels and did go on a tour across north America, starting in NYC and going as far as Edmonton in Canada (based on newspaper records from 1914 and 1915). \n\n\n\nOf what I've been able to find online, the film was lost, potentially in the 1965 MGM Vault fire. BUT I'm thinking that maybe copies survived that had gone on tour? Maybe one of those Canadian stops?\n\nReally a shot in the dark here, but if anyone can help, I think it would be Reddit.",

        "content": "Recently twitter introduced me to Immortal (Imortel, ad vitam) - 2004 french sci-fi that's 50% cool and imaginative reproduction of Enki Bilal's work and 50% absolutely abhorrent cgi and at times disjointed plot, and, for how weird and frankly just not very good the movie is, I really enjoyed it for how stylized and batshit insane it is (and I admit it's been years since I touched the Nikopol comics so I pretty much went in blind). I think I'd put it in the same \"vibes\" folder as Animatrix, A Scanner Darkly, Metropolis, Repo: Genetic Opera, Aeon Flux (the cartoon, not the movie), and Moebius' Metabarons comics.\n\nCould anyone recommend movies that feel like this? I'm not just looking for interesting depictions of sci-fi dystopias, but mainly very ambitious (for better or for worse) visuals - from the designs to the techniques used, e.g. the rotoscoping in Scanner Darkly or how Immortal used cgi so extensively for its time.",
