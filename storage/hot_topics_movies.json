        "content": "I remember first coming across this rumour maybe ten years ago and immediately finding it suspicious: it gently sexualised a charismatic, 'wholesome' actor and suggested a highly friendly and funny atmosphere on set - it felt like fan-fiction about real people, something very online fans of The Mummy might like to imagine happened. \n\nThe only evidence were photographs of Arnold Vosloo and Brendan Fraser laughing and smiling during an interview for The Mummy with subtitles of the interview embedded at the base of the image:\n\n&gt;*\"We' re filming the prologue. The cameras start rolling. I'm standing by, and we're all waiting for Patricia to make her entrance. Instead, out struts Brendan dressed like Anck-Su-Namun. Body paint, gold pasties, and everything else.\"*\n\n&gt;*\"\\*Laughing\\* I wasn't even supposed to be on set that day. Arnold's face was the funniest shit I ever saw.\"*\n\nAnd again, the dialogue reads like someone who's trying to sound like an actor telling an anecdote during an interview. \n\nNow this has evolved, and clickbait Facebook pages tell the same story with AI images. \n\nI've always found this example slightly worrying - it's always appeared to me to be something that sounds plausible while still being obviously fake. However, it seems to have become a generally accepted bit of BTS trivia. \n\nAnother good example of the same phenomenon would be the frequently repeated 'fact' that Peter Jackson wanted any stunt rider who wanted going to be at the front of the Rohirrim's charge in The Return of the King to prove their love of Tolkien's books by quoting Theoden's speech - obvious horseshit to anyone who knows anything about how film sets work. \n\nAre there any other examples of popular BTS anecdotes which are bullshit?

        "content": " When I say that Rat Race is one of the funniest and comedically psychotic movies in decades, I'm not exaggerating.  I can, and have, watched it hundreds of times and still love it. How many movies can you find a murdering squirrel lady, nazis, a mob of Lucy impersonators, and a rocket car? Seems like movies these days want to push some kind of message or agenda when all we really need is something to make us forget real life for a while and make us laugh.",

Other times it kinda throws you off in a weird way.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s always the plot twist or tone shift that sticks in my mind more than anything else.\n\nWhich movie did that for you \u2014 where you went in expecting one thing, and halfway through it became something completely different (good or bad)?\n\nCurious to hear which ones surprised you the most.",

        "content": "Just watched Go (1999) as an unexpected Christmas movie. Loved the description as \"a very 90's teenage Pulp Fiction\". I hadn't watched it since being a teen in that period, and it was fascinating to have that extra layer of \"this is the late 90's\", and have it feel authentic, moreso than something forced like Empire Records (1995), who just missed the end of grunge.\n\nI also watched Cocktail (1988) this summer, and it was fantastically 80's as a movie, and in the movie, obviously. Most reviews were meh, but obviously they were contemporary to the film and so couldn't fully grasp how gloriously 80's the whole thing was.\n\nAny other movies that live on for you as perfect time capsules of a moment in time?",
