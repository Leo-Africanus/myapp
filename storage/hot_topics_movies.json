        "title": "V For Vendetta (2005) is more relevant now that when it was released",
        "content": "It's been nearly two decades since V for Vendetta (2005) hit theaters, and while it was powerful then, it feels downright prophetic now. The film (adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novel) depicts a world gripped by authoritarian rule, where fear and control are used to suppress dissent, manipulate the public, and eliminate those who don't fit a rigid, regime-approved mold. Sound familiar?\n\nOver the past several years, we've seen a troubling global shift toward far-right politics and fascist rhetoric. Governments are cracking down on dissent, scapegoating marginalized groups, and using mass surveillance and propaganda to consolidate power. In America, book bans are rising, protests are being criminalized, and political leaders openly flirt with authoritarianism while spinning their actions as \"preserving democracy.\" Meanwhile, corporations and media conglomerates control narratives just as tightly as the Norsefire regime did in V for Vendetta. The line between fiction and reality is thinner than ever.\n\nTo fans of the original graphic novel, and I am one\u2014yes, I know, the book did a lot of things better. Alan Moore\u2019s work was sharper in its critique of Thatcher-era Britain specifically, and the story had more complexity in certain areas. But that doesn\u2019t mean the film was bad. In fact, I\u2019d argue it made a few changes that I actually like (though I won\u2019t go into spoilers). The movie, despite its differences, still stands as a powerful and necessary story\u2014one that feels chillingly relevant today.\n\nAlso, Alan Moore hating adaptations of work is par for the course. He's entitled to that opinion as an artist, but the film stands on its own.\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t watched V for Vendetta in a while, I highly recommend revisiting it. It\u2019s no longer just a dystopian cautionary tale; it\u2019s a mirror reflecting where we might be headed if we\u2019re not careful. And remember! Ideas are bulletproof.",

But someone said that due to these types of grifters and the tactic of bombarding of content, things such as a movie being good but not great are viewed as negative nowadays. Then other things such as perpetuating blanket statements as facts. I remember seeing one \"reviewer\" talking about how there's \"no good remakes\" as you can see a poster for \"A Star is Born\" (2018) in the background and they weren't being ironic. There are other examples of how this type of content has really hampered movie going and watching. ",

        "content": "**Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_brave_new_world): 53% (133 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/captain-america-brave-new-world/): 43 (41 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-reboot-1236286418/):\n\n&gt;Director Julius Onah (*Luce)* and a boatload of writers provide plenty of oppotunity for Mackie to show his strengths although Evans\u2019 Steve Rogers is a tough act to follow. That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/) (70):\n\n&gt;Wilson\u2019s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He\u2019s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark\u2019s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s motormouth), and Wilson\u2019s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie\u2019s when-you\u2019re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we\u2019re thinking, \u201cWasn\u2019t the earlier Captain America more\u2026super?\u201d\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/) (40):\n\n&gt;At 118 minutes, *Captain America: Brave New World* thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*, *The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford\u2019s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in that franchise\u2019s final installment.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (30):\n\n&gt;\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d was directed by Julius Onah (\u201cLuce\u201d), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the real problem is that we weren\u2019t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film\u2019s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fitting enough that \u201cBrave New World\u201d is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It\u2019s even more fitting that it\u2019s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers\u2019 shadow, but there\u2019s still no indication that the MCU ever will.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/) (40):\n\n&gt;While *Brave New World* is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits\u2019 teaser \u2014 you knew there would be one \u2014 feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might [once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something\u2019s coming, we\u2019re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (4/10):\n\n&gt;In trying to do so much all at once, *Captain America: Brave New World* forgets what made its title character a relatable fan-favorite. Instead, we get a narrative that is as convoluted as it is boring, visuals that are as unappealing as they are uninspired, and a Marvel movie that is as frustrating as it is forgettable. Had this been a random C-list Marvel hero, that would be forgivable, but for a character as revered as Captain America, it's a huge disappointment.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/12/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-harrison-ford-juggles-green-screens-red-fists-and-vanilla-plotting) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Brave it might be, but there\u2019s nothing all that \u201cnew\u201d about the world revealed in this latest tired and uninspired dollop of content from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nDirected by Julius Onah:\n\n&gt;Following the election of Thaddeus Ross as the president of the United States, Sam Wilson finds himself at the center of an international incident and must work to stop the true masterminds behind it.\n\nCast:\n\n* Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Captain America\n* Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres / Falcon\n* Shira Haas as Ruth Bat-Seraph\n* Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley\n* Xosha Roquemore as Leila Taylor\n* J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson as Copperhead\n* Giancarlo Esposito as Seth Voelker / Sidewinder\n* Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns / Leader\n* Harrison Ford as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross / Red Hulk",

        "content": "Ive watched a lot of comedies such as monty python and hot shots, scary movie, Airplaine!, etc.\n\nNowadays comedies just make me snore and bored. I need something funny to watch, one that is guaranteed to make me laugh. Not some movie wirh just tiny joke that make you chuckle for a second, i want to be on the floor. \n\nI like movies that dont take themselves to serious. Or a movie where i dont really need to have seen another movie to understand the humor. Slapstick seems to work with this a lot.\n\nEdit: thank you guys for the recommendations so far, although i will try to upvite as many as i can. i will compiling them into a letterboxd list. So far i have 18 :D\nTime to crack open a beer and sit back!",

Despite his troubled history and just delusion now, that dude gave a helluva performance.\n\nWhen he spouts \u201c\u2026I *hate* you.\u201d \n\nI cried. Literally cried. I felt everything that was taken from him in that moment. \n\nAnyway, still holds up, mostly.",

It was beyond all the expectations I had for the film and found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of some of it being over the top, the gore and then the pure insanity of it.  Definitely would go see this again\u2026 and our illustrious director even makes a small\u2026 SMALL cameo on the film.  Definitely one to be a cult classic\u2026 ",
