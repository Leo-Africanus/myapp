        "content": "The scene is from the Special Edition, the one where the xenomorph is born from an ox instead of a dog.\n\nI find this to be the best single sequence in the entire film and it is nothing short of magnificent. The emotional punch of the scene, the sombre atmosphere, Sigourney Weaver's facial expressions, Elliot Goldenthal's score, Charles Durning's monologue ... everything comes together beautifully.\n\nThe editing of the scene is particularly a thing of beauty. As Charles Durning says, \"for within each seed, there is the promise of a flower\", the xeno bursts out of the ox in the next shot, which is immediately followed by Ripley's nose bleeding that serves as foreshadowing for her eventual condition.\n\nIn light of how well executed this sequence is, I find it to be a pity that the rest of the film turned out to be such an incoherent mess. I won't write down everything I find to be wrong with the film, just a few points as I remember them.\n\n1. Elliot Goldenthal's score takes a drastic downturn after this scene. The rock music playing during the gang rape was particularly hideous. Who had that bright idea, I don't want to know.\n2. I had seen the theatrical version long ago and therefore, the subplot of trapping the xeno inside a nuclear waste chamber came as a surprise to me. Now I think the entire sequence and its aftermath was a complete waste of time and was rightly excised from the theatrical cut.\n3. The finale is an utter mess. I had little idea of what was happening and who was where.",

What feels like a slow paced burn turns into a gut punch by the end when you make complete sense of whatever events that have happened.\u00a0\n\nThe movie is about a girl revisiting the memory of her father and her revaluation of the whole trip through the eyes of an experienced adult. She doesn\u2019t read too much into it when she\u2019s in those moments but now that she\u2019s pieced it all together, she sees her father\u2019s pain and suffering and we as the viewers come to feel it in the end too. This is why i feel aftersun is a painful and haunting watch.\n\nThe cinematography and background score really help us fill up the blanks that the movie deliberately leave for us. All of it really ties into an emotional and unforgettable experience. I don\u2019t think im getting over this for a while",

They know what happens. They've seen the whole movie. And they do it anyway  \nKaufman builds that ambiguity in deliberately.

        "content": "***Scream 3 SPOILERS below***\n\nScream 3 is set around a filmmaker who is trying desperately to get his Stab 3 movie done, but the studio keeps dicking him around and forcing rewrites, just like the production of Scream 3. \n\nScream 3 also follows a breadcrumb trail that this filmmaker leaves for a world-famous investigative journalist to expose his disgusting producer for the various sex crimes he's committed over the decades.\n\nAnd what is the breadcrumb trail? The story of a young woman who went to Hollywood and wanted to be an actress, but was forced out by the trauma of the sexual abuse that she endured there. If you're not familiar with what happened to Rose McGowan (a.k.a. Tatum from the first Scream), I highly recommend looking it up. \n\nAfter the information is finally out and the producer is confronted about what he's done, the filmmaker violently kills him. \n\n----\n\nTLDR; &gt;! A film about a filmmaker who publically exposes his producer's long history of exploiting and sexually abusing actresses...and then murders him for it. Produced by Harvey Weinstein. !&lt;",

The acting by Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington is superb. The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is incredible.

Anyways, I just had to get that off my chest and show my appreciation!\n\nEdit: typos",
