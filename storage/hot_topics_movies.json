        "content": "This movie nails the miserable mundane life on an office worker (and any job really) it\u2019s hilarious and also kinda sad because of how accurate it is. Everything depicted in terms of a job in this film has happened to me, the traffic in the morning, the annoying co workers, the passive aggressive boss who you can clearly tell is trying to be sarcastic and piss you off, the annoying soul sucking phrases (\u201csounds like a case of the Monday\u2019s\u201d) and if you screw up, you have 3 different people telling you the same shit within the span of 10 minutes and you have to just suck it up and take it, unfortunately as long as these jobs exist, this film will remain timeless. The second half of this film is just as great at the first because it shows all the things that YOU WANT to do but can\u2019t because you\u2019ll get fired, Mike Judge really nailed the realism of jobs, and it\u2019s one of my all time favorite comedies, however it can also be called a documentary\ud83d\ude02",

The film has a certain level of camp from Meg Ryan playing 3 different characters to Joe having to throw himself into a volcano to appease the gods of islanders who love orange soda.\n\nStart to finish one of my favorite films, insanely infectious dialogue, goofy playful absurdity, a very defined aesthetic. I can't even begin to truly express how much this movie means to me.\n\nNot looking for straight romance movies, Joe Versus The Volcano isn't really your typical romance. It's more of a fantasy adventure with romance on the side imo.\n\n\"This is one of those typical conversations where we're all open and sharing our innermost thoughts and it's all bullshit and a lie and it doesn't cost\u00a0*you*\u00a0anything!\"",

        "title": "The Devil Wears Prada: Andy's Boyfriend and Friends Still Suck. (Except Emily, I love Emily)",
        "content": "I decided to re-watch the movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\" as I was bored, and needed something to do. I watched it with my fianc\u00e9, kind of. (He was playing a videogame while occasionally listening in).\n\nSo, going into the movie again, I thought 'Maybe, just maybe Andy's friends and boyfriend aren't as bad as I remember.\" I thought this was a possibility as the last time I watched the movie was when I was like, 13. So I thought maybe some of the details my teenage girl brain jumbled up, but nope. They were still bad.\n\nI mean, first of all... they do originally come off as somewhat supportive. But then Andy begins putting a bit too much time in at work. And then, she slowly begins changing. Changing her clothes, wearing makeup, and seemingly just taking care of herself. (I mean, her hair looks healthier and well-taken care of after she begins changing.)\n\nSo, to me, it's obvious that she likes, and actively enjoys her job. It may be high stress, and high pressure, but she quite obviously enjoys it.\n\nSo the first time I got the ick was when they somewhat blasted her for working at a fashion magazine. Like, so what? I'm pretty sure he works as a line-cook, and their hours and work is TERRIBLE. (I know, I was one.) So I don't really understand why he's letting their friends blast her for being at the bottom of the chain. (Yeah, I know, he gets a job as a sous chef at the end of the movie, so what?)\n\nThen, when Andy begins excelling at her job, she brings them expensive gifts that Miranda discarded. (A $1100 telephone, products (I'm assuming expensive shampoos, or conditioners), and most importantly, a designer bag that she offers to her friend, Lily. (Isn't it funny how Anne Hathaway keeps playing characters with shitty friends named Lily? xD) Lily then informs Andy that she 'couldn't possibly' take the bag, WHILE SHOVELLING HER SHIT INTO THE BAG. Then, directly after that, Miranda begins calling her... and like the WONDERFUL friends they are, they proceed to play Monkey In the Middle with her phone. RIGHT AFTER SHE GAVE THEM EXPENSIVE GIFTS. (Honestly, Andy should've sold the gifts to pay rent, or put into savings, because considering Andy's father wrote her a check to do so, I doubt Nate is bringing in the big bucks.)\n\nThen, Andy is tasked with accompanying Miranda and Emily to a party. And ends up missing Nate's birthday party because of this. I get it, I understand being upset, but he proceeds to act like a child who's father didn't come back with the milk. He sulks the whole night, undoubtably expecting Andy to try to apologize to him/make it up to him. And then proceeds to seem angrier when she doesn't. SHE DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING BUT HER JOB. (Throughout this scene, my fianc\u00e9 kept rolling his eyes at Nate. xD) \n\nFinally, I understand why Lily got upset when she saw Christian kiss Andy's cheek, but come on. A simple conversation would've cleared up any misunderstandings. She acts as if she's upset that Andy was with another guy, and said guy kissed her, but when Nate does come around, she doesn't even tell him about it! So it's clear she didn't give a hoot about him, so why was she so upset? (Oh, because she's jealous).\n\nI don't even want to explain how HORRIBLE I think the ending is. (I already know about the book ending, it's even worse.) But Andy ends up quitting, and I could understand that IF she didn't apologize to her awful boyfriend. (I mean, I didn't really like Christian that much, but at least he seemed supportive of her job, y'know... until he was trying to replace Miranda.) I mean, Nate was an awful, annoying, needy, and unsupportive boyfriend throughout the entire movie. That is MONTHS of it. (My fianc\u00e9 was in total shock and this, and was legitimately angry at the ending. Which, I did find hilarious.) \n\nI just personally believe Andy should've kept working for Miranda, I'm pretty sure she worked only a few months, and was excelling even more than Emily did. (I genuinely felt bad for Emily in this movie though, especially when she got hit by the car.)\n\nOverall, I think Andy is just lucky Miranda was so fond of her. Because she was, and I don't know why everyone glosses over that fact. I mean, Miranda had every right to give Andy a bad review. (She works hard, is adaptive, but quit suddenly during a work event. She's unreliable.) Despite this, she doesn't, and in turn helps Andy get her dream job. (Or, at least the start of her dream job.)",
