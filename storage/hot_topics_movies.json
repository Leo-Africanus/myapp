Granted I know the population will never get this bad but it felt more real to me. \n\nAnd the final twist which I\u2019m sure everyone knows by now, most humans are processed to be converted into food for the rest also feels real. I\u2019ve recently learned much of the food we eat is grown in sewage! A shocking truth but hey what else can we do? We need food! And the rich practically get away with everything!

        "title": "I have a soft spot for \"Die Hard 2\" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three \"Die Hard\" entries.",
        "content": "There's no way, of course, that \"2\" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by \"Vengeance\" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.\n\nBut I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.\n\nI'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest \"Die Hard\" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan\u2019s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. \n\nMemento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. \n\nIn The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier\u2019s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.\n\nAt the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent\u2019s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel\u2019s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who\u2019s already grieving from her death.\n\nA large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.\n\nInterstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.\n\nNolan\u2019s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people\u2019s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.\n\nThere was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan\u2019s movies but I can\u2019t remember it now.

It's a very brutal and sad movie, and I recommend going in blind without seeing any of the trailers (it's a much better experience, in my opinion). The voice actors also did a great job.",

        "content": "Hey all, I love going to watch movies in the theatre as I truly believe it can make a huge difference for many films compared with watching at home. Unfortunately I don't always have friends or family that want to join but I've always felt too socially uncomfortable to go by myself as I feel people will judge me.\n\nI just recently decided I should give it a try and man am I happy I did. Some movies are great to watch with friends, but sometimes it's awesome to be able to fully focus and engage with a film without being distracted by others, especially at the theatre. Most recently I went to catch the re-release of Interstellar in 70mm on my own and it was genuinely one of the best movie theatre experiences I've ever had. \n\nLong story short, if you've ever held back on going to a see a film alone, do yourself a favor and go to the movies on your own you won't regret it. Nobody is judging you!",

Plus Rachel macadams had done The Vow and Time travelers wife before it. So I initially judged it harshly.\n\nI fell in love with this movie around 2018 when I finally got around to it and it\u2019s become one of my top movies to watch.\n\nI\u2019ve realized why I love it so much and find it so comforting. The father and son relationship reminds me so much of my husband and his dad. They have a wonderful relationship of friendship, respect, playfulness and love. Whenever my husband is out of town and I\u2019m missing him, I watch this movie and I\u2019ve only just realized it\u2019s because it reminds me of him in a way. \n\nWe have 2 daughters and while he won\u2019t have the son and father relationship, I know he will have the same silly and playful relationship with them rooted in love.\n\n\nSorry that was a lot! lol \n\n\nWhat movie reminds you of family?",

All of the videos are available online except one of Gondry's: Ossamuch!.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of somewhere online I could find this video, I've looked for what seems like years and had had no luck.

        "content": "I just watched this Netflix Christmas movie for the first time and it's left me with some questions. \n\nOne, the tiny nation of Aldovia has so many orphaned children they can fill an enormous and stately orphanage. What happened a generation ago to kill all these children's parents? The statue of the late king shows him in military uniform - was he a war hero? When was the war in Aldovia?\n\nThe second bit of world building was in the climax of the movie where &gt;!the King's secret note in the acorn Christmas ornament changed the law to allow non-blood relations to still be in the royal line of succession!&lt;. Aldovia has a Prime Minister, which suggests it is a constitutional monarchy, but this plot makes it seem like the king is the head of both the executive AND legislative branches of government. The head of this nation had extraordinary, unchecked power - perhaps the result of the hinted-at civil war?\n\nThe last question is about the posh accents of the entire royal family. All of the official royal decrees and ceremonies are held in English. There's no sign of a native Aldovian language. Is Aldovia a colony of the British Empire? What happened to the Native Aldovians and their language? Could this perhaps be the seed of the conflict that led to the former king becoming a war hero, and the leagues of orphans in the care of the state?\n\nI am yet to watch the second and third movies, hopefully they expand on the world building in A Christmas Prince, if not I'd love to hear peoples thoughts about the history of the Aldovan nation state.",

        "content": "Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss.\n\nThe film is not a classic, it is a more naive and fun adventure. It's as if Robinson Crusoe got lost with his family on an island.\n\nThe book The Swiss Family Robinson (Der Schweizerische Robinson) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss which was inspired by the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and inspired the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams\n\nThe basic story is a husband and wife want to get away from the rat race and are traveling by ship from their home in Switzerland to New Guinea to start a new life. But before they arrive they are caught in a bad storm and are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The captain and crew must have seen it coming and deserted early, leaving the family, with three sons, to fend for themselves.\n\nThey do the best they can to salvage useful items and supplies from the wrecked ship and set about building their new home. It ends up being a quite elaborate 3-cottage cluster in a very large tree with nicely spread limbs.\n\nThe family finds a number of animals, a Tiger, a small elephant, and several others that lead them to think it might be a land bridge, so they build a small boat and set sail to try to go around the island. Another shipwreck and an encounter with a band of pirates results in their rescuing a teenage girl as her grandpa is captured.\n\nIn the end the pirates return, the Family Robinson work hard with improvised defenses to hold off the pirates and, when it seems the pirates will prevail a ship arrives and starts shooting at the pirates and their ship to save the day.\n\nWhen it was all over the parents decided they wanted to stay in this \"New Switzerland\" with the prospects of additional settlers.",
