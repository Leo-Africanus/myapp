        "content": "There\u2019s no feeling more crushing than when you watch a movie for the first time, love it from start to finish and look up reviews to see that you\u2019re one of a few who \u201cgets it.\u201d\n\nBad publicity, bad acting, careless stories or messaging, a bad story from production and BTS or maybe everyone just had a poor night when they watched it; you can\u2019t help but love it with flaws and all.\n\nI recently watched Stephen King\u2019s \u201cLawnmower Man\u201d and, despite going into it with the idea of watching a bad movie\u2026 I liked it. I thought it was a great movie that didn\u2019t deserve the hatred I\u2019ve seen it get for years.\n\nI loved the acting, I thought the story was interesting and left me thinking about the nature of the brain and what we are as humans, the CGI was awful and it was dated even back when it was first released but it has an uncomfortable grit to how thinks look in the VR world, etc. I finished the movie with a smile on my face and a disappointment that I\u2019m one of a few who seems to unironically enjoy it. \n\nIt absolutely has its shortcomings. The plot is ridiculous, it can be pretentious at time, it was named after and partially adapted by a story written by Stephen King and yet it also had almost nothing to do  with the original pitch, and the CGI DOES look like shit for sure; but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m willing to look past its issues because they don\u2019t mean that much to me.\n\nThis thread isn\u2019t about \u201cLawnmower Man\u201d though, it\u2019s about you and your criteria.\n\nWhat are some movies you think get more hate than they deserve? Are you a real man\u2019s man that enjoys the subtle complexities of \u201cThe Room\u201d, or maybe you\u2019re someone who just enjoys slop and doesn\u2019t care what other people think about your interest in \u201cSlow Torture Puke Chamber?\u201d I wanna know what cinematic cinema hot takes you\u2019ve got.",

        "content": "Firstly, it is by far my favorite movie ever. The entire series. All three. I love every moment and every scene, and can pretty much recite every movie line by line.\n\nJust watching the movies, literally every single line is pretty much connected to the bigger story, and looking away/not paying attention for a split second can cause you to miss an Easter egg, a foreshadowing line, or important information. I love how engaging it keeps the watcher. The way that the series finish complete full circle, and ends on such a good note to \u201cclose\u201d time is amazing. Regardless of the obvious paradoxes that are in the movie, I think that every little thing is important to pay attention to. Even the little things. The recycled lines, the same locations, and same characters, all just fall into place.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any other movie that I have seen or can think of that does it like these movies do.\n\nEdit: just wanted to give a fun example of a little detail- in the beginning of the first movie, Marty met doc at *Twin* pines mall, and when he goes back to 1955 on Mr. Peabody\u2019s pine farm, he drives away and hits one of the pine trees. When Marty returns to 1985, the mall is then called *Lone* pine mall. Some people might have caught that, some others may have not.",

Studios uploaded the entire MoMA 4K restoration of Night of the Living Dead by George A. Romero a few days ago. \n\nSo if you\u2019re a lifelong fan of this film or a newbie who\u2019s never seen it. Now\u2019s your chance to see it again or for the first time.\n\nEveryone have a Happy and Safe Halloween out there. \n",
