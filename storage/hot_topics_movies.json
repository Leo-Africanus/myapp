We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.\n\nSynopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father\u2019s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.\n\nTrailer:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M)\n\nWatch on MUBI:\u00a0[https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024)\n\nAsk us anything!

So many cool ideas for a film in this genre like the viewing room where we see a man get cooked alive by the sun. The space craft they're in has one of the coolest designs I've ever seen in a space/scifi film. Personally, I fully believe that the film stuck the landing as well. However the shaky cam at the end is nauseating and there's a certain bit towards the end that I rolled my eyes at. But other than that I really don't have very many other complaints this shit rocks. \n\nIf you haven't seen Sunshine and you're a fan of scifi I highly highly recommend it. This is one of the greatest films to get high to as well if you partake. I was in awe during multiple scenes on my first watch after smoking a bowl. Don't go in expecting a super realistic and grounded space film. Just go in expecting a fun ass movie and you won't be dissapointed. ",

All this in a movie with just a $25 million budget.

        "content": "Wow wow wow wow. \n\nI had no idea that one, much less both of the movies were going to go in fascinating directions with time (literally lol) like they did. \n\nArrival is, of course, much more theoretical. I suppose it dabbled more in memory, than time, per se. The idea of being able to perceive language as a non-linear medium is absolutely fascinating to me. \n\nAnd Memento. Wow. That\u2019s probably my favorite Nolan movie I\u2019ve seen up to this point. I figured out pretty early on that the black-and-white colored scenes were moving forward linearly, and the fully colored scenes, backward. So, I guessed they would intersect at some point. But, I could never have guessed they would have met in the way they did. \n\nThe way the two different timelines were inter-spliced was absolutely brilliant on a first viewing. But that being said, I don\u2019t think it lends itself to an even better second viewing in the way other Nolan films do. My best explanation for that is: because the story is being told backwards, the lead up to the \u201cending\u201d is REALLY the lead up to the beginning. Whether you agree or disagree with that, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.",
