Her Oscar win was the \"ah ha\" moment for me. I mean... her acting and transformation was SHOCKING and incredibly enjoyable to watch on screen.\n\nAnyone else experience this with other actors/actresses?\n\nEdit: Just thought of another performance that gagged me. Javier Bardem in \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d was extraordinary.",

        "content": "This is such a solid movie about girlhood and its influence on messy, complicated adulthood. I first saw this movie when I was the age of the younger cast (the \"Then\" group), and now I'm closer in age to the \"Now\" cast. Everything resonated about their reunion in their thirties -- from the awkward conversations, the guilt of not being around each other often, and then the hospital scene with the baby delivery. The back-and-forth narrative really holds up in showing how the girls' last summer before they drifted apart really planted seeds for their complicated adult lives: \n\n* Chrissy (Ashleigh Ashton Moore, Rita Wilson), the most cautious and naive of the friends but also curious about 'the birds and the bees,' is the one who doesn't leave the neighborhood and marries her high school sweetheart. She's also the first of the friends to have a baby;\n* Teeny (Thora Birch, Melanie Griffith) is obsessed with movies and her body image; she later becomes a celebrated actress who experiments with breast augmentation; \n* Samantha (Gaby Hoffmann, Demi Moore) goes through it - her parents divorce, she almost drowns, her interest in the occult gets sidelined during their last seance scene. She finds refuge in science fiction writing, but struggles with being vulnerable; \n* Roberta (Christina Ricci, Rosie O'Donnell) is still grieving her mother's death; as an ob-gyn, older Roberta helps shepherd her best friend (Chrissy) safely into motherhood. Both Ricci and O'Donnell said the character was initially written as a lesbian, but some of the context was written out last minute due to test audience feedback--  however, it would have been compelling to keep the queer context in for the character, considering her 1970s arc (taping her chest, pretending to drown to see if her friends would perform CPR, disinterest in Devon Sawa for most of the movie, etc). \n\nI know Christina Ricci is now in Yellowjackets (which is also about a 90s group of girls in a back-and-forth timeline, but add cannibalism) but I could seriously see \"Now and Then\" being the premise for a limited series -- think \"This is Us\" crossed with \"Big Little Lies.\" ",

In fact, this is something I'm seeing more frequently nowadays; I'll hear about a movie that just came out in theaters that I didn't even know was coming out.\n\nIt was way different back in the '90s when I was a kid. I pretty much knew EVERY movie that was coming out and when it was coming out because I would see tons of ads on TV and in the paper in the months leading up to its release. This was especially true for Disney; when \"The Lion King\" came out in 1994, you literally couldn't go ANYWHERE without seeing it advertised. If you turned on the radio, there was Elton John singing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\" If you went to Toys 'R' Us, there would be Lion King toys EVERYWHERE. If you wanted to get a chocolate bar, there you'd find a special Lion King Nestle bar (I can still taste them).\n\nFast forward to 2025 and I find out there's a new Disney movie through an Alex Meyers video. Literally no advertisement or buzz leading up to its release.\n\nSo what's going on here? Did the streaming age and/or COVID change the way studios advertise upcoming movies? Or do algorithms only show us ads for movies they think we want to see?",

Fell in love with my wife during a late night game of 6 degrees where we would both name a random actor/ress and the fastest to connect movies between the two the winner. Told my wife I loved her on Oscar night 2004. Trailed off watching films as the young kids came. Owned thousands of DVDs and bluerays, had to sell nearly all of them over the years during lean times. Some of them still hurt, others were easy to let go of. Stoped being a douche, or at least that flavor of douche. Got into fantasy books instead of films and haven't seen much recently - not to say nothing. Still a bit of a film snob.

        "title": "Did John Ottoman win the Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody because he salvaged the troubled Production?",
        "content": "In 2019 Bohemian Rhapsody's John Ottman won the Academy Award for best editing, while the Film is [known for its editing breaking even basic rules and being very confusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dn8Fd0TYek).\n\nNow this has been confusing me for a long time and strengthend my belief that the oscars are mostly arbitrary, but I have recently stumbled upon the following Video. Here the Bullets &amp; Blockbusters alleges, that [John Ottoman was rewarded for salvaging a troubled production](https://youtu.be/eNtviFf3y0w?si=uyqWnBXxqmmjQ5u-&amp;t=518) and not for flawless editing.\n\nIs there any merit to this claim? I struggled to find any other source alleging this.",

It doesn\u2019t have to make sense, and it can even be kind of dumb\u2014but when you first saw it, you were genuinely shocked.\n\nFor me, that would be Saw. Thinking back, the twist is a little silly and far-fetched, but when I first saw it, my jaw was on the floor for a solid five minutes.",

But damn, dude, I do not remember it being this intense. 45m30s is basically the transition from boot camp to vietnam and I\u2019m over here (having watched the movie a few times over the years) actually gasping before the transition lmao! I love movies and there are a few I rewatch fairly frequently, but goddamn this one holds up so well!!",
