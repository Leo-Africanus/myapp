        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to find a film I watched about 10+ years ago, so I think it was made in early 2000s or late '90s. It's a psychological thriller(?), not mainstream, probably European\u2014maybe Scandinavian or from Northern Slavic countries.\n\nHere are the details I remember:\n\n- entire film has a bluish/blue tint/filter or I remember it like that because I was little \n\n- main characters are a blonde girl and a guy who's bald I think\n\n- the guy has large scars on his back that look like whip marks, which he got from childhood abuse\n\n- he kidnaps (and possibly rapes) the girl\n\n- I remember them running away through a forest and a river at some point\n\nThe ending scene is very memorable: the guy is holding the girl's necklace as a keepsake, and he is in a brutalist concrete building (lots of raw concrete, very stark). He kills the girl at the end. Edit: she finds a necklace box that contains jewellery from other murdered girls, so he kills her because she found it (?).\n\nThe atmosphere is tense and dark, more of a psychological thriller.\n\nThe film was shown on TV in late evening or night hours.\n\nEdit: main characters were both in late teenage years or early to mid twenties, the guy is a serial killer (and a serial rapist), I remember it like that\n\nIf anyone recognizes this film or can help identify it, I would be very grateful!\n\nThanks a lot!",

        "title": "Strange Cinema Experiences",
        "content": "I went to see Superman last night at my local cinema. It's small, only 2 screens, and there normally aren't that many people there since it's in a rural area of England. I had hoped since it was a few weeks into Superman's run it would be pretty empty. I was wrong, it was maybe three quarters full. Oh well, no big deal.\n\nI sit down, and a little bit later an old man wearing a suit sits next to me, his wife and presumably their daughter beside him. When sitting down, he knocked my drink on the floor. Oh well, it was bottled, just didn't have much fizz in it anymore, and of course he apologised. Shit happens.\n\nThen they pull out the loaf of bread. It was half full, and they have some cheese slices and just start making some sandwiches. Never seen anyone do this before, very very odd behaviour, but ultimately harmless. Just so strange. This was all during the trailers, so no bother. I regret watching the screen instead of the group beside me honestly, because there was a lot of rustling and I wonder what other ingredients they brought for their sandwiches. I suppose I'll never know now.\n\nSo now we're about 20 minutes in, and this old man - who I estimate was probably in his 70s - is starting to breathe quite heavily. I think he's a little warm, and given that he's wearing a suit with what looks like a thick jacket on quite a muggy evening, that makes sense. Instead of taking it off though, he pulls out an electric fan with a distracting bright blue light that is now noisily whirring right next to me and blowing air in my face. Were I to embelish the story, this is where I'd say he also smelled, and that stench was blowing right up my nostrils. Thankfully, that was not the case at all. I was laughing to myself because, in a way, I got a free 4D experience, the wind blowing through my hair as Superman flew about. He did eventually decide to take the jacket off, which I think was a much wiser decision. The fan went away, though it did make more minor appearances sporadically throughout.\n\nAbout an hour in, a very loud phone alarm goes off near me. I nearabouts shit myself, I could've sworn I turned my phone off! Of course, I did. It was the old man's. Wow, what an embarrassing mistake, I think to myself! But oh no, this was no mistake. This was the reminder to take his medication, mid way through a film, in a packed cinema, which he does. But of course you wouldn't want to take that on an empty stomach, so it's time to make a few more sandwiches.\n\nTo my mind, there was nothing overtly annoying about this experience. I overall enjoyed the film and was laughing at the strange antics of the man next to me. But it was certainly very, very bizarre. Anyone else got any strange cinema experiences to share?",

And K says: \u201cA person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals, and you know it.\u201d And holy crap, do I think about that a lot, because it\u2019s so true. A movie about giant cockroaches and talking pugs has no business being that profound.\n\nWhat are some quotes from comedies or mindless action thrillers or just plain bombs that have stuck with you for whatever reason?",
