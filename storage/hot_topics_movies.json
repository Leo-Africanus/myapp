Some mob members killed a relative of a politician by mistake, and a few days later were killed by the mob in turn as punishment - at the time I thought, man, I don't even think they have a name for the emotion these guys were feeling when they realized how badly they fucked up.\n\n  \nSo then I thought, are there any good movies or scenes that capture really well that feeling of \"I fucked up, I'm going to die, and there's nothing I can do about it?\" It doesn't count if the person thinks there's a chance to fight it, it's gotta be realizing they are powerless to stop it.\n\n  \nThat famous scene in the Goodfellas is more or less that, but it was for a split second. The Death of Stalin has a big one towards the end too, but the character was kicking and screaming the entire time.",

I would expect the camera crew to be more jerky and suddenly stop if they are expecting to pan from him walking from the store directly to the car? Is it something they edited in post to make smoother, or they're just really good at smoothly following any unexpected action?",

        "title": "Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968)",
        "content": "Based on the best selling novel by Ira Levin and directed by Roman Polanski, Rosemary\u2019s Baby is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move to a New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and odd neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon). When Rosemary becomes pregnant she becomes increasingly isolated, and the diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth. Just finished watching this on TCM and it\u2019s a classic. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are really good in their roles. The film moves at a slow pace but it doesn\u2019t get boring and actually keeps you invested in what\u2019s going on. Great movie it is if you all haven\u2019t seen it.",

        "content": "I was recently walking along Hollywood Blvd. on my way to 1717 Vine Street around the corner for a Hollywood Writers Group meetup, when I saw the Frolic Room. It\u2019s still there, having survived the pandemic, when many of the enterprises on the boulevard in that area were boarded up, and were never to be re-opened again. When I peered in, The Frolic, where I used to hang when I first came to town, looked just as dark and divey as ever\u2014just perfect. For some reason, I nodded and the seated doorman, who I\u2019d never met, smiled and nodded back as if he sensed I had been a customer. \n\nThe Frolic has been used as a location for numerous movies, including A Woman Under the Influence (1974), From Hollywood to Deadwood (1988), LA Confidential (1997), and The Little Things (2021), among many others. Another one was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ode to 60s Hollywood, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It only appears briefly in the movie, but star actor Rick Dalton DiCaprio) drunkenly crashes his car outside the location. Moreover, folklore has it that the Frolic was one of the last spots that murder victim Elizabeth Short (\u201cThe Black Dahlia\u201d herself) visited\u2014being a regular denizen of the night on the \u201cboulevard of broken dreams,\u201d it\u2019s more than likely she partied at the Frolic. Personally, I\u2019ve shared a drink or two there with other \u201cprofessional\u201d drinking regulars like Harry Dean Stanton (RIP). Apparently, writer Charles Bukowski was also a regular there. Of course, he was. \n\nCheck out a little background on The Frolic Room, the oldest dive in Hollywood: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9jmCNiTDjQ\n",
