        "content": "*When all but one child from the same classroom mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weapons/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/weapons/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Inverse](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2998) \\- [Lyvie Scott](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/lyvie-scott)\n\n&gt;Cregger\u2019s goofy sense of humor aside, *Weapons* is otherwise pretty understated, even refined. His camera moves with glacial, dream-like focus, tracking characters from behind or panning to unveil the latest torment around the corner. That visual style has become a trademark of \u201celevated\u201d horror, but it goes a long way in anchoring a story that could have turned unwieldy fast. Cregger\u2019s chapter-by-chapter story serves that same purpose: It has the capacity to frustrate when it cuts away from a major reveal, only to reset with the backstory of a new character. But it also adjusts the aperture whenever things get too heavy \u2014 a breath of fresh air in a different form.\n\n[CGMagazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3897) \\- [Shakyl Lambert](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/shakyl-lambert) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;*Weapons* is a noticeable step up for Cregger as a filmmaker. It feels like he took what worked in *Barbarian* and tightened up the things that didn\u2019t. It\u2019s bigger in scope but more focused. With a strong story and cast, it\u2019s the most fun you\u2019ll have being scared all summer.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/weapons/)\n\n&gt;There are some who will be moved and struck by \u201cWeapons,\u201d intentionally or unintentionally, so. For 75% of its runtime, it was one of my favorite films of the year. However, for the final 25%, in some ways, it feels like Cregger missed an opportunity to tell a story that is more emotionally rich and relatable. Here is a filmmaker who feels like he\u2019s trying to prove he\u2019s capable of more, but without fully grounding that ambition in character or clarity, instead opting for a facile solution. There\u2019s a version of this movie that could have been genuinely great. You can appreciate the potential in the performances, the themes, and the overall craftsmanship. And to be clear, I\u2019m sure this will resonate and work for some viewers. But for me, much like \u201cBarbarian,\u201d Cregger doesn\u2019t quite bring it all together, making \u201cWeapons\u201d a rare kind of disappointment.",
