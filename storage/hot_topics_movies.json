Some people were on their way out, they were on their way in. And I thought, \"who was on their way out?\"\n\nIt makes sense, when one era starts it means another is over, but it would be interesting to think some actors or directors careers ended because they couldn't adapt to the \"New Hollywood\", especially since that era is considered a Golden era of films but to some it was the end. \n\nAt first I thought Audrey Hepburn would be the obvious candidate, she was huge in the 60s but then disappeared almost in the 70s. However, looking at her wiki page, it seems she voluntarily left Hollywood to be with her family, not because she couldn't get work. \n\nJust a random thought.",

        "content": "The Fall Guy is available right now on Netflix, at least here in Sweden, so I watched it yesterday with my SO. We were not looking for it specifically, it was just shown on the home page, and we thought, why not? Our two small kids are asleep, it had been a long day, we were tired, it was late, so an easy-to-follow, action movie seemed like a good idea. When it finished we just looked at each other and we both said the exact same thing: 'it was much better than I had expected'.\n\nI had heard about the movie before, but it just looked like the typical action/comedy movie with two very well known faces to pull people into the cinema, so it didn't catch my attention. And in a way it was indeed an action-filled film with plenty of very funny moments, so even if it were just that it would had already fulfilled its duty. But it's also a love letter to stuntmen and women and their craft and skill, showing a lot of their work in front and behind the cameras in a realistic way (or at least that's what I thought as someone that has nothing to do with the cinema business). The choreographies are superbly done, for example the one at the club, when Ryan Gosling's character is under the influence. It also has some very neat scenes that would be worth of mention even in a more \"serious\" movie (I'm talking specifically about the split-screen specular shot of the phone-call; if you have seen the movie I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).\n\nSo why don't I hear about it more often than I do? I think that it deserves more mentions than it gets.",

        "content": "Lately, I\u2019ve noticed filmmakers love to use that \u201cears ringing\u201d effect to show disorientation or \nshock. I get that it\u2019s effective for most viewers, but as someone who already has tinnitus, it\u2019s \nphysically uncomfortable.Even if the sound lasts just a second, it\u2019s enough for me to want to mute the TV or leave the \ntheater. Sometimes it even makes my tinnitus flare for a day or so afterward. \nDoes anyone else experience this? I\u2019ve tried coping by avoiding super loud scenes and \nchecking my ears for issues with a Bebird Ultra X, just to rule out anything physical making it \nworse, but the ringing effect itself still hits hard. \nI don\u2019t know who would actually read a petition to stop using this effect, but I\u2019d sign one in a \nheartbeat.",

        "content": "For me, I love the visuals, the score, the way John Boorman handled the story. It's dark and disturbing like fantasy Horror and I appreciate that eerie, mythgological tone about the legend. \n\nBut it's also episodic and not a lot is thoroughly developed like the reintroduction of Morgana into Arthur's life. She just shows up halfway into the movie without any explanation as to how she and Arthur reconnected. And it takes pretty long for Helen Mirren to show up. Thankfully, Mirren is spectacular, a incestuous manipulative monster whose drive for power and beauty becomes her undoing. Her reparte with Nicol Williamson's Merlin (who's superb as the wizard) worked because both actors hated each other in real life.  I still wish the film hadn't made Morgana so underdeveloped. She comes into the movie too late. And a few of the casting choices were not that good: Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi as Lancelot and Guinevere.",

        "content": "I've been searching everywhere and cannot find who translated the movie into Danish for the life of me. I tried looking at the end of the credits on Disney+ but it doesn't list the Danish translators (despite there being a Danish dubbing option, which is rather poor work on the credits) and I cannot for the life of me find it online.\n\nI got curious about this because I'm both trilingual (English, French, Danish) and a singer and wanted to learn Once Upon A December in a new language (since I already know the English one like the back of my hand), and a problem I run into regularly when learning songs I already know in English in other languages is that the lyrics do not respect the original vowels AT ALL which can cause technical difficulties in a song, especially one like Once Upon A December, but the Danish translation of the song is SO well written; the vowels match almost exactly (especially where it matters most), the words themselves are so poetic and ethereal which fits the scene SO well, and I'd like to know who did such a lovely job.\n\nThe second paragraph was because of the 300-word minimum, and I frankly didn't have any other ideas for what to type; it's not important to my question, just filling out the word minimum.",

It doesn't matter how the character is portrayed, how the world treats them, how the character ends up etc. If they have the role of the protagonist then people will rant online about \"the glorification of the X and Y things this character does\". It's concerning when people cannot comprehend a character's downfall when this character is an important figure in the movie instead of a person deemed as the bad guy from the start. ",

        "title": "Best movie fights with a \"Sacrificial Lion\" turning a two-on-one into a one-on-one",
        "content": "For those who don't know, the \"sacrificial lion\" is a trope wherein a good/powerful character is killed to prove to the audience that the villain is a threat or the situation is genuinely dire. I wanted to get more specific though and find the best examples of this trope happening all within one fight - specifically, where the heroes were already struggling together against the villain, placing more emphasis on how screwed the remaining hero is. Two examples (spoilers for Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Mission Impossible: Fallout):\n\n1. [Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo__6MZIg6U) \\- Bolstered by John William's insane soundtrack and some of the best choreography in the series, this might be the best fight in Star Wars. Specifically though, I like how the tone of the fight completely shifts when Qui-Gon dies - Obi-Wan is alone but pissed off, and the audience both fears for him (if the master couldn't do it, what chance does the student have) and roots for him to get revenge.\n2. [Fake John Lark vs. Ethan Hunt and Real John Lark](https://youtu.be/z83IyEgxPrk?si=mlnVYzgvVTRWU8AW&amp;t=210) \\- This whole fight is awesome, but the best moment (besides Henry Cavill reloading his fists) happens near the end, when Fake John Lark grabs Real John Lark by the hair, takes a moment to stare down Ethan Hunt, then knocks him out and readjusts his suit jacket. Ethan has always been shown to be a skilled combatant, so the fact that he couldn't even beat this guy *with* help is pretty intimidating. I love that this random henchman gives our main hero such a challenge, as well as Tom Cruise's \"I really don't want to be doing this\" look right before he charges him. \n\n \n\nWhat's the best example of this trope that you can think of?
