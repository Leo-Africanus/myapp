Guy's a complete scumbag ffs. Not to mention keeping all the world changing tech secrets to himself lol \n\nAnd i swear this guy isnt just simply \"absent minded\"... Hes such a genius yet cant tell time properly and misses the first wedding, whilst not realizing hes been lecturing a life drawing class for a full 5 minutes, nor that he was at a rehearsal dinner for his own wedding just the night before, is utterly bonkers!! \n\nI mean theres ditzy and scatterbrained, and then theres just full blown dementia! \ud83e\udd26\n\nDear god this has spoiled my memories of this flick BIG TIME! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nDid I miss anything?

It either has to be a 10/10 movie or it\u2019s terrible. There\u2019s no acknowledging of good things in bad movies (which sometimes isn\u2019t easy to find so sometimes there is just nothing redeeming about it) or criticisms for good movies. It\u2019s always \u201cwell is it a fresh or rotten review?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rating?\u201d \u201cSum up your thoughts in a sentence\u201d, \u201cmovie good or movie bad\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m also sick of the \u201cwell you didn\u2019t agree with me on a movie therefore I can\u2019t listen to your opinions about anything\u201d. It\u2019s. Subjective. Someone not reacting the same way as you doesn\u2019t mean their opinion is invalid. \n\nOr the whole \u201cthey just hate fun\u201d argument. Or \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just enjoy it??! It\u2019s not that deep!\u201d I don\u2019t go into every movie thinking I\u2019m going to hate it. I do give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSure some opinions can be pretentious. Hell - I\u2019ve been in that boat where I question someone\u2019s tastes because they\u2019ll say something isn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d. And I did not handle those conversations well. But now I don\u2019t try to make them think they\u2019re wrong for an opinion. I try to ask what worked for them or what didn\u2019t. Sometimes they\u2019ll give me a boring answer like \u201cI was just entertained\u201d but sometimes they\u2019ll throw a point that I may not agree with but can understand. \n\nThere are people who are genuinely nuanced in their approach to talking about movies. But good grief it\u2019s not what it once was. I don\u2019t want to sound like that old guy by saying that given that I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s but it has gotten worse in the last decade. ",

To be in a place where everyone is reacting in unison - gasping and laughing, is just so special, and an experience that (to me) doesn't happen so often anymore.\n\nMy favourite experience was seeing Scott Pilgrim vs. The World the first day in a sold out theatre in Toronto (my hometown). Seeing Toronto be itself in a film (Not a US city) along with laughing at jokes that only Torontonians would get, is a special memory.\n\nWhat are some of those experiences for you?",

I gave it another shot a few months later and really liked it. Now, as I\u2019ve watched it dozens of times I have to say, it is an absolute masterpiece. The casting is spot on, the effects are fun and it is such a ride from beginning to end. It is now EASILY one of my favorite movies.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences with other movies? Something you just didn\u2019t get the first time around? This movie had such a hard swing for me, from thinking it was ridiculous and soft-baked to seeing how much time and effort was put into it in such a low key manner that the artistry was NOT seeing it. It legit hits all the boxes looking back. ",
