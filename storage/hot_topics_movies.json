They need to plant an idea in this guy's head so they go in a dream within a dream within a dream and Leo deals with some personal stuff along the way, its just a sci-fi heist movie, like Ocean's Eleven but a little trippy. I had always heard about this movies reputation for being overly complicated and if you look up an \"Inception references in media\" video on YouTube, every reference is poking fun at how complicated it is and how nobody gets it but like... it's actually not that hard to understand?\n\nFunnily enough, South Parks parody of it kind of proves my point because they make fun of how characters are constantly explaining stuff but to me that's what made it easy to get. The fact every time they did anything someone was explaining it made it really easy to follow.\n\nThe only part that's really even up in the air is the ending but I believe in happy endings and the evidence points to him being awake.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is, was this movies convulted-ness overblown or is everyone kind of stupid?",

The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.",

        "title": "Movie that takes place after a super villian succeeds?",
        "content": "I was wondering if there are any movies that are set after a super villain's plot to destroy the world has succeeded. I'm not talking about a sequel where the first movie ends with the villain winning. I'm looking for a movie where it starts in the after math of the villain's win and we learn about what happened and then maybe the protagonists try to fix the world or the villain's story can just be in the background of something entirely unrelated happening. Does this exist or did I just come up with a new movie idea??\n\nEdit:\n\nI appreciate everyone who's trying to keep others to my criteria but it's not that serious. It's fun seeing how everyone interprets my ask. But I do want to add some background and clarification. What initially got me curious about this is I was watching Kingsman: The Secret Service. In that Samuel Jackson's character sets a plan in motion to make everyone hyper violent and start killing each other but the Kingsman come in and thwart his plan. So it got me curious to see what the world would have looked like had they failed to stop him. I don't want any sequels at all. I'd like it to be a standalone film (other mediums are ok too), or the start of a series. I want a majority of the story to be set after the heroes fail. If Avengers: Endgame was a standalone movie, it'd be a perfect example. \n\nHowever, a good example I forgot about is an audio book called Third Eye by Felicia Day. It's essentially the story of if Harry Potter failed to beat Voldemort. In the prologue we get the showdown between the child wizard and the villain and the villain wins and takes over the world. Then it jumps forward like 20 years and we see what how the world looks under this dark lords rule.\n\nHope this clears things up!\n\nAlso, thanks for all the suggestions! There have been a lot of great ones so far!",

        "content": "(SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH)\n\nI am not going to talk about the premises because this is for people who have seen this film.\n\nSo I want to say that this film is a very solid film like an 8/10 but oh boy is it interesting.\n\nI want to state that I think basically every performance is ether pretty good or very good. Jason lee fits the character perfectly,joey Lauren Adams is also incredibly good but can get a little annoying on the ears(not her fault I am aware,that is just her voice but still), Kevin smith has this small but incredible scene and Ben Affleck...well. At first I was kinda mixed on him since I wanted him to be more pathetic but as it turns out. He is sooooo pathetic I just didn't realise it. His performance went from pretty alright to really great. I love genuine the car starts out but as it goes on he voice sounds...well it sounds like he is begging more,like he is trying to kinda manipulate her. It's one of the best scenes in the film( you know what the best is). So overall great performances\n\nSpeaking of Ben Affleck's character I fucking love that he doesn't make up with Amy. It made the 10x better but I am more mixed on the friendship with Jason Lee's character. In one hand Jason lee is kinda correct on how the relationship is changing their friendship with eachother. On the other he is kinda of huge ass but the film never out Wright tells you he hates Amy,here me out. In the the beging Amy and him have this conversation about eating pussy and their laughing their asses off. I think this scene shows how Jason Lee's doesn't hate Amy he is afraid what she will do benn Affleck's and his friendship it's so interesting but... I don't see these guys as friends AT ALL. I know thats kinda of the point but one scene or flashback of them being friends would be nice.\n\n\nThat's most of what I want to say tell me your thoughts!",

        "title": "\"Manchester by the Sea\" is the perfect depiction of how depression kills even when the outcome isn't suicide. A lot of times, there is no escape from mental illness or grief.",
        "content": "I just watched this movie for the first time and I'm both in awe and absolutely devastated.\n\nI've seen a lot of comments from people asking \"What was the point of the movie? There was no progress or character growth\"...yet that was exactly the point of the movie. A lot of movies these days depict depression or mental illness as something that a character wakes up one day and snaps out of it. Movies treat mental illness as something that eventually has a complete resolution and that \"character growth\" is depicted as the character resolving their mental illness. But a lot of times, the reality is there is no escaping mental illness and there is no resolution. You're stuck. You \"can't beat it\".\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder, which is a long-term form of depression with highs and lows, life feels like you have a dark cloud hanging over your head endlessly and permanently. Lee's sunken eyes and spirit and the feeling of a man just waiting to die resonated very deeply with me and which is why this movie affected me to the core. Lee was in a state of psychological paralysis.\n\nThe harsh reality is that depression requires immense effort on behalf of the person to treat. I was in therapy for around 3-4 years and progress was very slow before things got better. Yet even now I don't think I'm cured but depression and mental illness didn't win. Before therapy, life felt exactly like Lee's in the movie. Were it not for therapy and a support system of family and friends, I might have ended things a while back.\n\nIn Lee's case, and in a lot of cases for so many people, depression and mental illness do win. They win even if the person doesn't resort to suicide. Suicide isn't the only depiction of mental illness winning. Lee was a dead-man walking. When Randi tells him \"you can't just die\"...she didn't mean literally. She meant Lee's soul was dying. And Affleck's acting nailed the \"dying on the inside\" reality for so many people. No ambition, no goals, nothing to look forward to, and lack of ability to commit to anything that requires any sort of emotional or mental effort on his part.\n\nI also understand the janitor job. It's a job that doesn't require any degree of investment yet at the same time I think the janitor job gives Lee a sense of helping other people when he himself couldn't help his own children. I don't think picking the janitor job was random. I think the janitor job perhaps made Lee somehow feel better about himself subconsciously because it involves a certain degree of fixing different issues people have inside their homes which could contrast the helplessness he felt not being able to save his children from the fire inside their home. It also gave Lee a sense of organization or routine, which a lot of depressed people need to feel somewhat in control.\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to what many people say, Lee did show character growth and progress. Lee saying that he wants to get a house with an extra room for Patrick to visit is growth. Lee at first somewhat considering accepting guardianship and then seeking out better guardianship for Patrick shows growth and responsibility. Lee taking care of his brother's funeral processions, quitting his old job to be with Patrick, attempting to look for a new job in Manchester before deciding to move back to Boston are all signs of growth. But the reality is that growth with mental illness is very slow that is almost seems non-existent.\n\nNot to mention, the hope his nephew gave him for a better and more hopeful life mirrors my own experience with how my own nieces bring hope into my world despite everything and reminds me of lyrics by Sufjan Stevens: \u201cMy brother had a daughter, The beauty that she brings, illumination\u201d\u2026Nephews and nieces are a blessing to our world and what we carry from our siblings after they\u2019re gone.\n\nIn Lee's situation, continuing to exist is the most beautiful and commendable form of resistance. \n\nWhat a beautiful masterpiece. Easily one of my favourite moves of all time.",

        "title": "\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" is SO much better than \"When Nature Calls.\"",
        "content": "I just watched both movies back to back after not seeing them since I was a kid back in the 2000's. I remember really liking \"Pet Detective\" and feeling let down by \"When Nature Calls\" because it failed to improve upon or at least be as good as it's predecessor.\n\nThe Miami and detective mystery setting of PD lends itself better to Ace Ventura. In PD, Ace Ventura is annoying and strange to everyone around him, but he gets away with it because he is actually a good detective\u200b. Also, Ace isn't as much of a bad ass in WNC. He can catch a bullet with his teeth, but he can't dodge a sphere? His character just seemed inconsistent in the sequel.\n\nDoes anyone agree? Disagree? Let me know!\n\nEdit: I do agree that WNC has a lot of great lines and some great scenes. It did get a few cackles from me. I guess I just prefer PD overall.",

        "content": "I saw John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cThe Thing\u201d when I was maybe 7 years old. The scene with the dogs lived rent free in my head for my whole life as the definition of nightmare fuel. I was a grown man before I could muster the courage to watch it again. Love the movie now, but the way the images from that scene stayed with me as a kid\u2026nothing else like it. No idea why my parents let me watch that so young.",

        "content": "I watched many shorts and reels of some of the popular scenes of this movie, my expectations were that this would be a light hearted feel good movie, which was also the case for it &gt;!But the last 30 minutes were heart breaking, I didn't expected this movie to take such a sudden and tragic turn.!&lt;\n\nAnyways I loved the movie. Although it may have slow pace, but I really enjoyed the moments in that pace, if it had fast pace then I may not have liked the movie that much. Also many indian movies also seems like directly or indirectly inspired from this movie like Tare Zameen par(2007),  3-Idiots(2009), Tamasha(2015), Udaan(2010) and many more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01vt7ls3urag1.jpg?width=183&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a3ae0b9172d7cebb89df6319fa3e23df7c0390\n\n",

Before we begin, just a few clarifications from years past:\n\n* I do view myself as a \"typical moviegoer\" and don't see myself as a cinephile at all. I know I go a lot, but I go through the lens of just wanted to do something fun, I don't really care to judge a movie on its artistic merit.\n* My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours, which can be limiting - Also, in 2025 she started traveling more for work, and while I like to go to the movies alone, I also prefer to do other things while she's gone \\[typical hobby stuff that she doesn't enjoy partaking in\\]. So there are a lot of movies that we do miss that we did want to see. We caught a few of those at home, but they're not included in this list.\n* There are a lot of movies we'd like to see but don't get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we're very busy and don't get to the theater for a few weeks.\n* This list does include movies from 2024 that I either saw at the beginning of 2025, or we saw in 2024 after releasing my list last year.\n* Everyone asks me every year, I do have a letterboxd, its \"egnards,\" but its one of those things that I update for 1-2 months at the beginning of the year and than just forget about it.\n\n**A Quick Note on Categories:**\n\nOther than \"Favorite of the Year\" I don't particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite. There are movies in the \"Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again\" category that I liked better than movies in the \"Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again\" category, but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings.\n\nPeople tend to get caught up in the categories in assuming that I'm ranking a particular movie over another particular movie - The reality is that there are many movies that I love, but dont feel a need to rewatch, and there are many movies that are mediocre that I find to have a lot of replay value.\n\nAlso, I specifically write all of the blurbs at the end of the year, with the purpose being that I want to focus on the resonant feeling a movie gave me, and less on rehashing the plot of a movie you've probably seen already.\n\n# Favorite of the Year [Ranked in Order]\n\n* **Eternity:** I thought I was going to go the whole year without having a really strong standout for a favorite movie, but I just really enjoyed this one so damn much. It feels a little long in the final act, but other than that it's a very cute story.\n* **Good Fortune:** I wanted to see this because the trailers reminded me of a Dogma vibe but I went in kind of expecting the best parts of the movie to be in the trailer. Overall I think it was very well done and threaded the line of \"serious message, but very funny delivery\" very nicely.\n* **F1 The Movie:** I mostly dislike sports, and I've never watched a race in my life, but in the last few years I've been a sucker for racing movies. F1 is very well done for a movie that I didn't even anticipate staying awake during.\n* **The Amateur:** I love a good spy thriller - Mission Impossible was one of my favorite movies for feel less like an action movie, and more like a CIA spy thriller. I stopped watching Mission Impossible movies as they got more and more grandiose. . .This felt a lot like the original Mission Impossible and it made me happy.\n\n# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again\n\n* **The Naked Gun:** I have always liked this style of parody humor. It's not something I'm going to watch often, but my wife and I have already rewatched it at least once after a few drinks and a gummy. I'd like to see a return of this style in short spurts every year.\n* **Novocaine:** Look, the movie is dumb. But it knows what it is, and it stays true to exactly what it is. It's just turn your brain off dumb comedy/action, and I am ok with that.\n* **Final Destination Bloodlines:** I gave up on Final Destination after the third one, and yes that log truck from the second one will always be a core memory, but this one has breathed enough new life into the franchise that if they make another I'd go see it.\n* **Death of a Unicorn:** It's not a perfect movie by any means, and it loses itself in its own absurdity at times, but it had a fun black comedy/horror feel that I liked.\n* **One of Them Days:** It's a stupid romp comedy that benefits from sneaking a few beers into the movie, but that's ok and I hope they make another one.\n* **Sinners:**  It's a very good movie, though feels long at parts. My one frustration of which is that these types of movies always come down to \"that one character did that one thing they were specifically warned that they absolutely under no circumstances should do.\"\n\n# Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected\n\n* **Lilo &amp; Stitch:** Often with live action remakes I feel that the best I can hope for is not hating it. I found Lilo and Stitch to be cute and enjoyed the journey. People get caught up in trying to relive a movie as a shot for shot remake, but in that case. . What even is the point?\n* **Freakier Friday:** The original is a classic. The Lindsay Lohan version is also a classic. I didn't expect much going into a \"20 years later\" sequel, as I've been burned so many times recently, but it was a fun romp that I'd probably watch again if I needed a turn off my brain movie.\n* **Jurassic World Rebirth:** I have kind of hated the last 3 Jurassic Park movies for taking us into more \"Action Movies that Dinosaurs exist within\" so didn't have high expectations. I wouldn't say it's a great movie, but it felt far more like Jurassic Park to me and I was pleasantly surprised.\n* **Karate Kid: Legends:** I went in with pretty low expectations. Everyone else I know that grew up on Karate Kid kind of disliked it, but I enjoyed it. I think it has a bunch of pacing issues with training montages and having be believe that this tournament was happening across multiple venues in a very short amount of time. But if you just lose yourself in the stupidity of 80s style stupidity it's fun.\n* **Thunderbolts\\*:**  I found the Black Widow movie to be forgettable so I had the lowest of hopes for Thunderbolts\\* but really enjoyed it for what it was.\n* **Mickey 17:**  My wife is the Robert Pattinson fan and I probably wouldn't have seen this otherwise, but I really liked it. Though it's one of those movies that does feel like it kind of gets lost in its own conclusion and could end 15-20 minutes early without losing much, if any, plot.\n* **Now You See Me: Now You Dont:** The franchise overall isn't for me, my wife always liked them. But overall I enjoyed this one, even if it's just a \"look at this magic trick I can do\" porn duel between characters at times.\n* **Roofman:** Didn't really know what to expect from the trailers but I thought it was a cute movie with a lot of heart.\n* **Superman:**  I haven't enjoyed many of the DC Comics movies that have come out and I'm honestly so beyond tired of Superman reboots, but the trailer being very \"camp\" heavy made me optimistic. It's not amazing by any means, but I feel this lighter comic book tone really works, and hope that DC remains consistent with this.\n\n# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again\n\n* **Presence:** I really enjoyed this because it felt new and different - Its the first time I've seen something from this perspective. It's not particularly scary, but I feel like it's one of those \"one and done\" journeys that doesn't need to be revisited.\n* **A Minecraft Movie:** Its a silly/stupid video game movie, and I think it was done well. One thing I noticed with Minecraft \\[and a lot of these kids movies in the last few years\\] is that it doesn't give scenes any time to breath. It's just one fast packed action sequence after each other and probably could have benefited from a slower narrative driven scene inserted in a few places - This is, I think, just the culture of kids movies these days.\n* **The Long Walk:** Not much to say here - I think for a movie that basically fully takes place while walking across the country that it's pretty damn well done, just don't feel any need to ever have a repeat viewing.\n* **The Housemaid:** The whole movie I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd read the book, and kind of new what was going to happen. Turns out there is *another* similar book \\[The Last Mrs. Parish\\] that I read with my wife during Covid which is essentially the same story. All that said, I think overall it was pretty well done.\n* **Paddington in Peru:** In my opinion it's the weakest of the 3 Paddington movies, with the other two being near perfect. It's still a perfectly good movie that had me tearing at the end.\n* **A Complete Unknown:** We saw a captioned showing with my in-laws, which seems to be how we go to all of the music biopics. I'm not much of music person myself, but I didn't find myself bored, even if it felt like I was just watching vignettes.\n* **Drop:** I am fully a sucker for thriller movies that take place in a very confined space.\n* **28 Years Later:** My wife had never seen the other 2, so I got to watch all 3 in pretty quick succession. Overall I enjoyed it, but I'm also a bit hesitant about the series going forward. I'll remain cautiously optimistic of The Bone Temple though I feel like the \"zombies are this new species now\" plot line is a line that can be very difficult to pull off long term.\n* **Weapons:**  It's fine, but I was really hoping for more of a grounded horror thriller and less of a supernatural \"weird creepy clown witch doctor\" lady kind of horror thriller. I knew it had to have some supernatural threads, but it went further than I wanted it to.\n* **Last Breath:** Like Drop, I just really like thriller movies that take place in very confined environments. I also *hate* water when it comes to video games, and will 100% walk away if a game features an extended water area with enemies. This movie was anxiety inducing the entire runtime, and I'm ok with it.\n* **The Smashing Machine:** The Smashing Machine gets very long at times and by the end I really was waiting for the conclusion, but overall, as someone who grew up in the early era of UFC, I think it was a story told in a really entertaining way \\[whether it was accurate or not\\].\n* **Caught Stealing:** It's a perfectly fine one viewing movie but for a very short movie it jumps around to different scenes so often that it felt like so much longer - Also, I'm just not buying that this \"average joe\" kind of guy would go through the amount of abuse he went through and \"just run away\" as often as he was able to.\n\n# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be\n\n* **How to Train Your Dragon:** My wife had never seen the original so we watched it a few days before going to see the live action version. It's not a bad movie, but it definitely falls into the \"shot for shot remake\" category and offers nothing new. . .Which makes it feel very long and not very engaging when you've watched it pretty recently.\n* **Eddington:** I really enjoyed the first half but the second half totally lost me. I felt the covid era small town story was interesting and made for a good movie. . As the scale kept increasing I gave less and less shits about what was going on.\n* **Nosferatu:** I know I'm going to get grilled for this one - My wife loved it and will probably have it ranked as one of her top movies seen - I found it to be long and full of itself. Honestly I think I could say that about most of the Robert Eggers movies I've seen.\n* **Mufasa:** I didn't hate the movie, but I really didn't enjoy the soundtrack at all. I work in 5th grade and one of the girls in my class said it best to be pretty recently. . .\"how did Lin Manuel Miranda come up with THAT?\"\n* **Friendship:**  You either like Tim Robinson, or you dont get Tim Robinson - I happen to like Tim Robinson, but I feel like a lot of Friendship sort of just gets lost in itself and forgets that it's not 12 little sketches stitched together, and is supposed to be a full movie.\n* **Wicked: For Good:** The problem with Wicked: For Good is the same problem that the Wicked Musical has, in that the second half of the play is significantly weaker than the first half of the play. That is to say that I think that this is far more enjoyable than post-intermission Wicked.\n* **Captain America: Brave New World:**  I don't even really know what I was expecting from the new Captain America. I have enjoyed the Marvel Movies overall less and less lately, but it's not a terrible one - I wish the trailers didn't basically give the entire movie away. . .But what can you do?\n* **I know What You Did Last Summer:** It's exactly what I expected it to be. That's it.\n* **Materialists:** Mostly forgettable. I just didn't feel like there was enough buy-in on the characters for me to give a shit about what was going on.\n* **The Strangers - Chapter 2:** It's fine. We skipped the first reimagining when it came out in theaters because we heard it was terrible, though did end up watching it at home right before going to see Chapter 2. I think it walks this line of \"am I losing the scare factor when you give too much context to these characters?\" and I'm not entirely sure if it crosses it yet.\n* **Wolf Man:** The trailers make it feel like a unique movie, but I just didn't feel like Wolf Man did very much to allow it to stand out, and told an interesting story in a not so interesting way.\n* **Fight or Flight:** Bullet Train 2: This Time on a Plane - There ya go, that's the movie.\n* **Heart Eyes:** I kind of like these holiday horror romps that have been happening in the last few years, but this one was a bit of a miss for me and too on the nose.\n\n# Expected More and Left Disappointed\n\n* **Zootopia 2:** I need to stipulate this by saying that the movie looks to be a really solid kids movie, and I think I'm being mildly unfair in my personal taste here. I loved the original, but I think the novelty of what Zootopia is has worn off for me, and that the newer movie didn't do enough to keep me engaged as an adult audience member - Even if I don't think they necessarily have to do that.\n* **The Monkey:** Being based on a short story I feel like The Monkey kind of just gets lost in itself and doesn't do enough to buy me into the fact that this monkey exists. It just gets more and more over the top without allowing me to feel like I have earned the suspension of disbelief that it's asking me to have.\n* **Babygirl:** I think that Babygirl could have been so much more than it was, and it sort of forgets to allow me to buy into any of the relationships in the movie. They kind of \"just happen\" for no other reason than to move the narrative along. I love me some Nicole Kidman but I found myself checking the time often hoping for it to be over.\n* **Black Phone 2:** Black Phone 2 isn't terrible but I think it's a significant downgrade from Black Phone and goes a little *too far* into trying to be the new age Nightmare on Elm Street.\n* **Honey Don't!:** It's fine. . .I guess? I just didn't think Aubrey Plaza worked very well as a villain. It became one of those \"i'm just going to guess that the bad guy is Aubrey Plaza, because it makes no sense, but they'll do it because nobody will ever see it coming.\"\n* **Fantastic Four: First Steps:**  I really enjoyed the hyper \"post-modern 1960s/70s\" esthetic of the trailers and had high hopes. And while I didn't hate watching it, I just don't think it did anything special for being the flagship property that so many Marvel fans have been waiting for for so many years \\[the return of FF to Marvel/Disney\\].\n\n# Didn't Expect Much, and Got What I Expected\n\n* **M3GAN 2.0:** I liked the original a lot, but the trailer for this one kind of showed me they were trying to transcend genres and they flew too close to the sun on being self aware. The line, \"hold onto your vaginas\" will live rent free in my head forever as I had to sit through that trailer about 20 times, and it's practically my only memory of the whole thing.\n* **Hell of a Summer:** The entire thing is forgettable and when looking through my ticket stubs on the AMC app I needed to google it to even remind myself of what it was even about.\n\n# Worst of the Year\n\n* **Die My Love**: I had never walked out of a movie before seeing Die My Love. About 45 minutes in my wife and I saw another couple get up and leave, we both looked at each other and kind of whispered, \"oh right, we don't have to stay,\" and left. Honestly the parts we did watch felt like the kind of college art student film that nobody likes but the filmmaker thinks is the most brilliant thing in the world.\n* **Five Nights at Freddy's 2:** I've never played the games but enjoyed the first one as a silly horror romp. I was warned before hand that this one was bad, but also assured that if I enjoyed the first I'd probably still like this one - To the Redditor that told me that? I hate you forever.\n\n**Note:**\u00a0At roughly $25/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5.50/ticket to see each movie. We often do get popcorn so the new Popcorn Pass is attractive, unfortunately I've committed to cutting down on my popcorn intake this year. . .Right in the nick of time obviously.\n\n**Note 2:** Normally I post this list at the end of December but AMC was bugging out on their app and not allowing me to see all my ticket stubs - I actually didn't even expect to do a list this year because of it, but thankfully they got their act together and fixed the issue!",
