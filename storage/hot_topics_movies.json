        "content": "Just watched Crazy, Stupid, Love last night... and can i say boy is it a breath of fresh air to see a romance movie that doesn't glorify cheating and sleeping around. \n\nI know, the entire premise of the movie is about infidelity and being a playboy, but rather then showing how cheating and sleeping around can lead to happiness, it shows the opposite. Showing the regret and consequences from both her infidelity and his womanizing is honestly very nice to see in a more modern movie, at least modern enough to be apart of the \"cheating and divorce is good\" culture as seen far to often.\n\nAnd the B plot of a playboy who seems to have it all together who sleeps around constantly cause it brings \"happiness\", only to see how once he truly falls in love he realizes and admits he's been lying to himself and everyone around him too... that was a good touch too. \n\n  \nOverall its just nice to see that divorce and sleeping around isnt the answer to happiness. 10/10 movie, would recommend ",

        "content": "I finally watched 'Mother/Android' today. It was a decent film with enough plot to make it enjoyable if you don't look at it too hard. But at the emd of the movie, one small detail just made me really appreciate the effort put into the film so much more.\n\nAs the truck is driving away, we can see a few street lights with christmas wreaths and garland hanging on them. This brought me back to the beginning of the film which clearly happened around the holidays. Some nine months later, when the end of the movie takes place about 9 months later, of course no one took the time to take down the holiday decorations in this post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nA completely inconsequential detail that could easily have been overlooked. Instead, it called back to the beginning of the movie and really added to the atmosphere of the film as a whole. A small detail that just shone brightly and made a huge impact on my perception of the film as a whole.\n\nAre there any other examples like this that spring to mind?",

It snapped me out of my boring, emotionless state I've been in for ages.\n\nI can't remember ever feeling such strong emotions after a movie. \n\nIt made me realize I need to stop waiting around, expecting life to come to me, like I've been doing for the past few years. \n\nI have to go and experience it myself.\n\nThere's so much out there, and none of it is going to magically appear on my lap one day. \n\nWatch it, please. It's fucking amazing.\n\n",

        "content": "If I don't mention it, I don't know who will, but in the 1980's, Robert Duvall was in an action film called \"Let's Get Harry.\" It was another jungle rescue-themed action cheapie that ended up being directed by Alan Smithee. It's got a lot of heart. Maybe not as affecting as some of Duvall's bigger roles, but the cast includes some pretty notable names in addition to him, like:\n\n* Thomas F. Wilson - \"He's nice\"\n* Rick Rossovich - Terminated\n* Glenn Frey - The heat was on\n* Mark Harmon - LEEEEROOYYY\n* Gary Busey - Tied with Lou Diamond Philips for music movies that made me cry when I was eight\n* Elpidia Carrillo - Got to da choppah\n* Gregory Sierra - Chano from Barney Miller!\n* Jere Burns - I remember him from a couple of TV sitcoms\n\nAnyway, if you want a good non-thinker or need some of that 80's action cheese, you could do worse. I believe it's on Amazon streaming, but you can find it elsewhere if you look.",

My daughter could not take her eyes off her, she just kept saying how beautiful she was.  She has become obsessed and I can't blame her.",

        "content": "This is not about the movie exactly, but more about what it made me feel. I don't know what's the right sub for this but I wanted to discuss this.\n\nI recently watched \"The life of Chuck\" without knowing anything prior about it, and it was a great experience. There are few great scenes from it stuck in my head like when the teacher explains \"I contain multitudes\", or the end of mind world, but the one stuck the most is when narrator talks in the ending of act 2. Following was the narration to help people's memory:\n\n*Narrator: As he passes the place*\n\n*where Taylor set up her drums,*\n\n*those two questions recur.*\n\n*Why did he stop to listen?*\n\n*And why did he start to dance?*\n\n*He doesn\u2019t know.*\n\n*And would answers make a good thing better?*\n\n*Later, he\u2019ll lose the ability to walk,*\n\n*never mind dancing with little sister*\n\n*on the promenade.*\n\n*Later, he\u2019ll lose the ability to chew food.*\n\n*Later, he\u2019ll forget his wife\u2019s name.*\n\n*Later, he\u2019ll lose his grip on the difference*\n\n*between waking and sleeping*\n\n*and enter a land of pain so great*\n\n*he will wonder why God made the world.*\n\n*What he will remember, occasionally,*\n\n*is how he stopped and dropped his briefcase*\n\n*and began to move his hips to the beat of the drums.*\n\n*And he will think*\n\n*that is why God made the world.*\n\n*Just that.*\n\nI know the central theme is that \"Every life is wonderful\" and \"Living to the fullest\", and I did get that feeling while watching the movie. But due to this excerpt, I asked myself \"what if something like this happens to me tomorrow, do I have anything that I would feel the same way about?\". I do remember one small occasion, when I felt alive and happy, but nothing that I feel so strongly about and this made me a little sad. I do feel a little hopeful, maybe my moment is yet to come, as I am only 26, but what if something happens to me tomorrow, of what if I never get my moment.\n\nAnybody felt this way? What did this scene and this movie made people feel?",
