Go Hoosiers! IG: u/patriscuit\n\n**Kiel Kennedy** is an actor, writer, and (current) director of the Groundlings Sunday Company.

He\u2019ll also appear in the horror film MCCURDY POINT, which he produced and starred in alongside fellow Groundling and other great bud, Ryan Gaul. Kiel earned an Emmy nomination for his work on ROBOT CHICKEN, where he also became an expert at picking up Hot Wheels that he launched off ramps. (It\u2019s a thing at Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.) His other credits include SUPERSTORE, NOBODIES, LAZY SUSAN, THE MISADVENTURES OF VINCE AND HICK and THE BINGE 2.\n\n**Kenneth Mosley** is an actor, singer, writer, producer, and host.

Mosley holds a Journalism degree from Southern Methodist University and continued to develop his acting craft, studying at the British American Drama Academy\u2019s MIO program in Oxford and completing the conservatory program at The Second City.\n\n**Greg Porper** is an award-winning writer, director, and producer known for edgy, unexpected comedies that push rule-followers and rebels out of their comfort zones, blending humor and tension to spark laughs and gasps. In addition to writing and directing DON\u2019T TELL LARRY, Porper served as the film\u2019s lead producer, strategically crafting, pitching, and executing the film's business plan, securing all of the financing from over three dozen investors, and managing daily operations overseeing a team of more than 100 people throughout the film's lifecycle. Working as a development executive and freelance producer for over ten years, Porper has also developed and produced shows for Netflix, Fox, ESPN, MTV, truTV, Viceland, Discovery+, and more. He created, sold, and served as showrunner for the ten-episode CW digital series, Worst Birthday Ever.

I'm really craving films where the main character is smart, competent, and knows what they're doing. Someone who thinks ahead, solves problems logically, and doesn't keep making obvious mistakes.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean, I really enjoyed \n\n\u2022 The Accountant \n\n\u2022 Limitless \n\n\u2022 Sherlock Holmes (the Guy ritchie ones ) \n\n\u2022 The Imitation Game\n\n\u2022 A Beautiful Mind",

        "content": "Back in 2018 or 2019, I hit a low point and didn't know where to turn to. It felt like nothing was going right and my depression was crippling. I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.\n\nDuring this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Ant-Man,\" and \"Prisoners,\" I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn't alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.\n\nFor an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like \"The Suicide Squad,\" \"Dune,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" or \"Late Night with the Devil,\" I just think about how deserved it is. I'm so happy he has had continued success. It is deserved!",

        "content": "I have brought this up before but always find it fascinating when a director/creator can bring out multiple films in a single year. It\u2019s something really special when they are true classics.\n\nMy favorite example is Spielberg in 1993 with Jurassic Park and Schindler\u2019s List. Apparently the wild differences between the two process nearly drove him crazy. There are stories of George Lucas needing to oversee (at least some of) the visual effects after a certain point, Robin Williams calling Spielberg just to cheer him up and so on.\n\nBut the man delivered two *pillars* of filmmaking in a very short span. I know it\u2019s happened other times and would love to hear everyone weigh in!\n\nEdit: Love these responses and am getting schooled on some great films!\n\nTo clarify I did mean separate productions and not filming and releasing sequels super close together. Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Matrix 2 and 3, Hunger Games and probably a few others are a topic for a different discussion IMHO.",
