Rather than conform, she recruits a misfit crew for a spontaneous night of pool hopping through the lavish backyards of her college town. What starts as an adrenaline-fueled escape turns into something deeper as Kennedy confronts grief, identity, and the lingering impact of her father's death. It's messy, it's emotional, and it's the ride of her life.\n\nAMA! Back at 3 PM ET today to answer any questions.",

        "content": "We all know that *2001* was a game-changer, paving the way for sci-fi movies like *Silent Running*, *Star Wars* and *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* in the 70s. \n\nBut if you wanted to show someone (e.g., my kids) the state of the art prior to that, what would you use as an example? What was considered the best special effects movie before *2001*?\n\nI'm mostly familiar with *Star Trek*, but that was a TV show, obviously, and didn't have the budget of a feature film. Would it be something like *Forbidden Planet*? A Ray Harryhausen film? *The Ten Commandments*? \n\nWhat was the movie whose special effects made everyone say \"WOW!\"? \n\nEDIT: Yes, *King Kong* was the OG special effects spectacular and has been one of my favorite films since I was a kid. It was the first movie I intentionally sought out to watch multiple times, but I don't think you can say that there was no progression of special effects between 1933 and 1968! There's a direct line from *King Kong* to Ray Harryhausen and you can't deny that Harryhausen's movies have more technically advanced effects than *Kong*. \n\nEDIT 2: People are suggesting *Metropolis* and other movies from the 20s and 30s. Yes, they're great movies, and yes they were spectacular **in their time**, but I'm looking for the movie that would have had the most spectacular special effects as of the beginning of 1968. If you owned a repertory cinema on March 1, 1968, and you wanted to show your customers the most spectacular special effects movie possible, I don't think you were going to pick *Things to Come* or *The Thief of Baghdad* (or *Citizen Kane*, for that matter). \n\nIt seems like the top candidates are:\n- *Forbidden Planet*\n- *Jason &amp; the Argonauts*\n- *Fantastic Voyage*",

        "content": "I was thinking about this last night and figured I\u2019d ask here. What do you guys think is the biggest mistake in film history? Not just a bad movie but like one decision that totally changed things, either for the movie itself or for the entire industry.\n\nThere\u2019s so many that come to mind. MGM literally burning their original silent film library. Disney basically killing off their legendary 2D animation division after Treasure Planet and Atlantis underperformed. The entire Disney Star Wars era and how much potential they fumbled after buying the most valuable IP in the world. Sony turning down Marvel\u2019s offer to buy the rights to all their characters for cheap, and only buying Spider-Man later on. Disney betting everything on John Carter. The Hobbit being stretched into 3 movies instead of one tight adaptation.\n\nOr even further back, like United Artists giving Michael Cimino a blank check for Heaven\u2019s Gate which almost destroyed the whole studio system in the 80s. Or WB letting Kubrick\u2019s Napoleon die in development. On the business side: Blockbuster literally could\u2019ve bought Netflix for pocket change in the early 2000s, laughed them out of the room, and now\u2026 well, we all know how that turned out. And then there\u2019s WB/DC trying to copy Marvel with Snyder\u2019s DCU, rushing everything without building it up, which basically torpedoed what should\u2019ve been a billion-dollar universe.\n\nCurious what you guys think is the single worst call in film history. What\u2019s the one move that makes you go \u201chow did they screw that up so bad?\u201d",

        "title": "Yorgos Lanthimos' 'Bugonia' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bugonia): 100% (22 reviews) with 7.70 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bugonia/): 79/100 (11 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Bugonia is by no means Lanthimos\u2019 best work, but it looks spectacular thanks to the sheer richness, the stinging clarity and the eye-searing colors of Ryan\u2019s VistaVision images. Besides, what\u2019s not to love about extinction-level anxiety accompanied by the aching tenderness of Marlene Dietrich singing Pete Seeger\u2019s anti-war folk song, \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone?\u201d\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos-1236355544/)\n\n&gt; The timely urgency of \u201cBugonia\u201d could be identified from outer space unless you\u2019ve been living under a celestial object these days, as rogue vigilantes taking down corporate bigwigs have, in a post-2020 world, turned into the folk heroes dominating headlines and activating internet warriors. That\u2019s not to say \u201cBugonia\u201d carries an empowering message: If anything, it\u2019s distrusting in humanity\u2019s ability to rise above our own failures, arguing that while it\u2019s not too late to turn things around, we probably won\u2019t anyway.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/bugonia-review-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-1235147826/): B\n\n&gt; Yorgos Lanthimos, the director of \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d and \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d has become a squirmy master of this brand of violent-outsider filmmaking; let\u2019s call it enlightened misanthropy. He\u2019s working in the tradition of directors like Stanley Kubrick and the Oliver Stone of \u201cNatural Born Killers,\u201d but Lanthimos operates with his own dark playfulness. His new movie, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is a heady and gripping experience, in no small part because it takes the form of a duel \u2014 tactical, philosophical, brutal \u2014 between two characters who might almost be locked in a contest entitled \u201cWho\u2019s the More Outrageously Spectacular Anti-Social Offender?\u201d\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos-1236499397/)\n\n&gt; On one level, which punchline the film eventually plumps for doesn\u2019t matter: it\u2019s in the twisty agonies of the telling that the buzz of Bugonia lies. But it has to end somewhere, and perhaps some viewers will find the payoff maddening \u2013 though others (like your critic) will just bark at the sheer virtuoso mischief on show. Either way, what a joke.\n\n-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/08/28/bugonia-venice-review/): 5/5\n\n&gt; Bugonia is a very well made film, and while it is not true to say it is less than the sum of its parts, it is less than that final and very powerful part. Like Ari Aster\u2019s recent film Eddington, it also shows how difficult it is to make internet conspiracy obsession interesting. For me, Bugonia doesn\u2019t have the ingenuity and elegance of Lanthimos\u2019s previous film Kinds of Kindness, nor the emotional generosity and audacity of his steampunk fantasia Poor Things. It\u2019s a spiny, prickly, hothouse flower.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/28/bugonia-review-emma-stone-might-be-an-alien-in-yorgos-lanthimoss-macabre-conspiracy-theory-comedy): 3/5\n\n&gt; It\u2019s \u201cMisery\u201d meets \u201cMars Attacks\u201d meets all kinds of other stuff, with the excesses being quite entertaining, if not as satisfying as, say, \u201cPoor Things\u201d or \u201cThe Lobster\u201d or \u201cDogtooth\u201d or \u201cThe Favourite.\u201d Coming only a year after the sampler pack that was \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d this feels in a way like Lanthimos on automatic and in overdrive, churning out fun transgressions one after another because he and his leading lady have so much fun doing them. Then again, too much Lanthimos is still kind of a blast.\n\n-[Steve Pond, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/bugonia-review-emma-stone-jesse-plemons-yorgos-lanthimos/)\n\n&gt; The power of Lanthimos\u2019s work has always come from his ability to provide surreal but dead-on metaphors that take on lives of their own: a futuristic resort where one must debase oneself to find a mate, in The Lobster; or a family where the parents have trained their kids to accept absurdities as reality, in Dogtooth. With Bugonia, it feels like he\u2019s entered our world at last, at least for a while. Which also makes it maybe the saddest film he\u2019s ever made.\n\n-[Bilge Ebiri, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/bugonia-review-yorgos-lanthimos-enters-the-real-world.html)\n\n&gt; \u201cHumans can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d Michelle pointedly observes in the film. Lanthimos offers little evidence to refute her case \u2026 but ample evidence to love and care for their well-being even still.\n\n-[Marshall Shaffer](https://theplaylist.net/bugonia-review-yorgos-lanthimos-paranoid-thriller-starring-emma-stone-movie-built-for-our-times-venice-20250828/): A\u2013\n\n&gt; Lanthimos allows us the grace of that ending only after he\u2019s put us through the wringer, maybe even boring us a little along the way. The world isn\u2019t pretty, and Lanthimos is sounding the alarm. If only he would tell us something we don\u2019t already know.\n\n-[Stephanie Zacharek, Time](https://time.com/7313036/bugonia-movie-review/)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nTwo conspiracy-obsessed young men kidnap the high-powered CEO of a major company, convinced that she is an alien intent on destroying planet Earth.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nYorgos Lanthimos\n\n**WRITER**\n\nWill Tracy (based on the film *Save the Green Planet!* by Jang Joon-hwan)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nJerskin Fendrix\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nRobbie Ryan\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nYorgos Mavropsaridis\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- August 28, 2025 (Venice Film Festival)\n\n- October 24, 2025 (worldwide)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n117 minutes\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Jesse Plemons as Teddy\n\n- Emma Stone as Michelle Fuller\n\n- Aidan Delbis as Don\n\n- Stavros Halkias as Casey\n\n- Alicia Silverstone as Sandy",

I of course said release order but it made me think, what franchise would I ever say to watch it in chronological order? Is there a franchise where watching it in chronological order is as good of an experience (or better!) than watching it in release order? I may get roasted for this but I was thinking star wars would be a decent watch in chronological order. I still think release order would be best but I could see the argument for it.",
