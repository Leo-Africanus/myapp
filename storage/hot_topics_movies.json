Im speechless really. \n\nAlso, the way it was made is absolutely stunning. Stop motion is awesome, sad that its not used a lot nowadays. \n\nIm not going to spoil much here, and Im going to say to go watch it yourself. Amazing movie. \n\nIts about a Fox and his family getting into a conflict with three \"corporate\" food giants, that eventually evolves into a full blown war between the two, and even drags other animals into the conflict. \n\nThere are also some elements of philosophy too, so yeah. \n\nAll in all its a solid 8.5/10. The only bad thing was that its short, but then again its based on the book, so yeah. Go read that too if you would like.",

        "content": "Hi, guys!\n\nWell, my today's movie watching day was a chaotic one. Watching Soylent Green (1973) was a long overdue, but how that went from futuristic antiutopia (2022, lol) to classic noirs is a mystery to myself. Namely, Double Indemnity (1944) And, well, by the end of this I discovered something bizarre. What do those two films that are three decades apart have in common? Yeah, I know, the title spoiled it, but still. By pure coincidence the two movies I spontaneously decided to watch share an actor, Edward G. Robinson. And, well... He's great\n\nSoylent Green doesn't really give his character a lot of screentime, but when it does - he did his part perfectly. To me he selled the idea of a man crying over a cut of true natural beef. Not because he got it and he's happy, but rather because the world went down so bad it's even a problem to get some meat in the first place\n\nAnd then there's Double Indemnity. Oh, boy, Barton Keyes is awesome. An insurance investigator with a passion and a knack for statistics and finding inconsistencies and other \"oddities\". Dude radiates passion and charisma and this makes watching him such a treat. I seriously don't want to spoil much, but his position as protagonist's friend AND almost a central antagonist is a masterclass of suspense IMO\n\nCan't really vouch for Soylent Green since while it's a good movie, to me personally it was a bit boring. But Double Indemnity? Absolute yes! It's a gem. Not only as a time capsule, but also as a movie in general.  Anyway, it was bizarre. Realising I was looking at the same person 30 years apart. Even more bizarre because if I understand correctly 40's was Edward's peak and Soylent Green was his last role because he died of cancer just three months after he completed filming it...",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like romance but I'm already a  dark romance books reader and that's enough to make me crave something that doesn't exist. \n\nI want action, supernatural (like The Umbrella Academy, Beetlejuice), fantasy, crime thrillers, or comedy. Give me fights, chaos, mind-blowing twists, and a little romance just not an overdose. And pleaseno horror I barely slept after watching Abigail Please drop your best recommendations :) \n\n",
