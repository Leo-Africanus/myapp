The dude is in his element. \n\n\u201cLo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers. Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning. Lo they do call to me.

        "content": "**Ari Aster's 'EDDINGTON' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eddington)**:** 59% (17 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eddington/)**:** 67 (10 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety:](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/eddington-review-joaquin-phoenix-pedro-pascal-ari-aster-1236400006/)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s no question that in \u201cEddington\u201d Art Aster makes himself a scalding provocateur, the same way Todd Field did in \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d when he staged the confrontation at Julliard between Cate Blanchett\u2019s Lydia and the BIPOC student who questioned her devotion to dead-white-male composers. Yet as much as nailing down the precise point-of-view of \u201cEddington\u201d is bound to be the subject of numerous incendiary debates, I\u2019d argue that this is very much not a case of Aster becoming some young A24-approved version of David Mamet. What he captures in \u201cEddington\u201d is an entire society \u2014 left, right, and middle \u2014\u00a0spinning out of control, as it spins away from any sense of collective values.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/eddington-movie-review-ari-aster-1235123804/):\n\n&gt;Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d was born from some very personal trauma, \u201cEddington\u201d \u2014 the tagline for which reads: \u201cHindsight is 2020\u201d \u2014 only wields its\u00a0*what\u2019s the opposite of nostalgia?*\u00a0specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little \u201cremember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?\u201d fun, but Aster\u2019s bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we\u2019ve become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities.\u00a0\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/eddington-review-ari-asters-explosive-satirical-neo-western-takes-a-big-swing-at-maga-culture-cannes-film-festival-1236401277/):\n\n&gt;*Eddington*\u00a0is what you might call a big swing, a film that\u2019s more serious than it first seems, seeing Covid as the Big Bang that landed us right where we are now. It\u2019s about the elephant in the room: the emergent likes of QAnon, 4Chan and the Proud Boys, things that did more damage than Covid ever did, leaving a raw, still-festering wound. Without ceremony or mercy,\u00a0*Eddington*\u00a0rips the Band-Aid off, and not everyone is going to want to look at, or think about, what\u2019s there underneath it.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/eddington-review-cannes-2025-ari-aster-joaquin-phoneix-emma-stone-pedro-pascal/):\n\n&gt;And by way of creative catharsis \u2013 listen, no one was thrilled about 2020 \u2013 \u201cEddington\u201d finds greater charge enacting American carnage than just winking about, but that should come with little surprise. Aster has always had a knack for confrontation, while Phoenix works best as an open-nerve. That the duo should prove so adept tapping into a vein of neurotic action is one of the many brutal surprises in a social satire as blunt and broad as America itself.\n\n[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250516-eddington-review) (4/5):\n\n&gt;If Beau is Afraid seemed to be about Aster's own fears and neuroses, Eddington is about the more general fears and neuroses of the US in the year 2020. The writer-director puts everything into his blackly comic modern western \u2013 Covid-19 and online conspiracy theories, Black Lives Matter and white privilege, cult leaders and cryptocurrency \u2013 even if he can't quite work out how to weave all of those subjects together. The film would probably have been better if it had been more focused (and shorter), but Aster's deranged vision makes most directors seem timid in comparison.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/eddington-review-cannes-joaquin-phoenix-b2752519.html) (4/5):\n\n&gt;This is Aster\u2019s funniest film to date, and makes use of an ever expanding and shifting cast to dot the 150-minute runtime with well-observed comic details and visual payoffs.\n\n[ScreenDaily:](https://www.screendaily.com/eddington-review-joaquin-phoenix-and-pedro-pascal-face-off-in-ari-asters-wan-satire/5205133.article)\n\n&gt;Without question, the pandemic profoundly transformed an America that was already descending into tribal factions and widespread animosity. But\u00a0*Eddington*\u00a0lacks a clear perspective on that ever-present tragedy, settling instead for cynical observations and a fatal amount of smug self-satisfaction.\n\n[Collider ](https://collider.com/eddington-review/)(8/10):\n\n&gt;Eddington may feel like a step back for Ari Aster in regards to his striking visuals and talent for creating nightmarish viewing experiences. But, if anything, it\u2019s showing that Aster can take these nightmares and show how they can operate in reality.\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by Ari Aster:\n\n&gt;In May of 2020, a standoff between a small-town sheriff (Phoenix) and mayor (Pascal) sparks a powder keg as neighbor is pitted against neighbor in Eddington,\u00a0New Mexico.\n\nCast:\n\n* Joaquin Phoenix\u00a0as Joe Cross, Eddington's sheriff\n* Pedro Pascal\u00a0as Ted Garcia, the town's mayor who is running for reelection\n* Emma Stone\u00a0as Louise Cross, Joe's wife\n* Austin Butler\u00a0as Vernon Jefferson Peak\n* Luke Grimes\u00a0as Guy, an officer at the Eddington sheriff's office\n* Deirdre O'Connell\u00a0as Dawn, Louise's mother\n* Micheal Ward\u00a0as Michael, a young sheriff's trainee\n* Clifton Collins Jr.\u00a0as Lodge\n* William Belleau as Officer Butterfly Jimenez\n* Cameron Mann as Brian\n* Matt Gomez Hidaka as Eric Garcia\n* Am\u00e9lie Hoeferle as Sarah\n* Landall Goolsby as Will\n* Elise Falanga as Nicolette\n* Robert Mark Wallace as Warren",

While some of those do exist, this movie blew me away. \n\nMalkovich as the sleazy corporate guy valuing money over safety was one of the most effortlessly hateable performances I\u2019ve ever seen outside of actual violent, sociopathic villains. \n\nRussell also delivers, with these chilling silent stares throughout the film that perfectly convey his disgust and contempt without saying a word.  \n\nAnd then just when I thought I had seen it all, Mark Wahlberg of all people makes me cry. I can\u2019t remember the last time I cried during a movie. His performance was a total gut punch, every moment authentic, and it\u2019s some of the hands down best acting I\u2019ve seen from him.\n\nMan, what a rush this movie was. Unexpected viewing pleasure. ",

        "content": "*A brother and sister witness a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.*\n\nDirector: Danny Philippou; Michael Philippou\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [96%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bring_her_back)\n\n**Metacritic:** [72/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bring-her-back/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Mashable](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2685) \\- [Kristy Puchko](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kristy-puchko)\n\n&gt;*Bring Her Back* is extraordinary. For those who found *Talk to Me* sensationally scary, this follow-up will thrill with its deeply deranged tale of heartache and body horror. But the Philippous went deeper, presenting a character-driven drama with flares of psycho-biddy and religious horror. That heady combination not only makes for a satisfyingly scary as hell movie, but also a profound one.\u00a0\n\n[Slant Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/821) \\- [Rocco T. Thompson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/rocco-t-thompson) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;Looking at the work of Ari Aster, Oz Perkins, and many other modern horror filmmakers, much of the genre is currently entrenched in examining grief and trauma cycles in endlessly reducible patterns, traceable across generations from parents to children, that exist outside of the individual or unit, often as a satanic or supernatural influence that destroys from without. *Bring Her Back* is different, and uniquely devastating, in showing that grief\u2019s causes may be external, but its manifestation is entirely internal: lonely, shapeless, ugly, and unfathomable.\n\n[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \\- [Sean Boelman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/sean-boelman) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;All in all, *Bring Her Back* shows a massive step forward for the Philippou brothers. Although it\u2019s much more of a slow burn than *Talk to Me*, and its story is a tad generic, the excellent character work, performances, and horror scenes make this a horror flick that you won\u2019t be able to shake.\u00a0\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \\- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;The Philippous, leveraging makeup magic and other practical effects, relishes in the corporeal terror of death and its devastating aftermath. When they can translate something into a tangible sensation, like the camera effects of focus that take viewers into Piper\u2019s distorted field of vision, the film operates within a comfortable range for the directors. Where they struggle to locate resonance is in the emotional realm.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-lattanzio) \\- C+\n\n&gt;A taxing experience. Except not taxing emotionally, where it should count, as despite the Philippous\u2019 flair for craft, they here don\u2019t quite connect the dots from horror movie that features grief to a horror movie that\u2019s truly about grief.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Matt Schimkowitz](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/matt-schimkowitz) \\- B\n\n&gt;The Philippous escalate the tension carefully, choosing the right moments to tear into their characters. *Bring Her Back* becomes increasingly brutal as it veers into its last act, but it also adds too many swerves, layering up twists that don\u2019t amount to much. Some land better than others, but the movie works best on a visceral and emotional level, carried by Hawkins\u2019 mania and the textured sound design that feels like pouring glass in the ear canal. Like a punk band turning four chords into pure angst, *Bring Her Back* turns familiar trauma-based horror into a traumatic experience. To sit through *Bring Her Back* is to endure it.",

He made Slackers which then inspired Kevin Smith to make Clerks which is picked up by Harvey Weinstein (hate that he\u2019s part of this). Ben Affleck is cast in Chasing Amy where he is introduced to Weinstein by Smith. Affleck then connects Matt Damon to Weinstein. Damon gives Weinstein his script which was thriller about a genius janitor from Boston who works for the NSA. Weinstein advises Damon that the psychologist relationship should be a major focus in the film (originally only a minor part). The rest is history.\n\nAlso, 9/11 being a factor in Twilight and 50 Shades and influencing the popularity of Saw and Terrifier.",

Then it effortlessly transforms into something completely different.\n\nIt's a movie that you can almost close your eyes to, and just *hear* the story.  It's visceral, in a way that's rarely ever shown on screen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIt's one of those \"acid trips\" of a movie.  Meant to be \"felt\", much more than narrated.

But I was struck by how bad of an actress Abigail Breslin was. She no longer had that natural acting ability she had as a kid where she'd just disappear. As a grown girl/woman, she came off as wooden and whiny. And I've seen the same on some other movies she was on as an adult. It would explain why her fame dried up. Because child actors can cross over  if they can adapt. I mean, the Fanning sisters are doing well. \n\nAnother one is Corey Feldman. Went from being a big movie child star in the 80s to being a joke in the 90s and up, with the Cosplay Michael Jackson moonwalk and La Toya hair and his godawful singing.
