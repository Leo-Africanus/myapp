        "title": "The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One",
        "content": "So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&amp;t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light &amp; Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. \n\nDuring quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.\n\nThey went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. \n\nHow do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well. ",

The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli tries its best to avoid the cliches of the overworked spy genre and manages to help create a worthy character for Malek to run with, maybe not as fast as Jason Bourne, but no less memorable.\n\n[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-1236362272/)\n\n&gt;This is the third thriller that Rami Malek has made since becoming a star in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d and it nudges his tense, twitchy moodiness even closer to the center of his brand. He\u2019s the right actor to play a digital geek turned mindhunter; those eyes of his glare like lasers. Mostly, though, Malek plays out his methodical mission of vengeance as if it were something almost theoretical. The conceit of \u201cThe Amateur\u201d \u2014 that Charlie must do all this himself \u2014 remains, at heart, a conceit. That\u2019s why the movie is okay but never, you know, killer.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;There is a fundamental problem concerning how ruthless Charles is supposed to be in killing his wife\u2019s murderers in cold blood and the final confrontation with the homicidal mastermind involves a very muddled exchange of views.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;It at least looks and feels like a real movie. That might sound like not much of a distinction. But in this age of assembly-line streaming originals that play like bland knockoffs of a dozen multiplex hits you\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s not nothing, either.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \\- C+\n\n&gt;An aggressively competent spy thriller that has less use for logic than its lead actor does for his smile... the film makes a compelling enough case to sustain itself across the entire television season\u2019s worth of plot that it packs into two hours.\n\n[awakeinthedark - Brent Leuthold](https://awakeinthedark.com/2025/04/the-amateur/) \\- 2.5/5\n\n&gt;*The Amateur* isn\u2019t a bad movie from a technical perspective. Despite some misjudged shaky cam, it\u2019s well-shot and edited in a way that makes its 2-hour runtime move along briskly. It\u2019s just not a film that distinguishes itself enough from other revenge or spy films we\u2019ve seen already. Its release comes just a few weeks after *Black Bag*, already one of the year\u2019s best, which also follows spies chasing spies but does so with much more panache and thematic heft.",

I thought she was a good actress but men were mesmerized by her body and iconic lips. She then did Weird Science, playing a virtual woman, created by two geeks, and that film became a instant cult classic. In the 80s, she was the perfect woman. \n\nSo what happened? Two words: Steven Seagal. She married the famed martial arts movie star, after working together in Hard to Kill, and the troubled marriage lasted 9 years. \n\nShe barely acted but while her film career went up in flames, she did turn to a good cause, helping the Terminally ill by being a spokesperson for Club Carson, a foundation helping children with cancer. \n\nA good woman, her film career didn't rise to the potential she had, but she has used her fame for a worthy cause and this is what matters the most. \n\nAnd she's still stunning.",

        "content": "I've recently been working on a project about goth films for[ enjoyment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMHTjJ0F7m8) / academic research, and a lot of my friends recommended The Lost Boys - I get that it's a cult film, but I'm not a huge fan of the plot - the grandad is amazing in that though!! Are there any vampire-themed films that you love the plot of - I get people are gonna say Blade and stuff, but that's cool....I discovered He Never Died, and thought that was quite interesting, for example - I'm also looking forward to trying Sinners :) but any recommendations would be welcome. Thank you very much!! :)",

Kermode, the more art-house loving critic, whereas Randolph, the critic who prefers modern, mainstream movie. And you just know they'd hate each other so there would be loads of tension whenever they'd disagree. \n\nWhat do you think?",

This is kind of an appreciation post, I just think the guy is insanely talented and I think he nails every single role. He brings such a raw, intense vibe to his roles and he never phones it in, even in a bad movie, he always gives 10/10 even if the movie isn\u2019t 10/10. I\u2019m an aspiring actor and he\u2019s one of my heroes! Gladiator, Walk The Line, Joker, The Master, 8mm, the guy is absolutely brilliant, and I can\u2019t wait to see his new film Eddington this year!",

I watched it in the late 90s, on VHS or maybe even on TV.\nI do not remember a lot, which could make it harder to find. \nI remember that there were 3-4 Kids in this Movie in a haunted House.\nIn one Scene one of the Kids opened a Closed or something, and another Kid jumped out of it as a \"Zombie/Undead\" Version of them and bite the other Kid. But the Kid was not really dead, it was maybe just a halucination? Not really sure.\nAt the End of the Movie, i remember the House blowing up, but not with Fire, but with spooky stuff like lightning and some things like that.\n\nUnfortunately, this is all i remember. I've been searching for this Movie for over 20 Years now and i can't find it.\nI really hope someone can help me find this Movie! ",
