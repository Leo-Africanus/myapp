This sort of hypothetical has really intrigued me and I'm wondering if any movies have done it before (or something close to it).",

HE JUST SAYS \"I'm obsessive\" ?!?\n\nIsn't that like, Day 1 of film school, do-not-ever-do-this type of shit? How did that pass the writing room, and why did the director include this scene, whose entire purpose is to deliver that one line, and immediately end it, with no relevance to the broader plot at all.\n\nI watched them days ago and this is still pissing me off.",

Stitch looks like he isn't even in the scenes in the Lilo &amp; Stitch trailer. The CGI dwarfs in Snow White look creepy and superimposed into every shot. \n\nDon't get me started on the \"live action\" Lion King which was beat for beat the original's script and had no \"live\" elements \u2014 just CGI animated talking \"realistic\" animals. Why would I watch this when I can just watch the original?\n\n*TLDR:* I wish animated films could just be animated films. I'm not into this recent obsession with everything needing a live action remake. \n\nObviously it makes Disney a lot of money. \n\nI'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this phenomenon. \n\n",

Is there anything in particular that you love most about it? \n\nPersonally for me, it\u2019s the score to John Carter. The film as a whole is underrated in my opinion. Campy, and unoriginal in the world of sci-fi. But the film has a lot of heart, and (in my opinion) some amazing set pieces and action sequences. \n\nIn particular the scene where &gt;!John takes on the horde of Thark as the memories of him discovering his wife and child being murdered play interject through the scene.!&lt; Michael Giachino really knocked the music for that film out of the park in my opinion.

        "title": "Robocop and Robocop 2 are solid action movies which can also be perceived as satires of violence in film, especially the Paul Verhoeven movie",
        "content": "I loved Robocop. There's something about it which truly hooked me in and it probably has to do with the fact that it had heart. Sure, it was very much a cynical satire on the West's obsession with violence but it also had a protagonist, Alex Murphy AKA Robocop, played brilliantly by Paul Weller, as a man who \"died\" and came back as a robot, a Robocop but as the story goes forward, the man within the machine is still there and he starts remembering his past life, the family he lost, as well as reconnecting with his former partner, Anne Lewis, played well by Nancy Allen. The two together join forces against the criminals who \"killed\" Murphy as well as the Trumpian Businessman, played by Ronny Cox. \n\nThe sequel is not as good, it's more straightforward, but I did find the subplot about the criminal kid and how Robocop can't help but see his own son in this \"evil\" kid is quite sad and touching. And I still enjoyed Robocop 2 as a watchable action movie.",

        "content": "Definitely Mellish from Saving Private Ryan. I love how it's silent for a few moments then the Germans shoot back through the wall, hitting the other GI in the neck. \n\nOne sticks his head out and Mellish drops him but the rifle goes empty so he rushes the last German. It's a scrappy, dirty fight which seems to last FOREVER, while the GI is still laying there bleeding to death. It breaks my heart hearing Mellish calling out for Rieben, who had been busy taking out the 20mm cannon. They're fighting for so long that the GI bleeds out.\n\nMellish did have the upper hand - he was on top with the knife but the German reversed and disarmed him. Then it was over for Mellish. I like that they showed humanity and that the German didn't take pleasure in stabbing Mellish.\n\nIt's actually a very accurate portrayal as well - The Fallschirmjager, German paratroopers actually held the most hand-to-hand combat victories in all of WW2. You can tell by his camouflage he's not regular German infantry. ",
