Anthony Hopkins has pretty much nailed every single role he has ever played. \"The Edge\" wasn't some huge summer blockbuster or one of his most memorable roles, but I absolutely love his character in the movie. A billionaire who you wouldn't think would end up being the total bad-ass that he ended up being when shit hit the fan in such a serious survival situation. Such an underrated movie. ",
