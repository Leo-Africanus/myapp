        "content": "**The Naked Gun - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_naked_gun_2025): 94% (81 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-naked-gun/): 78 (31 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson-1236333409/) (70):\n\n&gt;Even if the movie kind of stalls midway as Schaffer struggles to balance the gags with the action of an overly elaborate crime plot, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to keep nostalgic fans of the earlier films happy.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/07/naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson-comedy-reboot-1236473708/):\n\n&gt;With rapid fire gags and a game cast trying hard to play it all completely straight, this nakedly hilarious *Naked Gun* is a welcome return in a time where we can use a few good laughs. This one has *more* than a few if sight gags, literal humor, and characters short a few cards of a full deck are your idea of a good time.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson-1236472418/) (70):\n\n&gt;The original Naked Gun was hilarious. It was a film that practically had audiences wetting their pants. The new Naked Gun, by contrast, is amusing. What it won\u2019t do the way these movies once used to is shock you into laughter.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson/) (85):\n\n&gt;The Naked Gun is back and it's as naked as ever. And also as gun.\n\n[The Guardiam](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/30/the-naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-spoof-reboot) (80):\n\n&gt;There is no reason for this new Naked Gun to exist other than the reason for the old ones: it\u2019s a laugh, disposable, forgettable, enjoyable.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-naked-gun-review-2025-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson) (70):\n\n&gt;With more jokes than you can possibly catch in a single viewing, The Naked Gun proudly brings cinematic groaners and outrageous sight gags into the 2020s.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-naked-gun-movie-review-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson-2025-1235141714/) (83):\n\n&gt;While it\u2019s a mild shame \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d peters out a little bit toward the end (at least before rebounding during the credits), it\u2019s even more of a shame that it has to end at all.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/the-naked-gun-review-2025-liam-neeson-pamela-anderson/) (90):\n\n&gt;The Naked Gun's joke-per-minute ratio is truly astounding, and the fact that so many of them hit as well as they do makes that even more impressive. For goodness' sake, even the credits have jokes in them!\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-naked-gun-2025/) (80):\n\n&gt;The result is a film that has a better chance of producing a belly laugh than any in recent memory: one that deserves, as Drebin would say, \u201c20 years for man\u2019s laughter\u201d.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1925863/naked-gun-review-2025-reboot/) (90):\n\n&gt;The Naked Gun is one of the most consistently and even exhaustingly funny movies in a long time, the kind of outrageous, outlandish comedy that multiplexes have been missing for years. It's truly a revelation to have a movie where the laughs come so fast and furious.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDirected by Akiva Schaffer:\n\n&gt;Only one man has the particular set of skills... to lead Police Squad and save the world!

        "title": "I analyzed Barbarian (2022) and without spoiling the movie, I figured something out. Here\u2019s a hint - 1,826 square feet",
        "content": "**Warning - Spoilers - Barbarian rules and I recommend you watch it before reading this dumb movie data article.** \n\n**Once again - Spoilers**\n\nI love [Barbarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr89pmKrqkI&amp;t=138s&amp;pp=ygUOQmFyYmFyaWFuIDIwMjI%3D). It\u2019s hilarious, stressful, scary, unpredictable and pretty much every other complimentary word I can think of. Shea Serrano recently watched it for the first time and posted about it on his Good Movie Substack page and it reminded me of a moment in the film when a character named AJ (Justin Long) discovers a labyrinthian basement and tunnel system underneath one of his rental properties in Detroit. Instead of being scared, he\u2019s over-the-moon and immediately starts researching whether it adds to the square footage of the property. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t, but \u201cit can be noted separately in the listing\u2019s total area (yeah\u2026b\\*\\*ch).\u201d Shortly, after learning this, he finds a tape measure and starts measuring the square footage of the subterranean torture tunnels. He doesn\u2019t get to finish the measurements because horrible things happen, so I decided to analyze the movie and figure it out for him. Here\u2019s what I did\n\n  \n\n\n1. Rewatched the movie\u00a0\n2. Listened to the director\u2019s commentary (very helpful) and watched the behind the scenes docs.\n3. I also used a tape measure at certain moments to figure out house length (when compared to the 6\u20192 Richard Brake).\u00a0\n4. I analyzed rectangular pallet length, counted stairs, and figured out step counts\n5. Counted how steps the characters walked, then I walked the same amount and measure the distance\n6. Drew a color-coded visual\n7. Did it all again because I\u2019m a maniac\n8. Collected timestamps\n9. I researched the production - [Zach Kuperstein\u2019s Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/zachkuperstein/?hl=en) was very helpful because it provided me with a nice layout of the area.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Quick Note** \\- Yes - I put way too much work into getting the numbers because these posts only work when they are wildly detailed. I can\u2019t stand lazy numbers or guestimates pulled from nowhere, so I always make sure to base my numbers on something tangible and researched. There\u2019s no way to get a 100% correct estimate, but I tried my best!\n\n\n\n**Several Assumptions**\n\n\n\n1. With a trial looming, AJ is going to need $140,000 for legal fees. Since he has no new money coming in, I am 100% certain that he was going to measure every inch of the basement. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not on his property, he seemed hellbent on getting the numbers.\n2. I initially thought AJ was using a 25-foot tape measure. However, when he measures the distance between two rooms (01:04:00 - Cage Room to Mother\u2019s Room) he takes close to 38 steps (of varying distance) which would max out the 25 feet. So, I have to assume he has a 50-foot tape measure. It\u2019s too small to be a 50-foot tape measure, but it\u2019s a fictional world where tape measure logistics are different\n3. Doug\u2019s (Frank\u2019s neighbor) house doesn\u2019t have a basement. [Only 33% percent of homes in Wayne County](https://www.drymich.com/resources/basement-waterproofing/michigan-cities-have-the-most-basements/) (where Detroit is located) have basements - so I feel pretty good about this assumption. I say this because of tunnel setup, there can\u2019t be a basement\n4. In the commentary, Zach (with some uncertainty) says 150 meters of tunnels were built for the production, (01:03:10). My numbers are close but they don\u2019t reach the 150 meter mark. So, I decided to use my numbers and calculations.\u00a0\n5. During the commentary, Zach is adamant that the staircase is 30 meters long (00:40:00), but I only counted 27 steps. The math doesn\u2019t add up. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s wrong, I just like using numbers I can vouch for.\u00a0\n6. They used Zeiss Supreme Prime lenses that exaggerate the space. It may make the rooms seem larger than they are.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo get to the total, I\u2019ll start with the rooms (and the hole in the ground).\n\n\n\n**There are five rooms in the underground tunnels**\n\n\n\n1. Video Camera Room\u00a0\n2. Cage Room\u00a0\n3. Mother\u2019s Room (with the TV)\n4. Hole in the ground - Prisoner holding\n5. Frank\u2019s Room\n\n\n\n**Video Camera Room - 108 square feet**. After measuring the room, AJ says to himself \u201cThis comes in at 9 by 12.\u201d (01:02:20) The average guest room in the US is 120 square feet, so I feel good about this number.\n\n\n\n**Cage Room - 104 square feet** \\-\u00a0 There are four rectangular pallets in the room (01:03:25). They are [typically four-feet long](https://www.kampspallets.com/standard-pallet-sizes-with-chart/),. Based on the way they are placed in the room, I was able to get a solid estimate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Mother\u2019s Room - 108 square feet** \\- I went with 9 by 12 based on the length of the bed and location of the television (01:04:25).\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Hole in the Ground (Prisoner Holding) - 36 Square Feet** \\- There isn\u2019t much room to maneuver in the hole - so six by six works for me. Also, based on a few photos I saw on Instagram, the estimate seems right (01:14:00)\n\n\n\n**Frank\u2019s Room - 144 square feet** \\- Based on [research of similar military-style beds](https://www.homedepot.com/p/36-in-x-75-in-x-1-5-in-Round-Tube-Black-Steel-Military-Bed-MIL150RD3675BED/318778769) (they\u2019re typically a little over 6-feet long), I calculated the room to be around 12 x 13 (01:21:39).\n\n\n\n**Total Square Footage of Underground Dungeon Rooms (and hole in the ground)** \\- 500 Square Feet\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Hallway to stairs leading further underground** \\- **120 Square Feet** \\- (01:02:15) - based on the amount of steps I feel safe saying the hallway is about 25 to 30 feet. Also, in the script (page 41), it says \u201cit seems to go on for some 25 feet at least.\u201d Later In the script (page 75) Cale (switched to AJ) says the hallway is \u201c30 by 4.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Staircase** \\- **115 square feet -** If there are 27 steps, the math comes out to 115 Square Feet (based on tread depth, riser height, and stair width).\n\n\n\n**Bottom of Stars to Cage Room** **- 131 square feet** \\- It\u2019s about 10 feet to the metal door (after the stairs end), and this is where AJ starts his measurements. I went 22.75 feet. This guess makes sense because it took Georgina Campbell (who is 5\u20196) 10 steps to reach the room.\u00a0 (01:03:20).\n\n\n\n**Quick Note** \\- In the script (page 75), when he gets to the bottom of the stairs he measures the width of the hallway and says \u201cFour Feet.\u201d I\u2019m going with a width of four feet for the hallway.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Cage Room to Mother\u2019s Room - 182 square feet** \\- AJ takes 23 tiny backward steps before he stops and sees light coming from Mother\u2019s room (01:04:00). I retraced his steps and covered 16.5 feet. Then. He then takes about 18 steps toward the room which is around 29 feet (I took 18 steps and measured them. It\u2019s close).\n\n\n\n**Mother\u2019s Room to the End of the Tunnel (it branches off left and right) - 240 Square Feet** \\- AJ runs/jogs for 8 seconds (01:05:07) before he has to make a decision whether he should go left or right. Based on a similar running speed he covered close to 60 feet during his eight-second jog.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Quick Note** \\- After Tess escapes the hole in the ground, she makes it to Mother's room much faster than AJ\u00a0 (01:16:16 - She takes about 12 steps from the bell). The two distances don\u2019t match, so I went with the longer running scene. Also, while Tess is walking to Mother\u2019s room, there\u2019s a cut, so it might\u2019ve skipped a bunch of steps to make things zippier. Last thing, shortly after AJ escapes the room he needs 17 steps to get to the bell. The numbers are all over the place, so I trust the straightforward running scene.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**AJ Takes a Left and Falls Into a Hole - 250 square feet** \\- AJ runs for three seconds before dropping his flashlight (01:05:15). He crawls backward for several seconds, and runs for 4 seconds before falling into the hole in the ground.\n\n\n\n**AJ Gets to the Bell and Takes a Right Towards Frank\u2019s room - 288 Square Feet** \\- This one is tricky, AJ walks for a total of 16 seconds (I only counted on-screen walking) before he stops and sees Mother lurking in the tunnels. When he turns around, he\u2019s about seven feet from Frank\u2019s door (01:19:02).\n\n\n\n**Conclusion** \\- If AJ has been able to complete his measurements, he would\u2019ve come up with a total of at least 1,826 square feet (169.641 square meters). This number isn\u2019t exact, but based on an absurd amount of research (and measuring my steps), I\u2019m happy with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s the twist!**\n\nI\u2019ve mapped out the tunnel system and it expands well past AJ\u2019s property line, so he\u2019d only be able to add part of the first tunnel and camera room. Based on the property lines, and distance between the homes, it\u2019s about 77 square feet that could be added to the total listing area. This is an inflated number for sure, but AJ would give it a shot. \n\nif you share this image please share the post too.

The way the characters ended up... it was so overwhelming emotionally. This movie truely is a masterpiece and recommended for those who need to know about the dangers of drugs.

How some people don\u2019t get closure, they just learn to carry the weight. It\u2019s quiet, heavy and real in a way that leaves you staring at nothing long after it ends\n\n",

The absence utterly crushed me and I vowed never to work with Spielberg as a result (I've been successful in this). \n\nInterested to know other things that never made it from the book into the film and really should have done.",
