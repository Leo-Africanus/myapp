What were they doing all this time? Just hanging out off-screen or something?\n\nFor instance, *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning* introduces Gabriel and gives him some real bad history with Ethan that predates even the first *Mission: Impossible.* For someone with this bad of blood with Ethan, it took 7 movies to show up.\n\nSo, when you run out of new bad guys to introduce, just come up with a name and give them some grudge that goes back to before the first movie in the franchise.\n\nWhat do you think about this trope? Other examples come to mind?",

        "content": "St. Elmo's Fire is referenced all the time, and is considered to be in the same league as John Hughes comedies. But it really is a shitty movie.\n\nIf it weren't for the title song and the very good musical score by David Foster, there wouldn't be many redeeming qualities about it.\n\nDemi Moore gives the most realistic performance. Ally Sheedy is high-school play level bad in every scene, and seems coked up with her nervous delivery.\n\nRob Lowe jumping onto stage yelling, \"Let's rock!\" is cringeworthy. Judd Nelson has none of his appeal from \"The Breakfast Club.\" Demi Moore's gay friend is a stereotypical, flouncing flamer, and she refers to Kevin being gay as a problem. Mare Winningham is the most bizarre casting, and doesn't fit with any of them.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was originally considered for Rob Lowe's role. Other actors considered or turned down roles: Brooke Shields, Tatum O'Neal, Jodie Foster, Joan Cusack, C. Thomas Howell, Jamie lee Curtis, Melanie Griffith, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Elisabeth Shue, Bridget Fonda, Anthony Edwards, Lea Thompson\n\nDid you see this movie when it came out and what do you think of it now?",

        "content": "A long time ago someone in this sub recommended that I watch this movie after I had seen the original Planet of the Apes. What a great recommendation. There are quite a few similarities between the two.\n\n\nMan the animation in this movie is mesmarizing. The artwork is so detailed and beautiful, everything is crosshatched. One of those \"every frame a painting\" movies. Literally.\n\n\nThe music builds quite the atmosphere. An OST I could definitely see myself sitting down and listening to. Groovey psychedlic rock. It reminded me of Belladonna of Sadness.\n\n\nEvery once in a while I come across a piece of animation and am reminded how France can stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan and the US cause they too have been doing animation since the days of yore.\n\n\n\nWatching the story unfold is so satisfying. And the pacing is quite tight might I add. Nothing feels excessive, every scene establishes something or progresses the story. The movie has such a whimsical, curious sci-fi feel that some of the more somber moments pack twice as much of a punch and are quite sobering.\n\n\n\nThis is one of those trippy ass 70's movies.",

        "title": "Rewatching 'Seven' yesterday really made me realize how weak 'Longlegs' was",
        "content": "They did a re-release of Seven in IMAX this past weekend, and even though it's not the most obvious contender for the format, I was able to go with my subscription, having only seen it on TV previously, and goddamn did it hold up.\n\nThe sound design, especially the music used in the opening titles, felt so grimy and real. The way the story unfolds as it slowly creeps towards an inevitable conclusion, even going so far as to have Somerset say \"you know this isn't gonna have a happy ending.\"\n\nThere were a lot of details I picked up with seeing it at that scale; one moment that stood out to me is when they have dinner together, the moment Somerset sees Tracy, there's this momentary darting-of-the-eyes that almost looks like a brief moment of recognition of what's to come, or at least a grizzled detective who's seen enough to know that a young detective with a beautiful wife investigating a vicious serial killer isn't going to end well, and that there's a reason the people who end up in that field for so long generally don't have anyone that immediately close to them.\n\nCompared to last year's *Longlegs*, which like many of you I was excited for based on the marketing - visually, it seemed creepy, the weird symbols, the grainy crime scene photos, the billboard with the phone number, it was all a brilliant way to get millions of people to watch something with a paper-thin story.\n\nThe biggest issue with the film is that it seems more intent on capturing the \"ambience\" and \"vibe\" of the genre, which it admittedly does well, but once you actually realize how thin the story is and how little there are to any of these characters, it begins to resemble the turkey from *Christmas Vacation* turning into dust.\n\nThere's a scene in *Seven* of the two detectives on the couch pouring over evidence; Mills says he's getting a second beer, and asks if Somerset wants one as well. Somerset says he'd prefer wine. Right away, this tells us not only did Mills start drinking first (which feels very in character), but that Somerset would prefer something slower, so as to not get too drunk while working. Mills proceeds to pour an absurd amount of wine into a tall, regular drinking glass, and only a minute later does Somerset pick up the glass, notice how full it is, and briefly look at it in befuddlement. Almost all of this exchange occurs visually.\n\nThere's more characterization in this scene than literally the entirely of *Longlegs*.\n\nA phrase I've heard used in comedy (but that I also think applies to many forms of storytelling) is, \"don't put a hat on a hat.\" Aka, the context I first heard it was in relation to writing a sketch for SNL that had Natalie Portman in it, where the initial setup was going to be something about a tutor teaching a student, and then halfway through they said \"wait what if she's also her character from Star Wars\", and then the whole thing fell apart. This kept ringing true the more *Longlegs* continued its descent into silly contrivances, with four separate plot elements that all feel as though they could've independently been the vessel for a story; the mother being forced to make a pact with the killer (which in itself is already absurd; the idea that maybe she would've turned a blind eye towards *one* as a way to save her daughter would've been interesting and slightly believable, but the idea that she ends up taking this gig for twenty years is laughably dumb).\n\nWe then proceed to learn the full extent of it, that the plan was for Longlegs to get the mother to delivery dolls to these families that had metal orbs in their heads that caused the families to go crazy and kill each other. It's like reheated Mike Flanagan gumbo. I was shocked at how not 'cool', smart or interesting this reveal felt in comparison to how sleek and Fincher-y the first hour of it felt. It's a cinematic Krabby Land.\n\nAnyways, I don't mean for this to just be another \"muh old is better\" as much as it is a hunger for more films with real characters that act and behave like real people, who do things unrelated to the plot while they're waiting for something, who occasionally sit down and talk about their lives, and who don't just feel like sterile vessels for the delivery of plot devices. Something as simple as the wine exchange is all it takes to turn a basic scene of exposition into something more flavorful and 'complete'.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I'm going for with this; I'm not simply saying \"X is better than Y\". Asking any film to live up to *Seven* would be impossible, I'm saying \"X feels lacking in a way that Y does not, here's one example of how Y does this correctly\".\n\nThe point of this was not to shit on *Longlegs* but to demonstrate how much a few very minor changes can turn what would be a boring exposition scene into something that gives us an entertaining insight into the differences between the two, which gives the experience a lot more meaning beyond just \"atmosphere\".\n\nalso muting this now because i wasn't expecting seven hundred notifications i thought this might get ten comments lmao",

        "title": "Barroz: A Grand Vision Lost in a Sea of Flaws",
        "content": "**Review of** ***Barroz***\\*\\*: An Ambitious Fantasy Let Down by Poor Execution\\*\\*\n\n*Barroz*, directed by and starring Mohanlal, sets out to be an epic fantasy rooted in Indo-Portuguese history but ultimately falters in execution. The narrative revolves around Barroz, a Malabari slave who becomes the guardian of \u00a0Viceroy Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama\u2019s hidden treasure. However, the characterization is inconsistent; while Barroz is portrayed as a former slave, his attire and demeanor resemble those of a nobleman or general rather than a subjugated figure, creating a jarring dissonance between the backstory and the visual representation.\n\nThe central relationship between Barroz and Isabella da Gama\u2014a friendship with father-daughter undertones\u2014had immense narrative potential. Unfortunately, this emotional core is underdeveloped and hurriedly presented through a song montage, depriving viewers of a deeper connection to their bond. The subplot involving Isa Ron in the present timeline also suffers from significant plot holes. Her sudden trust in Chotta, a protestor she barely knows, and the abrupt transition to a slum where she encounters Muwesi Maria feels forced and underexplained. Additionally, despite losing her phone, an important detail in the plot, Isa does not display any concern, undermining her portrayal as a supposedly intelligent character. This lack of consistency in her actions diminishes the credibility of her role.\n\nVisually, *Barroz* struggles to meet the expectations of a fantasy adventure. The cinematography is mediocre, and the VFX, which should have been a highlight in a film of this genre, falls short of modern standards. The fight sequences, a crucial element in a story of this nature, are poorly choreographed and fail to create any genuine sense of tension or excitement.\n\nAnother troubling aspect is the underlying tone of historical revisionism. The film appears to gloss over the harsh realities of Portuguese colonial rule and the atrocities committed during that era, offering an overly sanitized version of history. This approach, while perhaps unintentional, risks trivializing a dark period of exploitation and oppression.\n\nIn conclusion, *Barroz* had the foundation of an intriguing story but was marred by weak characterization, underwhelming visuals, and a disjointed narrative. While the attempt to create a fantasy epic is commendable, the film ultimately lacks the depth and finesse needed to leave a lasting impression. It\u2019s an ambitious but flawed effort that, with better execution, could have been a memorable cinematic experience.\n\n4o\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi7si0d0mpbe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49229bddd016659a681a63b2d63f3dae6f0ce1d2",
