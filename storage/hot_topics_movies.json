        "title": "June 6-8 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Ballerina' disappoints with just $24.5M, allowing 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' to stay at #1 for the third week 'The Phoenician Scheme' debuts in wide release with an okay $6.2M. 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' crosses $700M worldwide, while 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning' crosses $450M.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/zgb2eu7vrz5f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=862e8e8c963f9b6d98ed9e0b6ea1da6611037d54\n\nWithout much competition this weekend, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** managed to snatch #1 for the third weekend in a row. Lionsgate tried to counter with their ***John Wick*** spin-off, ***Ballerina***, but it fell short of expectations. Wes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** also made its debut in wide release, although it wasn't a very memorable opening.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $104.9 million this weekend. That's up 5.2% from last year, when ***Bad Boys: Ride or Die*** topped the box office.\n\n***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** stayed at #1 for the third weekend in a row, earning $32.3 million this weekend. That represents a rough 47.6% drop, which is worse than ***The Little Mermaid*** (44.1%) and ***Aladdin*** (42.4%). That's weird, considering the film didn't share much of an audience with ***Ballerina*** this weekend. In fact, the film is now running $8 million behind ***A Minecraft Movie*** through the same point, despite having a big advantage on its fourth day onwards. \n\nThese drops aren't great at all. Family films usually hold well, but ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** is dropping faster than usual. But with $335.6 million in the bank already, it's not really much to worry about. Regardless, with ***How to Train Your Dragon*** premiering this week, it will continue having rough drops. The film is not hitting $450 million domestically, and it should finish with around $420 million. That means the film won't hit a 3x multiplier, which is what family films easily achieve.\n\nMaking its way to 3,409 theaters, ***Ballerina*** opened with a very disappointing $24.5 million this weekend. These numbers are below the past three ***John Wick*** titles***, which range from $30 million to $73 million. It's not even Ana de Armas' biggest debut as lead or co-lead (***Knives Out*** is higher at $26.7 million).\n\nSpin-offs are a complicated case at the box office. For every one that explodes (***Minions***, ***Rogue One***), there's always far more that just fail to manifest (***Solo: A Star Wars Story***, ***Elektra***, ***The Huntsman: Winter's War***, ***Evan Almighty***, etc.). Even more complicated are spin-offs of characters we never knew before, which is the case with ***Ballerina***. Sure, Lionsgate did a job in trying to connect it as much as possible to the ***John Wick*** franchise (to the point that they had that annoying ***From the World of John Wick*** in the title), but that doesn't mean the audience will watch anything related if the lead character isn't here.\n\nNow, John Wick is definitely in the film (Lionsgate made sure to include him in the posters and trailers), but his presence is very minimal, opting to focus on the new character, Eve. But one thing that may have contributed to its lost revenue is the interest cooling off: this film was supposed to come out last June, but was delayed a full year as the film underwent reshoots. [These reportedly lasted 2-3 months and were helmed by Chad Stahelski without Len Wiseman on set.](https://www.thewrap.com/lionsgate-box-office-slump-ballerina-reshoots/) Although there's a [new report](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/ballerina-director-john-wick-3-connections-1236257808/) where both Stahelski and Wiseman refute that claim, claiming they collaborated and the reshoots weren't that big. Now, the audience generally isn't aware of production issues; they only care if the film looks good or interesting. With that said, Lionsgate built negative buzz after it was [reported](https://deadline.com/2025/05/lionsgate-ballerina-embargoes-positive-negative-critics-1236409583/) that they only wanted positive social media reactions of the film posted before its review embargo, causing many to worry over its quality prospects. It was all for nothing, given it has a solid 75% on RT, although that's below the rest of the franchise.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male, and 76% of the audience was 25 and over. At the very least, not everything is disappointing: audiences gave the film an \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, the same grade as the second and third ***John Wick*** film. Maybe it could hold on well, but with heavy summer competition, it's very unlikely ***Ballerina*** can get to $75 million domestically.\n\nIn third place, ***Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning*** dropped 45.5% this weekend, adding $14.8 million. Not a bad drop, but not great either. The film has earned $149 million domestically, and it's probably going to finish with around $185 million domestically.\n\n***Karate Kid: Legends*** earned $8.5 million on its second weekend. That's a very poor 57.8% drop from last weekend. In contrast, the 2010 version eased just 46.3% on its second weekend (a second weekend that's actually higher than ***Legends***' opening weekend). Through 10 days, the film has earned just $35.3 million, which is simply a very poor figure for the franchise. With heavy competition on its way, it will probably continue falling like a rock. Right now, the film will finish with around $50 million, pretty much less than the 2010 version's opening weekend ($55 million).\n\nIn fifth place, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** is stabilizing. It dropped just 40.8%, adding $6.4 million this weekend. The film has already made $123.5 million in the bank, officially passing any of the prior films adjusted for inflation. It should finish with around $140 million domestically.\n\nWes Anderson's ***The Phoenician Scheme*** expanded to 1,678 theaters, earning $6.2 million. Counting its numbers from its limited performance last week, the film has crossed $7 million domestically. That's below ***Asteroid City***'s wide debut ($9 million), but it wasn't really expected to top that film. \n\nThis is an okay start for the film. At this point, Anderson's name is pretty much the selling point; either you are already in or you just don't care, it's just that simple. The film offered pretty much the same things everyone loves about his films. Reviews aren't as glowing as Anderson's previous films (78% on RT), but no one interested was going to be dissuaded from watching this.\n\nAccording to Focus Features, 56% of the audience was male and skewed young (59% was 18-34). They gave it a very weak \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is even lower than ***Asteroid City***. It's unlikely it can hold as well as that film, so it's pretty much set to finish with less than $20 million domestically. Don't fear for Anderson's future, though; he's already working on his next film.\n\nA24's ***Bring Her Back*** dropped 51% and added $3.5 million this weekend. Not a bad drop for a horror film, although it's clear it won't hold as well as ***Talk to Me***. Through 10 days, it has earned $14.1 million, and it's unlikely it can pass $20 million.\n\n***Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye*** debuted in just 1,085 theaters, but that was enough to hit $3.1 million this weekend. That's pretty good, although like other anime films, it's gonna be front-loaded as hell.\n\n***Sinners*** dropped 46.4% and added $2.8 million this weekend. 8 weekends in, and the film has yet to fall at least 50%. Truly impressive run. The film has amassed $272.5 million domestically, and it will soon pass ***Gravity*** as the biggest live-action original film of the past 14 years.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***Thunderbolts***, which is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 49.5%, earning $2.4 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $186.4 million, and it's officially finishing below $195 million domestically.\n\n***Dangerous Animals*** debuted with a weak $1.5 million in 1,636 theaters. Expect it to fade quickly.\n\nKevin Smith's ***Dogma*** returned to theaters for its 25th anniversary. It managed to hit $1 million ($2.1 million four-day) despite playing in 700 theaters. That took its lifetime gross to $32.7 million.\n\nNeon released Mike Flanagan's ***The Life of Chuck*** in 16 theaters, although it earned a soft $224,585. That's an underwhelming $14,036 per-theater average (usually these films gross around $30K or more). What does this suggest? That interest may not be as high as expected. It's set for a wide release this weekend, although it's likely that the film does not hit it out of the park.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** was once again #1 this weekend, earning $67.7 million overseas for a $772.2 million worldwide total. It debuted in its final market, Japan, earning $4 million this weekend. The best markets are Mexico ($56.8M), UK ($42.2M), France ($30.4M), Brazil ($28.2M) and Germany ($23.7M). As previously said, it will reach $1 billion but its faster-than-usual drops indicate that it won't make it much further than that. Quite disappointing, considering its opening weekend suggested it could've gone for $1.2 billion or more.\n\n***Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning*** added $40.6 million overseas this weekend, lifting its worldwide numbers to $450 million. Its biggest markets are China ($47.5M), the UK ($27.8M), Japan ($23.4M), Korea ($20.5M) and France ($17.7M). It will definitely outgross ***Dead Reckoning*** ($567 million), but it's a question mark if it can hit $600 million worldwide.\n\n***Ballerina*** debuted with $26 million overseas, for a $50 million worldwide debut. That's below the forecast, which was already far below the previous ***John Wick*** films. For reference, ***John Wick: Chapter*** debuted with $138 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in China ($3M), UK ($2.5M) and Mexico ($1.9M). With competition on its way, ***Ballerina*** will probably miss $150 million, failing to recoup its $90 million budget. Ouch.\n\n***Karate Kid: Legends*** added $10 million this weekend, for a $73.9 million worldwide total. It has performed very softly so far in all its markets, and there's not a lot of countries left. It should close with around $110 million worldwide, which would be quite disappointing.\n\nWith $8.7 million overseas this weekend, ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** has crossed $257 million worldwide. This is definitely finishing with almost $290 million. Where's that sequel announcement, WB?\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Snow White* | Mar/21 | Disney | $42,206,415 | $87,203,963 | $205,545,435 | $270M\n*Hurry Up Tomorrow* | May/16 | Lionsgate | $3,312,692 | $5,215,357 | $6,222,399 | $15M\n\n- Hi-Ho. Hi-Ho. Hi-Holy shit. Disney's ***Snow White*** has closed with a horrible $205 million worldwide, far less than its $270 million budget. Absolutely pathetic. An anemic 2.07 multiplier, which is simply poor for family films. But here's the thing everyone will say: is anyone truly surprised? Everything that could have gone wrong, went horribly wrong. And now it's one of the biggest flops in history.\n\n- The Weekend probably is saying \"I hope you cry for me.\" Mmm, nah, I don't think so, Abel. ***Hurry Up Tomorrow*** has closed after just 3 weeks with a poor $6 million worldwide. It's crazy to see how low it could go after the film snatched some of the year's worst reviews. Maybe this is it for The Weekend as a leading star. Pretty funny memes tho. \n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThe ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** live-action remake will cede the top spot to... another live-action remake.\n\nYep. DreamWorks' ***How to Train Your Dragon*** is finally arriving, just 15 years after the original was released. Quite a short time to make a remake, isn't it? Well, for $ome rea$on, Univer$al decided to $imply get Dean DeBloi$ to make a remake. Why would he do it? Gee, I don't know what it i$. In fact, there's a lot of shot-for-shot scenes in this film. If this is a hit (and we all know it will be), expect more DreamWorks Animation remakes. *sigh*\n\nA24 is also releasing Celine Song's new film, ***Materialists***, starring Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal. She hit gold with ***Past Lives***, and this film is aiming to be even broader, hoping to attract more people. With a pretty great marketing campaign in the past few days and a very well known cast, this could be a sleeper hit for A24.\n\nAnd as mentioned earlier, Neon is expanding ***The Life of Chuck*** into wide release. After its weak numbers in limited release, the film will really need to step up its game to not disappoint.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

It offers an unblinkered, earned romanticism that suits this moment, and bolsters Song's reputation as one of our most astute observers of relationships.\n\n[SlashFilm - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/1871812/materialists-review/)\n\n&gt;There's a bit of quiet courageousness to the movie in its commitment to depth over trying to nakedly appeal to others, and that's a quality which makes any person \u2014 and any film \u2014 more desirable. So, I'll follow the film's bravery by admitting, right here and now, that I'm in love with it.\n\n[San Fransisco Chronicle - Hannah Bae](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/materialists-review-celine-song-20363208.php) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;Through most of \u201cMaterialists,\u201d the director and screenwriter\u2019s follow-up to 2023\u2019s \u201cPast Lives,\u201d the camera casts its luxurious settings in a golden sheen. This is the world of a successful, high-end matchmaker in New York City. Responsible for nine marriages, Lucy (Dakota Johnson), as her boss crows during a sparkling office celebration, possesses \u201crazor-sharp instincts and one hell of an eye.\u201d Marketed as a romantic comedy, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is a sharper, more thoughtful film than its genre would suggest. This is a story about perceived value and what its pursuit costs its characters -- emotionally, physically and materially.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Derek Smith](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-chris-evans-pedro-pascal-celine-song/) \\- 2/4\n\n&gt;*Materialists* is beautifully lensed by Shabier Kirchner, who captures the unstained luxe-ness of Harry\u2019s pricey condo and the upscale restaurants he takes Lucy to as lucidly as he does the ramshackle reality of John\u2019s day-to-day life. But Song\u2019s script works only in fits and starts, too often reliant on merely raising the subtext around the types of economic anxieties that affect relationships in numerous rom-coms to literal text. The central trio\u2019s conversations become less entrenched in realism as the film goes on, with the characters sounding increasingly less like individuals in the throes of love and more like they\u2019re espousing an authorial point of view.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-pedro-pascal-chris-evans-a24/)\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not sure \u201cMaterialists\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdate movie\u201d by any conventional definition, unless you and your date love artful cinema and don\u2019t mind having a complex, not-very-sexy conversation afterwards. But I do heartily recommend you see \u201cMaterialists,\u201d and that you see it for what it is, not what it kinda looks like from the outside, as pitched to you by the very sort of romance-commodification salespersons that Celine Song\u2019s movie criticizes. It\u2019s a great movie about romance \u2014 whether it\u2019s technically \u201cromantic\u201d or not.\n\n[AV Club - Natalia Keogan](https://www.avclub.com/materialists-review) \\- B-\n\n&gt;The rom-com has not been resurrected with *Materialists*. Though Song showed much promise with her Oscar-nominated foray into filmmaking, this screenplay feels less intentional in nearly every respect, and the performances from central cast members, save for Evans, don\u2019t adequately enhance the narrative. The ham-fisted insistence that relationships are largely transactional\u2014no matter the amount of money a couple may earn\u2014is void of any meaningful insight, resulting in a story that simply doesn\u2019t pay off.\u00a0\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-chris-evans-pedro-pascal-1236257284/)\n\n&gt;Especially for someone relatively new to filmmaking, Song\u2019s thoughtfulness as a writer is matched by unerring instincts as a director \u2014 nailing the balance between tonal variation and fluidity; getting superb work out of her actors; making judicious use of Daniel Pemberton\u2019s gentle, melancholy score; and delivering a sweet, satisfying ending that keeps a lid on the sentiment. Song\u2019s script avoids glibness in dealing with the transactional aspects of partnering and the commodification of certain attributes. There\u2019s a frankness here that\u2019s refreshing as *Materialists* explores ideas of personal value and increasing one\u2019s worth \u2014 including via the obvious path of cosmetic surgery.",

It\u2019s fully engaging, kind of an edge of your seat, I didn\u2019t see that coming, what the hell is going on here!, bonanza. \n A really great cast in a sci-fi, horror drama dressed up as a Western? but not like any western I\u2019ve seen before. \n If You\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve seen it, you can\u2019t un-see it and then you know. \nBut, I\u2019d say anyone who hasn\u2019t \u2026if you mention Bone Tomahawk they wouldn\u2019t  have any idea it even existed. \nIs that the consensus or is this just me?\n\nOh\u2026 and the sound editing??? Those sounds!! \ud83e\udd74",
