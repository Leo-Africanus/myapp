He\u2019s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.\n\nWell, The Blind Side is on TV and it\u2019s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what\u2019s on film I\u2019ve seen (or at least know about).\n\n",

        "title": "Which films make you cry every time?",
        "content": "It can be a film with a sad ending or simply one with a sad scene/s.\n\nFor me, these films are:\n- The Miracle Maker, a little-known but absolutely fantastic animated film from 2000 about the life of Jesus. Firstly, the scene where Jesus is crying on the beach after learning that John the Baptist (His cousin, no less) has been murdered. Secondly, during the Crucifixion scene. The music during so that scene is heartbreaking, not helped by Simon Peter clearly overcome with guilt for betraying Jesus and Jesus whimpering and looking helpless on the Cross. I've been watching that film every year since 2001 and I'll always be in tears during the Crucifixion scene;\n- Cinderella (the 1950 Disney film). Quite possibly Disney's saddest film. Admit it: until she marries Prince Charming, Cinderella's life sucks. The bit that gets me every time is when Cinderella is crying in the garden after her stepsisters have destroyed her dress;\n- Philadelphia. When Andy's family say their final goodbyes. Then the wake scene. No other words to describe these scenes;\n- Finally, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Might seem odd, but there are a couple of scenes in this film that bring me to tears. Namely the \"Cheer Up, Charlie\" song and the ending when Wonka gives Charlie the factory and says \"Charlie, don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he ever wanted. He lived happily ever after.\" It's not just that line, but also Wonka and Charlie's hug immediately thereafter that gets me.",

He\u2019s my second favorite actor of all time, and he is one of my biggest inspirations, an amazing actor and a true artist!",

The old school effects, the adventure, the humor\u2026 love it. \n\nWhat recommendations do you have for similar films to scratch that particular itch? I love fantasy, action, and mysteries the most. Especially when they don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. The humor is top notch. Horror is not my thing, which is why the Mummy was an outlier for me.\n\nAnyhow, what do you think is similar in some aspect?? Take it in any direction you choose! ",

        "content": "I watched a movie called \"The Score\" from 2001. Simply put, it's a heist movie with Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, and Angela Bassett. \n\nSolid movie with a star-studded cast but the trailer is absolute horse shit.\n\nFirst of all, the trailer makes it seem like all 4 actors are part of the heist but that ain't the case. Brando is an information broker. He's not really part of the actual heist. \n\nBassett is just there to be DeNiro's love interest. She's barely in the movie and knows next to nothing about the actual heist. \n\nAnd secondly, there's a twist in the movie that they straight up spoil in the trailer. \n\nAn absolutely horrible trailer for an otherwise good movie.",

I l liked the intimate drama of it, even though some of the close up face shots were unsettling.  \n\nAs much as I liked it, I was really distracted by the fact that Henry Fonda looks like a blend of comic book Norman Osborn and Willem Dafoe.  \n\n---\nEdit 1 - We just finished 2001. It was definitely an experience, especially the last chapter. I think I'll want to revisit it again. At the suggestion of another user I looked up the Wikipedia article, which references Clark's original book which gives a rather straightforward answer for the monolith that locates the concern of the last act, in part, in concerns about the evolution of the human race.\n\nWith that said, I couldn't help but bring with me the semi-gnostic metaphysics of Xenogears and Xenosaga, especially to the last act.",

        "content": "I know it's very, very dumb - but my god this film looks great. Michael Bay gets a lot of flack but boy was he making some great looking movies - to deliver this level of CG in 1998 was a feat in and of its self, but aside from that, every shot has thought behind it, it genuinely looks excellent throughout. Contrast, depth of field, interesting composition... \n\nI think what's happened recently is that big budget movies are being directed by people with almost zero experience and every single creative decision is being left for post production. That's why movies are \"flat\" right now. \n\nAt least a few years back our daft, big budget nonsense was made by people who had some visual flair. ",
