        "content": "I just finished watching \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and I have to say, the lack of attention to the Spanish language in this production is absolutely disappointing. It\u2019s baffling how a movie of this scale, with a cast full of internationally recognized actors, didn\u2019t invest in proper dialect coaching. Mexican audiences, myself included, are extremely upset by how the film handles the Spanish language\u2014or rather, \u201cbutchers\u201d it.  \n\nSelena Gomez doesn\u2019t even attempt to explain or adjust her poor pronunciation. Then there\u2019s Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a, whose character conveniently throws in a \u201cDeus ex machina\u201d explanation that she was born in the Dominican Republic to justify her accent. And Sofia Gascon? Her voice had to be AI generated because she couldn\u2019t even sing the notes of the songs. \n\nIt\u2019s as if the production, being French, didn\u2019t even bother to take the language seriously. The songs\u2014written in French and awkwardly translated into Spanish\u2014make little to no sense, and it\u2019s painfully obvious. It feels like they threw words together without understanding cultural nuances, making the whole thing feel artificial and disconnected from its supposed Mexican setting.  \n\nThis brings me to the larger issue: why is it that English or Australian actors go through extensive dialect training when portraying American accents (e.g., Andrew Lincoln, Kelly Reilly, Andrew Garfield), yet \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d gets away with such a glaring lack of effort? Even Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal trained extensively to sound like a Spaniard in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cLa Mala Educaci\u00f3n\u201d, proving that the right effort -can- and -should- be made.  \n\nAnd yet, despite all of this, the Academy is showering the film with nominations. It\u2019s disheartening to see how -actual- Mexican films, with authenticity and cultural accuracy, don\u2019t receive this level of recognition. Instead, we get a film that diminishes the importance of language and cultural representation, all for the sake of style over substance. Imaging making an Italian language movie where Brad Pitt keeps his Italian in  \u201cInglorious Basterds\u201d not as a comedy but as a serious drama, that was this movie. A joke. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m sad and disappointed. Mexican culture and language deserve better.",

BUT, the 3rd act of the movie could have played out the exact same way, even without anything supernatural.\n\nWe have seen those types of tragedies on the evening news.\n\nAnd, it just makes me sad everytime I watch this movie.\n\nHow relentless the bullying is, and how **utterly impotent, incompetent and passive** the adults are to stop the bullying.\n\nSome people complain, about why \"others\" were caught in the tragedy...well simply: all of them were complicit.\n\nThere are so many opportunities in the story where somebody saw the bullying take place, they recognize it is wrong, but then do nothing to stand up for Carrie; or at the best only make a half hearted effort, and then immediately forget.\n\nIt's not rocket science to stop a school bully. It's not international politics. They don't have weapons. They are just kids playing mean pranks. The adults should have easily been able to clamp down on the bullying if they really cared.\n\nAnd in the 1976 version; nobody has learnt their lesson...because they still continue defacing her grave afterward...\n\nThat's not supernatural evil. That's very real. This sort of evil exists in the real world.\n",

There's a bunch of James Bond castings in the Indiana Jones franchise - namely Sean Connery, but also Allison Doody and Julian Glover as well.\n\nAnother example is \"Joker\" taking cues from DeNiro films \"Taxi Driver\" and \"The King of Comedy,\" with them ultimately casting Robert DeNiro in their film as well.\n\nWhat other examples exist of this? A movie inspires another movie, so they cast folks from that first movie in this one. ",

Of course, it's more beautiful when you've seen the movie, especially because of Gunpei's katana and the hot dog and cold beer while watching a Cubs game.

Seeing Edward be so self conscious, and seeing him think that once he gets this miracle drug then his life will be better. Until he meets someone who has the same disease he then sees how much they embrace life, how confident they are in their own skin. It\u2019s such a beautiful and smart film that this for me is a Top 3 A24 film! ",

Ryan Gosling would be a good fit and he just did The Fall Guy with Leitch. \n\n",

For me, *Kubo and the Two Strings* is one; the end of *The Lion King*, when Simba is walking up Pride Rock with that glorious Hans Zimmer score swelling, is another. \n\nThe biggest ones probably: \n\n- Peter Falk\u2019s gentle \u201cAs you wish,\u201d at the end of *The Princess Bride* is so sweet I check my blood sugar after watching. \n\n- Colin Firth proposing in broken Portuguese to L\u00facia Moniz in the restaurant in *Love Actually* is peak romance. Not a huge fan of the whole movie now but that part is exquisite. \n\nWhat about you? Anything make you cry happy tears?",

        "title": "What are scenes cut/deleted from a film that SHOULDNT have been cut out?",
        "content": "Deleted scenes have always fascinated me. There are quite a few infamous cut out sequences. Some have been put back in alternate or extended cuts, others released as bonus features, and some have never seen the light of day. Others were scripted but never even filmed.\n\nThe ones that come to mind for me are Michael Corleone killing Fabrizo in Godfather part 1(apparently part of this scene was shot before it got cut and the idea saved for part 2 where it was cut again). There\u2019s a picture of this sequence, or part of it, where Michael apparently shoots Fabrizio with a shot gun. No idea where would it would fit in but the pictures are floating around the internet. I can see why it was cut but it\u2019s something id love to see. \n\nSuperman TMP. Added to the special edition but cut from theatrical is a sequence where Lex Luthor tests Superman\u2019s powers before he can enter Lex\u2019s underground lair. He shoot\u2019s Superman with machine gun bullets, sets him on fire and then freezes him whole. It\u2019s a fun sequence with some cool FX. Even the director, Richard Donner, on the dvd commentary is puzzled why he ever cut the scene.\n\n\nI always loved the Sentry Gun sequence in Aliens which was added back in for the special edition. \n\nGhostbusters 2 has a number of deleted scenes. Many have never been seen. One that\u2019s never been seen is Ray getting possessed by Vigo and crashing the Ecto 1A(remnants of this scene remain in the first montage sequence where we see Peter in the back of the Ecto 1 looking repeatedly to Ray whose running a red light.)\n\n\nAnother from GB2 but has been released which is Dana addressing the fact that she\u2019s involved in another paranormal event and so is there something that makes her vulnerable to these situations? This one is good because it makes light of something we the audience are thinking about. Dana Barrett just so happened to walk in that Slime?Out of all the people it was her AND she has a baby the bad guy wants? After what happened in the first film? Really?\n\nThe alternate ending of Little Shop of Horrors works way better in my opinion. Much darker. But funnier. Great miniature work.\n\nSpider-Man 2 has an extended cut which some extra bits of action on the train but more than anything there\u2019s a scene with MJ and her friend going shoe shopping that I love. It really delves into who MJ is and her friend really gives a nice performance. Plus J Jonah Jameson trying on the Spidey suit is GREAT, the one brought in by garbage man\n\nKill Bill. Ok. This is an interesting one. The Kill Bill that\u2019s been released(both volumes) is not the Kill Bill originally planned. QT wrote an earlier draft and he cut out what I consider to be the best chapter in the entire saga. \u201cYuki\u2019s Revenge\u201d. This was never filmed. And it\u2019s a damn shame. Gogo has a twin sister and she tracks down Beatrix right after killing Vernita Green. In the film we hear an Ice Cream Truck roaming Vernitas neighborhood. In the script? That\u2019s Yuki and shes found The Brusge and they both go on destroying the neighborhood in an explosive action sequence. Beyond that, there\u2019s a version of the film called \u201cKill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d which combines both parts into one film. The House of Blue Leaves is in color and extended(as it was , Extended anime sequence, a new anime sequence but most importantly? We, the audience, spend the entire film thinking Beatrix lost her baby. We don\u2019t find out until SHE finds out that BB is alive. I can only imagine the power of this sequence. It removed the stinger from the end of volume 1 where Bill reveals the truth.\n\nSo those are some of my favourites. I have more but don\u2019t want to name them all.\n\n What are yours?",

        "content": "I wasn't expecting a thoughtful meditation on something or other with Salem's Lot.  I was just hoping for a watchable Stephen King adaption.  \n\nBut here is when I shut if off:\n\nTwo of the characters, fully convinced that a vampire is living in the creepy house on the hill, go to the house on the hill.  Let me make it clear that they weren't going to confirm a suspicion; they'd already made up their minds that a vampire was living there.\n\nBy the way, each had found their own path there; they were not working together.  So what do they both happen to do?  They go at night, and both go right down into the basement.  Does either one bring, say, a flashlight?  No. One hadn't brought anything, and the other happened to have matches because he's a smoker.  The one who hadn't brought anything was supposed to be the precocious smart kid.  The one with matches was sort of the town intellectual, a highly-regarded school teacher.  But neither one had thought to bring a flashlight, or even a candle?\n\nSo yea, that was just too dumb for me to stomach, and I had to shut it off.  I can live with unwary teens calling out, \"Frank, is that you?\" not knowing the killer is lurking nearby, though it is a tired trope.  But this sort of plain stupidity was too much for me.\n\nHave you ever shut off a movie just because of what a character did was so unbelievably dumb?",
