        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

It\u2019s darkly funny watching him try to get it right and failing in ridiculous ways, yet slowly improving. \n\nThat experience made me realize how many films I might dismiss too quickly based on trailers or hype.

Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson are both excellent, delivering riveting performances that emotionally reel in the audience. It can also feel repetitious at times, trying to replicate the highs of some of the more exciting set pieces, building towards an expected ending.\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1953442/the-long-walk-review/) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;\"The Long Walk\" is an emotionally obliterating all-time great Stephen King adaptation, and undoubtedly one of the best films of 2025. The camaraderie shown by the group is not unlike the foxhole friendships developed between soldiers during wartime, but given the hopelessness of their situation, it starts to feel like we're watching the American version of \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Wang provides a majority of the much-needed levity with his sharp tongue and fearless delivery, while Baker's warm, gentle optimism represents the best of humanity.",

The resulting drama, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Tuesday will be released on Netflix in October, is more riveting than most thrillers, and more terrifying than most horror films.\n\n[The Independent - Geoffrey Macnab](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-netflix-b2818601.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;*A House of Dynamite* stands as a grim and timely warning about the renewed dangers of nuclear proliferation. Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick\u2019s *Dr Strangelove*. Unlike Kubrick, Bigelow doesn\u2019t offer much humour \u2013 satirical or otherwise \u2013 but this is a white knuckle ride of a movie in which the tension is ratcheted up to near breaking point early on, and then simply keeps on rising. German composer Volker Bertelmann\u2019s ominous score, heavy on the strident strings, puts viewers on edge even more.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-idris-elba-kathryn-bigelow-1236504169/)\n\n&gt;\u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d a countdown-to-nuclear-disaster thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is jacked up with so many familiar MOR tropes that even though it\u2019s trying to be realistic about what it shows you (spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t really succeed), it still has the feel of a self-consciously jittery high-end cautionary potboiler.

I also loved it and enjoyed it for what it was trying to do. But rewatching it recently really makes it feel like a movie out of time. It was doing the whole meta, self-aware thing long before it caught on. Movies like Cabin in the Woods, Tropic Thunder and Deadpool later got praised for that same kind of storytelling, but Last Action Hero was already playing with those ideas in the early 90s.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to revisit it now and see how much it holds up, especially knowing how common that style has become.\n\nCurious what other movies people think were misunderstood at release but actually aged really well.",

        "title": "Watching \u2018The Mighty Ducks\u2019 (1992) in 2025 makes me long for a different decade",
        "content": "It\u2019s 2AM, I can\u2019t sleep and I need some fodder on the screen to put me to bed. Picking \u2018The Mighty Ducks\u2019 was the wrong movie but in watching it, it has really made me realize how much the world has changed since 1992.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s a work of exaggerated fiction. Even in 1992, no law firm is giving a pee wee hockey team $15k to buy equipment, there weren\u2019t publicly broadcast televised pee wee tournaments with commentators, analysts and a full stadium audience, coaches aren\u2019t telling 10 year olds that if they don\u2019t make the game winning shot, not only are they letting their coach down but they are letting their team and their dead dad down and finally, the dialogue is way too clever and quippy for a bunch of 10 year old kids.\n\nGreat, we got that out of the way. But the movie unintentionally captures a vibe in the 90s that has since disappeared. They shot it earnestly and now it\u2019s a time capsule for that time. The kids are out hanging out with each other, the cities are lively, people communicate in the wild. The kids have this sense of adventure that I recall in my childhood but don\u2019t see in kids today. They are generally just out in the world without parental supervision, and that\u2019s *okay*. Shit, the notion of a grown man trying to teach kids hockey didn\u2019t come with the default assumption of grooming and pedophilia. \n\nIt\u2019s just wild how different things are today. I was a teenager in the 90s and again, yes the film exaggerates but the details they showcase in how we freely communicated back then and how people didn\u2019t jump to the worst conclusions of each other, is just wildly different.\n\nFinally, this is a little off topic, but this movie was rated PG yet it gets away with so much stuff and definitely isn\u2019t just a kids movie, as we know them today. The kids are looking at dirty magazines, they make light hearted race jokes like calling the 2 black kids and one white kid \u201cOreos\u201d, Gordon Bombay verbally rips the kids apart and straight up tells them they \u201csuck\u201d. I just can\u2019t imagine a PG movie today having any of these vibes.\n\nI really encourage giving the film a shot. I haven\u2019t seen it since I was probably 10 years old myself. No it is not high art and it won\u2019t blow your socks off. But if you recognize that the days we live in today are just\u2026so\u2026bland, I think you\u2019ll have a good time with this unintentional time capsule of a film.",

        "content": "\n\nI liked it as a kid. My mom was obsessed with it, which was one of her cute personality quirks, but the rest of us just kind of passively enjoyed it. The fact that I liked it as a kid at all when the movie was already about 50 or 60 years old says something, but I just thought of it as a good classic film, and felt modern movies were better.\n\nThen, I didn't watch it again for decades.\n\nI watched it last year (age 41) with my own kids and was blown away at the quality of it.\n\nThis was all done way before digital effects were invented and even conceived of, when even colorized film was a new invention.\n\nEvery effect is practical and built by hand. Every magical moment was real, done with clever editing, set building, storyboarding, and makeup.\n\nThe twister scene is genuinely harrowing. The tornado in the sky looks stunning, the wind is real, the screen door being ripped off the house and flying away looks totally believable.\n\nThe Witch appears in a 30-foot column of fire!\n\nIt looks real because IT IS REAL. The only way to make that effect was to create a real 30-foot column of fire, so they did. The actor was injured in the filming of this.\n\nThe performances were also amazing. Judy Garland's facial acting and singing is so affecting. The movie is iconic because of her performance. She's heartbreakingly beautiful and naive in it.\n\nHer scene with Professor Marvel (the fortune teller played by the same character as the Wizard) is really subtle and has aspects I did not appreciate as a kid, with him using cold reading techniques to convince her to return home. He does this in a way that seems sweet and genuine, and not sketchy or manipulative.\n\nThe performances from the other actors are also top notch, especially Ray Bolger's singing and dancing as the Scarecrow.\n\nTo think that a movie of this scale and quality came out in 1939 really staggered me. It comes as absolutely no surprise that it stunned and amazed audiences at the time, during the golden age of cinema, where these early films became iconic because of their craft and spectacle. Of course it's an enduring classic.",

        "content": "*MMA fighter Mark Kerr reaches the peak of his career but faces personal hardships.*\n\nCast: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_smashing_machine_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [79/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-smashing-machine/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Geoffrey Macnab](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-b2817883.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;This, though, is a story in which winning finally begins to seem very hollow. The real way Safdie puts a chokehold on his audience is by examining Mark and Dawn\u2019s physical and emotional weaknesses in such forensic detail. The Smashing Machine may not provide the pay-offs that audiences expect from more conventional sports movies, but this is the most raw and vulnerable that Johnson has ever been on screen. Once you\u2019ve seen him this exposed, you won\u2019t watch his typical action movie stunts in quite the same way ever again.\n\n[Daily Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a classical fight movie that innovates subtly. Maceo Bishop\u2019s nimble photography has the sweat and grit of a vintage muscle flick from the Pumping Iron era, but the score by the experimental jazz composer Nala Sinephro is all swirling harps and breathy saxophones; arguably no piece of music has ever sounded less like a punch in the face. Yet as an accompaniment to Kerr\u2019s battles in and out of the ring, it\u2019s oddly perfect, giving this tough story an unexpectedly sweet and even spiritual edge. Smashing stuff has rarely been such smashing stuff.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Cody Dericks](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-smashing-machine/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Dwayne Johnson delivers the best performance of his career as the amiable but troubled UFC champion Mark Kerr. Emily Blunt and Ryan Bader are also excellent in their roles. The screenplay is repetitive and frustrating. Blunt's character is so unlikeable and written with such vitriol that it becomes exhausting to watch her, although Blunt's performance is as good as it could possibly be.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-1236503546/)\n\n&gt;Johnson, shifting his whole aspect (he seems like a new actor), invests that silent, moody, hidden side of Mark with a quality of mystery. He gives an extraordinary performance, playing Mark Kerr as a gentle giant with demons that will not speak their name, yet the audience can feel them there; we want to see those demons healed. You might think the key word in the movie\u2019s title is \u201csmashing,\u201d but it\u2019s actually \u201cmachine.\u201d Mark is a man who reins in his violence by having constructed his entire self \u2014 body and personality \u2014\u00a0as a controlled engine of demolition. The movie is about how this man-machine becomes a human being.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Jordan Mintzer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-delivers-the-blows-as-a-tormented-fighter-in-benny-safdies-gritty-and-downbeat-mma-flick-1236358361/)\n\n&gt;Johnson has rarely played a loser, but he\u2019s always been likable, displaying a massive grin to match his massive pecs in action vehicles that never allowed him to showcase much range. He manages to go deep here without overdoing it, killing the audience with kindness as a benign warrior who suffers from one scene to the next, triumphing briefly in the ring before succumbing to addiction and/or romantic grief. Like Mickey Rourke in *The Wrestler* \u2014 a film from which Safdie seems to take a few cues \u2014 the actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-smashing-machine-review-1235148509/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;Johnson\u2019s performance is out-and-out wonderful, a beady-eyed fusion of body and spirit that osmoses Safdie\u2019s sensibility to deliver what can\u2019t be disputed as the most layered work of the actor\u2019s career. A vividly contradictory Blunt, funny and sad especially in articulating Dawn\u2019s conflicted response to Mark\u2019s post-rehab emotional about-face during a tense argument, is equally sensational.\n\n[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \\- [Damon Wise](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/damon-wise)\n\n&gt;Dwayne Johnson owns the whole thing with his truly remarkable work as fighter Mark Kerr, disappearing so fully underneath Kazu Hiru\u2019s astonishing prosthetics that the opening of the film, presented as contemporary footage from an event in Sao Paulo 1997, looks genuinely like the real thing. It\u2019s that rare beast, a biopic that\u2019s light on the bio and resistant to being a pic. It\u2019s a film about a human being, and its effect is strangely haunting, since Dwayne Johnson seems to do everything while doing nothing.",
