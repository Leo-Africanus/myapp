        "content": "**Anemone - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anemone_2025): 82% (11 Reviews)\n* [Metacritc](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anemone-2025/):\n\nReviews:\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236385949/):\n\n&gt;What lingers as the end credits roll is Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019 noble face \u2014 full of sorrow, resentment, guilt and shame, emotions that Ray spends much of the early action masking in hardened indifference. Regardless of the film\u2019s shortcomings, it\u2019s a thrill to have this giant of an actor back on a movie screen, hopefully next time with a more satisfyingly fleshed-out screenplay.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/28/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The younger Day-Lewis shows promise as a film-maker \u2013 Anemone certainly\u00a0*looks*\u00a0serious, the correct scowls and swirling skies and wordless, eerie montages to suggest weighty themes, big emotions and ominous suspense. The tools to back up that style with emotional punches that land like the real ones of the brothers \u2013 best believe they tussle it out, because of course \u2013 are not yet refined, but in this father-son duo, at least, I have faith.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236530758/):\n\n&gt;There are flashes of talent in \u201cAnemone.\u201d Ronan Day-Lewis, who has come up in the world as a visual artist, knows how to frame a shot, and he\u2019s canny about playing off the mystique of his father. The whole plot, with Jem entreating Ray to come out of his self-imposed exile, is almost a sly metaphor for how Daniel Day-Lewis would take a sabbatical from acting to become a cobbler or cabinet maker, or for his retirement now. Yet for most of its 125-minute running time, \u201cAnemone\u201d just sits there.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/09/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-ronan-day-lewis-sean-bean-1236557832/):\n\n&gt;*Anemone*, is a film that doesn\u2019t live in or anything\u2019s or anyone\u2019s shadow, even though that\u2019s what the story is essentially about, a plot point made all the more salient by the casting \u2014 or perhaps that should be\u00a0*positioning*\u00a0\u2014 of acting giant Day-Lewis Sr. in his first starring role since\u00a0*Phantom Thread*\u00a0(yep, another PTA production). Press-wise, the fervor for this long-anticipated return has already done a lot of heavy lifting, especially for savvy arthouse audiences. But, although he could so easily have rested on his old man\u2019s laurels, Day-Lewis Jr. instead exploits those\u00a0*expectations*\u00a0of his father\u2019s power (more of that later), and he does so in a fuss-free way that serves the story surprisingly well, right up until the actor finally coughs up his elusive character\u2019s shocking backstory.\n\n[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anemone-review-ronan-day-lewis-1235153177/) (B):\n\n&gt;This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn\u2019t placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It\u2019s disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can\u2019t put them back together again. But everything that\u2019s come before is so rich that you\u2019re ready to forgive it. The title, by the way, comes from the flowers that bloomed from Ray\u2019s own father\u2019s planting. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.\n\n\n# \n\nCast:\n\n* Daniel Day-Lewis\u00a0\n* Sean Bean\u00a0\n* Samantha Morton\u00a0\n* Samuel Bottomley\u00a0\n* Safia Oakley-Green\n\nDirected by Ronan Day-Lewis\n\n",

I remember being in grade school and seeing the trailer and thinking \"that looks cool, I should watch it\", and then I never actually did. From time to time the movie would pop up somewhere and again I'd think to myself \"I should watch it\" and then I'd forget and years would go by again. Well yesterday was finally the day I sat down and watched the film and I was honestly blown away. I seriously did not expect it to be that good.\n\nFor starters I am a huge sci fi fan, and usually I tend to gravitate towards realistic, \"hard\" science fiction as much as possible. Think of the Martian, The Expanse, Gravity, Apollo 13, etc, stuff that tries to be as realistic as possible. That being said it's not like I don't understand the concept of creative license and I do believe that the story always takes precedence over technicalities and realism. \n\nSunshine is a bit weird in that regard because part of it is very grounded and realistic while other parts of it are pure fantasy. While a bit jarring at first while trying to figure out where the movie stands exactly on that regard, it was absolutely the right call for them to make. The story is gripping, engaging, and the feelings and emotions are masterfully conveyed to the viewer mainly visually rather than dialogue. Which leads me to my next point, the visual effects for this movie are incredible. It's hard to believe it came out in 2007 because it puts many modern movies to shame. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised because the late 2000s were a golden age in terms of VFX as the convergence of classic film making effects and CGI came together in the best way, with film makers using each to their strengths while using each other to cover their weaknesses. This is in contrast to today where there is often an over reliance on CGI. \n\nThis movie was made for only 40 million. That was a more hefty sum back then in terms of a movie budget but by today's standards that's low budget. And yet you would never call this movie \"cheap\". The set design is impeccable, the CGI is impeccable, the practical effects blend seamlessly with everything, and of course the story is the real star of the show, keeping you engaged and pulling you into the mind of the crew throughout. \n\nGo watch the film now.

There's also the deadpan-somewhat-stoic, \"suffer in silence because I'm Soviet\"  attitude portrayed  by Arnold Schwarzenegger that softens by the end of the movie vs. Belushi's loud American persona that warms up to his USSR counterpart.  \n\nAnyone else have some love for this movie? \n\n\n----\n\n*Do you know Miranda?*\n\n*Nah, I never heard of that bitch*\n\n*FACEPUNCH!*\n",
