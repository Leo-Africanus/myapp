Joe Hisaishi's score just soars, it truly is perfect. \n\nIf you have any opportunity to catch this limited showing this weekend - don't miss this. It's a true work of art.",

        "title": "Lethal Weapon 4 is a good example on how to handle a forced unnecessary sequel and make it enjoyable",
        "content": "We all know that feeling, right? When Hollywood milk too much a franchise and you rolls your eyes because there too much sequels and they are kind of useless. Nevertheless, Lethal Weapon 4 is an exception. That movie is kind of underrated but \"full\" of quality. It's a perfect example on how to make a good forced-sequel-that-nobody-asked-for.\n\nFirstly and important point, it acknowledge the aging of the actors (and therefore, their characters) and even allows them to live an evolution. The best thing I suppose is the moment when Riggs use the famous \"I'm too old\" line from Murtaugh, which is a very logical move. But it also keep every running gags and codes of the previous movies to not stray too far from this franchise's nature (this is good too, to not lost the hardcore fans imo) while in the same time, showing new things to still give its own identity to this fourth sequel.\n\nThe Triad is an interesting new antagonist and we are even seeing the international debut of a young rising star (Jet Li). I am also kind of surprise by the final fight scene because of various aspect : it's a little more violent than what we are used to and throught this it also cemented the bromance/alchemy of Riggs and Murtaugh. It's also not a duel but a... truel? definitely not what we are used to in an action movie or a buddy cop movie. Last note, I love so much how Murtaugh and Riggs move in different direction (like a cross) when the fight is about to happen, it's very martial movie-like.\n\nThanks to all this, LW 4 made you feel like you are watching friends or a family that you have been seeing for years. The last scene is the best and almost pretty meta since it totally made you feels like you are a part of the Lethal Weapon family. So, kudos to the late Richard Donner and the whole crew.",

        "content": "I grew up with Airplane and Spaceballs and Hot Shots! and the amount of both visual gags and puns is still astounding. Some you only get as an adult, some you'll never get because you're missing a frame of reference (for example \"he never drinks a second cup at home\").\n\nCurrently there is a news headline going around where people suggest that Brazil should introduce a O2 fee for the upkeep of the Amazon rainforest and immediately people jumped in with pics from Spaceballs and President Scrooge taking a nose from the [Perri-Air can](https://atomicjunkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Perri-air.jpg).\n\nAnd I just began to wonder how you can create a Star Wars spoof movie and then just throw in a [Perrier sparkling water](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WIYnduw0L._SX522_.jpg) reference. How many rewrites and add-ons go these scripts through and how many people throw in a few more puns during writing and filming.",
