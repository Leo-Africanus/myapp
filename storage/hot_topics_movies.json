        "content": "When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.\n\nIt's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.\n\nWhat could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??\n\nI didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.\n\nGladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.\n\nIt's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.\n\nHe managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.\n\nWith Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.\n\nHe's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.\n\nIt's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.\n\nIt's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.\n\nRussell's performance wasn't just \"playing the hero\" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.\n\nHe's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.\n\nIt's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.\n\nI hope one day we will see him again in an another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.\n\n\n",

To be honest, I was afraid to watch them again because I figured I'd find them to be immature and dated.\n\nBut, I'd run out of movies I'd wanted to watch, and I figured I'd give them a re-watch all these years later. Oh, boy, was I impressed. They were all truly a delight to watch from start to finish.\n\nFortunately, I'd forgotten most of what happens during the films. There are scenes and jokes that I remembered, but they were also fun to watch because they're performed so well. Absolute classics. Then, the rest, had me laughing on the inside and the outside.\n\nNowadays, there aren't that many movies that I find truly joyful to watch from start to finish, but these movies all met the mark. When I first saw Goldfinger, I didn't even know who Beyonce was xD.\n\nI don't think there's been comedy like this since the last time it came out.",

        "content": "I went into *Grave of the Fireflies* completely clueless , I had no idea what to expect. But by the time the movie ended, only one thought kept echoing in my mind:\n\n**\u201cWhoever starts the war, no matter who wins or loses, the ones who truly suffer are the people just trying to survive it.\u201d**\n\nThe pain, the sorrow, the daily struggle of those living through wartime\u2026 it\u2019s unmatchable. Unless you've lived it, you can never truly understand it. And I was in tears by the end.\n\nI came across some online discussions where people were blaming Seita, the brother, saying his pride got them killed. But honestly? I don't agree. During a war, everyone is pushed to the edge\u2014there\u2019s food scarcity, fear of sudden death, bombing raids. Every morning, you wake up wondering if you\u2019ll live to see another day. In that kind of world, the mind doesn't function normally.\n\nEven the aunt, who many view as cruel, was also a victim of the war. You could see how it was mentally breaking her. Seita and Setsuko were just children. Seita had just lost his mother, had no contact with his father or relatives, and on top of that, he had a little sister to protect. How is a child supposed to carry all that?\n\nPeople say it was pride\u2014but if it was, would he have risked stealing food again and again, even after getting beaten, just to feed his sister? That\u2019s not pride. That\u2019s pure, desperate love. He didn\u2019t have an adult to guide him. He was just a boy, doing the best he could in a world that had collapsed around him.\n\nThis movie doesn\u2019t draw a line between good and bad\u2014it shows how **unfair** war is to everyone. And I think this is the **saddest movie I\u2019ve ever seen in my life**. I don\u2019t want to watch it again... but I truly believe *everyone*, especially our generation, needs to see it **at least once**. You\u2019ll learn something that no book or lecture can teach.\n\nAlso, that background music , Absolutely unforgettable. And that fireflies scene... the red glow, Seita and Setsuko sitting together on the bench in the night\u2014that image is forever engraved in my heart.\n\nThis movie... it\u2019s more than a story. It\u2019s an experience. And I\u2019ll never forget it.",

Before they ever achieved top billing and surprisingly the only time (as of now) that they've shared the screen.\n\nThe film's original title is \"Swimming Pool\", just to clarify. It's a slasher, despite what this video may convey. People get stabbed and die, things get bloody. In this clip, James McAvoy and Isla Fisher play university students who have just finished their exams. Fisher's character failed her exam and is fuming over it, but her boyfriend played by McAvoy invites her to a party celebrating the end of the term. She doesn't take it well and breaks up with him. Included a clip of McAvoy partying it up so that Fisher isn't the only one sported in a swimsuit.",

        "content": "When I was growing up, I used physical media all the time: VHS tapes, DVDs, Blu-rays. I remember going to the store or renting a movie and feeling a real connection to it. I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays too, especially full series of movies I loved.\n\nThese days, with streaming platforms, everything is online and instantly available. It\u2019s so convenient: you can watch whatever you want, whenever you want. The same goes for books and music.\n\nBut I wonder: do people still prefer physical media? Does anyone still collect Blu-rays or DVDs? Do you think physical media offers something digital just can\u2019t replicate? Like, do you miss the experience of handling a book, album, or movie?\n\nI guess what I\u2019m really asking is: do you miss that era of physical media, or are you glad we\u2019ve moved on to everything being digital?",

Granted, I may be biased because I did study linguistics, so the movie was right up my alley, but I get the feeling it's be quite intriguing even if you're not into that particular science.\n\nI am giving the movie a big, fat, enthusiastic 9/10, and now I want to continue with the alien motif.

The pacing is great, and keeps your adrenaline up. The way they explained technical terms and concepts was great for someone that has basic knowledge of the stock market. I did have to go back a few times to rewatch some parts. \n\nNot being an American citizen, it was shocking to see the reality of what a mess the banks made of the mortgage market. My face must\u2019ve looked more shocked than Steve Carell\u2019s character throughout the movie. The greed and apathy of the top guys is incredible. I especially liked the Mr. Chau character (who is a real person). And the gotcha at the end when they revealed only 1 person got a prison sentence out of this shit show. \n\nThe parallels with what\u2019s going on right now is quite freaky. My favourite part was how they blamed immigrants and the poor. They\u2019re still blaming immigrants and the poor. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, I\u2019d highly recommend checking it out.

        "content": "**Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sinners_2025): 100% (37 Reviews)\n\n     * Critics Consensus: Thematically rich as a Great American Novel and just plain rip-roaring fun, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination with unforgettable panache.\n\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/): 83 (15 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):\n\n&gt;It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):\n\n&gt;*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):\n\n&gt;The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It\u2019s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):\n\n&gt;\"Sinners\" is several things at once \u2014 a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original \"Assault on Precinct 13\" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography \u2013 but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):\n\n&gt;\u201cSinners\u201d is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema \u2014 epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It\u2019s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):\n\n&gt;If cinema weren\u2019t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*\u2019s electric fusion of genres \u2013 historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner \u2013 would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I\u2019m one of them; I\u2019d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness\n\nVanity Fair (80):\n\n&gt; Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film\u2019s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):\n\n&gt;Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old \u2014 high and low \u2014 at the same time.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by Ryan Coogler:\n\n&gt;Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.\n\nCast:\n\n* Michael B. Jordan\n* Hailee Steinfeld\n* Miles Caton\n* Jack O'Connell\n* Wunmi Mosaku\n* Jayme Lawson\n* Omar Benson Miller\n* Li Jun Li\n* Delroy Lindo",

Morpheus could be there, but instead he's flying around on a ship for some reason\n\n\\- The architect scene made a surprising amount of sense, if your attention span is on\n\n\\- Rehashing the iconic lobby scene in Revolutions was baffling\n\n\\- The Zion council is unbearable and speak as if they have access to the film's script\n\n\\- The machines don't feel too threatening... they fly around in octopus swarms a lot\n\n\\- You could rewrite both Reloaded and Revolutions into great films if you took a different direction",
