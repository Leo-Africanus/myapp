Everybody likes to associate with the both of them. It makes for a very heartfelt film about troubled, lovers Gary Oldman it\u2019s electric, as is Chloe this clip is based on a real music video vicious shot for his own rendition of the standard my way, and I think it perfectly encapsulates the love between both Sid and Nancy.

In fact, they were a game changer for its time. Especially in the fantasy genre, which was around the same time Harry Potter came out. Some of the CGI hasn't aged well at all but that's to be expected. The story, characters, wordbuilding and battle sequences were all great and the sets were beautifullly designed.\n\nI wasn't alive or born when these films came out so it's interesting to see how time has come along over the years. However, the trilogy are still great films (with Fellowship of the Ring) being the best out of the bunch.",

        "content": "Okay. So people often ask what's that one actor that gave a surprisingly good performance.\n\nOr what's that one actor that you that you didn't think was capable of good acting but proved you wrong.\n\nAnd recently for me that was Judy Greer in The Long Walk.\n\nI've always known Judy Greer as that actress who plays small side roles in movies.\n\nAnd she's always been good but nothing too impressive. And I can't remember her ever putting on a dramatic performance.\nSo I never thought much of her.\n\nBut in The Long Walk with just 5 to 10 Minuets of Screen time she absolutely blew me away.\n\nShe is devastating to watch. She conveys such a raw Terror and emotional Turmoil over the possibility of losing a child.\nI did not know she had it in her. She was for me the best performance with just 5 minutes of Screen time in a movie filled with incredible performances.\n\nI now hope to see her more in leading roles or atleast substantial supporting roles.

        "title": "We all enjoy it when an actor uses a \"for the paycheck\" role as an excuse to ham it up, but what's your favorite example of the other extreme? Meaning where an actor clearly has no motivation for a role other than financial and therefore clearly doesn't care and is barely trying if at all.",
        "content": "Let's be clear; acting is a job and pretty much every actor will have to take roles for financial reasons alone at some point. Charles Dance put it very well here:\n\n\"I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work.\"\n\nBut there's a difference between actors who take those paycheck roles in lackluster or bad films and give it their all or chew up the scenery in entertaining fashion and those who clearly are not even trying. See the 2000 \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", a terrible film where you have at one end Thora Birch monotonously droning every line and putting in as little effort as possible and at the other end Jeremy Irons (who openly admitted to doing this to pay for his newly acquired castle) tearing through every scene he's in like a mako shark on a cocaine high. You can't get a better example of the extremes of this.\n\nMy personal favorite example of the \"don't care\" approach is Peter O'Toole in the adaptation of Dean Koontz's \"Phantoms.\" Not a bad movie (Affleck is the bomb in it), but one that got a very negative reaction upon release and one you definitely don't expect the likes of O'Toole being in it. Being O'Toole, he isn't bad, but he's obviously putting in minimal effort and his attitude screams, \"Look, I had a bar tab to pay off, sue me.\" It's something I find very entertaining.\n\nYour favorite example?",

        "content": "I'm always baffled by this trajectory.  He's no doubt successful and surely insanely wealthy.  So whatever works works, I guess.\n\nBut it just seems so not what I would have expected for him.  I don't think today he is a director whose name will draw an audience like so many auteur types, yet he does seem like an auteur director....sometimes.  He's also just super talented.  There's no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Tarantino, Spielberg or Nolan.  But unlike those three, a \"The Next Film from....\" tagline on a poster isn't going to instantly sell out movie theaters.\n\nI think maybe it's easy to point to Spy Kids and the Lavagirl thing and be like, \"Oh, he just wanted to make kid-friendly blockbusters\" or whatever, but it doesn't seem like that's the case because he still did Grindhouse, Machete and Sin City through all that too.  Also, Hypnotic was apparently a recent film of his but nobody saw it, and that's what I'm getting at.  I think Tarantino could do a string of kid movies and as soon as he comes back with a \"real movie\", everyone's going to want to see it.\n\nSo what's going on with Rodriguez?  Why didn't he reach that level of status and fame?  He certainly seems to have the talent and he probably has the money and general financial backing to warrant it.",
