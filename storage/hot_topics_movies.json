        "content": "I think the first film is a masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films of all time. Maybe not number 1 but top 5 if not 3. I watched it last year for the first time in years. I didn\u2019t think it would be all that good anymore with how lifeless the series felt in the modern age. But no. It\u2019s still an amazing movie that lives on its simplicity. Dinosaurs are brought back. At first it seems magical. Then it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nAnd now with the seventh movie in the franchise coming out I\u2019m feeling that same tired and apathetic feeling I felt before I re-experienced the original. This really feels like it was not meant to be a franchise. The first film is very simple and the minute you try to stretch it beyond that you lose the appeal. It\u2019s not like Indiana Jones where you can have multiple adventures. That\u2019s why we have Dial of Destiny a chance because a fifth movie could\u2019ve worked. But with Jurassic I just can\u2019t see it. \n\nAnd I feel like with how lifeless the series feels now it\u2019s easier and easier to forget how amazing the first one actually is. Which is why I\u2019m not even bothering to see this one. I saw some reviews of it and that was enough for me to learn this wasn\u2019t worth my time or money. We should listen to the ending of the first one and let these creatures stay gone and not try to bring them back because it never works.\n\nNot sure how anyone else feels about this. For anyone who has actually seen it is there actually something in Rebirth that\u2019s worth while?  ",

        "title": "2000\u2019s erotic slasher film with major twist ending",
        "content": "**UPDATE: MOVIE FOUND**\u00a0a few redditors (namely u/[9Virtues](https://www.reddit.com/user/9Virtues/) and u/UPdown1111)\u00a0pointed out **Killer Instinct (2001)**. This movie has all of the markers: familial ties, mirror scene, fire at the end and early 2000's. The main difference is the final girl. I distinctly recall a twist and I also recall a visibly bi-racial woman. However, everything else matches. I must have misremembered the lead. It has been over 20 years so please have mercy on me! I'm going with\u00a0**Killer Instinct\u00a0(2001)** on Tubi. Thank you all!\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019m looking for a very specific movie. I haven\u2019t met anyone that\u2019s seen it but I\u2019m hoping movie buffs in this sub can help. I hope it\u2019s alright to ask.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was a kid I saw a movie in the early 2000\u2019s (possibly late 90\u2019s) about a group of young adults in a house (not sure whose house it was or why they were there). But one by one they were being murdered by a mask figure. Pretty generic but what stood it out was how sexual it was. A lot of nudity and sex. While it wasn\u2019t an actual porn film, there was a lot of nudity and a few memorable scenes:\u00a0\n\nA couple is having sex in a large bed with a red canopy. On the (I guess) ceiling of the canopy is a large mirror. The masked figure breaks the mirror and the couple is impaled while the woman is on top of the man. The mirror goes through both of them. I also recall a scene at the beginning of the movie where the final girl has sex at night on a beach while being watched by the masked figure.\n\nAnother memorable part of the movie is the twist ending (major spoiler alert):\n\nThe final girl is biracial (half black). At the end of the movie, the killer removes his mask and it\u2019s a white male. It turns out he\u2019s her father. I think she set fire to the house and he dies inside of the house (not 100% sure it's been 20ish years).\n\nI\u2019m trying to find this movie because this one ignited my love of slasher films. I\u2019ve seen countless ones since but never this one again. Does anyone know the title of this movie?",

The world-building is well done and enjoyable to be immersed in.  \n\nIt\u2019s also got great acting from a charismatic cast and has decent plot with tension/suspense.  \n\n  \nAnyone else still enjoy this 20+ year old movie?

I wanted to see more of that world and those characters. At the same time, I definitely don\u2019t want them to make a sequel or prequel. I think the movie works perfectly on it\u2019s own and I think making spinoffs would kinda cheapen it. Not everything has to be a franchise.\n\nAnother example would be The Goonies for basically the same reasons.\n\nWhat are some movies that are that way for you?",
