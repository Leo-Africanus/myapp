        "content": "I understand why many had a hostile reaction towards Eternals. The film is slow and does drag in parts, a stronger edit might have helped in dealing with its deficiencies, and while I like Gemma Chan as an actress, Sersi is a fairly bland protagonist. I couldn't be invested on her or her romance with Richard Madden's Ikaris. \n\nStill, I liked Eternals. The cinematography is splendorous and epic, especially in the last act. I liked the score. Some of the performances stand out like Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo, Angelina Jolie's Thena, Barry Keoghan's Druid. Say what you will, the director picked a superb cast for the film. \n\nThe action scenes aren't frequent yet they are highly effective. I've never seen someone truly convey the abilities of a speedster in a live-action film like Chloe Zhao did with Makkari, her fight scene with Ikaris being the highlight of the film, in my opinion. \n\nI also enjoyed the tone of the film, it's more existential and thought-provoking. The director's personal aesthetic is present in the film, instead of it just being a paycheck film lacking any identity from the filmmaker. \n\nI wouldn't mind Chloe Zhao getting a 2nd chance at Eternals 2, though it will never happen.",

        "content": "*Detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down. Testing their growing partnership like never before, they go under cover in new parts of town to crack the case.*\n\nDirector: Jared Bush, Byron Howard\n\nCast: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Ke Huy Quan, Idris Elba, Quinta Brunson, Jenny Slate, Brenda Song, Dwayne Johnson, Shakira, Andy Samberg, CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Jean Reno, Macauley Culkin, Alan Tudyk, John Leguizamo, Josh Gad, Danny Trejo\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [95%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zootopia_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zootopia-2/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[RogerEbert - Nell Minow](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/zootopia-2-movie-review) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;The details are dazzling,\u00a0rewarding repeat viewings. Disney magic radiates from every texture and movement, and a near-vertiginous sense of space and momentum. There are car chases through the streets and one where characters travel by Tube, not as in the London Underground but as in a miles-long, water-filled tube, and it\u2019s all visually dazzling.\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/zootropolis-2-movie-review-b2872048.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;*Zootropolis 2* reframes the original\u2019s metaphor for racism in a sounder, more thought-out way. In the first, the wave of fear and discrimination against predators like Nick was given material justification in the fact predators like Nick had been repeatedly attacking people (only under the influence of psychotropic substances). Some of the broad strokes of are the same as the first movie, with the same contractually obliged reappearances from Flash Slothmore (Raymond S Persi), Gazelle (Shakira), and the Shrewfather himself, Mr Big (Maurice LaMarche). Yet, there\u2019s more than enough of a change of scenery to never feel like we\u2019re watching a dog chase its own tail, and an endless supply of visual jokes and references. A disgruntled rodent will appear to jostle any cans stuck in the vending machine; in the Louisiana-flavoured Marsh Market, there are jazz-slinging lizards and sea lions easily offended by the term \u201cseal\u201d.\n\n[Flix - Nathan Swank](https://flix66.com/zootopia-2-movie-review/) \\- 3.5 / 5\n\n&gt;ZOOTOPIA 2 might be one of the funniest films of the year. The adults were laughing as much as the kids and not because of some inappropriate innuendos, but rather witty references to recognizable life situations. Judy Hopps receives a text from her dad that is identical to what I receive on a daily basis from my supportive, aging parents. Background jokes of cleverly named animal themed versions of popular movies, the same pig character getting drinks spilled on him at a party, or a simple yo mama joke keeps everyone engaged and laughing. ZOOTOPIA 2 proves that the old R-rated, comedic buddy cop formula can easily transition for the PG-family friendly crowd to great success.\n\n[DEADLINE - Dessi Gomez](https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-review-disney-1236627513/)\n\n&gt;Ultimately, the sequel delivers on its message to tell the truth about historical events, fight for one\u2019s beliefs and stand up to power and money. The climax that reflects debates about identity, official cover ups and who controls a narrative. Hilarious nods to Disney animation films like *Ratatouille* and the return of favorite faces \u2014 like Shakira\u2019s Gazelle with a catchy new tune \u201cZoo\u201d \u2014 from the first film bring humor and fun to a story of justice and embracing differences. And if that post-credit scene is anything to go by, there may be hope for a third film that takes viewers into a previously unexplored realm.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Derek Smith](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/zootopia-2-review/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;Bush\u2019s screenplay both effortlessly and elegantly weaves Judy and Nick\u2019s personal drama into this larger story about the importance, and difficulty, of exposing widespread corruption and historical erasure. Advocating for the importance of individual action in the face of bigotry codified into law, *Zootopia 2* provides plenty of food for thought for its young audience, making a more expansive statement on the dangers of intolerance than the first film, and without sacrificing any of its charm, humor, or visual ingenuity along the way.\n\n[AttractionsMagazine - Mateo Osorio](https://attractionsmagazine.com/zootopia-2-movie-review-disney-animation-2025/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Not only is the movie extremely entertaining but as Disney movies used to be known for, very moving as well. The relationship between Nick (Jason Bateman) and Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) tugs on the heartstrings of fans of the duo, but the star of the show in my eyes is the social commentary this movie touches on. I can\u2019t dive too deep into that without giving away big plot spoilers, but I will say that \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has some of the most relevant messaging in an animated movie from the 2020s so far. Disney does such an amazing job at writing real-world issues in a way that families can enjoy without worrying that it might be too much for their little ones.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/zootopia-2/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;\u201cZootopia 2\u201c is a marvel of modern animated storytelling, a family film that really will have everyone in the family laughing, singing (in the case of the earworm \u201cZoo,\u201c sung by Shakira\u2019s Zootopian pop star Gazelle), and perhaps even crying together.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/25/zootropolis-2-review-just-about-passable-family-comedy-sequel-might-as-well-be-ai-generated) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;There are a few laughs in Z2: of course there are. But they are algorithmically generated and corporately approved. It\u2019s the kind of movie you put on an iPad to keep the children quiet on a long plane or train journey; nothing wrong with that of course, but the heart and soul are lacking.\n\n[Seattle Times - Soren Anderson](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/zootopia-2-review-disneys-sequel-lacks-sweet-charm-of-the-original/) \\- 2.5 / 4\n\n&gt;The sweetness in the original is absent in the sequel. The players, including Judy and Nick, have an edge to them. Maybe that\u2019s to be expected in that the main characters are now more settled in their parts, but there\u2019s a sharpness in tone that makes them hard to warm up to.\n\n[AV Club - Caroline Siede](https://www.avclub.com/zootopia-2-review) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;Zootopia 2 is a stagnant sequel with one stellar subplot. As family entertainment, it\u2019s all perfectly fine. There are plenty of callbacks to the original to delight young fans (including a catchy new song from Shakira\u2019s Gazelle) and plenty of knowing jokes for the adults in the audience. A sequel of this magnitude has the ability to reach higher, though, with more creative worldbuilding balancing out the dime-a-dozen pop culture references and cheap gags. Given that a post-credits scene hints a third installment may be on the horizon, Disney is clearly still invested in *Zootopia* as a franchise. Hopefully it can remain invested in its artistic evolution too.",

        "title": "Rewatching Memento now vs early 2000s hits completely different in the context of our hyperpolarized culture",
        "content": "I randomly started thinking about Memento recently, hadn't seen it since it came out in the early 2000s.  Back then I was so focused on the backwards narrative structure /gimmick, but in 2025 after everything society has gone through, especially culturally in the US, in the past 10-15 years I realized Memento is like a premonition of our entire polarizing cultural climate today.\n\nSome examples:\n\nLeonard can\u2019t form new memories, so he literally builds his reality out of:\n\n* Polaroids\n* Sharpie notes\n* Tattoos of \u201cfacts\u201d he chooses to trust after each \"reset\" and not question later\n\nThis feels similar to how people build their political identities now. We don\u2019t sit with nuance anymore or deep, probing critical thinking. We grab a screenshot, a headline, a tweet, a TikTok clip, and treat it like it\u2019s the whole truth. Just little ideological Polaroids we carry around like proof. You hear people reference these \"tattoos\" in debate. (e.g. have you seen the clip of Don Lemon on CNN trying to explain how women reach their prime in their 20s, 30s, and sometimes 40s citing Google as his evidence?)\n\nLeonard, the movie's protagonist, says:\n\n\u201cWe all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.\u201d\n\nModern culture takes that literally. Instead of mirrors, we have algorithms and influencers constantly reflecting back the version of ourselves we already want to believe in. And if something contradicts that? We just forget it. On purpose.\n\nWhat's really prescient is realizing Leonard is basically choosing his own reality. He keeps the \u201cfacts\u201d that keep him emotionally stable and discards anything that threatens the story he needs to survive. That\u2019s the real twist: he doesn\u2019t actually want the truth because he wants certainty.\n\nThis feels like american politics now.\n\nStructurally, the movie even mirrors how discourse works. You don\u2019t move from facts --&gt; conclusion. You start with the conclusion (my side = good) and work backwards to grab whatever fragments support it. Same inverted logic as the film itself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the line that feels like it was written in 2025:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the truth. You make up your own truth.\u201d\n\nLeonard and an entire culture built on curated memory, selective evidence, and outsourced thinking.\n\nBy the end of the movie, Leonard isn\u2019t free - he\u2019s the easiest person in the world to manipulate. And the scariest part is that he thinks he\u2019s thinking for himself the entire time.\n\nFeels like Nolan made a movie about humans and social media before social media even gained momentum. This could have a current film about current times.",

        "content": "I was debating about this topic with a cinephile friend...and it came back to favorite directors and then what directors I don't like.  Naturally, I thought I'd come to reddit and see what others popped up and how many people will disagree with these 3 directors I don't like.\n\n1.  Woody Allen - I never got his neurosis-as-performance schtick.  His insecurity isn't funny or charming to me.  Even if he's NOT in the movie, there's a character that's always a Woody-stand-in.  His characters never grow, never learn...everyone else around him changes.  The women in his films are fantasies for insecure males and there are zero stakes.  \n\n2. Terence Malick - IMHO, he loves his camera more than his characters (outside of Badlands which I enjoy).  For him, the camera is the character....which doesn't give me any reason to care about characters.  So while his films are visually-stunning, they're emotionally empty to me.\n\n3.  Lars von Trier - Watching a von Trier movie is more of an exercise in endurance as to how much suffering I can withstand over the next 2 hours.  And he has a particular style that I find not only annoying but takes me out of the movie.  Here they are: a.  He removes agency from his characters, b.  He engineers the world as hostile to his protagonist, c.  There's no counterweight to any trauma, d.  He relies on performers to give the appearance of humanity.  Von Trier fans like to pass him off as if his suffering is making some sort of profound statement.  They're not.  It's suffering for the sake of suffering.  \n\n  \n",

I watched it for the first time this year and there's so much about it to like. I went into it blind and it was one of the weirdest movies I've watched (in a good way). \n\nSomething about The Martian (2015) scratches my brain just right. The potato thing is just cool. \n\nAd Astra (2019) didn't have a great plot IMO, but it was visually a beautiful movie and the score was pretty solid too. ",

On the bridge of Spaceball 1, as Rick Moranis, Mel Brooks, and George Wyner find the self destruct cancel button out of order, one of them says \"fuck\". I can't explain exactly why, but I think this is the funniest and most sincerely delivered f bomb in cinema and it cracks me up every single time I watch the movie. I giggle a little when I remember it is coming. \n\nI can't tell which of the 3 says it. Their faces are off camera when the f bomb hits, so I can't tell from rewatching. It sounds a lot like it is Rick Moranis, which makes it even better, but there is a small seed of doubt that it is George Wyner, and I don't want to deny the man due credit for a perfectly placed expletive if it is him. Does anyone know for sure? \n\n",

When I got a bit older I loved clubbing, especially the dancing and music part of it. Nothing else mattered anymore as soon as I was able to conquer a podest for myself and could dance the night away. I never got enough of it. But of course the club culture was very different in the early 2000s and living in Germany didn't help to feel really free while enjoying the music (Berlin would like to have a word possibly, but I lived far away from it). Watching this movie now I understand much more what I felt was missing back then. This movie may not be a masterpiece, but it reminds me of a time I was as hungry for enjoyment and attention as the protagonist. Music felt different to me. Studio 54 brings back all those emotions I had back then. Maybe I can motivate some people to have a watch. It's of course not all fairytales, it shows the downfall of Studio 54 because of excessive behavior in a lot of forms. But imagening the late 70s, there weren't many spaces for queer folks. Studio 54 was a place where people could be themselves, for a short period of time, of course. ",
