So that go me wondering why his film career got stalled.\n\nand Yes I know he did television work during this time (Boston Legal, A Season of The Office &amp; The Blacklist), but I've seen television actors trying to manage both television and film roles. I just wonder why Spader just became more sporadic with film.",

If there are love letters, are there booty calls?  Pickup lines?  I'm not even being satirical, really, since there's an element inherent in the idea of a love letter that is over the top and maybe a little much.  Meaning maybe the booty call is all people really need sometimes? Maybe?

        "content": "Some movies are advertised with a big named celebrity. It even focuses on them throughout the movie or maybe they're the main hero. However there's some that I myself didn't realize until after several viewings, the main star isn't always necessarily the \"lead\" character.  \n\nTake Terminator 1 and 2 as examples. Arnold is written all over those movies as the star, but it's Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor is the lead character.\n\nSinners (2025). We may get Michael B Jordan x 2 as twins brothers but it's actually their teenage cousin, Sammy that is the lead character.\n\nAny other movies like this you can think of?",

You see all that humanity has to offer: men with great empathy and a solemn duty; petty hateful men who use power and influence to cause misery because they like to hurt people, men who rightfully get what they deserve, men who get what they don\u2019t deserve, and others in between. There is such humanity in this movie, both the good and the bad. It is tragic in places, it is funny in places, and the characters are so well acted and here is the thing:\n\n\nIt is meaningful.\n\nYou can\u2019t say that about a lot of movies, something that uses a very difficult subject to display powerful messages of compassion, forgiveness, but also being completely open with the nastiness out there. It is a great movie. \n ",

Personally thought it was mediocre and just a standard \"technology bad\" type movie that was coming out then. No way this kind of thing could happen right? The movie just felt ridiculous with the AI as a cop out plot device\n\nRewatched this on Netflix yesterday and man, it was ahead of it's time....now that we know what AI is capable of and the possibility of agentic misalignment (ie: blackmail). Sure the movie has flaws and it's still a bit exaggerated in some ways, but we're so much closer to this being a possibility than we were back then, and it makes it a different/better watch\n\nI feel like this movie would have done better today than 10 years ago",
