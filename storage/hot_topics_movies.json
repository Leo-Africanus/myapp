        "content": "I recently snagged a five-pack DVD bundle of Cannon movies including Bloodsport, Over The Top, Masters of the Universe, Cobra, and The Hitman.  I had seen all of them except Cobra and The Hitman.  So, I decided to pop it in this morning, and it was awful, almost unbearable to watch.  It's your usual run of the mill partner turns on the good cop action movie where the good cop seeks revenge, however, the acting in this movie was atrocious, especially from Chuck Norris.  Emotion was non-existent.  Every scene with him looked like he was spacing out, staring into the void, reciting a handful of boring lines.  He looked so uninterested, even when teaching a bullied teen how to stick up for himself.  Is this the norm for his movies?  Is he worse than 90s Steven Seagal?  How did Walker, Texas Ranger run for almost ten years?  Please tell Cobra is better than this movie.",

        "content": "It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.  Driver's average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" (94/100), Coen Brothers' \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (93/100), Jarmush's \"Paterson\" (90/100) and Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" (87/100) at the top.\n\nOther than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you'd struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver.  For example,  Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).\n\nDriver seems to seek out roles like he's adding great directors to his Pok\u00e9dex.\n\n**Adam Driver's Pokedex:**\n\n**1. Martin Scorsese**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Silence* (2016)\n* **Notable Films**: *Taxi Driver* (1976), *Goodfellas* (1990), *Raging Bull* (1980)\n\n**2.

Jeff Nichols**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Midnight Special* (2016)\n* **Notable Films**: *Take Shelter* (2011), *Mud* (2012), *Loving* (2016)\n\n**Additional Thoughts**\n\n* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's \"Megalopolis\", Gilliam's \"Man who Killed Don Quixote\", Ridley Scott's \"House of Gucci\" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.\n* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like \"Hey... my boy is ready when you are\".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?\n* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",

Denzel's worked multiple times with the likes of Spike Lee, Ed Zwick, Tony Scott and Antoine Fuqua but I gotta ponder has he ever been up for a lead in a Spielberg or Tarantino film? Did he ever wanna work with any of the top directing talent in the industry? Most of his films, he's by far more known and powerful than his director.\n\nAny films you'd have loved Denzel to have worked with them on?",

I found the overlapping and simultaneous images in Megalopolis to be genuinely incredible and a spectacle to watch. Same goes for Speed Racer where it breaks down the traditional style of storytelling with its whacky style and beautiful sequences of overlapping settings and characters. \n\nLooking online I\u2019ve seen recommendations like Southland Tales, Under the Silver Lake and The Fountain. What movies spring to mind for you when you think visually crazy/stunning and stick with you?",

        "content": "Hi! Looking for input or advice from anyone who's seen either of these movies. Have to pick one to see open captioned and one to see sans caption. Might be asking prematurely, not sure if either of these have even had limited releases or premieres or whatever yet lol\n\nContext because I love to over-explain: I'm HoH and strongly prefer watching movies with subtitles, but can live without. I do better without them in theaters than without them at home. In most cases if I'm having an issue it's not that I can't hear the noise/voices, but that I can't make out what exactly it is or what they're saying. If your hearing's fine, maybe imagine watching a movie in a theater but also that theater is a plane that's taking off. You might not quite make everything out. \n\nI have a subscription to one of my local theaters so I have to go there. The open caption showings are double booked and another day doesn't work. Between Wolf Man and The Room Next Door, which would one miss more with no captions? I feel like dramas often have characters muttering grimly in a low voice, but horrors can do a lot with nuanced sounds, so it could go either way. I haven't watched trailers or anything for either but I like to go in blind (ha.)\n\nGreatly appreciate any thoughts! I'm going on the 19th.",

        "content": "SOLVED!!! THANK YOU!\n\n\n\nSo I have a specific scene in my head that i remember pretty clearly. There are two guys running from gang bangers, I believe. They make it to a diner with cops inside drinking coffee and they're trying to figure out how to get away. When a tow truck pulls up and one of them goes out and connects the chains to the rear axle on the car. He goes back inside and the both share a cup of coffee taunting the guys in the car. The tow truck driver comes back out and goes to leave and when he does he rips the rear axle from under the car. The cops inside the diner hear it and run outside. The guys in the car have illegal firearms and are arrested and the two guys get away.\n\nThis is the only part of the movie that i can clearly remember. My initial thought was that is was money talks. but after watching a few short clips, i don't believe that's it.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions on what movie I am thinking of? I think it would have been late 90's or early 00's",
