Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

        "content": "I was told by many online and in-person that this film would break me, especially if you related to the story being told. Two years ago around this time, I experienced the most painful breakup I had ever felt in my life. Me and my ex had permanently split lives right after a partial breakup, and it completely destroyed me. A woman who I thought would birth my first child and share many more memories with me suddenly became a stranger and at the time an enemy to me. In the moment, none of our heart felt moments felt like anything. I legitimately remember crying begging God or somebody above to erase any thought I had of her, because for that time then and to this day I have thoughts of her that used to send chills up my spine and give me goosebumps. My heart would drop thinking of the fact she was moving on completely care-free while I was stutter stepping around my life while also having her in the back of my brain at most times. It genuinely upset me how much time and effort I thought about her and how or what I could have done differently to make our lives work together. We were very different people with very different upbringings, but when we made it work it was beautiful. I have never fully forgiven myself for letting her slip away and I think I will forever hold some space for her. After watching this film, it has completely shifted my perspective on the memories we share. I think a very important lesson in this movie to save is that relationships will be extremely ugly, and extremely breath-taking. As humans I feel we like to cling on to negativity, no matter what the ratio is. One awful moment can completely erase 1000 thoughtful acts, and that\u2019s completely fair. There\u2019s no measuring disrespect or hurt, if something hurts you to the point of leaving even after reconsidering, leave. And so what I will take with me from this film is pushing through the ugly is worth it, what\u2019s worth having will take forgiveness, not all great things have great endings, memories are worth keeping even the bad ones, and that we can love the right person at the wrong time. I genuinely wanna thank Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for their amazing performances, if I could give them both a handshake right now I would, but the best I can do is a little more than lengthy reddit post off of a couple drinks. Amazing film that I rented on youtube (i have never rented a film on youtube before), cannot recommend anymore and would love to converse over the film or any topics it touched on\ud83d\udc95 much love ",

It was unapologetic, rough around the edges, and kind of refreshing compared to how careful movies and life are now.\n\nOf course, some parts are over the top like the abusive dad and coaches but it all fits into that era\u2019s gritty honesty. And I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Buttermaker coaching a team of total misfits with a cigar in his mouth and a beer in hand the entire time. Nobody cared, nobody blinked, and somehow it worked.\n\nIt really made me wish I could\u2019ve been part of that generation when people weren\u2019t walking on eggshells about every little thing. All in all, the movie still holds up, and maybe even hits harder as an adult.",

        "content": "I have a personal theory, based solely on acendotal observations, that the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark is the most parodied movie scene of all time. Specifically the part where Indy swaps the golden idol for the bag of sand and then escapes from the boulder. \n\nThe scene is perfect to parody because it's visually memorable (obviously), easy to replicate in other situations and characters, and doesn't involve any dialogue. Even kid shows can parody it since there's nothing too adult about the scene.\n\nNow, I have no way of proving this without watching and cataloging hundreds of hours of film and tv (not to mention comics, video games, etc). That being said, does anyone else agree? \n\nIf not, what scene do you think has been parodied more? Or what scenes are runners up for the title?\n",

Without even thinking, I jumped right in, and we were suddenly in perfect sync, loudly reciting one of cinema\u2019s most intense monologues in the middle of the office.\n\nWe didn\u2019t plan it, we don\u2019t even share the same native language, but for those few seconds, we were just two people connected by a movie. It was oddly wholesome\u2026 and probably very confusing for everyone else around us.",

        "content": "\n\nHonestly, I was quite disappointed. I expected a movie revolving around the cloning plot. Specifically, the idea of two Mickeys existing at the same time due to an error. That would have been a great movie! Instead, what was advertised as the main concept feels like a subplot in the movie. Essentially the entire thing revolves around the intelligent aliens. And then there was also the plot with Mark Ruffalo being an obvious stand in for Trump. But then there was also the subplot with Steven Yuen.\n\nI finished the movie feeling incredibly confused, because how did they mess up the initial concept like this? The idea of a guy who is constantly sent on deadly missions and is revived is an absolutely golden idea. It also leads to an interesting discussion about consciousness and if a copy of you is still really you. But that\u2019s barely even brought up. The whole plot with two versions of Mickey is completely sidelined. Which makes no sense at all. That should have 100% been the main conflict in the movie, like it was advertised as. Instead, we got a mess.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the movie horrible, but I definitely didn\u2019t like it as much as I hoped I would.",

What is the one sound from a movie that would scare the life out of you?

Personally, the T Rex footsteps from Jurassic park would terrify me for the fact that you know what\u2019s coming and there\u2019s not much you can do",

I've seen a lot of negative feedback for that film and just wondering how yall felt about it? I went and saw it twice in a weekend when it came out and its the most fun I've had in theater in like 2 decades. The way they went back to horror rather than an action film is probably what instantly earned my approval. While I realize its not a piece of art in the way something like there will be blood is, its still wildly fun which in my opinion is something that has been missing from movies for a long time now (with exceptions of course). Hell, its been a few months now and i still will just randomly smile thinking about a new *good* alien movie as I enter my 40s lol. Almost makes me emotional haha. Its just the coolest monster design by a country mile for me. The show is a little disjointed but I *love* how animalistic the xeno moves in it but I digress...",
