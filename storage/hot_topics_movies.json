        "content": "*Disowned at birth by his wealthy family, Becket Redfellow will stop at nothing to reclaim his inheritance, no matter how many relatives stand in his way.*\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Glen Powell, Margaret Qualley, Jessica Henwick, Topher Grace, Ed Harris, Zach Woods\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [75%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_make_a_killing_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [55 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-make-a-killing/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/how-to-make-a-killing-glen-powell-a24-review/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;How to Make a Killing has the acuity to know that even if you are willing to play such a rigged game in ruthless fashion, you\u2019ll still lose. The film\u2019s magic trick is taking this bleak idea and knowing how to find the fun in such brutal sport.\n\n[Slash Film - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/2104095/how-to-make-a-killing-review/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Powell's Becket recalls similar upwardly mobile antiheroes like Saul Goodman or Michael Corleone, characters who seem to be living a wish fulfillment of righteousness, only to find themselves trapped by the persona they've built up. It's this aspect which Ford addresses most subtly, ultimately making \"How to Make a Killing\" a cleverly scathing indictment of the American dream as it stands. It's also an impressively multi-layered indictment, too, for while it'd be easy (and rather popular) for Ford to point out how the haves and the have-nots aren't all that different from each other if they were able to switch places, the filmmaker instead leans into the complexity and systemic issues surrounding wealth and success. \"How to Make a Killing\" is a movie that sneaks up on you, and like Becket himself, doesn't simply stab you in the chest or punch you in the gut. Instead, it slowly poisons you, leaving you bewildered by the end as to how sick you and the country you live in has become.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/how-to-make-a-killing-review) \\- 'C'\n\n&gt;At the center of it all is Powell, making the same face for an hour and 45 minutes, too unflappable to root for, too smug to magnetize as an inhuman American Psycho. And *How To Make A Killing* needed to pick a side, either of clownish class comedy or of bitter sociopathic satire. Its split-difference approach certainly racks up a sizable body count, but its most battered and bruised victim is the truism it keeps hitting: In America, there are no consequences for the rich, unless other rich people desire it. That\u2019s almost funny, in an empty and respectable way, like how a *New Yorker* cartoon is almost funny, or how Glen Powell is almost a leading man.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/how-to-make-a-killing/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;As someone who absolutely loves any kind of a crime film, \u201cHow To Make A Killing\u201d can be entertaining at times as a morality play wrapped in designer suits and generational spite. It\u2019s juggling a lot more than it needs to, and it never fully synthesizes its most perceptive ideas, but it\u2019s powered by another star performance from Powell, keeping it barely afloat.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Alexander Mooney](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-john-patton-ford/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;The brittle humanity of Ford\u2019s characters is the key ingredient to his film\u2019s grim sense of irony. In a media landscape replete with hot-button satires and airless farces, *How to Make a Killing*\u2019s rejection of formal frippery and easy caricature is refreshing. Ford cultivates an old-school flair while keeping one finger on the pulse of the current moment, shrewdly retooling the canonical story of a rotten family patronage to comment on a quintessential American birthright: the compulsive desire for individual gain.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-margaret-qualley-1236666029/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s likely that 95 percent of the people who go to see \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d will never have seen, or even heard of, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets,\u201d the 1949 British black comedy it\u2019s a remake of \u2014 or, I should say, a reimagining, since for once that marketing-spin term applies. In its day, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d was wickedly outrageous. But in the age of \u201cDexter\u201d and \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cBeef,\u201d \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d just plays as a patchy amusement. Yet I was held by it; the film\u2019s acrid riffs on the hidden depravity of the new greed culture keep it aloft. And each time Margaret Qualley shows up, she gives the movie a charge, because of how her Julia incarnates money hunger cut off from everything else. Qualley somehow makes that fun, maybe because it\u2019s the one thing in the movie that everyone can agree on.",

        "title": "In \u2018Goodfellas\u2019, is Tommy D. actually humiliated during the \u201cI amuse you?\u201d scene?",
        "content": "Is that scene about a wounded ego, or is it a status check? On the surface, it looks like Tommy gets his feelings hurt. For a second he seems honestly confused, like Henry just called him a clown in front of everyone. But Tommy has clear sociopathic tendencies. He enjoys pushing people to the edge and watching them squirm. Add in his Napoleon complex and it makes even more sense. He\u2019s small, volatile, and obsessed with respect. The sudden switch in tone feels less like insecurity and more like a reminder that he decides when people laugh and when they panic.\n\nAs for Henry, the fear makes sense in that moment because they\u2019re in public and the power dynamic is on display. Tommy\u2019s unpredictable, and everyone at that table knows he\u2019s capable of real violence over something minor(Spider\u2019s killing later in the film). When they torch the Bamboo Lounge together, Henry scolds him because the setting is different. They\u2019re alone, partners in crime, not performing for an audience. Henry isn\u2019t fearless. He just understands when Tommy is posturing and when he\u2019s actually unstable. At the table, with witnesses and pride involved, the risk feels real. \n\nInsight into the real-life Tommy from Pileggi\u2019s \u2018Wiseguy\u2019 made me think about this. It also made me think about Scorsese\u2019s genius at work.  Did he layer the scene in a way that every choice Pesci makes is open to interpretation? Is Tommy actually humiliated for a second, or is he entirely in control, and just running that power check on Henry? Scorsese doesn\u2019t force a single answer. Instead, he lets the tension live in the ambiguity. The fear in Henry is real either way, but the audience is never sure if it\u2019s \u2018cause Tommy\u2019s ego is bruised or because he\u2019s testing who\u2019ll break first.",

        "title": "It's been exactly a year since Gene Hackman passed away - an appreciation post.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/2bamek056akg1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4270296a6386d6bbb710cb13bebc27e9a6d54659\n\nGene Hackman is one of my favorite actors. NGL it broke my heart when I found out few months ago that he passed, and that he did so in such a brutal way.\n\nMr. Hackman is an actor's actor through and though. He didn't have the face of a conventional leading man (who needs that anyway). But he had this rare gift: he brought the seemingly mundane and insignificant to life, via perhaps but most subtle acting one has ever the pleasure to witness. His characters is never black and white (except for the blind monk in \"Young Frankenstein\", jk). They are so complex, often feel extremely intimate and personal (to the point of causing mild disform, but in the best way possible), despite their effort to keep people at arm's length. \"Scarecrow\" with Pacino comes to mind (utterly wrecking).\n\nHe also got is this unique \"smiley eyes\" thing (Ed Norton has it too but not exactly the same). It could convey anything: kindness, ill intention, heartbreaks, or simply a mask stretched over vulnerability.\n\nThis month I've been revisiting his films as a small dedication. Looking at his IMDB, it's breathtaking that the man has got so many near-perfect movies under his belt:\u00a0[The French Connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_(film)),\u00a0[Scarecrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow_(1973_film)),\u00a0[Mississippi Burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Burning),\u00a0[Unforgiven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgiven),\u00a0[The Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firm_(1993_film)),\u00a0[Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Tide_(film)),\u00a0[Under Suspicion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Suspicion_(2000_film))\u00a0(an underrated gem, Gene made the movie IMHO)...\n\nFor this post I'd like to shine the spotlight on perhaps my most favorite, not just of Mr. Hackman's movies, but of all the finest movies ever made.  \nSpoilers ahead.\n\n\"The conversation\"( both Hackman and Coppola's favorite) isn't just being watched (pun intended), it crawls underneath your skin, pitches a tent in your head for days afterward.. much like the way the surveillance case burrows into the protagonist. In our world of incessant and intrusive monitoring, it's arguably more piercing now than it was in '74. But beneath the paranoia and the wiretaps beats the timeless human ache: the urge to shield ourselves from exposure, clashing against the deep, stubborn hunger to truly connect.\n\n&gt;!Hackman gives us Harry Caul, a man who's easy to dislike at first: quiet, yet quietly arrogant at his craft. Infinitely neurotic, paranoid, perpetually teetering on the edge\u2026 only to stumble into disastrous choices whenever his pride or his fragility briefly wins out. Always on the fence.. to the point to pushing the rare few that cared about him away. Oh, and he wore a disposable plastic rain coat when it wasn't raining. Often caught between inner conflicts. Like how he angrily threw that piece of plastic (if anyone could enlighten me as to what it is), walked on for a while, then turned right back to pick it up in metal surrender. Yet all those layers of guardedness and isolation forge an unexpected bond with us viewers.!&lt;  \n&gt;!We've all known loneliness. We've all flinched at the thought of letting someone see too much. And we've all secretly ached for something real, unguarded, authentic.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And when the tape-thief lady banged her head on the hanging metal plate thingie, Harry's instinct first reaction was to check his gadget, lol. Despite his moral objection, after the tapes were stolen he went ahead and collected his pay, then quietly poked around trying to learn the fate of the couple.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!We hear the recording several times throughout the movie. But as the story unveils, the meaning of the dialog has changed (to be fair, throughout Coppola inserted different variations of the same convo recorded by the same actors). By the time the credits rolls, we are left dazed and confused - unsure what's objective reality and what's Harry's fracturing mind conjuring. That trashed apartment.. gutted floorboards, ripped walls, the torn-up virgin Mary figure he cherish so much, mirrors his unraveling psyche perfectly. As much as the movie tries for us not to like Harry, as odd, prickly, and closed-off as he seems, we do feel for him. And It leaves a hollow, echoing hole inside your soul.!&lt;\n\nNo more words.. Just awe.\n\nThank you Gene. Every one of your performances was a ride worth taking.\n\nPls do share your favorite Gene movies/moments.",

But, if you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ll understand it\u2019s not something you can recommend to just anyone. Even the title alone would likely turn some people off.\n\nI chose wisely and recommended it to two people who I thought might appreciate it and got 10/10 responses from both.\n\nWhat are some other films that you enjoyed but feel like you can\u2019t recommend to everyone?",

I dont think anyone, except Walton Goggins, could have pulled off bringing the character to life so unbelievably well from a bunch of words on paper. The guy just has so much range. He managed to be super raciest, extremely tolerant, dumber than a bag of rocks, smart as shit, really mysterious, [funny as hell](https://youtu.be/b2_OqofTZns), [even funnier (\"What's in the chair???\")](https://youtu.be/krxjTwujmFk?t=172), and above all else, [loyal to the very end](https://youtu.be/cwX5syZfWyU). \n\nI just recently read that at the start of filming, Goggins \"only had one question for Quentin: 'Is Mannix really the sheriff of Red Rock? Is that a bluff?' And QT's reply was: 'I need you to figure out the answer and never tell me what it is.' That was all I needed to know. And he never asked. He may be the only person to date who hasn't asked me that.\" Goggins said.\u00a0[Here is the article.](https://www.slashfilm.com/1190522/quentin-tarantino-left-the-answer-to-a-hateful-eight-mystery-up-to-walton-goggins/)\u00a0He 100% should have been nominated for best supporting actor (and won something) for his portrayal of Sheriff (????) Chris Mannix. 10/10, in my opinion, with one of the best ever character arcs as well.",
