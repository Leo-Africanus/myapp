        "title": "Chef brings a smile to my face no matter how many times I watch it. It's my \"comfort food\" of a movie. What is yours?",
        "content": "Chef (2014) is one of those movies I really should have watched a long time ago. So many people recommended it to me, and once I finally did, I just couldn\u2019t stop watching and rewatching it.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m having a boring weekend, feel down, or get that sense like I\u2019ve lost some passion for life, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s watch Chef again.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it, but basically it\u2019s a movie starring and directed by Jon Favreau about a chef who eventually quits his job and starts operating a food truck, and that\u2019s when the movie really becomes fun. From there, it turns into a great road-trip kind of film.\n\nThere are some big names in it like one of my favorite actors Bobby Cannavale, but there's also Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, and Robert Downey Jr. even shows up. But what really sells the movie is the story. It\u2019s a feel-good comedy, maybe not particularly sophisticated, but the message about following your passion (or finding it again, reinventing yourself, not letting problems stop you, rediscovering that inner sense of liveliness and creativity) is so well expressed.\n\nAnd if you like good food or enjoy cooking, you definitely won\u2019t be disappointed. The music is great too, and there\u2019s plenty of it. The whole thing is just so charming and pleasant. It\u2019s become my \"comfort food movie\" as one of my friends says. I guess he means \"comfort movie\" but I'm fine with putting the word food is there cause, you know, it's a film about cooking. Forrest Gump is his \"comfort food movie\" btw. I never connected with Forrest Gump like that. So I guess different strokes....\n\nHave any of you watched Chef and enjoyed it so much that you\u2019ve rewatched it a lot? If not, is there a movie you consider comforting enough to be your \"comfort-food movie\"?\n\nP.S. I seen Favreau in a lot of films but I just really like his character in Chef, just so charming.",

        "content": "*Upon discovering millions in cash in a derelict stash house, trust among a team of Miami cops begins to fray. As outside forces learn about the size of the seizure, everything is called into question -- including who they can rely on.*\n\nDirector: Joe Carnahan\n\nStarring: Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Steven Yeun, Teyana Taylor, Sasha Calle, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Scott Adkins, Kyle Chandler\n\nRelease date: January 16 on Netflix\n\n[Rotten Tomatoes: 82%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_rip)\n\n[Metacritic: 65 ](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-rip/)\n\n[David Rooney - The Hollywood Reporter: 8/10](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-rip-review-matt-damon-ben-affleck-netflix-teyana-taylor-1236474437/)\n\n\"The Rip doesn\u2019t reinvent the cops-in-a-pressure-cooker genre, but its mix of closed-quarters tension, car chases and gunfire gets the job done. Thanks to Carnahan and his accomplished cast, it\u2019s both more convincing and more watchable than the average original streaming movie.\"\n\n[Brian Tallerico - RogerEbert. com: 3/4](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rip-netflix-matt-damon-ben-affleck-movie-review-2026)\n\n\"It's a testament to Joe Carnahan\u2019s direction that there\u2019s not a false note in this talented ensemble.\"\n\n[David Ehrlich - Indiewire: B-](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-rip-netflix-movie-review-ben-affleck-matt-damon-1235173331/)\n\n\"But the most important reason why The Rip is a slight cut above the average streaming fare is the lived-in history that Affleck and Damon bring to their characters\u2019 dynamic.\"\n\n[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/the-rip-review-matt-damon-and-ben-affleck-go-full-action-movie-mayhem-on-netflix/)\n\n\"A rugged affair that\u2019s canny and concussive enough to compensate for a somewhat deflating ending, it proves that its headliners remain cinema\u2019s preeminent BFF duo.\"",

        "content": "It's funny, witty, characters that I found intriguing, some relatable and Jeremy Piven was a charismatic lead. I can never say no to any movie that casts Jessica Walter as an evil college president of the movie. \n\nThe writing is so biting and amusing and I love how it makes fun of everyone, showing how in college various groups are formed which causes more division than unity. \n\nThe movie flopped when it came out but it seems to be a movie that generated a small cult following as the years went by.",

He was as nice and unassuming as he was depicted in the movie.  He seemed very much to be legitimately surprised at the reaction to what he considered to be \"doing his job\".\n\nI thought Clint Eastwood struck the right tone with this movie to not overly dramatize this event but rather let the story play out on its own.",
