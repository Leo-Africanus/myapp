        "content": "I watced a video recently about a Korean war horror movie called R Point, which is about a group of Korean soldiers being sent to find and rescue a group of missing soldiers from a place called R Point during the war...\n\nThey reach the place, and soon weird things begin to happen. A giant factory like building appears out of nowhere one morning, one soldier sees the ghosts of another platoon, while a few American soldiers warn the troop that the place is haunted, and their radio begins to play weird screams...\n\nOne morning, they find one of the members of the troop dead and report it to HQ. But in response they're informed that &gt;! this \"dead troop member\" is actually one of the guys from the missing troop that they were sent to find!&lt; \n\nThe twist isn't grand or whatnot, but it's the way they hide it right in front of the audience that amazed me. For over 50 minutes they showed the twist and nobody could've guessed it. A good example of how atmosphere and execution can make even a predictable twist unpredictable...\n\nWhat are some other plot twists cleverly hidden in plain sight..?",

        "content": "i recently watched 1997's galaxy quest. since i'm a star trek fan, my older relatives have been recommending that i watch this movie for quite some time. i've always heard that galaxy quest was ahead of it's time in it's portrayal of geek culture and i was reluctant when i heard that it was a satire of geek culture. when i hear the words \"satire of geek culture\", i imagine a work that portrays geeks as pathetic man children who take media way too seriously and need to get a life. sure, there's plenty of that in geek culture but that's a minority and not the rule.\n\nhowever, my curiosity finally peaked and i decided to give it a watch. and it's a very funny movie with a fascinating story(even if it is just the plot of three amigos but with a star trek expy). and, despite my fears, the film's portrayal of geek culture is one of my favorite aspects of the film.\n\nlike i said, the film is a satire of geek culture, specifically trekkies. and the film largely portrays geek culture very positively. the geeks in the film are passionate about galaxy quest and knowledgeable about the lore. and, in the end, it's both of those things that end up saving the day. the film also does take lighthearted jabs at geeks, such as mocking the social awkwardness of some nerds and the intense obsession that some of them have. however, as i watched the film, i got the vibe that the filmmakers were laughing WITH me and not AT me. of course, it also helps that i have a pretty thick skin when it comes to jokes at my expense.\n\nif you think about it, the film is less of a satire of geek culture and more of an affectionate parody that's more than willing to make fun of it but is also willing to acknowledge the good parts and that, at the end of the day, geek culture is a good thing.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always really loved Dan Aykroyd. Ever since I saw that cigarette dangle off his lip in Ghostbusters? This dude interested me. \n\nAnd even tho he\u2019s been in more than a few turkeys, he is never not good. But where he really shines is delivering information and exposition. \n\nGhostbusters has made up mythology but the two scenes I LOVE are with him and Winston where he quotes the bible and then when they are in jail and he tell us what the building of Dana is meant for. \n\nEven in a movie like Pearl Harbor. My ex LOVED that frigging movie. And during all the lovey dovey stuff I always thought \u201ccut back to Dan Aykroyd breaking codes!\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the sound of his voice or the way he talks.",

        "title": "Mississipi Burning (1988)",
        "content": "A thriller based on the real-life murder of Civil Rights activists in 1964 Mississipi. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play two FBI agents assigned to a missing persons case. They find themselves in a community terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan. Both agents fight for the truth while butting heads over different tactics to bring the Klan to justice. \n\nThis movie hits home at the moment. What really struck me is some of the language the more bigoted characters use to describe the murder of the activists, e.g. \"they shouldn't have been there in the first place\". Absolutely relevant to what is happening right now. Some of the messages of the movie can come across a bit heavy-handed, but it's necessary given the subject matter. Hackman delivers a knockout performance. Frances McDormand also stars. This film is a goldmine for character actor nerds, featuring R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, Kevin Dunn, Frankie Faison, and Brad Dourif, among others. ",

        "content": "So I just watched Interstellar for the first time, yes I understand it\u2019s 2026, I just now got around to it. I was completely hooked on it, I loved everything about it and was super interested as I\u2019ve always been quite intrigued by physics, however, him in the black hole and everything after that kind of messed it all up for me. My main thing is that, if we see him communicating with his past daughter (and his past self), then wouldn\u2019t this entire thing all just be a loop anyways? He\u2019s communicating with the past, so then that past version of himself would continue on to go on the same journey, and then communicate with ANOTHER past version of himself. I understand that the past watch he tinkered with led his present daughter to solving everything (which I wish we got more of an explanation of), but what about the past daughter he had communicated with? Is that just its own alternate timeline that will lead to the same result? And then also, was the tesseract in the black hole created by a whole other future civilization for the sole purpose of allowing him to communicate with his past daughter, allowing her to save humanity?? So, a future 5 dimensional civilization builds a structure for a past 3 dimensional civilization so that a man can communicate even further into the past to allow for the future existence of their own civilization. Sorry I\u2019m a bit slow.",
