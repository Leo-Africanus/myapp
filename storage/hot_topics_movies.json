        "content": "I was thinking, the other day, after a rewatch of Pulp Fiction that we, collectively as a society, really missed out on a Vega brothers movie that would have been great. Looking at the performances of Michael Madsen and John Travolta in those movies, coupled with Tarantino's storytelling, it makes me kind of sick thinking about what could have been but never was. Just imagining a single scene of those two characters having a chummy interaction with each other makes me tingle a bit.\n\nThis got me thinking about the question I am posing today for you bunch of movie buffs... what do you think is the greatest movie that is known to have been conceived but never got made? What are we worse off for as a media consuming civilization for not getting the pleasure of watching? I will throw my hat in on the never made Vincent and Vic Vega movie, but I haven't really explored too many other options... I leave that to you all.\n\nI request that everyone, before replying, check the existing replies (Ctrl-F search if you have to) to see if your suggestion was recommended, give it a thumbs up, and add your take as a reply. Thank you.",

        "content": "This movie is something special. The cast meshes extremely well. Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn\u2019t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he\u2019s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too.  \n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it\u2019s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. \n\nSome of my favorites lines in this movie:\n\n*lands on ship* \u2026\u2026.Aaaahhhhhhhhhh\n\nWait! Don\u2019t open that! It\u2019s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don\u2019t know!!!\u2026.sniff sniff\u2026seems like there is air\n\nWe have to get out of here before they kill guy!!\n\nGuy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!?!\n\nBesides\u2026..hehehehehe, I just had this really interesting idea. Guy: Are you stoned?\n\nWell screw that!\n\nThe list goes on. If you haven\u2019t seen it, go watch it!!",

I thought the racoons had eaten his legs. I have no idea how I didn't clock he just had little legs, but boy was I absolutely horrified. \n\nI'd love to hear other people's reactions to things in films they completely misinterpreted on first viewing.

For example, Amon Goth constructing the concentration camp and mercilessly killing the engineer who tried to explain an issue is a powerful display of such evil.

        "content": "Saw a similar question on r/television and thought it would be an interesting way to jog our memories about older movies. \n\nI was thinking of *West Side Story* (1961). It doesn\u2019t quite work, as there is one obvious exception. But four out of five lead actors are still with us while being quite up in age:\n\nRichard Beymer (Tony): 86\n\nRuss Tamlyn (Riff): 90\n\nRita Moreno (Anita): 93\n\nGeorge Chakiris (Bernardo): 92\n\nBoth the astronauts from *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968) are still around, but Douglass Rain (the voice of H.A.L.) died a couple years back. Similarly, I\u2019m pretty sure *The Sound of Music* worked for a while until Christopher Plummer passed. \n\n",

        "content": "\\*Minor spoilers ahead\\*\n\nEarlier this week, I was watching the movie \"My Old Ass.\" If you are unfamiliar, the movie has themes of living in the moment. This is something I could admittedly do better at. Specifically, there are two monologues in the film that emphasize \"you never know this is the last time you'll do X.\" \n\nI enjoyed the movie, its themes, and peformances. I was getting ready for bed and thinking about the film in my mind. Maybe 15 minutes after the movie had ended, our baby monitor goes off. I walked into the nursery to replace the pacifier and soothe my kid back to sleep. Then, I connect the dots that this could be the last time I have this kind of moment. I started to weep and really reflect on enjoying these experiences of parenthood. I'm genuinely grateful that the movie made me consider this more closely. \n\nHas anyone else watched and not had an outward response to it intially, but later become emotional when reflecting on that film? If so, what movie had this effect on you?\n\n  \n",
