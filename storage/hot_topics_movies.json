        "title": "Hollywood Is Cranking Out Original Movies. Audiences Aren\u2019t Showing Up.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES\u2014When director Christopher Landon introduced his new thriller, \u201cDrop,\u201d before its premiere at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame, he had a warning for the packed auditorium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard out there for an original movie,\u201d he said, urging everyone who liked the Universal Pictures release to \u201cscream it from the rooftops\u201d and on social media.\n\n\u201cDrop\u201d opened this weekend to an estimated $7.5 million domestically, one of two new movies based on fresh ideas that fizzled at the box office. The other was Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Amateur,\u201d a spy thriller adapted from a little-known 1981 book, which opened to an estimated $15 million.\n\nAfter years of gripes from average moviegoers and Hollywood insiders alike about the seemingly nonstop barrage of sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations of comic books and toys, the film industry placed more bets on original ideas.\n\nThe results have been ugly. \n\nNearly every movie released by a major studio in the past year based on an original script or a little-known book has been a box-office disappointment. Before this weekend\u2019s flops were Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s\u201cMickey 17\u201d and \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d Paramount\u2019s \u201cNovocaine,\u201d Apple\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cRed One,\u201d and the independently financed \u201cHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 1\u201d and \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\n\nJason Blum, who produced \u201cDrop\u201d and built his company Blumhouse largely on original horror franchises, said audiences\u2019 preference for known properties has made it harder to release original movies in theaters, \u201ceven though that\u2019s where some of the most exciting and risky storytelling still lives.\u201d\n\nGetting people into theaters more frequently is a priority for a movie industry still recovering from the pandemic. Box-office revenue in the first three months of this year in the U.S. and Canada was the lowest it has been, excluding the pandemic, since 1996.\n\nAt the CinemaCon industry convention in early April, theater owners said they welcome more original films, but only if they are backed by robust advertising campaigns. Building buzz for a new film in a media environment fractured between YouTube, TikTok, streaming and sports is tough, particularly when it is an unknown title.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening films that have almost zero awareness,\u201d said Bill Barstow, president of Main Street Theatres, a small Nebraska-based chain.\n\nMany consumers are content to wait until an original motion picture is available to rent online a few weeks after its theatrical release or to stream on a service like Netflix in a few months.\n\nThe only films succeeding in the current environment are those with built-in audiences, like \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which was released in early April and has grossed more than $280 million domestically. And these days, even franchises can be far from a sure thing. Long-running series such as Marvel and DC superheroes and live-action remakes of Disney animated classics are showing their age and proving unreliable at the box office.\n\nStudios say they have little choice but to make more original movies they hope will buck the odds.\n\n\u201cTelling original stories and taking risks is the only path toward creating new global franchises,\u201d Bill Damaschke, Warner Bros.\u2019 head of animation, said at CinemaCon.\n\nSome of the increase in original film releases is attributable to Amazon and Apple, which are building film businesses with few well-established franchises. One of the biggest bets on an original film from any company this year is Apple\u2019s \u201cF1,\u201d a June release starring Brad Pitt as a race-car driver.\n\nAmazon hyped 11 coming movies to exhibitors at CinemaCon, of which six were originals. Among traditional studios, Warner Bros. is taking the most risks on originals, with big budget films from directors Paul Thomas Anderson and Maggie Gyllenhaal. \n\nHollywood\u2019s next original release comes Friday with Warner\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d a horror movie starring Michael B. Jordan. Next month even Marvel, home to Hollywood\u2019s biggest franchises, is taking a gamble with \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d about a super team brand new to all but the most devoted comic-book readers.",

        "title": "An appreciation for the dying art of practical Blood Squibs. There\u2019s just something different about them. It\u2019s one of the last things I feel CGi hasn\u2019t been able to replicate 100% correct. What are some of the greatest blood squib effects in film?",
        "content": "I love blood squibs. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, these are practical blood packs put on an actor or stunt person to simulate bullet hits. Are they realistic? No. But there is something visceral and cool about them. And they are becoming a lost art. \n\nYou can see why CGI blood hits have taken over. Blood squibs take ALOT OF TIME. There\u2019s the rigging, the safety, the clean up. There\u2019s none of that with digital. Add it in post and you are good to go. There\u2019s way more control with digital. Far more safety.  \n\nImagine blowing a take during the final big shootout of Django Unchained? Those were legit blood squibs. And the room\u2019s walls are painted red. The clean up to start again? Hours. That\u2019s a lot of $. \n\nBut for some reason, unless there\u2019s an example I don\u2019t know about, I haven\u2019t seen CGI replicate what a blood squib does. With CGI you get the red mist, but I don\u2019t see the chunks or clothing. There\u2019s a look to squib hits. And I\u2019m sure cgi maybe could get it exact if they really tried, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s treated as seriously or something important enough to spend precious R&amp;D time on. \n\nBut I also think squibs affect the actors performance. Think of Al Pacino in Scarface. You feel those bullet hits and his body reacts to them. There\u2019s a physical reaction the actors have. When you watch John Wick and John is blasting these guys left, right and centre, you don\u2019t see the actors reacting to them too much. And look I love those movies. But the bullet hits don\u2019t have much of an impact. It\u2019s not visceral. \n\n\n Of course digital makes it easier to remove for ratings. Look at Die Hard 4. Released as PG13 and got an unrated cut for dvd. They added the blood in digitally and it looks awful.  Same many of the \u201cunrated\u201d cuts of movies that originally had PG13 ratings. Awful blood hits. It\u2019s like they all use the same digital file to render the blood. \n\n So you can see why it\u2019s dying. For a filmmaker to use legit blood squibs in today\u2019s filmmaking world? I feel that needs to be celebrated. Because everything is going against you. Time, money, and yes safety. To set off a blood pack is requires a small explosive charge. They can hurt.\n\nWhen I watch John Wick 1-4, or the Deadpool movies, I\u2019m hoping for some legit blood squib action. \n\nSo. In celebration of practical blood squibs, What are your favourite blood hits in cinema? I already mentioned Django Unchained. What else? \n\nBad Boys 2 has some great squib work. In the opening scene especially. \n\nPredator 1 &amp; 2? Jesse Ventura\u2019s death is *chefs kiss*. Total Recall has some beauties. \n\nOf course one of the GOAT\u2019s and one of the first major uses of a squib was in Godfather. The when Michael avenges his father\u2019s death. Man. The hang time of that blood in the air is beautiful. In fact Godfather has a few great blood sequences. Sonny\u2019s death is amazing. His body must have been riddled with squibs(I think they even get his face)",

        "content": "First Time posting here, and I just wanted to ask everyone's opinions about the above mentioned film, I will abbreviate to DBS for the rest of this post. In my own humble opinion this movie never gets the recognition it truly deserved, I have always been a fan of creature features and general shark movies, and I have to say personally I would rate this movie at least 2nd in the shark genre, it's fun, the actings on point, and the sharks actually look realistic, another thing I feel they did very well, was make the point, sharks are not like this, these aren't normal, so it didn't give sharks a bad name, they used a relatively unknown breed of shark with mako, and the premise was genuinely believable (to a degree) and for some reason, it never really gets a mention, and very few people I know have actually heard of it?\nAll that being said, the score of the sharks theme is also spine tingling and eerie, and it could have gone on to have a good sequel if they would have kept the graphics and effects what they were (we won't discuss DBS2 here) Honestly it had its flaws, what movie doesn't, but I'm genuinely curious, Deep Blue Sea, bad movie? Or underrated?",

Film.\n\nI grew up in a \"movie family,\" with my dad quoting both famous and obscure films left and right throughout my childhood. He quoted this one *a lot* (specifically, \"I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating\"). Those quotes often led to the realization that his delivery sometimes was considerably better than the reality of whatever movie he was quoting, LOL\n\nThis, this right here, is the #1 exception. \n\nWhen I finally sat down and watched it at 16 or 17 (early aughts), I remember being blown away. This is one of the only movies that has retained that wonder for me over 20+ years now - I turn 40 this year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't absolutely valid criticisms. There are. But this post is just about appreciating a film where, IMHO, the actors and the script and the cinematography are all nearly perfect.\n\nAnd the LINES. Just... I could quote this film forever. Which is wild because the script is in itself pretty sparse.\n\n\"I CAN'T SWIM!\"\n\"Who ARE those guys?\"\n\"You just keep thinkin', Butch, that's what you're good at.\"\n\"Rules! In a knife fight?!\"\n\"I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman...\"\n\nI know I'm not the only one who HEARS THEIR VOICES reading those, right?\n\nAll right, I'm done. Back to the movie. \ud83e\udd70",
