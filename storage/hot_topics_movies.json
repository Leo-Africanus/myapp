I dont think anyone, except Walton Goggins, could have pulled off bringing the character to life so unbelievably well from a bunch of words on paper. The guy just has so much range. He managed to be super raciest, extremely tolerant, dumber than a bag of rocks, smart as shit, really mysterious, [funny as hell](https://youtu.be/b2_OqofTZns), [even funnier (\"What's in the chair???\")](https://youtu.be/krxjTwujmFk?t=172), and above all else, [loyal to the very end](https://youtu.be/cwX5syZfWyU). \n\nI just recently read that at the start of filming, Goggins \"only had one question for Quentin: 'Is Mannix really the sheriff of Red Rock? Is that a bluff?' And QT's reply was: 'I need you to figure out the answer and never tell me what it is.' That was all I needed to know. And he never asked. He may be the only person to date who hasn't asked me that.\" Goggins said.\u00a0[Here is the article.](https://www.slashfilm.com/1190522/quentin-tarantino-left-the-answer-to-a-hateful-eight-mystery-up-to-walton-goggins/)\u00a0He 100% should have been nominated for best supporting actor (and won something) for his portrayal of Sheriff (????) Chris Mannix. 10/10, in my opinion, with one of the best ever character arcs as well.",

But at the emd of the movie, one small detail just made me really appreciate the effort put into the film so much more.\n\nAs the truck is driving away, we can see a few street lights with christmas wreaths and garland hanging on them. This brought me back to the beginning of the film which clearly happened around the holidays. Some nine months later, when the end of the movie takes place about 9 months later, of course no one took the time to take down the holiday decorations in this post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nA completely inconsequential detail that could easily have been overlooked. Instead, it called back to the beginning of the movie and really added to the atmosphere of the film as a whole. A small detail that just shone brightly and made a huge impact on my perception of the film as a whole.\n\nAre there any other examples like this that spring to mind?",

Showing the regret and consequences from both her infidelity and his womanizing is honestly very nice to see in a more modern movie, at least modern enough to be apart of the \"cheating and divorce is good\" culture as seen far to often.\n\nAnd the B plot of a playboy who seems to have it all together who sleeps around constantly cause it brings \"happiness\", only to see how once he truly falls in love he realizes and admits he's been lying to himself and everyone around him too... that was a good touch too. \n\n  \nOverall its just nice to see that divorce and sleeping around isnt the answer to happiness. 10/10 movie, would recommend ",

Just too good of overall energy.\u00a0\n\nAlso characters in this movie acts so smart and has very good awareness of situation, which is hard to find in this type of movies.\u00a0\n\nThere is always a scene where some scientists or a smart character tries to explain a plan to group. In other movies others characters just brush it off or don't believe in. Here's before finishing the explaining the situation to our main leads. He just straight up says, we believe you. My God that's just \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. I loved that scene. That's how you survive in these types of movies.\u00a0\n\nThe landscape and music sets the tone of the movie so good. Very beautiful mountain scenery and all. The chemistry in characters is so good. I can't even control my excitement while writing it. It's in my top 4 now.\u00a0",

Ape movies manage to be entertaining and mind bending as they delve into the nature of man and accomplish this unlike any other film franchise.\n\nAny writer worth their chops would kill for a story that is as fun and as deep.\n\nTop tier franchise.",
