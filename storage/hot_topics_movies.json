How many rewrites and add-ons go these scripts through and how many people throw in a few more puns during writing and filming.",

Like the anticipation of a roller coaster climbing, waiting for the drop. \n\nWind River is one that comes to mind, but there was a bit of levity in it with how good the chemistry between Olsen and Renner was. I prefer something that really doesn\u2019t let up and wants you to feel as miserable and scared as the characters do. \n\nBasically the same atmosphere of the basement scene in Zodiac, but for 90 minutes straight. Anything that can scratch that itch?\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "And this is coming from someone who isn't even a Transformers fan. IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).\n\nTrailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.\n\nAfter having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.\n\nSadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. \n\nOne way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.\n\nBy no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. \n\nBut overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, this might sound harsh but whoever done the marketing and trailer deserves to be fired. Whoever you were, you ended up dooming this amazing movie to fail.\n\nP.S.: I didn't think Brian Tyrian Lee of all people could have pulled off a great Megatron.",

        "content": "So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.\n\nThere's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.\n\nThere's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.\n\nIf you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. I'm trying to avoid giving anything away because I do feel as though it's best experienced mostly cold, but I also expect it'll only be in theaters for another few days. ",

        "content": "[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MnOG-sHz4U)\n\nHow do I describe this film?  Okay, imagine if, rather than an animated film about animals, *Flow* (2024) was a live-action film about androids.  Now imagine that it was co-directed by Michel Gondry and Darren Aronofsky and give it a steampunk aesthetic.  That's *Myth of Man*.  But this description does not do this beautiful film justice.  I believe that Jamin Winans' *Myth of Man* represents the reason that human beings still make movies -- the hope and possibility that we might still capture a truly unique and mesmerizing vision on film.  And *Myth of Man* is *truly* mesmerizing.  Try to see this film.",

The fact no one else around me enjoyed the trailer as much as me should\u2019ve been the first and only sign not to include others in that fever dream. \n I still enjoyed the movie tho.",

        "content": "A recent strange phenomenon is how Hollywood goes out of its way to hide the fact that musicals are musicals in the marketing. The trailers won't show any of the characters singing and will make it look like it's a normal movie. The reason for this seems to be that marketing teams know that some people don't like musicals, so they think they can get them to buy a ticket by tricking them into thinking a musical is not a musical and I guess hope that they won't bother doing any research beforehand. Wonka and Mean Girls are some recent examples of this.\n\nBut Hollywood does this kind of deceitful marketing all the time. Most infamously, the movie [Kangaroo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyLeUjuT_k)'s marketing made it look like a fun family movie with a talking kangaroo that raps, but in reality it's a comedic crime movie for adults and the kangaroo barely appears and only talks in one scene where a character is hallucinating. In fact, the movie was originally R-Rated and was going to be called Down and Under, but then was retitled and edited to a PG rating by producers because the kangaroo scene was the only think test audiences liked.\n\nSo what other movie marketing campaigns tried to basically trick audiences into thinking that the movie was going to be about something else or even of a different genre?",

It\u2019s always fun to see returning cast members, but doesn\u2019t seem like they always know how to use them in an organic way that serves the story. A legacy sequel is one that is a soft reboot of an older series that features at least one cast member from the original, so something like Twisters doesn\u2019t really count in my book. \n\nMy groupings:\n\nGood:\n\n- Scream 5\n\n- Axel F\n\n- Blade Runner 2049\n\n- Top Gun: Maverick \n\nMid:\n\n- Force Awakens\n\n- Ghostbusters: Afterlife \n\n- Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music\n\n- Beetlejuice Beetlejuice \n\nHorrible:\n\n- Coming 2 America\n\n- The Matrix Resurrections\n\n- Jurassic World: Dominion (technically a sequel to a reboot but since it featured the original cast, I\u2019m including it)\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Ok I know I'm 7 years late, but I finally just watched Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. I was absolutely blown away by the visuals as well as the acting by the main character Rohan Chand (at just 14 years old).  I was shocked to find out it was made in 2018, I feel like the visuals are above and beyond much of what I see from movies made today in 2025. And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I'd ever normally expect from an actor that age. \n\nOf course there was massive departure from the \"original\" story, but that didn't bother me at all, it's its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. \n\nThe only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn't do justice to their nostalgia for the \"original(s)\". \n\nThe few reviewers who mentioned uncanny valley also baffle me.  I'm as adverse as the next guy to poorly animated humans and other creatures who speak, but I felt none of that in Mowgli. The animals with speech were remarkably believable and relatable. \n\nI searched and read threads on reddit from just after it came out, and most seemed to share the same criticisms as the critics, but I'm curious if that is still the consensus?\n\nThose who loved, and loathed, this wonderful movie, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions.
