Unfortunately I don't always have friends or family that want to join but I've always felt too socially uncomfortable to go by myself as I feel people will judge me.\n\nI just recently decided I should give it a try and man am I happy I did. Some movies are great to watch with friends, but sometimes it's awesome to be able to fully focus and engage with a film without being distracted by others, especially at the theatre. Most recently I went to catch the re-release of Interstellar in 70mm on my own and it was genuinely one of the best movie theatre experiences I've ever had. \n\nLong story short, if you've ever held back on going to a see a film alone, do yourself a favor and go to the movies on your own you won't regret it. Nobody is judging you!",

The father and son relationship reminds me so much of my husband and his dad. They have a wonderful relationship of friendship, respect, playfulness and love. Whenever my husband is out of town and I\u2019m missing him, I watch this movie and I\u2019ve only just realized it\u2019s because it reminds me of him in a way. \n\nWe have 2 daughters and while he won\u2019t have the son and father relationship, I know he will have the same silly and playful relationship with them rooted in love.\n\n\nSorry that was a lot! lol \n\n\nWhat movie reminds you of family?",

It doesn\u2019t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can\u2019t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn\u2019t waste my time. \n\nFrom there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn\u2019t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I\u2019m glad they gave Rocky\u2019s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.\n\nI\u2019ve also just finished all the Rambo movies, and just finished the first Creed movie. All of this is to say that the Rocky movies kick ass and I\u2019m mad at myself for not watching them sooner. ",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/yicntwi7lq6e1.png?width=219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4058b385363489b27ba3d34b8e628fe804990207\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a7q1fr9lq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d5e104f8f85d119d971b127d6b9177902447d2\n\nWilliam Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb\n\n\n\nBut much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the \u00a0sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207\n\nCharacters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.\n\nIt is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.\n\nAnd it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",

        "title": "With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.",
        "content": "I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as \u201ccasuals\u201d or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).\n\n\n\nI knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.\n\n\n\nThen there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will \u201ccasuals\u201d who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?\n\n\n\nAI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.\n\n",

If you don\u2019t at least get choked up at this movie, what is wrong with you.\n\nTo some degree it\u2019s almost gratuitously sad, like manipulatively sad. It hits you from every potential angle, poking and prodding until it finds the thing that hits you hardest and then it just hammers it over and over and over. Every moment of levity (of which there are many, it\u2019s actually a pretty funny movie!) serving only to crush you even harder later on.\n\nAnd the ending, so bittersweet. Nobody gets \u201cfixed\u201d, Lee doesn\u2019t stop drinking, it\u2019s just the most minor of victories wherein these two troubled people resolve to spend more time together. But still so sweet, so nice, such a small but warm light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nReally, really, really good",
