        "content": "Hey r/movies! We're Freddie Gibbs and Ryan Prows, here to answer your questions. \n\nSome info about us:\n\n&gt;Freddie Gibbs is an American rapper who has made a name for himself with a series of self-released mixtapes throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. Following his first properly distributed release, the Str8 Killa EP (2010), he began releasing proper studio albums, including the well-received Madlib collaboration Pi\u00f1ata (2014), Shadow of a Doubt (2015), and You Only Live 2wice (2017). After he issued the commercial mixtape Freddie (2018), he reunited with Madlib for Bandana (2019), and with the Alchemist cooked up Alfredo (2020). The latter became his first LP to crack the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and subsequently earned a Grammy Award nomination.\n\n\n\n&gt;Ryan Prows is an American filmmaker. He won a Student Academy Award for his AFI thesis film NARCOCORRIDO, and his cult debut feature film LOWLIFE (2017) was hailed by audiences and critics alike as \"a seriously nasty treat\". He also directed a segment for \"V/H/S/94\" (2021).\n\nWe worked together on NIGHT PATROL. \n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J\\_pMGZScB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J_pMGZScB8)\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nAn LAPD officer discovers a police task force is harbouring a horrific secret that endangers residents of the housing projects he grew up in.\n\n**Cast:** \n\nJermaine Fowler, Justin Long, Freddie Gibbs, RJ Cyler, YG, Nicki Micheaux, Flying Lotus, CM Punk, and Dermot Mulroney.\n\nIt's out in theaters starting this weekend via Shudder!\n\nAsk us anything. We'll be back at 1 PM PT/4 PM ET today (Wednesday 1/14) to answer your questions.",

He clearly struggles with who was and who is now and genuinely feels uncomfortable being a killer.  But after being triggered by his friend Ned is killed by Little Bill and hung onside the saloon. \n\nWas anybody else this impacted by this movie?  And did you find any movies (action movies) that you feel equaled or surpassed this movie?",

Not just \u201ca drink,\u201d but a specific cocktail you can clearly identify on screen.\n\nScenes where the glass, the ice, the pour, the color all register and suddenly you're thirsting for *that exact drink*, not just alcohol in general.\n\nWhat movie scene and what cocktail did that for you?\n\n  \n\\*Edit: Also, TV shows! Not just movie scenes!",

        "content": "I thought this movie will be simple serial killer stuff. Rich guy, secret life, cops chasing him, done. But nah\u2026 it slowly messes with your head.\nBrooks doesn\u2019t act crazy. That\u2019s the scary part. He\u2019s calm, polite, family man. Then he kills like it\u2019s just another task. No emotion. The voice in his head keeps talking, pushing him, judging him. Feels like his real self arguing with him all the time.\n\nThe movie is slow but heavy. Not boring slow, just uncomfortable slow. Like you\u2019re sitting inside his mind and can\u2019t leave.\n\n\nThe daughter part really hit me. When FBI questions her and Brooks starts crying\u2026 that scene felt real. He\u2019s not scared of police. He\u2019s scared because he thinks he ruined his kid. Like \u201cI\u2019m sick\u2026 and now maybe she is too because of me.\u201d\nEnding is dark as hell. \n\nNo happy ending. No cure. He kills that inner voice, not to become good, but because he accepts who he is. And that last feeling with the daughter\u2026 it\u2019s quiet but disturbing. Makes you think the cycle won\u2019t stop... ",

So curious who people think the best villain in standalone/non franchise films is. My personal pick would have to be Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Daniel Day Lewis turns that character into someone you can\u2019t take your eyes off of. ",

And yeah, it's fun. I'm not complaining. I'm just curious about a more grounded approach. Off the top of my head, the only cases I can think of where the old badass is actually, visibly hampered is Harry Brown and Rambo: Last Blood. And Rocky Balboa, though he did all that willingly and it was just a boxing match.",
