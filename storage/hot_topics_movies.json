        "title": "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever felt this disturbed by a film before (Hereditary)",
        "content": "So I\u2019ve seen my fair share of horror films but I just watched Hereditary for the first time and it might be the first one that genuinely\u00a0*got*\u00a0to me. I felt weirdly shaken by it - not scared, but unsettled on some deeper level. Some scenes were so horrific I didn\u2019t even realise I was squeezing/clenching my hands until they ended. And I even unexpectedly started crying in the final 10 minutes, not out of sadness but more like something closer to dread. I literally felt off afterwards and didn\u2019t want to go to sleep for a while.\u00a0\n\nAt first I rated it 4.5 stars because it was good but I never really wanted to think about it again - but then I\u00a0*did*\u00a0start thinking about it again. And things started clicking.\n\n**Spoilers below:**\n\nAt first, the history of Annie\u2019s family just seemed like a dark family backstory: her father starved himself, her brother took his own life, and both were labelled schizophrenic. I initially assumed this was just background context, sad but not exactly plot-relevant, but by the end of the film I realised they weren\u2019t just tragic footnotes - they were likely\u00a0*failed vessels*\u00a0for Paimon. Annie\u2019s mother, Ellen, wasn\u2019t simply difficult or estranged - she was a long-time cult member, hell-bent on summoning a demon. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that she tried (and failed) to use her husband and son first. Her husband deliberately starving himself becomes more than just an act of despair or mental illness when you consider that Paimon prefers \u2018healthy male hosts\u2019. Similarly, her son hanging himself in her room after claiming\u00a0*\u201cShe was trying to put people inside me\u201d*\u00a0 wasn\u2019t simply a mental breakdown. It was an act of resistance.\u00a0\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, she turned her attention to the next generation - hence her sudden reappearance in Annie\u2019s life and insistence that she give birth to Peter,\u00a0*the next male in the bloodline*. But Annie\u2019s refusal to let her back in only lasted until the birth of Charlie, at which point she took control and practically raised the child, which heavily implies that Ellen had been planning for Charlie to be Paimon\u2019s host - expecting a male - but when Charlie was born a girl, she went ahead anyway. This led to what was probably her first semi-successful attempt, and explains so much about Charlie\u2019s eerie behaviour (her unsettling nature, the clicking sounds, how she was rather odd for a young girl), because Charlie was never really Charlie - she was always just a vessel for Paimon, waiting. But Paimon\u00a0*prefers male bodies*\u00a0(as Joan says), so Charlie\u2019s form was never meant to last. Her death was never just random or for shock value, it was a ritual -\u00a0*\u201cWe have corrected your first female body.\u201d*\n\nCue Peter.\u00a0\n\nThe entire film builds toward his possession with an unbearable, creeping sense of inevitability. What first seems like a chaotic sequence of family tragedies slowly reveals itself to be something far worse: an orchestrated series of events designed solely to break him down emotionally and spiritually and bring him to his most vulnerable state, ready for Paimon to take control. Every family member\u2019s fate - from Charlie\u2019s decapitation to Annie\u2019s unraveling to Steve\u2019s sudden death - was part of a dark lineage passed down like an evil heirloom.\n\n\u200b\u200bThat\u2019s what makes Hereditary so disturbing. It doesn\u2019t rely on senseless gore or cheap jump scares to get under your skin. Instead its horror is slow, psychological, and brutally personal. It\u2019s about the things you can\u2019t outrun - not just demons or possession, but lineage, inevitability, and being born into something you can't escape. Every character\u2019s doom feels prewritten, every scene purposeful. That\u2019s what hit me so hard: the sense that these people were\u00a0*never*\u00a0free. That they were cursed not by any true fault of their own, but by blood.\n\nBy the end, it all comes together. The final treehouse coronation scene makes everything else fall into place: the decapitations of \\*just\\* the female worshipers that were used as vessels then discarded, the cult\u2019s twisted fixation on Peter, the inescapable curse of inherited fate, and the way every family member's tragedy served the same dark purpose.\n\nTo sum up, Hereditary was horrifyingly brilliant in a way few horror films are. I may not have loved watching Hereditary, but I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since. And that, to me, is the mark of something truly unforgettable. Final rating: 5 stars.\n\nAlso as for why Ellen was so dead set on using her own family as pawns in her evil plot, I\u2019m not entirely sure. Perhaps it was because their bloodline already had some sort of unholy tie to the supernatural. Or perhaps she simply just wanted the honour of knowing it was her own flesh and blood that was responsible for hosting the demon she worshipped. Either way\u2026 wtf. (I cannot wait to rewatch this at some point in the future and notice all the extra little details I may have missed the first time round!)\n\n  \n**Edit: Wow, I genuinely didn\u2019t expect so many people to engage so thoughtfully with my writeup - 160+ comments and counting!**\n\n**I watched Hereditary for the first time last night and wasn\u2019t even planning to unpack it, but it haunted me so deeply I couldn\u2019t stop thinking - and writing - about it. Hearing that it helped things 'click' for some of you or gave a new emotional angle to revisit the film with has genuinely meant a lot. Whether you loved it, hated it, or were left somewhere in between, hearing all your perspectives has added so many new layers to how I understand the film.**\n\n**Huge thanks to everyone who's taken the time to read, respond, share their thoughts, interpretations, and even personal reflections - it\u2019s made the whole experience feel way more interesting and alive! I\u2019ll keep responding to as many comments as I can because I\u2019m really enjoying the conversation \u2014 but just wanted to pause and say a quick thank you here too :))**",

Thank you for all the suggestions! I definitely won't get to all of them but I'll keep the list for the future. For now, I'll watch Predestination as it's popped up a few times.",

        "content": "He\u2019s not the villain. He\u2019s the grandfather. The dreamer. The face of wonder.\n\nBut rewatching *Jurassic Park*, I was struck by how softly the film lands on Hammond\u2019s choices. There\u2019s early critique, Ellie\u2019s speech, Malcolm\u2019s warning, but by the end, he\u2019s grieving a lost dream, not facing consequences.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needed to be the villain. But it\u2019s fascinating how the story wraps systemic failure in nostalgia, and leaves us mourning *with* him.\n\nIs that emotional sleight of hand? Or just good character work?\n\nCurious what others think.",

Watching the scene where Indy and Short Round get stuck in the trap, small character moment I saw was Indy has a moment to escape after the first door closes but stops himself as the second door is closing. There isn\u2019t enough time to escape but he stops himself to try and get Short Round through, realizes there isn\u2019t enough time and they both end up stuck in the trap.\nI thought it was a very positive character moment for Indy, even though it is a dangerous situation, he doesn\u2019t forget about Short Round. What do you all think, and does anyone else have a small character moment that stands out for them?",
