        "content": "*Wealthy businessman, Zsa-zsa Korda appoints his only daughter, a nun, as sole heir to his estate. As Korda embarks on a new enterprise, they soon become the target of scheming tycoons, foreign terrorists, and determined assassins.*\n\nCast: Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Riz Ahmed, Truman Hanks, Steve Park, Scott Shepherd, Willem Dafoe\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [83%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_phoenician_scheme)\n\n**Metacritic:** [71/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-phoenician-scheme/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Standard - Jo-Ann Titmarsh](https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-andersons-film-just-doesn-t-soar-b1228420.html)\n\n&gt;As with many of Anderson\u2019s films, there is a lot to look at: there are ingenious set designs and costumes, a meticulous attention to the minutest detail. And there are some nice touches, such as Liesl\u2019s \u2018jewel-encrusted rosary as she gradually eschews her calling and embraces secular life. \u2018You could still believe in God if you want,\u2019 says her father. Whether that is enough to keep you on board for the 105 minutes of Wes Anderson\u2019s latest venture (which he also wrote and produced), appearing in Cannes in competition, probably depends on how much you love Anderson\u2019s oeuvre and how forgiving you are of his flimsy tales.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyarkye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson-benicio-del-toro-1236220124/)\n\n&gt;As with all Anderson films, *The Phoenician Scheme* boasts an enchanting world in which viewers can get lost. The director shows off his meticulous attention to detail and symmetrical composition, as well as a muted and moody color grading that serves as a steady reminder of the film\u2019s darker themes. Collaborating again with Roman Coppola (*Asteroid City*) on the story, Anderson constructs one of his most complicated narratives yet.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson-1235124323/) \\- B-\n\n&gt;Unburdened by the depth that has allowed earlier work like \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d and \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited\u201d to resonate for decades on end (even as it\u2019s saddled with twice the texture), \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is free to focus all of its attention on the simple idea that family is the richest inheritance that anyone could ever hope to receive or pass down, even if some people \u2014 fathers most of all \u2014 usually have to lose everything else before they can learn to appreciate its value. \u201cPlanning doesn\u2019t matter, Zsa-zsa says, \u201cwhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d It\u2019s a strange thing to hear towards the end of an Anderson film that\u2019s been too obsessed with the planning stage to meaningfully devote itself to *anything*, but \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is a movie with its heart in the right place, and a souvenir hand grenade within arm\u2019s reach just in case it\u2019s needed.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson-1236402578/)\n\n&gt;Less conceptually quirky than the eccentric auteur\u2019s recent \u201cAsteroid City\u201d (with its layered film-within-a-stage-rehearsal-within-a-\u201cPlayhouse 90\u201d-esque-TV-special meta-framing), but no less profound, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d once again finds Anderson incorporating existential matters into a seemingly satirical form. Not a frame goes by without myriad comedic details to tickle his audience, and yet beneath it all, the director dares to confront questions of mortality.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/05/the-phoenician-scheme-review-benicio-del-toro-hilariously-dominates-wes-andersons-latest-cannes-film-festival-1236401800/)\n\n&gt;The film belongs lock stock and barrel to Del Toro, playing this Onassis-style billionaire who proves again to be so adept to the rhythms of Anderson\u2019s dialogue and delivers flawlessly here, as does newcomer Threapleton as Liesl, and Cera, a newcomer to Anderson\u2019s stock company who will undoubtedly be asked back. Ahmed and Cumberbatch are also welcome additions,as is regular Richard Ayoade as a terrorist leader. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as popups along the way with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day\u2019s work.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-phoenician-scheme/) \\- 6/10\n\n&gt;While those expecting typical Wes Anderson fare will likely get what they came for with \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d there\u2019s no denying the director has provided more substantial efforts with poignant and memorable results. Certain aspects, such as the crafts and the performances from Cera and Threapleton, are striking all the right qualities to make this another Anderson outing worth examining. But outside of the shenanigans and the surface-level reading of a lack of religion in a dishonest man\u2019s life, there isn\u2019t as much to pry into here compared to \u201cThe\u00a0Grand\u00a0Budapest\u00a0Hotel\u201d or \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Much like Tarantino, Scorsese, Lynch, or any other revered filmmaker, opinions may differ from person to person regarding their favorite Wes Anderson film and how they would rank his work.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson/)\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is a serious work of art that plays like a boondoggle. Anderson could be accused of copping out of making a decision to choose between God and, you know, owning stuff, but I think he finds that there\u2019s a bit of spirituality in all of us that can\u2019t be ignored, and a desire to relish in life\u2019s little indulgences as well, and that the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Del Toro hasn\u2019t had a role this juicy in ages, and he\u2019s captivating at all times. Mia Threapleton is hitting all the right notes as well, spending much of the film with a wallflower entomologist named Bj\u00f8rn, played by Michael Cera (who is, predictably, a natural vessel for Anderson\u2019s sensibilities). They seem destined to fall, well maybe not in love, but perhaps in laconic mutual interest. Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Mathieu Amalric, Richard Ayoade and Benedict Cumberbatch all get their own delightful moments, and the list of cameos is as long as your arm, depending of course on the typeface and font size.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-phoenician-scheme-review-benicio-del-toro-and-wes-anderson-unite-for-espionage-comedy-drama/5204703.article)\n\n&gt;Del Toro makes for an enigmatic Korda, one of Europe\u2019s richest men who will discover the limits of his power. The actor\u2019s droll performance amuses, but the character never really surprises or taps into something deeper about the immoral capitalists who have plundered the globe for their own profit. Del Toro shares a wry, prickly rapport with Threapleton, but Liesl feels similarly underdeveloped. And *The Phoenician Scheme*\u2019s wealth of stellar supporting players only get scant screen time, with few managing to shine. That said, Cera, a newcomer to Anderson\u2019s acting stable, acquits himself nicely as Korda\u2019s ineffectual Norwegian helpmate who begins to pine for this aloof nun. He plugs into the filmmaker\u2019s deadpan style, but he can\u2019t fully enliven it.\n\n[BBC - Nicholas Barber](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250518-the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson-takes-his-quirkiness-to-a-whole-new-level) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Some directors boast that they make the films that they want to see, and they don't care about pleasing anyone else. In the case of The Phoenician Scheme, it feels as if Anderson and his team were enjoying it more than audiences ever will. It's one of the ironies of Anderson's films: in many respects they are planned with obsessive attention to detail, and yet the plot of The Phoenician Scheme could have been scribbled on the back of the envelope in the small hours of the morning. It's good fun, but unless your tolerance for the director's idiosyncrasies is stratospherically high, the chances are that the story will seem too random for you to care about by the halfway point.\n\n",

        "content": "I remember that night very well actually. I was playing video games with my friends, but decided to relax before bed and threw on Netflix at around 1am, May 30th 2021. That's when I saw Bo Burnhams \"Inside\" on the front title screen, ready to  go. I thought, perfect, I loved Bo and I can't wait to zone out and hit the hay. \n\nHoly fuck was I not prepared for that Covid Special. I was sitting straight up and at attention the whole time like a pre-teen watching their first porno. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen if I wanted to. It was exactly the movie/special I needed to see a year into the pandemic. The emotion, progression, and cinematography were unreal. I went to work the next day and couldn't help myself from talking to every person about the show. They had to see it. \n\nAnd now almost 4 years layer to the day, this special takes me back to a time where the whole world was scared out of their mind. An entire younger generation was stuck in time because they couldn't develop socially. \n\nAll I know is, if someone in the far and distant future asks me how the 2020 pandemic was to me, I'll send them a link to Inside by Bo Burnham.

Something about the pacing, camera movement, tight storytelling and a pretty consistent rotation of actors always makes this era and genre of movie stand out to me, with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nNo they\u2019re not particularly smart or compelling in the traditional film sense, but in an age where everything is franchised it\u2019s interesting to look back to an era when popcorn movies were original and stood alone. What are your favorite films from this era and genre?\n\nEdit: oh man, the problem with writing this kind of post sparked by watching one movie (The Rock in this case) is you forget all the other great movies in the genre. Just a quick edit on my Mount Rushmore of 90s films it has to be Fifth Element, T2, The Rock, and Speed. But also love all these others in the comments!",

Any genre, doesn't matter, just want absolute peak cinema.\n\nAnd those of you who haven't seen Thief yet, and enjoy heist, crime capers or noir, this one needs to be high on your must watch list.
