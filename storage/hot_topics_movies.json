Yes, the one nominated for 7 Razzies, that one.\n\nI was 11 years old, when I saw this and obsessed with:\n\n1. Cats\n\n2. Ancient Egypt\n\n3. Women kicking butt\n\nSo, of course I loved this stinker and even rented it multiple times from the DVD store.

So I sat down to watch a supposedly good movie about a family in the heyday of 80s wrestling.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a drama but I had no idea it was going to be so utterly devastating! Why didn't anyone warn me?!\n\nI thought the first half of the movie was solid, if a little slow. I was even finding my attention drifting a little bit at around the 50 minute mark.\n\nBut then the second hour of this movie is somehow 3 hours long and just a mesmerising tragedy that doesn't relent or shield you from the events that steadily punch you in the heart. Not many cheap thrills or twisty turbines, just a morbid sense of neverending 'Ah, fuck...' moments.\n\nI wouldn't say it was a perfect movie, but it was stoically devastating in a way that few stories are, and beautifully executed, if sometimes a little heavy-handed. I'd absolutely recommend it to any who haven't seen it.",

        "content": "When I was younger, I was really snobby when it came to movies. If I watched something that I didn't deem Oscar worthy, I'd feel like it was a waste of my time and money. I likely thought this way because I would go to the theaters and spend around $10 for every movie I watched. Regardless, this mindset was very limiting and made me not enjoy a lot of movies that were probably entertaining.\n\nNow, with streaming services, I can casually watch many movies without the worry that I am wasting my time AND money. This has caused me to lower my movie requirements to one simple thing; entertain me.\n\nI don't care if a movie is silly, has a low budget, or even has bad writing or acting. If I was entertained throughout it's runtime, I walk away pleased. I pretty much enjoy almost every movie I watch now (unless it's so bad, it's bad) and when I do watch a movie that I think is great, it is even more of a treat.\n\nI just have a more casual mindset towards movies now and it is a blast. I even enjoy watching rom coms and animated movies with my wife now, which I never would have bothered watching before. Does anyone else agree/disagree or has had a similar experience?

They are searching for Mar \u2014 daughter and sister \u2014 who vanished months ago at one of these endless, sleepless parties. Surrounded by electronic music and a raw, unfamiliar sense of freedom, they hand out her photo again and again. Hope is fading, but they push through and follow a group of ravers heading to one last party in the desert. As they venture deeper into the burning wilderness, the journey forces them to confront their own limits.",

Im imagining similar transitions, an obvious shift in the characters established speaking voice.",
