It's a very stage play performance, but it's so fun to watch. [The curse in The Lighthouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3vcK-ppzqE&amp;ab_channel=TheOncomingStorm) alone is one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen. Such a powerful scene. \n\n  \nI can't believe this man hasn't won an Oscar yet. He's a complete gift to the film industry. ",

        "content": "I think a good part of here knows the story behind the first casting of the protagonist of \"Back to the Future\". Michael J. Fox was not available and Eric Stoltz was chosen. But his type of acting was not suitable for what was a comedy, he was fired and MJF who had become available was called. The rest is history.\n\nBut recently I saw an interview with Lea Thompson (who plays Marty McFly's mother, Lorraine Baines).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-\\_lWQhgLYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-_lWQhgLYA)\n\nHere she tells an interesting anecdote. After the first reading of the script with the actors they are all enthusiastic, the story is great everyone laughs etc etc. Then they ask Eric what he thinks and he says it is a tragedy. Because at the end of the film Marty remembers a past and a family that no longer exists. His new family are strangers who have lived a totally different life. And this new family has lost a son, because at home they have a stranger who coincidentally has the same name.\n\nAnd I add, the movie tells us that all this is perfectly okay why? Because now Marty has a nicer house, he has a new car, he has so many *things*. Marty has lost his whole life but in exchange he has so many new material goods. And this is the essence of the American Dream, as long as you have things (goods, money, power, fame), everything else (love, family, beliefs) can be sacrificed.\n\n(I think that even Crispin Glover - who played Marty's dad, was very critical about the movie message: money and financial success = happiness)",

        "title": "What are scenes cut/deleted from a film that SHOULDNT have been cut out?",
        "content": "Deleted scenes have always fascinated me. There are quite a few infamous cut out sequences. Some have been put back in alternate or extended cuts, others released as bonus features, and some have never seen the light of day. Others were scripted but never even filmed.\n\nThe ones that come to mind for me are Michael Corleone killing Fabrizo in Godfather part 1(apparently part of this scene was shot before it got cut and the idea saved for part 2 where it was cut again). There\u2019s a picture of this sequence, or part of it, where Michael apparently shoots Fabrizio with a shot gun. No idea where would it would fit in but the pictures are floating around the internet. I can see why it was cut but it\u2019s something id love to see. \n\nSuperman TMP. Added to the special edition but cut from theatrical is a sequence where Lex Luthor tests Superman\u2019s powers before he can enter Lex\u2019s underground lair. He shoot\u2019s Superman with machine gun bullets, sets him on fire and then freezes him whole. It\u2019s a fun sequence with some cool FX. Even the director, Richard Donner, on the dvd commentary is puzzled why he ever cut the scene.\n\n\nI always loved the Sentry Gun sequence in Aliens which was added back in for the special edition. \n\nGhostbusters 2 has a number of deleted scenes. Many have never been seen. One that\u2019s never been seen is Ray getting possessed by Vigo and crashing the Ecto 1A(remnants of this scene remain in the first montage sequence where we see Peter in the back of the Ecto 1 looking repeatedly to Ray whose running a red light.)\n\n\nAnother from GB2 but has been released which is Dana addressing the fact that she\u2019s involved in another paranormal event and so is there something that makes her vulnerable to these situations? This one is good because it makes light of something we the audience are thinking about. Dana Barrett just so happened to walk in that Slime?Out of all the people it was her AND she has a baby the bad guy wants? After what happened in the first film? Really?\n\nThe alternate ending of Little Shop of Horrors works way better in my opinion. Much darker. But funnier. Great miniature work.\n\nSpider-Man 2 has an extended cut which some extra bits of action on the train but more than anything there\u2019s a scene with MJ and her friend going shoe shopping that I love. It really delves into who MJ is and her friend really gives a nice performance. Plus J Jonah Jameson trying on the Spidey suit is GREAT, the one brought in by garbage man\n\nKill Bill. Ok. This is an interesting one. The Kill Bill that\u2019s been released(both volumes) is not the Kill Bill originally planned. QT wrote an earlier draft and he cut out what I consider to be the best chapter in the entire saga. \u201cYuki\u2019s Revenge\u201d. This was never filmed. And it\u2019s a damn shame. Gogo has a twin sister and she tracks down Beatrix right after killing Vernita Green. In the film we hear an Ice Cream Truck roaming Vernitas neighborhood. In the script? That\u2019s Yuki and shes found The Brusge and they both go on destroying the neighborhood in an explosive action sequence. Beyond that, there\u2019s a version of the film called \u201cKill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d which combines both parts into one film. The House of Blue Leaves is in color and extended(as it was , Extended anime sequence, a new anime sequence but most importantly? We, the audience, spend the entire film thinking Beatrix lost her baby. We don\u2019t find out until SHE finds out that BB is alive. I can only imagine the power of this sequence. It removed the stinger from the end of volume 1 where Bill reveals the truth.\n\nSo those are some of my favourites. I have more but don\u2019t want to name them all.\n\n What are yours?",

        "content": "When I was a kid, I absolutely LOVED horror movies. But the worst part about me liking them was that most of the movies I was interested in were r-rated.\n\nI have thought of sneaking into a movie theater by myself and trying to watch one of those r-rated movies multiple times, but unfortunately I was too much of a coward to do so.\n\nI was always afraid that a worker at the movie theater would check my IDs or something, and then I would get busted out.\n\nHas anyone here ever tried to sneak into a r-rated movie and actually succeeded? If so, then how did you do it? Is it true that some theaters don't even check tickets or IDs these days when entering for a r-rated movie?\n\nEdit: If they do check your tickets/IDs, do they check them at the seats or just at the entrance???",

        "title": "Rewatching The Social Network in 2025",
        "content": "One of my all time favorite movies. I especially love the breakdown of each main character and their ideologies:\n\nAt the top, you have the clashing between Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker. \n\nEduardo is a good guy with bad ideas. He tries to monetize the site too early, and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Despite this, he is a team player and is the only person to put his money where his mouth is and fund the company. It\u2019s this naivety that ultimately gets him ousted from his own company by Mark and Sean. \n\nSean Parker is his exact opposite - a bad guy with really good ideas. He is able to predict the path social media is on, and even calls out the success of photo/video based sites while coked out of his mind. He knows how to influence Mark, but he is a creepy leech who ultimately enjoys lurking after college girls more than he enjoys creating companies.\n\nOn the other side, you have the Winklevii and Divya. The very definition of \u201cborn on third base and think they hit a triple\u201d. \n\nThey are suing Mark mostly based on what they feel their site could have been, vs. what it ever actually was. They never had a website or a product to compare to Facebook. They had a lot of money and influence which they used to consistently fail upwards while thinking they were \u201cplaying fair\u201d the whole time. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s Mark caught in the middle. He reminds me a lot of Louis Bloom in Nightcrawler, when Jake Gyllenhaal says \u201cwhat if my problem wasn\u2019t that I don\u2019t understand people, it was that I don\u2019t like them?\u201d \n\nIMO, Mark understands people better than he\u2019s ever given credit for. He understands the insecurity that drives much of a person\u2019s actions, and the innate desire everyone has for intimacy. This is demonstrated in the beginning of the movie with his facemash site. He knows everyone will use it, because it lets them compare themselves to people they know. This is essentially what Facebook and social media became in the 2010s - a way to compare your whole life to everyone else\u2019s highlight reels.\n\nHe also knows that the Winklevii are onto something with their website idea, but he resents them because they don\u2019t even understand why it\u2019s so valuable. He hates how little they crave any kind of companionship or intimacy, since they have grown up in an abundance of both. \n\nUltimately, the movie is about a bunch of rich kids arguing with each other. 15 years later, everyone involved is richer than they were, and nothing really happened. Sorkin and Fincher took the most boring premise ever and turned it into one of the most fascinating movies I\u2019ve ever watched.",

Fantastic recreation technically, the acting top notch. But fuck, what a heinous moment in history of man. I hadn't known about it before choosing to watch the movie so I think it was an important story to tell.\n\nAnd to show the real guy at the end pretty obviously just coping with what he did by acting like anything he did was courageous is crazyyyy. Like, my man, you were snaking your own people for YEARS. You took your own life after that documentary. You felt life ending guilt about what you did.\n\nJust a well made film. Lakeith getting nominated in Supporting though is wild lol.",

        "content": "There's some comedies from my childhood and teens that I watch now that I still have nostalgia for, but I look at them and I go yeah this is dated or this isn't as funny as I remember. I had that feeling a few years ago with American Pie where I watched it again and it really started to feel dated which is alarming for me because it seems like yesterday I was watching that movie as a kid on HBO behind my parents back. Superbad to me from start to finish is as perfect of a comedy as you're going to get. A very funny, relatable script from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Really cool locations and sets by Greg mottle and all the characters are so perfectly cast and portrayed. Not one missed joke in the entire movie and it's genuinely a movie that even at 32 I still laugh at damn near every frame now as I did at 14 when I saw it in theaters. ",

I\u2019m NOT saying he\u2019s a bad actor.
