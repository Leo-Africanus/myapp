        "content": "So I was looking at [this list of movies ordered by most box office admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_by_box_office_admissions) and I noticed all the top ones are Chinese. At first I figured \"big population, makes sense\" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?\n\nI tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.\n\nI also noticed a surprising lack of Indian movies, given the reputation of Bollywood and size of India. If population were the sole reason, I would figure India would also take several of the top spots on that list.",

There's something about how the music is connected to a storyline that makes it powerful for me, for example:\n\n\"Elizabeth\" (Elgar's Nimrod, Mozart's Requiem in D Minor)\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture)\n\n\"The King's Speech\" (Beethoven's Symphony #7)\n\n\"Wit\" (Arvo Part's Spiegel im Spiegel)\n\nIs there anything that you might suggest I look into adding to this list? Something that you feel was employed really well in cinema?\n\n(For what it's worth, I started looking into this after compiling a list of some scores composed specifically for film, by the likes of John Barry, Dario Marianelli, Howard Shore, Williams etc..).\n\nAlso, I think I initially got reeled in (ha, pardon the pun) after viewing this video essay on how Shore approached the Lord of The Rings score:\n\n\"How Music Elevates Story\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e7BkmF8CJpQ?si=eiYbn8O3Vc4dVZfD\n\nIf there are any recommendations for other YouTube channels that may do similarly accessible video essays on classical pieces, I'd love to take a look at them!!\n\nMuch obliged!",

        "content": "I remembered the case of \"The Thing\" in 1982. He was heavily criticized at the time. It was called idiotic, boring, with insipid characters, with not very good practical effects, and was even nominated for the worst soundtrack. But time passed and this film began to be considered the best science fiction horror film.\n\nAnd I wondering if some modern films of this decade would happen the same way. It will be criticized by the audience and critics, but in the future it will be considered a good film. It doesn't matter how long it takes from now on.\n\nP.S. English isn't my native language",

        "content": "Just thinking about the 90s recently. Twister for example is a big budget film starring a guy used to supporting roles in James Cameron films and a popular tv star. No legit A-listers yet it was a hit because the story was enough. Sure, maybe if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were in it, it may have been a bigger hit or maybe folks would buy it less with the performances.\n\nAlso, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.\n\nWhat are some other big budget films that have practically no stars in the lead role?",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Norway. More than 24 hours and almost 100 comments later, we have a clear winner: ***Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix*** (engl.: *Pinchcliffe Grand Prix*) will be a wonderful addition to our official Letterboxd list, which becomes more and more heterogeneous, as the time goes by. \n\ntoday, I ask you for your favorite movie set in the next european country by alphabetical order: We leave the letter N and go to P like **Poland**. It won't be quite as personal for me as Germany (where I was born and still live today), but both my parents come from Silesia, so I'm even more excited about your suggestions. All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: \n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n&gt;Day 35: Norway - Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 (engl.: You Won\u2019t Be Alone)\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "content": "Caught it months ago when it was in theaters then rewatched it again later with some friends. Think it\u2019s definitely in the top 5 of the year for me. Something about it has really just stuck with me, maybe it\u2019s the creepy imagery of the villain and twisted 90\u2019s tv show aesthetic. \n\nJustice Smith\u2019s characters narration about being young then suddenly growing old really just hit me like a brick wall. I'm a nostalgic person that grew up with 90's shows and that sequence just broke me, especially thinking on how quickly life has moved these past few years. \n\nThe entire theme of his character not being able to embrace who he truly is or wants to be and living a life suppressing himself haunts me. I\u2019m a straight male and I know the film is about trans identity yet it really connected with me. The entire ending sequence was so casual and yet so horrific. I know this movie isn\u2019t for everyone, but man I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I feel like there's so many different interpretations and things you can take from this film.",

        "content": "This was actually back in July. A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.\n\nI went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.\n\nI've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.\n\nI also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.\n\nI felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director. Maybe it's because I was very busy this year, but I didn't know he had directed this (shameful for an Italian). I guess that explains the eroticism of it.",
