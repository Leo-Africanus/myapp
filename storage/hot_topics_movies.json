        "content": "I'm not looking for sympathy, but My dad passed away in November. He was my best friend and one of the things we used to bond over was the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. We both were huge fans of those movies and we had so much fun watching them together. So these movies also remind me of my awesome dad. But even today, over 23 years since the First LOTR movie came out, I'm still so impressed with how perfect these movies are. The casting, the music, the special effects,  the creatures, the dialog, the acting etc etc. I'm geeking out but I can go on and on. These movies are something special. They are masterpieces. I mean I enjoy the old Star Wars movies but in my opinion,  they just don't compare to the gorgeous LOTR movies. The LOTR movies are definitely the best fantasy movies ever made, and I would say the best Trilogy ever made, though the Back To The Future trilogy was nearly tied as the best. I only give an Edge to LOTR because of the massive scale and epicness of it. They are true art. My opinion. I just had to geek out a bit haha. And I love that they remind me of my dad. They've been a comfort in my time of grief. ",

The physical media market may be vanishing, but they can still shop for which streaming service will get it.\n\nHorror seems to be the one exception, where a number of less expensive films are made which subsequently lowers the amount required at the box office to be successful.",

        "content": "Frank is only an assoiciate in the mob, a trusted and clealry special associate, but that's all he'd ever be. This is a far more common position than the guys Scorsese has shown in prior mob movies, and Frank's life reflects that. He doesn't have a sugar bowl full of coke in his bedroom, he doesn't own a yacht, his quality of life only marginally improves once he's killing and enforcing for a living. \n\nInstead of Frank's 'protectiveness' for his family being deified in a heroic scene where he beats up the guy who attacked his girlfriend, instead he drags his daughter down to the store so she gets a good look at Frank breaking a guys hand just because he pushed a girl acting up. And of course he can hardly understand why his daughters want nothing to do with him as an old man, it's not just for killing Jimmy Hoffa as they suspect/knew he did, it's because as kids they could never tell him about a teacher who was being unfair or a bully because he'd probably just make them watch as he murdere them. The insane violence that's a part of his career doesn't make him seem strong to his kids, he looks scary and dangerous because he is.\n\nAnd in the end what does his loyalty get him? Does he get what Vito Corleone got, dying peacefully at a ripe age surrounded by family and friends? No, he dies alone and forgotten because he murdered his friend for his boss, and he won't even tell his friend's kids what he did with the body even though there's nobody left to know he snitched. Frank gets a long lonely death because he was too shortsighted and ignorant to stay away from organized crime for his family's sake.",

        "content": "If sequels generally try to recreate the magic of the original, I'm wondering if any go off piste and change the genre of the whole franchise?\n\nI'm thinking less about sequels which ignore the original, or merely borrow the original's title for name recognition. \n\nI'm wondering more about sequels which function as sequels but alter the focus enough to arguably change the genre? Perhaps by hyperfocusing upon one aspect or theme of the original? ",

They're really nice and likeable characters.\n\nThe villain, on the other hand, though he makes some convincing arguments against religion, his arguments aren't specifically aimed at the LDS, but just religion in general. And he's an evil SOB. I think the movie is wonderful, and I personally don't think it should offend anyone of any religion.",

Ive been following Pearce\u2019s career ever since The Count of Monte Cristo and Memento and so him being in discussion for Supporting Actor this year is just cool. His collaborations with John Hillcoat are absolutely brilliant. Although I havent watched The Brutalist yet, I\u2019m very intrigued now and will definitely watch out for it.\n\nWith this, what is your favorite role of his and favorite film?\n\nJust check out some of his filmography which showcases his range: \n- The Proposition (Him and John Hillcoat are magic)\n- Rover \n- Priscilla Queen of the Desert\n- LA Confidential\n- Memento\n- The Count of Monte Cristo\n- Animal Kingdom\n- The Time Machine\n- A Slipping Down Life\n- The Road\n- King\u2019s Speech\n\n\n",
