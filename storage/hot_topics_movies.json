        "content": "Hi! I\u2019m Evan Ari Kelman, a filmmaker and writer. Barron\u2019s Cove is my feature debut, a new indie crime thriller starring Garrett Hedlund, Brittany Snow, Christian Convery, Ra\u00fal Castillo, Hamish Linklater, Tramell Tillman, and Stephen Lang. It\u2019s now in theaters and on VOD. \n\nFun fact: I first posted the script on r/Screenwriting , and the encouragement I got there helped push me to keep going and get it made. Barron\u2019s Cove is about the bond between fathers and sons, how it endures across time, and what it means to test that bond to its limits. At its heart, it\u2019s about confronting the limiting beliefs we place on ourselves, and discovering the strength to become something more, through love and legacy. I\u2019m here with Christian and Ra\u00fal to talk about the film, the process, and anything else you\u2019re curious about. Ask us anything!\n\nYou might also recognize Ra\u00fal from films and series like Smile 2, Army of the Dead, Looking, Hustle, Knives Out, We the Animals, Little Fish, Cha Cha Real Smooth, Wrath of Man, Unsane, and lots more.\n\nChristian has been in films/series like The Monkey, Sweet Tooth, Cocaine Bear, Mom, Invincible, One Piece, and more. \n\n**Here's the trailer:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/\\_CJ-f5GW9Xs?si=e4ySMtHxIM7v5b70](https://youtu.be/_CJ-f5GW9Xs?si=e4ySMtHxIM7v5b70)\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA man with a violent past kidnaps the boy he holds responsible for his son's death.

The ending I remembered wasn't nearly as good, but I'm struggling to figure out why I have such a vivid memory of a different ending scene.\n\nI remember a scene after Truman has left, where he is with Sylvia, and they are watching TV. The TV reveals that a reboot to the Truman Show has started, this time with a little girl as the main character, and Marlon is playing her father. Truman and Sylvia shake their heads and turn off the TV, and \\*that's\\* when it goes to credits.\n\nDoes anyone know where I might have seen this? Was it some fan-made thing, a post-hoc scene for something else that was referencing TTS, a deleted scene I can't find, or did I straight up hallucinate this ending?",

What sparked this is seeing how my dad gets tons of movies at those places like thrift stores for dirt cheap and there is a lot of quality movies he would get. So now I go with him and buy a whole bunch. Like recently at a library sale I bought like 80 movies for just a few dollars. Same with a donation shop I went to. I also do this for film preservation. It\u2019s great to own all these movies. I\u2019m proud to say I have over 1000 movies on DVD, Blu ray and 4K total. I was wondering if anyone else gets DVDs still besides my dad and I lol. Here\u2019s to the love of movies. ",

I was just watching the scene of Sonny saving C from getting killed when he\u2019s around all his friends who are bad influences.  I\u2019m thinking about it now, you can say it was the peer pressure, he mentions that he\u2019d never be able to walk around the neighborhood, that he\u2019d be looked out as a mutt, chicken, punk, but in reality, he was essentially Sonny\u2019s son or at least he was tight with Sonny.  Sonny had the most respect in the neighborhood &amp; he was feared, so I think his logic while he was in the car sort of didn\u2019t make too much sense, but I\u2019m noticing it now lol.  I want somebody to refute this, please! It ruins the scene a little for me \ud83d\ude02",

You have the guy sounding like a kindly grandfather doing the voiceover and a highlight reel of the film. \n\nBecause it took me another decade to finally get around to the film, the trailer became more a piece of nostalgia for me than the movie itself. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering how many people have similar stories where, as good as the film might be (or not), the trailer actually strikes a chord for you.
