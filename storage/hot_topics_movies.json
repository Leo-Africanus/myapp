When their best friends Richard (Rufus Sewell) and Beth (Olivia Williams) come over for a final dinner, an uninvited old friend, Jessica (Indira Varma), tags along.\n\nAfter a seemingly trivial argument at dinner, Jessica disappears.

        "content": "Rewatched Black Hawk Down recently and it left a jingoistic taste in my mouth - we learn nothing about the \u201cenemy\u201d and they are never really shown as people or equals. The viewer just knows they are bad and we should feel glad when they die and the protagonists are safe. \n\nIt plays into the good guy vs bad guy storytelling which makes the plot more straightforward so it\u2019s a common trope. I\u2019m looking for something that blurs the lines a bit more, like the TV series The Wire where you see the good and bad of people on both sides.\n\nThe Pianist is one of my favourite films and it touched on this a little bit with the Nazi officer at the end of the film and the Jewish ghetto police turning on their own as people. But it\u2019s only really a few glimpses, id like something that looks at this dynamic more. \n\nSo what films can you recommend where there\u2019s more balanced depiction? Where you can reasonably understand why they are acting in the way that they are, beyond being protagonist and antagonist. It can be any two (or more!) sides of any conflict, real or fictional. \n\n",

        "content": "If you haven't seen Ladyhawke, you should watch it so that you know I'm right. Basically, it's a medieval fantasy romance which we're introduced to as a revenge quest in which one of the cursed lovers seeks vengeance against the bishop who cursed them. It stars Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as the lovers and Matthew Broderick as the POV character that ushers us from the normal world of a medieval prison escape to the magical curse. Also, Leo McKern and John Wood. Plus a small role for Alfred Molina.\n\nLadyhawke is somewhat notorious for its \"synthrock score\" but honestly you barely notice it. Except when you do because it's awesome. But other than that, quite genuinely, this thing you'd think would intrude, doesn't.\n\nSo, why does the world need more Ladyhakwes? It's an original, high concept story that delivers on the premise of that concept. It's not trying to trick you, to pretend it's anything other than it is or subtly mocking you for taking the high concept at straight value. But nor is it overwrought and consumed by its own sense of seriousness -- there's colour in this world! Also, Broderick's character is a case study in how to provide quip-adjacent humour that feels genuine to the situation his character is in. Ladyhawke wasn't ahead of its time or anything but that's sort of the point I'm making.... it's a window into a different, more sincere world, that still knows how to laugh.",

        "title": "Which moment in a Disney live-action remake most misses the point of the original?",
        "content": "Freezing take: the disney live-action remakes aren't very good. But I think what's most frustrating about these movies is how often it seems that the people tasked with recreating those classic movies don't seem to understand why the original movies were the way they were in the first place.\n\nSo, often, you have times where they will change a certain plot point without understanding why that plot point was important in the original, or the consequences that it has for the rest of the story. Or, on the other hand, you have moments where they will KEEP a certain plot point of the original, while removing the reason for said plot point to exist in the first place. In the current discussion for the recent Lilo and Stitch remake, the most upvoted comment points out that the movie keeps Lilo's ritual of feeding her doll because she claims it controls the weather, while removing the information that Lilo's parents died in an accident caused by bad weather, which gave Lilo's silly ritual emotional weight and purpose.\n\nSo I want to know which moment in these live action remakes is most telling that the writers didn't understand the original movie. For me, I'll submit Pinocchio going to school in the remake. In the original movie, Gepeto tells Pinocchio to go to school, but on the way there, he is accosted by Honest John who convinces him to join the Strombolli's puppet show instead, which Pinocchio agrees, ignoring the advice of his conscience. When Pinocchio joins the puppet show, he is abused by the owner and is only freed when he learns what he did wrong.\n\nIn the remake, after meeting with Honest John, Cricket actually convinces Pinocchio to go to school and he does... only to be abused by the teacher for being a puppet and thrown out, at which point he follows John to the puppet show.\n\nThis is an absolutely baffling change because it completely contradicts the point of the movie. Pinocchio wishes to be a real boy, but in order to achieve that, he must first learn to be a *good* boy, which, among other things, involves obeying his father and steering clear of bad influences. In the original, Pinocchio willingly disobeys his father and fucks off to do something fun instead, which leads to a bad time. It's a simple morality tale; Pinocchio is rewarded for being good, and punished for being bad. Pinocchio's nose grows when lies. All of Pleasure Island. The story is centered on this theme\n\nBut in the remake, not only does Pinocchio obey his father from the start, he is PUNISHED FOR DOING SO. Now, joining the puppet show isn't a reckless decision by Pinocchio, it's his only option because obeying his father was actively bad for him.\n\nMaybe the writers wanted to make Pinocchio a \"better\" character by making him a well-behaved kid but, THE ENTIRE POINT OF THAT SCENE IS THAT PINOCCHIO MISBEHAVES. It's like if they made Pinocchio's nose grow even when he tells the truth\n\nAnyway, that's mine. What's yours?",

        "content": "*Two estranged siblings partner on a global heist to find the mythological Fountain of Youth. They must use their knowledge of history to follow clues on an adventure that will change their lives and possibly lead to immortality.*\n\nCast: John Krasinski, Natalie Portman, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Domhnall Gleeson, Arian Moayed, Laz Alonso, Carmen Ejogo, Stanley Tucci, Benjamin Chivers, Michael Epp.\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [45%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fountain_of_youth_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [42/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fountain-of-youth/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Todd Gilchrist](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/fountain-of-youth-review-guy-ritchie-john-krasinski-1236405297/)\n\n&gt;As a spirited time-filler, \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d gets the job done, but anyone looking for a deeper exploration of the search for eternal life may find this little more insightful than a stopped clock.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-1236224248/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s all as predictable as you\u2019d expect, with the screenplay by James Vanderbilt failing to provide the wit necessary to make the film stand out in any way. (One exception, an exchange between young Thomas and billionaire Owen about what it\u2019s like to be obscenely rich, stands out). By the time it concludes with the inevitable hinting at potential sequels, *Fountain of Youth* just seems desperate in its attempt to launch a viable film franchise for its streaming host.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-apple/)\n\n&gt;It would be nice to report that \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d is harmless fluff, a brisk escapist adventure with a game cast and a few fun set pieces. And I suppose it may be mostly harmless, unless you count wasting your time as a \u201charm\u201d (and I wouldn\u2019t fight you on that). But it\u2019s annoying fluff. It\u2019s tedious fluff. The only thing I wanted to escape was the movie itself. The cast is either trying too hard or not enough, and none of the action sequences blew me away. There\u2019s a bit on a boat that was probably expensive. There\u2019s a fight in a library that\u2019s competent. There\u2019s a shootout at the pyramids between characters we don\u2019t know or give a damn about. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201cfluffy\u201d and \u201cempty.\u201d \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d seems to have found it.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;No matter his gifts for tales about motley crews, this sub-Spielbergian venture isn\u2019t in his rough-and-tumble wheelhouse, the result being a clunky farce that never escapes its ancestors\u2019 shadow.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Ryan Gilbey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-gilbey) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation. As the family name Purdue suggests, Luke and Charlotte\u2019s father believed that some things should remain lost. Would that this had been the fate of the film.",

        "title": "Gary Oldman should have won an Oscar for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy",
        "content": "Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of our time, and maybe of all time, rightfully won an Oscar for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour (2017), but he should have actually won one six years before for his performance as George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), instead of Jean Dujardin in The Artist, a mediocre movie and performance no one remembers about.\n\nIt's a masterclass in subtlety and restraint. Portraying the quietly brilliant British intelligence officer, he delivers a deeply internalized performance that departs from the more expressive roles he's known for. \n\nOldman uses minimal facial expressions and dialogue to convey Smiley\u2019s intelligence and emotional complexity. \n\nHis stillness and silence become tools of tension; much of his performance lies in glances, pauses, and barely perceptible shifts in posture. \n\nThis restraint mirrors Smiley's role as a careful observer in a world of deception.\n\nHe disappears into Smiley. \nHe doesn't rely on prosthetics or accents; it's a performance built on deep character understanding and emotional nuance.\n\nOldman plays Smiley as an observer, a man who listens more than he speaks. His performance is quiet but powerful, defined by subtle glances, slight changes in expression, and long silences. \n\nThis suits Smiley, a spy who works in shadows and survives by reading people rather than confronting them.\n\nHe drastically altered his posture and movements to embody Smiley\u2019s meekness. He moves slowly, deliberately, with minimal expression, embodying a man who has spent his life concealing emotion and intention. His voice is soft and even, conveying control and precision.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects is how he conveys Smiley\u2019s emotional depth, his disappointment, betrayal, and loneliness, without overt sentimentality.\n\nThe scene where he recalls his one confrontation with Karla (without ever raising his voice) is especially poignant, showing vulnerability beneath layers of professionalism.\n\nHis voice is calm, measured, and deliberate, which helps create an air of quiet authority. \n\nOldman modulates his tone so that even the smallest changes register as significant, drawing the audience into Smiley\u2019s methodical thought process.\n\nAlso he portrays Smiley as a man weathered by decades of espionage, with visible fatigue and emotional distance. \n\nHis physicality, stooped shoulders, slow gait, and a distant gaze, reflects the emotional toll of betrayal and long-term isolation, both personally and professionally.\n\nPerhaps Oldman\u2019s greatest feat is how much he doesn\u2019t say. In many scenes, Smiley simply listens, yet he dominates the frame. Oldman\u2019s controlled stillness contrasts with the chaos around him, drawing the viewer in and underscoring Smiley\u2019s intellect and detachment.\n\nThe character of Smiley is torn between duty, personal loss (his wife\u2019s infidelity), and his disillusionment with the Cold War\u2019s moral murkine.\n\nThough emotionally guarded, Smiley\u2019s pain, particularly regarding the infidelity and the betrayal within the Circus, is palpable in Oldman's nuanced reactions. \n\nThere\u2019s a quiet sadness beneath the surface, making his moments of vulnerability (such as the brief flickers of emotion when discussing Karla or his marriage) particularly poignant.\n\nEvery gesture feels calculated, aligning with Smiley\u2019s role as a master spy. Oldman\u2019s control over his performance mirrors Smiley\u2019s control over his surroundings, underscoring the tension in a film where much of the drama unfolds beneath the surface.\n\nOldman's performance is a rare instance where less truly becomes more. \n\nHe fully inhabits Smiley, not by overt displays but through a deep understanding of the character\u2019s inner world. \n\nIt stands as one of his most disciplined and critically acclaimed roles. \n\nHis portrayal defines the tone of the film, quiet, cerebral, and hauntingly introspective.\n\nOften big, showy performances get the acclaim and all the attention, but Oldman's work is the opposite, it's a rare example of how powerful restraint can be. Few actors could make such a quiet character so compelling.\n\nHis portrayal of Smiley demonstrates that great acting doesn\u2019t always need to be loud or showy.\n\nIt earned him an Oscar nomination and cemented Smiley as a hauntingly real character, an actual human being who could walk out of the screen, one whose intelligence and sorrow are etched not in his words, but in his eyes and silences.\n\nI think in the future it will end up being recognized as his greatest and most complex performance ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
