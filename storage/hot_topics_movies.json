        "content": "What are your thoughts on The Curse of the Black Pearl?\n\nI decided to rewatch The Curse of the Black Pearl and I must say, I loved this film as a kid, I still love it as an adult. It\u2019s such a fun, compelling adventure film. The Special Effects I feel still hold up,\u00a0and the Big Action Pieces are great to watch. What I also found with this film is that I feels a little more grounded than the sequels, which I feel dial it up but I like 2 and 3, 4 is okay, 5, I just didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe Cast is great. Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Jack Sparrow and I feel he is at his best with the character in the 1st film. In the 1st film, Jack is a master manipulator who excels at improving his strategy when things go sideways and you can never really tell if he is a joke or if he\u2019s serious. He is unpredictable, he is charismatic, He is just fun to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also great as Barbossa and makes for a great villain and his banter with Depp is fun to watch.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are also good as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but I must admit, without Jack Sparrow, their story was a little bland but It didn\u2019t dissuade me, I still love this film.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I just love this film and rewatching it, it is a great adventure film.",

        "content": "\u201cThe film, directed by Miguel Zacar\u00edas, retells the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Mexican actor Jorge Rivero played Adam, while newcomer Candice 'Candy' Wilson played Eve. There are no other actors in the film. The movie is largely silent, with the actors gesturing and calling each other's names to communicate. The film has some opening narration, as well as the voice of God saying a few phrases from the heavens.\n\nThe film gained notoriety because Rivero and Wilson appear fully nude throughout most of the film, with occasional glimpses of genitalia, pubic hair and female nipples.\n\nThe film was picked up by Dimension Pictures. Stephanie Rothman and her husband Charles Swartz supervised re editing and dubbing the film for US release\u201d \n\nIt was a Mexican film titled El pecado de Ad\u00e1n y Eva that released in 1969 but later released in the states in 1973.

I never noticed an accent slip. There's certain words that UK/Aussie's usually slip on if their accent skill isn't perfected.\n\nToni Collette for just everything I've seen her in. I think I saw a movie where her natural accent was used but I can't even think of it.\n\nBoth I just assumed were Americans until I randomly found out weren't.\n\nEdit: Yes, I made a mistake and put who's and not whose. I get it. Thank you",

        "content": "Rewatched Bulworth for the first time in around 15 years this morning.\n\nThere is a reason Bulworth ended Beauty's, career, and it's the same reason the film is stuck on DVD despite earning a nomination for best screenplay. I don't know who the hell financed this, but it held World Championship belt for most scorching takedown of late-stage capitalism nearly 20 years (until Sorry to Bother You came along).\n\nIs it perfect? No. Is some of its audacious, late 90's contextual, satire going to offend folks for different reasons than it did in 1998? Yes.\n\nBut damn was it an enjoyable ride.",

        "title": "I\u2019ve watched 22 horror flicks during october - mix of modern and classics - either never seen bevor or last watched as a child. Here are my ratings.",
        "content": "I\u2019m 40, male, European (I\u2019m only stating this so you don\u2019t wonder why I don\u2019t know certain movies), just got laid the fuck off in November and decided to go all in on spooktober. There are some classics in here that I have never seen before and there are some classics that I have seen as an 8 year old but never again since, as well as some modern movies that I have read about. My goal was to close some gaps AND get some new era horror in. Rating scale is not relative to horror but to movies in general. No spoilers. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\n1. Hitcher (1986)\nBelieve it or not: never seen this. I was expecting some creepy slow paced road movie. Oh boy was i ever wrong. I really enjoyed it. But it was almost more of a terminator vibe than anything else. 7.5/10. This could go up to a 9/10 if it keeps staying in my head like it did those past few weeks. Greatly recommended.\n\n2. Final destination bloodlines (2025)\nFun all around. Entertaining and never boring. Great ideas well executed. 6.5/10. recommended.\n\n3. Malignant (2021)\nGreat start, kinda drags on for too long to subvert you. But then gets really fucking great and pays off during the last third of the movie. Loved this one more than I should\u2019ve and would watch it again with friends just to see their faces when shit really gets going. 7/10. recommended.\n\n4. In a violent nature (2024)\nReally enjoyed this \u201ekind of\u201c fresh take/perspective. Even though it doesn\u2019t fully deliver on its premise it\u2019s still special enough to feel different. Atmospheric, really gory, mostly well executed. 6.5/10. recommended.\n\n5. May (2002)\nThis was one of my favorites. Went in completely blind and loved everything about it. Performances are top notch across the board and it just keeps getting weirder with every minute. This is right up my alley! 8/10. Watch this!\n\n6. Dead and buried (1981)\nGreat atmosphere first and foremost. Fun twist at the end. Enjoyed this as well. 6.5/10. Recommended.\n\n7. Cat\u2019s eye (1985)\nStephen King adaptation. 3 shorts. I remember being horrorfied as a kid of the third one. This time around I LOVED the first segment, enjoyed the second one and didn\u2019t really care for the third one. Just for the first one though it\u2019s a 6/10. Not necessarily recommended.\n\n8. Halloween III: season of the witch (1982)\nWired. But kind of cool. Just for what it is and what it was trying to do. Got bored a couple of times during this, but did kind of appreciate it. 5.5/10. Not recommended to the general audience.\n\n9. Barbarian (2022)\nAfter watching \u201cweapons\u201d on the big screen this year (and fucking LOVING it) I had to give barbarian a shot. I do trust directors blindly once I really like one of their movies. So yeah I also liked this one. Not quite as nuanced and witty but just as fucking terrifying. 6.5/10 (weapons 7.5/10). Recommended.\n\n10. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside (2024)\nNetflix movie. I generally don\u2019t have many good things to say about Netflix movies. This one was entertaining with a fun twist. 6/10. Not necessarily recommended.\n\n11. Possession (1981)\nFuck me this was a ride. I cannot decide on if it\u2019s pretentious or genius. Maybe a little bit of both. The dialogues feel unnatural and the sets are sterile but the performances give it so much weight that the creepy fucking reveal in the third act hits like a baseball bat to the head.i really loved the over the top performances by some of these actors and they stayed with me for days. 8.5/10. Watch this immediately.\n\n12. Heretic (2024)\nMeh. Falls short especially at the conclusion and I didn\u2019t really care for it, even though performances aren\u2019t bad. 5/10. Not recommended.\n\n13. Evil dead rise (2023)\nAs an 80\u2019s kid I grew up with the evil dead trilogy. Sadly I didn\u2019t care too much for this one. Last 15 minutes were great creature horror. Everything up to that was rather boring and not at all up to par with anything that came before it. As a fan of the series I guess you would still enjoy it. I\u2019d still have to rate I 5.5/10 and not really recommend it if you\u2019re not an evil dead fan. \n\n14. Nightmare on elm street (1984)\nSo much worse than I remembered. Doesn\u2019t hold up for me at all. I\u2019m much more a John Carpenter guy than a Wes Craven guy and this was just another disappointment after rewatching it. There are so many things wrong with this movie, and don\u2019t get me started on the ending. 4/10. 4 because it gave birth to an icon of the horror franchise (I really only enjoy dream child). Recommended because of cultural impact only.\n\n15. Halloween (1987)\nSo, so much better than I\u2019d remembered. Watched this last when I was like 10, so 30 years ago. This is a true horror classic and it still holds up. It\u2019s so well executed (except for one scene, but I won\u2019t spoil it here). 8.5/10. Everyone should watch this. So do you. Go watch this right now.\n\n16. Tales of Halloween (2015)\nDon\u2019t know why I watched this. First couple of shirts were fun. Then it just dragged on. There were some truly dogshit parts in here. 3/10. Only watch this with your 5 y/o cousin on Halloween night and never admit to anyone that you\u2019ve seen this. (I did enjoy 2 or 3 of the shorts but don\u2019t tell anyone please).\n\n17. The descent (2005)\nGreat! Until it isn\u2019t. Why the fuck are most of them Turing into ass kicking Lara Crofts mid movie? I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to break a monsters neck in pitch blackness. Great premise, pretty solid execution but falls short somewhere in the middle and sadly loses credibly along the way. Still a great movie with pretty decent effects and atmosphere. 6.5/10 - would recommend \n\n18. Skinamarink\nThe fuck was that? I actually watched this all the way through to the end. I\u2019m not quite sure if that\u2019s an achievement or just wasted life. Interesting for sure. As a fan of film and art I really want to enjoy and recommend this. But I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sure some people will get something out of this, as did I. But I can\u2019t recommend this to the general audience. 5.5/10. Interesting. Not engaging. \n\n19. The ritual (2017)\nAnother Netflix movie. This one is genuinely great though. Great performances, great scenery, great atmosphere, fantastic monster design. 7/10. Highly recommended.\n\n20. The Thing (1982)\nLucky enough to have watched this at a beautiful movie theatre this month, this is a Jo brainer. 10/10. No doubt top 5 movies of all time. Don\u2019t need to tell you probably. \n\n21. Return of the living dead (1985)\nGo watch this right fucking now. I\u2019m not even joking. You need to watch this right now. 10/10. \n\n22. Bring her back (2025)\nPositively surprised. Great supernatural horror drama with some truly gnarly and disturbing scenes. 7/10. Recommended.\n\nHonorable mentions from November at the big screen:\n\n- weapons 7.5/10\n- alien 9/10\n- I saw the devil 8.5/10\n- the fly 8/10\n\nHappy Halloween y\u2019all.\n\n\n",

        "title": "Siskel &amp; Ebert's 1986 review of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home",
        "content": "November, 1986. Chernobyl disaster, Challenger explosion, Lake Nyos disaster, US reestablishes diplomatic relations with the Vatican after more than a century of anti-Catholic sentiment. Pixar is founded, Microsoft goes public and releases the \u201c[IBM PC Convertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_Convertible)\u201d ($5,900 in today\u2019s dollars, 256 KB of RAM and a monochrome display, weighing in at 13 pounds). \n\nAnd Star Trek IV was released. \n\n- - -\n\n\nSiskel: Star Trek IV The Voyage Home is one of those rarest of birds, a sequel that is better than the original. In fact, I liked it as much as any in the whole series, and it's a good series, particularly Star Trek II. How do they do it? I think by remembering that we go to a Star Trek movie to spend time with likable characters who obviously like each other, rather than with most outer space pictures, seeing a whole bunch of cardboard characters fighting all sorts of technological creatures. For example, in this mission to save the planet Earth, Admiral Kirk and Mr. Spock and the rest of the Star Trek crew return to Earth through the streets of San Francisco. This scene may remind you a little bit of Crocodile Dundee, this time with a whole bunch of fish out of water. \n\n&gt; Driver: You watch where you're going, you dumbass.\n\n&gt; Kirk: Well a double-dumbass on you. \n\n&gt; Bones: It's a miracle these people ever got out of the 20th century. They're still using money. We gotta find something. Spock, the rest of you stay here. \n\nKirk: The rest of you break up. You look like a cadet review. \n\nSiskel: Funny bit, saving the planet Earth requires the crew to find some humpback whales that are being sought by a mysterious space probe. The Star Trek crew soon finds themselves underwater. That last bit is from the last part of the movie, and that's the least interesting part The most pleasing part is simply when these familiar characters talk with each other, gently joke with each other. Really, the appeal is not unlike The Cosby Show, Our Father Knows Best, where we're seeing a family affair on the screen, a family with distinct characters who like each other and we suspect at some point love each other. \n\nEbert: I also thought this was one of the very best movies in the series, and it's funny because usually, as you said, sequels get worse and worse and worse. This one is better and better. I love Mr. Spock. \n\nSiskel: They have a lot of humor this time in the fact that he cannot tell a lie. \n\nEbert: So Catherine Hicks, who's the whale expert, is saying, do you like Italian? And Spock says, no. And Kirk is saying, no, yes, we like Italian. No, no, I don't, you know. Do you like it? No, I don't. That's very funny. And then, of course, the relationship between Hicks and Admiral Kirk is interesting. The fact that she is so emotionally involved with these whales, and only on Star Trek, you're quite right, would you have a scene where you start out in outer space in the 23rd century and winds up in San Francisco with [saving the whales](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/climate/whale-threats-solutions-antarctica). That was one of the things the TV series did so well, was to take a contemporary issue and put it into a science fiction format to make a statement about it. So the movie has heart, it has a message, it's a lot of fun. \n\n\nSiskel: I think it has some beautiful writing. They can get away, because the characters are true, they can get away with saying lines that if they're thrown in another movie, you say, oh, it's just a bunch of, that's phony, it's broad emotion. Here, there can be a conversation between Spock's father and Spock that touches us. Because they have these characters down cold, they've kept the team together, which is usually what doesn't happen in most sequels. \n\nEbert: They not only have kept the team together, but Leonard Nimoy is the director again this time, and he has developed into quite a good director. \n\nSiskel: I think he moves things right along. \n\nEbert: It's nice that the people who originally made the Star Trek saga are now still controlling what happens with the movies instead of somebody else with bright ideas to turn it into George Lucas or Steven Spielberg or something. They keep the human element. \n\nSiskel: Right.\n\n- - - \n\n[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1olp6i4/siskel_ebert_review_of_star_trek_ii_wrath_of_khan/nmjlpnd/?context=3) is a similar post for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.",
