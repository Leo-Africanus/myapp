Do you think he deserves to be considered in that upper echelon of legendary actors, or is he just a Hollywood name? \n\nEdit: I agree with what a lot of the comments are saying that he is a great actor, but bigger movie star. And that despite having gotten his Oscar, he still lacks his magnum opus. ",

        "title": "'Jurassic World Rebirth' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_world_rebirth): 57% (67 reviews) with 5.90 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-world-rebirth/): 55/100 (29 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; The blend of physical locations with sets and digital imagery is seamless and the CG work on the creatures is first-rate, notably so in the scary climactic stretch when the lumbering D. Rex joins the fray. Edwards clearly is a devoted Spielberg fan, embedding subtle homages throughout, notably in the open water sequences that recall Jaws. Jurassic World Rebirth is unlikely to top anyone\u2019s ranked franchise list. But longtime fans (count me among them) should have a blast.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-1236302373/)\n\n&gt; Scenes between Ella and her potentially ill-advised pet, along with tender moments involving several other species, introduce a surprising counter-argument to the earlier \u201cJurassic\u201d movies: namely, that they have a right to exist. But entertaining as it can be at times, stripped of the silliness that tainted the second trilogy, \u201cRebirth\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily make the same case for itself. The movie offers an updated version of the same basic ride Spielberg offered 32 years earlier, and yet, it hardly feels essential to the series\u2019 overall mythology, nor does it signal where the franchise could be headed.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-1236443872/)\n\n&gt; Needless to say, \u201cRebirth\u201d doesn\u2019t do itself any favors by so frequently harkening back to the original. Bad as some of the previous sequels have been, none of them have been so eager to measure themselves against Spielberg\u2019s masterpiece. Nothing in this movie is quite as maddening as the second trilogy\u2019s attempt to make audiences invest in a specific Velociraptor (though Edwards half-heartedly tries to sweeten us on an adorable baby Aquilops named Dolores), but the extent to which this franchise is just fending off its own extinction has never been more obvious than it is in during the \u201cRebirth\u201d sequence that pays homage to the kitchen encounter from the first movie. The \u201cJurassic\u201d sequels were bad enough when they made an effort to evolve \u2014 they\u2019re even less worth seeing now that they already come pre-fossilized.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-1235135932/): C\u2013\n\n&gt; There\u2019s a disappointing amount of \u201csame old thing\u201d to Jurassic World Rebirth. Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, and the rest of the cast are intriguing and sympathetic throughout, but Gareth Edwards doesn\u2019t quite recapture his signature flair for grand-scale visuals nor does David Koepp find the magic of his original Jurassic Park screenplay, opting to follow that movie\u2019s structure as more of a remix than a rebirth.\n\n-[Clint Gage, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-ali): 5.0 out of 10 \"mediocre\"\n\n&gt; So why the hell does this feel so generic, so by-the-numbers, so instantly forgettable? The whole thing resembles the blockbuster version of a readymade, assembled from various, recognizable spare parts and elevated only by virtue of its name. Fans and completists may still get giddy over a ScarJo vs. Dinos showdown, and you should never underestimate the power of giant, toothy jaws chomping down on poor, hapless humans. But long before the big showstopping climax, you\u2019ll start to understand why the movie\u2019s jaded public became bored by what once seemed thrilling and unique. Subtitling this Rebirth seems to have been an act of extreme optimism.\n\n-[David Fear, Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-1235372435/)\n\n&gt; This new Jurassic adventure isn\u2019t doing anything so very different from the earlier successful models, perhaps, and I could have done without its outrageous brand synergy product placement for certain brands of chocolate bar. But it feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs. Maybe the series can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t go on for ever: we need new and original ideas. This one would be great to go out on.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/30/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-runs-show-as-near-extinct-franchise-roars-back-to-life): 4/5\n\n&gt; \u201cJurassic\u201d has to live with setting a high bar, of course \u2014 the original film revolutionized the industry, a status that \u201cRebirth\u201d is all too aware of, as seen in its meta theme of dinosaurs becoming old news to a jaded populace. Yet just because cheeseburgers are now available anywhere doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be damn tasty. \u201cJurassic Park Rebirth\u201d is just a well made cheeseburger, and whether that\u2019s filling and interesting enough is up to your own appetite. \n\n-[Bill Bria, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review/)\n\n&gt; \u201cScience is for all of us, not just for some of us,\u201d Dr. Loomis tells Zora, advocating for their work to have a more noble purpose than lining their pockets. That aspirational notion has always sat at the heart of the Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park Rebirth is one of the more successful and satisfying entries in the franchise precisely because it, uh, finds a way to keep Loomis\u2019 mantra close, foregrounding the film\u2019s sense of wonder above a mere blatant cash grab.\n\n-[Maureen Lee Lenker, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/jurassic-park-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-jonathan-bailey-help-franchise-roar-back-11763036): B+\n\n&gt; It might sound like a challenge to believe these humans would sign up to visit a forbidden jungle for guaranteed encounters with truly frightening and gigantic creatures out of another time in order to essentially get blood samples, but if you are game to go with that premise a good time will be had for all. If there is to be an eighth installment, count me in.\n\n-[Pete Hammond, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-spielberg-1236445462/)\n\n&gt; This is a monster-adventure movie, with passages that recall Jaws and King Kong; maybe not the most original influences, but certainly not shabby ones. In its fusion of Edwards\u2019 craft with characters who aren\u2019t thunderously stupid or unlikable, this is the best Jurassic movie in ages \u2013 in part because it works so comfortably as an ooh/ahh/run/scream monster movie.\n\n-[Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/gareth-edwards/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-ali-gareth-edwards-dinosaurs): 7.0\n\n&gt; \u201cJurassic World: Rebirth\u201d is a very imperfect film. On one hand, it seems to be recycling every successful character trope and set piece from the franchise, which may be considered lazy and uninspiring, but it is still captivating. Even in its faults, the objective of a \u201cJurassic Park\u201d film is to scare, thrill, and amaze its audience, and this film does that in its set pieces.\n\n-[Lauren LaMagna, Next Best Picture](https://nextbestpicture.com/jurassic-world-rebirth/)\n\n&gt; There are worse exercises in IP-extension out there in the marketplace. But it is hard to imagine what possible basis there could be for an eighth Jurassic film. We\u2019ve overused the extra-island trope; we\u2019ve done dinos invading the mainland a couple times now. We\u2019ve seen enough long necks poking up from the grass. We\u2019ve seen too many T-rexes thundering after their prey. Now even the oceans have been exhausted. I suppose they could send some dinosaurs to space next time, where no one can hear them roar. But that wouldn\u2019t really make much of a difference: the sound barely registers anymore.\n\n-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jurassic-world-rebirth-review)\n\n&gt; To his credit, Edwards immediately injects \"Rebirth\" with a sense of stakes and tension that the entirety of the previous trilogy struggled to depict. But every time the plot kicks in again and writer David Koepp's script goes through the motions of a standard \"Jurassic\" movie, those dizzying peaks soon begin to flatten out into overgrown valleys. For those simply hoping for a watchable movie on the heels of the disastrous \"Dominion,\" your wish has been granted with a safe rehash punctuated by a handful of genuine thrills. For everyone else curious about whether this was the ticket to teaching old dinos new tricks? The inherent limits of the \"Jurassic\" IP are as glaring as ever.\n\n-[Jeremy Mathai, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/1899528/jurassic-world-rebirth-movie-review/): 5.5/10\n\n&gt; And there are some sporadic joys here in the clever sight gags, the sleight of hand, the bait and switch. These moments remind us of the mindless summertime excitement the \u201cJurassic\u201d movies have long provided, albeit with diminishing returns. But that giant footprint just isn\u2019t as imposing as it used to be. \n\n-[Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johannsson-movie-review-2025): 2/4\n\n&gt; Worst of all, this hoary adventure story is rendered soulless by the blatant product placement: Henry crunching on Altoids, Reuben scolding Xavier for eating too many of their bags of Doritos, and Isabella feeding Twizzlers to her little dino friend. After a while, you may wonder if the entire film was subsidized by the snack food industry. Rebirth even goes so far as setting its final action scene in a long-abandoned but still fully stocked convenience store. How meta: a franchise trying to distract us from how past its sell-by date it is with expired potato chips.\n\n-[Derek Smith, Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-jonathan-bailey-gareth-edwards/): 1.5/4\n\n&gt; Audiences may not have run out of enthusiasm for what the Jurassic Worlds are selling, or at least they haven\u2019t yet, but the people tasked with making them sure are out of ideas.\n\n-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-jurassic-world-rebirth-makes-dinosaur-carnage-dull.html) \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nFive years after the events of *Jurassic World Dominion*, the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI\u2019m trying to identify a Yugoslav (or possibly early post-Yugoslav) film I saw as a kid, probably on TV sometime in the late \u201990s or early 2000s. The movie itself felt older\u2014likely filmed in the late 1980s or early 1990s, based on the grainy visuals and production quality. It was in color, definitely not black and white.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I remember, as accurately as possible:\n\n\n\n* A man and a woman (she was blonde, maybe in her 30s) are driving at night in a **red car** (possibly a VW Golf, but I\u2019m not certain).\n* They are stopped at a **border checkpoint or police stop** and the man is **beaten** by the officers.\n* Later in the film, **several men invade a house** where the same woman and another woman are staying. There\u2019s a brief conversation, then a **sexual assault occurs**\u2014graphic and with nudity.\n* After the attackers leave, a **young boy comes to the house**, opens the door, and sees the two women **lying unconscious and naked** on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scene stuck with me because it aired on TV right after a block of children\u2019s cartoons. As a kid, it completely blindsided me. Now I\u2019m just trying to identify the film for peace of mind, to make sense of what I saw. I talked to my mom about how I was raised by my aunts as a kid when we visited our family home over the summer and I mentioned this stuff. My mom does not believe me. She also told me to prove it by telling her the name of the movie. At first I am like \"The fuck? What kind of logic is that? If I know the name of the movie, my claims are true but if not then I am lying?\" TL;DR This is *not* for any sensational reason\u2014just closure and proving my mom that some of my aunt's on my dad's side are a bit messed up\n\n\n\nIf anyone recognizes this or has any idea what film this might be, I\u2019d be grateful.  \n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Solved. The movie is vukovar jedna prica",
