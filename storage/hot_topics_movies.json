Btw I\u2019m going back and forth between the character letters and the actor names to make it make sense for myself.\n\nIn MiB3, it\u2019s revealed that K had traveled back in time\\* and witnessed not only J as a small kid but the death of his father, and K knew he was basically unwittingly responsible for how J grew up. But K doesn\u2019t treat it as a burden, he\u2019s honored by it and the father\u2018s heroic sacrifice.\n\nSo in the first movie, Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 insistence that Will Smith should not only be a new MiB agent but even his replacement when he retires makes all the more sense.\n\n\\*edit: sorry for fucking that up, Tommy Lee Jones didn\u2019t travel back in time of course, but we did. And he had those memories. ",

Then finally get caught the second after they complete their goal like their protection ran out the exact moment the task was done\n\nI\u2019m curious do you think they caused so much chaos because they knew they wouldn\u2019t get caught until their goal was done or is this just how they normally live?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to religious debate here just a discussion about the film and their actions in it",

Yet somehow Spielberg can craft this world, introduce us to all these wild ideas and all within just a few minutes, leaving us equipped to tackle the rest of the film.\n\nIn my honest opinion its brilliant film making and truly the work of a master film maker.\n\nWhat do you think?",

What scene specifically stuck with you?",
