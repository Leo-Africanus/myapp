Compared to those kinds of turns, Elordi\u2019s role didn\u2019t strike me as particularly demanding or transformative, nor did it feel like something only he could have pulled off.\n\nTo me, it felt like a well-executed performance that a number of capable actors could have delivered at a similar level.

I can\u2019t recall the last time a movie has made me cry since I\u2019m not nearly as emotional as I was when I was a kid, but HOLY HELL did this movie bring me close to doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie about a father and his son as they traverse a post apocalyptic United States in search of a boat to see if they can find a safer place to live.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear during the movie that humanity is doomed. A worldwide disaster struck the now ash covered planet, and pretty much all plant and animal life is gone. Because of that, it isn\u2019t uncommon for any remaining people to start resorting to cannibalism.\n\nI ended up watching it on my birthday, and it really put a damper on the remainder of it. Is it arguably a good movie? Yes, but I have no desire to watch it again. Not for a very long time at least.",

I normally always sit down and watch it if I see it on or streaming somewhere and have the time. I\u2019ve probably seen it a hundred times. \n\nThe reason it\u2019s my favorite movie isn\u2019t just because the acting is great, the story is great, and the pacing is almost perfect. It\u2019s that it takes me on this complete emotional journey of ups and downs and leaves me feeling happy and uplifted. I always have a smile on my face when credits roll. \n\nI recently just realized not a single other movie in my top 10 leaves me with that same feeling. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have other feel good movies on my watch list, it\u2019s the complete package that those other movies are acting. \n\nSo I figured I\u2019d come here and ask Reddit if you guys got any suggestions of another movie that could maybe make my top 10 that gives me that complete emotional journey with a happy ending.

        "content": "Recently watched The Last Showgirl where Pamela Anderson plays a showgirl who is delusional about her talent but clearly in love with the glamour and \u201cartform\u201d. She also plays a deadbeat mother. \n\nCan you recommend more films and tv shows with such bad/mediocre artists who clearly love the artform. Like in Disaster Artist they show Tommy believed he was making a masterpiece. I cannot remember but does Birdman fit this bill? Or was he just a has been like in Sunset Boulevard? Watched Birdman long time ago. ",

        "title": "Finally watched The Fall (2006). What did you think of the style and story?",
        "content": "I recently watched The Fall by Tarsem Singh after seeing a few clips online. The movie immediately caught my attention because of how beautiful it looked. The costumes, color schemes, and locations felt so intentional and striking that it made me curious enough to finally sit down and watch it.\n\nFrom the start, the film gave me a strange, nostalgic feeling. It felt like being transported back in time, watching a movie in the family room as a kid during summer break. That made sense since it came out in 2006, but at the same time it somehow still felt completely timeless.\n\nVisually, I found it beautiful but also a little weird in a very artistic way. The style felt dreamlike and surreal without feeling random. I really appreciated how bold it was with its visuals, especially the costumes and locations, which stayed with me long after the movie ended.\n\nI did feel that the story became a little messy toward the end. I was confused by some of the characters, their actions, and the reasoning behind certain moments. Still, it did not take away from the experience for me at all, and I would absolutely watch it again.\n\nIt is the kind of movie that lingers. I found myself thinking about it the next day, replaying images and moments in my head.\n\nThe best way I can describe watching The Fall is that it felt like one of those dreams you have during a summer afternoon nap, the kind of dream you really like. When you wake up, you immediately want to fall back asleep just to continue it. That is exactly what this movie felt like to me.\n\nI would love to hear other people's thoughts and experiences, especially how the story and visual style worked for you.",

        "content": "Couple months ago, I was looking for an old Sci-Fi movie from the former Czechoslovakia Republic titled \u2018Ikarie XB-1\u2019. A search on JustWatch showed that the movie is available on a streaming service called \u2018Cultpix\u2019. Since I\u2019ve not heard of it before, I did some googling and came across an article on [The New York Times about Cultpix](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/movies/cultpix-streaming-movies.html), it was a legit streaming service.\n\nGoing to the site, which allow you to see all available titles, was definitely more than I bargained for. \n\nFrom good to terrible Sci-Fi/fantasy titles like: \n\n* Ikarie XB-1 (Based on a novel by Stanis\u0142aw Lem).\n* Dark Star (dir. John Carpenter).\n* A Boy and His Dog (Based on a novella by Harlan Ellison, and starring a young Don Johnson).\n* The Day the Earth Stood Still (The original movie by Robert Wise).\n* Death Race 2000 (A Roger Corman production).\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;Plan 9 from Outer Space (Written &amp; directed by Ed Wood), Robo Vampire, Prisoners of the Lost Universe, Cosmos: War of the Planets, The Beastmaster, Hercules in the Haunted World.\n\nAlongside those movies, there is a whole section for European &amp; some American erotic movies, gems like: \n\n&gt;The Erotic Adventures of Hercules, The Spy Who Came, Around the World with Johnny Wadd, Swedish Confessions, Flossie, Fantasyworld, Marilyn and the Senator, and many others.\n\nWhile it was nice to find some obscure titles, a specialty streaming services dedicated for Sci-Fi content would be great, after all, horror fans have Shudder &amp; Arrow.

So tonight I'm watching the last major movie release before the world went to shit: Shrek. \n\nI haven't watching TV this movie in probably 15 or 20 years. It's every bit as funny, uncanny valley and dated but also modern as I remember. \n\nI honestly the think that I like this movie less for the movie itself and more for the memories of what the world was like when this movie came out. No patriot act. No iraq war. Politicians were engaged in less scandals because they actually had to fear the fallouts. The partisan divide was less noticable.  Fewer school shootings in the news. The dollar was trading close to parity between USA and Canada. Inflation hadn't kicked into high gear. Most jobs came with pensions and health benefits. Cars had buttons and knobs instead of screens. The Internet was a box in a corner you turned on and off when you needed it. Remember when there was no Facebook? No twitter and no demands to always answer a ping on your hip? \n\nSometimes I just miss the old days, and need to watch a silly movie to escape the modern dystopia. ",

        "content": "The rating in IMDb is 5.8/10.\n\nViewer rating is a bit extreme on both sides.\n\nHalf is \u201cjust watch with low expectations and don\u2019t question anything, then it is a very enjoyable movie to watch - same level as Armageddon, and better than most Transfomer movies\u201d\n\nThe other half is \u201cdon\u2019t waste your time, what a horrible movie that doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d\n\nAnyway, I always have this guilty pleasure of disaster/fight the monsters and save the world types of movie.  I love Pacific Rim 1 (I know it mainly it\u2019s because it has Guillermo del Toro as the director), however 2012 is below my limit.\n\nBattleship is \u2026 non stop action.  Hence it doesn\u2019t give you much time to question the plot.  The alien is not super powerful, which kind of a fresh air (?).  In fact, the alien is not really the bad guy.  At least they have no intention to kill living beings, if they don\u2019t have intention to kill first.\n\nCast is \u2026 ok.  Nice to see Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, who I had no idea who he was in my last watch (at least 7 years ago).  I don\u2019t listen Rihanna\u2019s songs so her acting doesn\u2019t bother me.  And I do like they used real life veterans as actor / extra.\n\nIt was a not bad movie to kill time and shutdown my brain in a summer afternoon.\n\nThank you for reading my confession.",
