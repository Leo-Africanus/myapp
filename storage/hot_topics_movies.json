We got most of the way through the first LotR movie, but I think the battle scenes were too much. We've got the OG Muppet movie on right now, any other suggestions? \n\nEdit:\n\nYou all are simply amazing. I can't tell you how overwhelmingly wonderful it's been to come back to this post and read the suggestions and stories. I'm going to try and nap a little while he's calm (we're taking shifts) and just want you all to know how much these replies of love have meant to my family. We all had a really good cry about a bunch of random strangers taking the time out of their days to share these moments with us. It's really something else. \n\nEdit#2:\nSleeping isn't working (y'all I was crazy for even thinking it) but TNG is. He just told me \"I think they should be allowed to intermarry\". God only knows who he was referencing, but it gave my mom and me a good giggle\n\nEdit: it's 8.15 am here and I think we can call it successfully getting through the night on his part. TNG has been his pick of choice but thank you all for keeping me and my family company through the dark hours. We know he's definitely not going to get better, and it's going to probably still be rough, but these stories are all so seriously beautiful, please keep sharing. It's been a rough year in general for a whole lot of us, it sounds like, but somehow it seems like there's enough love to go around (and I know that's STUPID cheesy but it seems very true to me right now). Love you all, thank you all. ",

Doesn't necessarily have to be openings of movies but it's common trope.",

        "content": "I've been watching a bunch of ninja movies, suprisingly not a very big genre. And even less good ones that stand out. But this movie's one of the good ones. It's a Hong Kong action comedy about a ninja who travles to china to complete a mission, and the ninja is a youthful Hiroyuki Sanada who has hit it big these days.\n\n\n\nAnyway, this being a HK movie about a ninja would make you think it's probably not gonna be that good. Wrong. WRONG!! They lean into it ***hard***. The ninja fight scenes and special effects fucking rule. Everything you want a ninja to do, they do it in this movie. Every old ninja tool and trick gets refrenced.\n\n\n\nBut even better than that are the fight scenes. It just goes and goes and goes and goes. They know you're here for the action and they fucking deliver.\n\n\n\nThe story is eh, but you're not really here for the story when it comes to these old kung fu movies.",

        "title": "Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful films I've watched",
        "content": "I think that Guillermo del Toro will become one of my most favourite producers. He captivated me with \"The Shape of Water\" and he did it again with Pan's Labyrinth. \n\nWhat more can I say about this beautiful film? Everything is phenomenal. The production, the casting, the colors, the practical effects, the music. This is a dark, fairytale full of magic, love and cruelty. It depicts the ugliness of our real world while establishing a mystical universe which is dark and mischievous. \n\nOfelia touched my heart. Her love towards her mother and brother was pure and real. Ivana Baquero did a fantastic job. Her expressions were so spot-on and she captured Ofelia's emotions in a raw way. The rest of the characters were just as remarkable, I loved Faun's mysterious personality and the actor's gestures and body language really brought life to the character (not to mention the amazing makeup and prosthetics). Mercedes was another character whom I felt a strong connection with and as for Captain Vidal, I hated him with a deep passion. Kudos to Sergi L\u00f3pez for making me dislike his character so much. \n\nThe depiction of siblings' love really touched me. As someone with a younger sister, I could relate with Ofelia and Mercedes' love towards their brothers. They would give everything to keep them safe no matter what. \n\nThe film really liked to remind us that our world is full of cruel, sadistic people like Vidal. Unfortunately for us, real life is not a fairytale. Sometimes we have to sacrifice many things to achieve a modest life. Ofelia's mother had to endure a wedding which didn't make her truly happy but by doing so, she thought that she would secure a better life for her and her children. Although the fantasy creatures in the movie were mysterious and creepy at times, it was the real people of the movie that gave me the chills. The scene with the farmer and his son made me wince and scream in anger. It is painful to remember that people like Vidal exist, people who find pleasure in causing pain to others and who will not hesitate to do despicable things without blinking an eye. \n\nBut despite the sad tone, there was also a bright side. With hatred there is also love, with despair, hope. Ofelia, Mercedes and Dr. Ferreiro reminded me that people are capable of good things too. These characters showed selflessness and kindness and these actions had a big impact on the film. \n\nThe ending made me a sobbing mess. Emotional yet beautiful. I loved the way it connected with the beginning of the film and how bittersweet it feels. The whole movie in general has a special place in my heart and it has become one of my most favorite movies of the year. I will definitely rewatch it but not too soon. For now, Ofelia and her story have left traces on my heart. ",
