I just want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude for your kindness and support over the past few months-it truly means the world to me. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about Sing Sing and the process of creating Like a Bird. However, I want to preface that I cannot speak on behalf of A24 or their team, as l'm not involved in their decision-making. That said, I'm more than happy to share insights about my experience writing the song and everything that happened within that creative space. If you haven't heard Like a Bird yet, would mean the world to me if you did and feel free to check out my debut album called SEA/SONS that I release in 23\\\\u2019. It features Gary Clark Jr. and Mavis Staples. Also, feel free to follow me on social media (@abrahamalexander) to stay updated on everything happening along the way! Looking forward to the conversations\n\nBest,\n\nAbraham",

I always thought he made that prayer up.

He hears the song at the drugstore and that\u2019s why he says that at the dinner table. ",

        "content": "Something about this movie makes me always have to come back for a re-watch every year or so. The acting of every character is so unique from each other, they all just feel grounded and like real people. I can't recall a single character that didn't feel like it was necessary to be in the movie.\n\nI will always watch this movie and just be waiting for Ben Mendelsohn to be back on screen. He plays that character so well and you just can't take your eyes off of him when he's on screen, he's like somehow made a scumbag druggie seem captivating. \n\nI watched this movie before I ever saw sopranos and I love seeing James Gandolfini in this movie as well, he's such a small part but he plays this older exhausted mob/assassin guy so damn well it's amazing. \n\nAnd of course Brad Pitt fits his role like a glove, he doesn't need to move outside his acting comfort zone because his role seems like it was written with him in mind. \n\nScott Mcnairy has such a unique voice and accent in this movie I can't not listen to every word out of his mouth. His role throughout the movie seems like a series of unfortunate events that brings all these fantastic characters to screen in such a great pace. \n\nOne scene I cant ever get over is the gambling robbery, something about the way the camera follows Russell through the back and the alley and out to the car, the sound design is just one of my favorite parts, it feels like youre right there. \n\nThis movie is a must re-watch for me every so often, because I know how the characters and the sound design and the filming will always just keep me in the movie and this story the whole time.

I also don't mind the shakycam in those movies too as at least you can focus on what's going on in those scenes.\n\nBut one thing I will say is how it kickstarted shaky cam in action movies for the worse. After Bourne Supremacy, every filmmaker decided to start including shakycam in action movies. Batman Begins was an early example of shakycam in action movies and then we had dozens more that had shaky cam until the trend finally went away once people found out that people couldn't replicate Bourne's shakycam. Even in The Bourne Identity, there was some shaky cam (especially the first act) in that film also.\n\nI ain't talking about The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Jason Bourne (2016) as we talk about those an another day in a separate post. But for a while, shaky cam in action movies were a huge trend around Hollywood.",

        "content": "Hello! I really like finding out peoples favourite movies on specific actors because I like to see the wide variety of picks people have and learning of underrated gems. \n\nSome of his movies like The French Connection (1971), Unforgiven (1992), The Conversation (1974), and Enemy of the State (1998) are my favourites from him and he's become one of my favourite actors.\n\nHis good guy roles and bad guy roles are both fantastic but I think my personal preference would be when he's the villain because he's so good at it.\n\nHis portrayal of Lex Luthor is also my favourite in Superman (1978).\n\nThis year he'll have been retired for 21 years, with his last movie being released in 2004.\n\nI think that he only has one credited voice acting role which would be General Mandible in Antz (1998).  \n\n\nWhat are your favourites?",

(It absolutely is)\n\nThis got me thinking about older black and white films as many still hold up quite well today.\n\nSo, what are your guy's favourite black and White films? My choice is It's a Wonderful Life (1946) ",

This is not typical compared to the other reviews, where are spread out by a couple of days to even weeks. \n\nThe reviews seen to have 3 thumbs ups and a single thumbs down.\n\nIt's sus considering how the movie isn't recent.

Channing Tatum also delivers an incredible performance. such a great movie overall and i wish it got more recognition because wow.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cringed in a scene more than when he meets Marge at the hotel. But then when you find out he was lying about allll of that. for what? To sleep with Marge? Pretty hard to stoop any lower. \n\nAlso side note; does all the fast food you see them eating in this movie make anyone else feel nauseous? Lol\n\nJust a brilliant movie. ",
