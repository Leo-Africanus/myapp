Here to answer your questions!\n\nIf you want to know more about us here are our credits\n\n* St\u00e9phane\u2005Naz\u00e9: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623408/?ref\\_=fn\\_all\\_nme\\_1](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623408/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1)\n* Lo\u00efc Mireault: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12787058/?ref\\_=fn\\_all\\_nme\\_1](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12787058/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1)\n* Kevin Sears: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3010149/?ref\\_=nv\\_sr\\_srsg\\_0\\_tt\\_4\\_nm\\_4\\_in\\_0\\_q\\_kevin%2520sears](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3010149/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_kevin%2520sears)\n\nHere\u2019s a taste of what we tackled on **Superman**:\n\nWe collaborated closely with director James Gunn and VFX Supervisor St\u00e9phane Ceretti to reimagine Superman\u2019s world, not just with spectacle, but with nuance, heart, and technical innovation.\n\n\\-Krypto the Superdog. Inspired by James Gunn\u2019s dog Ozu, we captured every subtle gesture, emotion, and furry leap to ensure Krypto felt like a genuine canine first, only one who happened to have superpowers.\n\n\\-The Fortress of Solitude: We designed the Fortress using more than 6000 reflective crystals, each one a challenge in shading, lighting, and rendering.\n\n\\-4D Gaussian Splatting: A first in feature film, we used 4D Gaussian Splat to create Superman\u2019s Kryptionian parents hologram.\n\n\\-And also the Engineer\u2019s nanite power suit, SupermanRobots, Lex vs Krypto fight scene and more! You can learn about our work here: [https://www.framestore.com/work/superman](https://www.framestore.com/work/superman) \n\nWe\u2019ll be back today (Tuesday 8/16) at 3PM ET to answer your burning questions. In the meantime, ask away, we\u2019re excited to dive into the murk and magic of bringing Superman to life! Ask us anything!",

More dumb jokes. \n\nIMO they really did an amazing job bringing back the vibe of the originals. So freaking refreshing. \n\nLeslie Nielsen fucking crushed that role. ",

How many action movies can you count where people chase eachother with tuktuks?!\n\n\nLike I said in the title what really makes this movie stand out to me is the fact that Tony's really hitting his opponents and it genuinely shows. The stunt guys are always wearing big wigs, hats, beanies, or layered clothing to hide the protective pads their wearing. It's nuts. The fight choreography is gorgeous in this, Tony Jaa's movement is so fluid and rhythmic, he really brought out the beauty of Muay Thai.\n\n\nThe story is also pretty decent, the simple story of a country bumpkin having to team up with a scummy city slicker to return hope back to their village is pretty cute.\n\n\nI think it's a tie for me between the fight club battles and the final fight for the best fight scene in the movie",

        "content": "I've actually always enjoyed Nick Nolte as an actor but I'm not sure if he got up to much in later years.  One of the last films I remember seeing him in was Three Fugitives (and I was happy to be reminded about Prince of Tides ... phew).  I went in blind on Warrior, only knowing that Tom Hardy was in it and was shocked to see Nick.  More shocking was how honest and sad his portrayal of Paddy Conlon was. The Casino and hotel scene were both so very different and so gut wrenching.  It was hard.\n\nI know the movie wasn't necessarily about him but I thought the ending was a little too Karate Kid in the way it dismissed his demons so cleanly and simply had him looking on like a proud dad. \n\nAnyway, just finished and it's still raw and with me and thought I'd share.",

I never had a father figure growing up, so I don\u2019t have much to look to as an example.\n\nI recently watched the new Superman movie and loved how important the dad was in his life \u2014 it really hit me hard and gave me some inspiration.\n\nI\u2019d love some movie recommendations that show a good father and son relationship \u2014 even if it\u2019s just the normal day-to-day stuff, or even if one of them is going through trouble. Basically, anything that can give me some ideas of what a positive father-son bond can look like.\n\nYou guys always seem to come through really well with answers!\n\nThanks!",
