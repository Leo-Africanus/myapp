By the end I felt like my emotions and trust were violated by David Lynch.\n\nThe edible peaked right as Rita opened the blue box and my soul left my body. The last 15-20 minutes was the craziest mindfuck I\u2019ve ever experienced in a movie. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. Is Mulholland Drive even real? Are we real?? I had to stop thinking of Betty and Rita as real people for the longest time. It\u2019s officially one of my favorite movies ever made, hands down. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this makes sense but I just need to get this out there.",

The difference in treatment between rodents (rats and squirrels), and he also revels in the nickname awarded to him by the french (the jew hunter).\n\nHe also describes his ability to think like two different beasts, the hawk and the rat, which make him perfect for his role. For most of the film, he is positioned as a hawk as it\u2019s beneficial but by the end we see his ability to align his identity with that of the rat to carve his name on the right side of history.\n\nI also noticed the constant readjustment of his badges throughout the film which I attributed to his receptivity to public opinion and general desire for respect. It makes why he\u2019d prefer to be seen as a double agent rather than a soldier turned halfway through the war.\n",

        "title": "I was NOT expecting Pan\u2019s Labyrinth to end like that",
        "content": "This movie has been on my watchlist for a long time and I finally got around to seeing it tonight.\n\nI thought the special effects were rly well done, especially the CGI given the time this\ncame out.\n\nI also loved the way this is more of a war period piece than a straight up fantasy, and how it blends aspects of fantasy into its very ground story!\n\nI was honestly expecting for it to be like a Tim Burton-esque \u201cLabyrinth [circa 1986]\u201d where after she first goes into the labyrinth it takes her on a magical journey, but I was pleasantly surprised how much of the storyline is just between the drama of fascists and the resistance. The moments of fantasy act as a nice addition to how Ofelia sees the world as a coping mechanism to the trauma around her (war, her mother\u2019s sickness, etc.)\n\nI am so curious as to what was real and what was just in Ofelia\u2019s head, because Vidal physically picked up the baby Groot fetus thing and threw it into the fire\u2026 but then the Pale Man wasn\u2019t there from Vidal\u2019s perspective when he chased her through the labyrinth, so can only she see these spiritual entities or..?\n\nI also just.. I was not expecting for her to die at the end let alone getting shot point blank like that. I haven\u2019t been this shocked watching a movie in a long time, I was lying down and when that happened I shot my head up and sat up in pure disbelief, mouth agape, eyes watering. The ending made me cry fr seeing her in the afterlife reunited with her family and having the \u201cprophecy\u201d fulfilled for the \u201cprincess to return to the land of spirits/leave the land of mortals\u201d wrapped up the fantasy aspects of the movie in such a way that made me rethink the meaning of everything fantasy-related that I just watched. \n\nWhat i didn\u2019t like about the movie was that there are a few little blunders with the audio syncing  and also seeing someone who\u2019s dead breathe for a slit second mildly takes me out of the movie for a sec, but other than that I give nothing but praise for this film. Praise for the costume designers who adorned the rich environments that brought colorful life into each scene, esp. the fantasy set pieces! Praise for the adult acting and the NOT god-awful child acting much\u00edsimas gracias a Ivana Baquero por darnos un gran performance fr. Praise to how Del Toro worked his craft and made such a unique, eerie, curious, intense work of art that pushes boundaries and major took risks with its characters. Mad respect to u for that Sr. del Toro. What a wonderfully melancholic movie, I can\u2019t wait to see it again with actual subtitles this time when i buy the blu-ray\n ",

        "title": "Kevin Costner's Americana Filmography",
        "content": "Kevin Costner has built a career that is threaded through with Americana: the western frontier, baseball, football, the American flag, the pursuit of dreams and excellence, etc. These are themes that you find throughout Costner's career.\n\nHe has made eight Westerns and four baseball movies. These make up the bulk of his Americana filmography and consist of some of his most famous and critically acclaimed movies; Dances with Wolves and Field of Dreams, in particular.\n\nBeyond this, however, you find Americana in many more Costner films. Fandango (1985) is about a road trip, an iconic American experience. American Flyers (1985) is about overcoming the odds and personal achievement in a bike race across America. The Untouchables (1987) is about Elliot Ness (Costner) going after Al Capone, America's most famous gangster. JFK (1991) is about the assassination of the American President. The Bodyguard (1992) is about a singer being protected by an ex-Secret Service agent, played by Costner. The Postman (1997) is about a postman- an iconic American figure- inspiring hope in post-apocalyptic America. Thirteen Days (2000) is about an American political crisis. 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001) is about a casino robbery wherein the thieves dress as Elvis, the quintessential American rock star. The Guardian (2006) is about the U.S. Coast Guard. Mr. Brooks (2007) is about a businessman with a serial killer alter ego and his businessman persona's attire is similar to the attire worn by a 50's businessman, an iconic American figure. Swing Vote (2008) is about one man- a blue collar guy played by Costner- having the power to determine the American presidency. The Company Men (2010) is about American businessmen struggling with losing their jobs. Man of Steel (2013) is about Superman, the quintessential American superhero. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014) and 3 Days to Kill (2014) are both about CIA agents (Costner is the mentor in the former and the main agent in the latter). Draft Day (2014) is about football, America's biggest sport. McFarland, USA (2015) is about a former football coach (played by Costner) turning seven disappointing students into a winning cross-country team, another story about athletes overcoming the odds and achieving victory and their dreams. Hidden Figures (2016) is about three African-American mathematicians helping NASA and John Glenn launch into space while dealing with racial and gender discrimination, a story that is about overcoming the odds and achieving excellence on multiple fronts. Finally, The Highwaymen (2019) is about two Texas Rangers pursuing and taking down Bonnie and Clyde, a quasi-western wherein Costner plays a cowboy out of time pursuing two of America's most legendary outlaws during the Great Depression.\n\nThree of Costner's movies have \"American\" in the title (although one is a sequel). Another of his movies has \"USA\" in the title. Three of his movies have the American flag on their poster (four if you count the NFL logo on the Draft Day poster; five if you count the red, white and blue color scheme on the American Flyers poster).\n\nAll in all, it's clear that Kevin Costner's career is a very American one. American iconography, symbols, stories, jobs, legends, eras, beliefs and creeds abound throughout it. \n\nI don't know how intentional this was on his part. My guess is that, for the most part, he did this on purpose and curated a career filled with Americana.",

        "content": "I been a longtime fan of these paperbacks.  But only one of them, Relic, was ever made into a movie.  Not great but not bad.  But that was a long time ago and nothing since.  These authors have a wide selections of mysteries, some with interesting reoccurring characters, set in places from the frigid Arctic to the deepest jungles.  Better yet, these  stories usually end up having twist endings with rational explanations, more or less, for the unspeakable horrors encountered.  And yet no movies to groove on.  The unconventional FBI agent Pendergast would have made an interesting franchise character.  (I think he could have been played by a young Johnny Depp twenty years ago.)  I really like Thunderhead and Still Life with Crows.  Which books would you like to see made into movies?  ",
