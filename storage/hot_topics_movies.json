Which is why it's surprising when something completely unexpected happens in the movie, not because it's something actually unexpected, but because the trailers and marketing completely omitted it. Sometimes even entire characters will be mostly absent from the marketing but turn out to be more important than some celebrities in the film that got top billing. Often this isn't even intentional, the people in charge of marketing just prioritized other things.\n\nSo what plot points/characters were you surprised weren't spoiled by the trailers?",

Right out of the gate, the opening hostage scene at the grocery store pulls you in with its serious 80's action movie vibes. Whereas a movie like Commando purposely hit you with funny one-liners, Stallone's sleepwalking expressions through this movie allows his one-liners to come across with a more serious intention. We learn absolutely nothing about Stallone's character other than the fact that he means business when taking out bad guys. And the main henchman in this flick, I swear was a bad guy in every other 80s and early 90s movie. At times, this movie reminded me of a horror version of Robocop. Looking it up, looks like it came out a year before Robo. There were some serious horror vibes in this movie, especially the hospital chase that reminded me of Halloween 2 with Michael Myers. Cherry on top is when Brigitte Nielsen's character asks Stallone's character what he will do next after getting through this ordeal, and he says something like, probably work on another case.",

The small monsters are **literally** the Chitauri? \n\nI finished the movie 20 minutes ago and I could not tell you what happens in the first third of it. \n\nIt\u2019s riddled with 2010s era action movie tropes. Hero saying \u201coh come on, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Dafuq. I don\u2019t need him to speak Ancient Greek but can Perseus please not sound like a Will Smith hero circa 2005? If Perseus had said \u201cI\u2019m putting together a crew for one last job\u201d it wouldn\u2019t have felt out of place for this movie. \n\nCan you guys think of some movies as generic as this?

Those crucial years she could have taken advantage of the fame and exposure didn't happen and when she did come back, she got a rhinoplasty which modified her face and made her unrecognizable. \n\nI watch \"Dirty Dancing\", a formulaic yet engrossing romantic dance drama, and as sexy and charismatic as Patrick Swayze is, it is Jennifer Grey who keeps it together. She's the main protagonist, she's playing the \"ugly duckling\" who blossoms as a dancer and sizzles with Swayze onscreen, their relationship going from tense and hostile into affection, admiration and love. Grey's Baby is easily identifiable, any girl (or boy) can connect with her character.\n\nThe more I watch Dirty Dancing, the more I like Jennifer Grey. You don't see many heroines like her on film today. Some of her lines are cheesy and corny but Grey commits to it. I couldn't dislike her. I kept wanting to know what she'd do next, her character's clumsiness made her endearing instead of unapproachable like Cynthia Rhodes' Penny.",

British officer Harry Faversham refuses to join an expedition to rescue General Charles Gordon, the British-appointed governor of Sudan, and resigns from his post. Viewing his withdrawal as cowardice, three friends and his fianc\u00e9e, Ethne, give him a white feather, the symbol of cowardice. Ethne then breaks off their engagement.\n\nWhen the expedition is defeated by the Mahdi\u2019s forces and British officers are taken prisoner, Harry travels to Sudan to rescue them. There, he saves his friends, who are hostages of the Mahdi. His friends, acknowledging his bravery, return the feathers as apologies. Ethne also gives back the white feather she had given him.\n\nIf I were the protagonist, I would not accept Ethne\u2019s apology \u2014 she, who never fought in the war, remained comfortably in England, and called me a coward. I would reject her excuses and refuse reconciliation. Refusing to fight in a senseless colonialist war is not cowardice.\n\nJack, one of Harry\u2019s friends, discovers Harry was his savior by touching his face. He releases Ethne from their engagement, as she had become engaged to another friend of her former fianc\u00e9. After a memorial ceremony, Harry and Ethne hold hands and renew their commitment.\n\nI only wish the protagonist had rejected her and left for another country, denying her a second chance.\n\nHeath Ledger plays Harry Faversham, and Kate Hudson portrays his fianc\u00e9e, Ethne",

        "content": "For me, I'm not a fan of Jim Carrey's work, but I really like \"The Majestic\". I was really caught in his ability to play a dramatic role. I only watched it as Martin Landau played his father in it, and I have fond memories of Mr. Landau in \"Space: 1999\" as a child.\n\nThis also begs the question of avoiding movies due to starring an actor one doesn't like. I'm sure I've missed on some gems because an actor whose acting style annoys me is in it, or their personal beliefs/behaviours go against mine so much it doesn't matter how good an actor they are...I won't see a film with them in it.",

Ghost World, which is an interesting indie movie. Bad Santa, an underrated black comedy, and Art School Confidential, which from what I read, is bad. \n\nI notice that after Art School Confidential, which was released 19 years ago, he hasn't made a film since and has been really reclusive.\n\nSo I wonder what has happened to Zwigoff and what he has been up to?",

I also liked the end and how subversive it was. So I was pretty surprised to see that the entire Internet seems to agree it's the worst thing since unsliced bread. I've read the complaints and I must agree, people who have seen the first two movies don't wonder if it's all real because they know they really have powers, and fans of the trilogy just find the end underwhelming. So, in a way, the best way to enjoy this movie is to either watch it before the other two, or to not watch them. Does anyone else feel this way?",

He observes the dynamics within his family, from his rebellious brothers who leave the mines, his sister who falls for the pastor of the village chapel, his kind sister in law, and his dignified elderly parents, played by Donald Crisp and Sara Allgood. \n\nThe film was a decent watch, a mature family drama. Huw, being a child, is a accessible lead one can follow, one can identify with the bullying he suffers from his coleagues and his snooty teacher, whose comeuppance is a particular highlight. Still, I did struggle in caring about Maureen O'Hara's lovestruck sister and Walter Pidgeon's handsome parishioner. \n\nSentimental, though I didn't find it moving until the ending which, I admit, was  knockout of sadness and tragedy.",
