        "content": "I was watching a movie last night and for what feels like the 50th time I encountered an overused joke that didn't get any reaction from me.\n\nThe set up for the joke was that a character was using their voice activated GPS and they were trying to input their destination.\n\nThen the \"joke\" started. The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said \"do you want to go to burger king?\"\n\n\"No Burbank\"\n\n\"Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?\"\n\n\"No Burbank!\" \n\n\"Destination set for baja mexico\"\n\nWow, so funny/s. I've seen this joke so many times but it just doesn't do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it's been so overused by this point that it's overstayed it's welcome.\n\nAre there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?",

I didn't trust any of the click-bait articles I found online, and figured if anyone should be trusted, it's an obscure crowd sourced wiki called [Cinemorgue](https://cinemorgue.fandom.com/wiki/Cinemorgue_Wiki).\n\n  \nTo spare everyone the ironically gory details of manual-entry text clean up, and partially because I wanted to doodle in Illustrator, I made a summary of the top 8.

        "content": "Tim Curry. Absolute legend. Rocky Horror, Annie, Clue and Muppet Treasure Island are all famous roles that come to mind.\n\nAlthough, I feel like I only know him for playing zany roles. I'd love the opportunity to see what he's capable of outside of the more comedic performances, and watch him in a straight acting role.\n\nFrom interviews, he seems like a softly spoken thoughtful chap, so it would be great to see the emotional depth he can muster in a top acting role.\n\nSo, what are his best acting roles that weren't zany? \n\nFeel free to suggest some lesser known zany roles of his as well, if you feel that deserves some more recognition.\n\nP.s this is not knocking Curry in any way, I simply want to see that other side of him.",

I know it's one that people often look for / post about not being able to find (because I often look for / read those posts) so now's your chance. Who knows how long it'll be available. If you've also been trying to watch this for years, bump it to the top of your list!",

Anyone else get like that with any movies or shows? \n\nThe same can be applied to music too and other entertainment,but i can make a separate post for that.  \n\nLike how did I go 21 years after it's release day  and never saw it? \n\nNot knowing those quotes or lyrics existed  and now my life is better with them (and also  I get to hyper fixate for a few days ha) \n\nIf anyone has any recommendations, I like movies with themes like \n\nA winters tale( 2014 ), \nOld historic events or tragedies , \nRomantic victorian period pieces , \nMoving indie films .\n\nThanks !

        "content": "So, last night I made a joke to my brother that I was gonna get high and watch some foreign lesbian love story. Then I did precisely that - 3 grams of edibles later and I rented \"Portrait of a lady on Fire\"\n\nThe movie had good reviews, and I'm still treating it like a joke at first. It's about 5-10 minutes into the film I realized every assumption I MAY have had about the movie was far, far off. and any notions of it being like a joke turned into a joke themselves.\n\nThe shots of the movie were\u00a0**so utterly beautiful it sometimes felt like I didn't even have the right to look at the screen.**\u00a0The\u00a0**characters were so utterly realistic it sometimes felt like I was genuinely invading their privacy simply by watching them.**\u00a0I related to them. I liked them. It is the only film I have seen where\u00a0**the cinematography was so good it provided a theater-like experience at home.**\n\nMy point is, I went into a movie expected a joke, and instead got a masterpiece every film student in creation should analyze thoroughly.\n\n**By the end, I was left thinking \"Jesus, that was so, so much better than it had any right to be.\"**\n\nWhat movie was this for you?",
