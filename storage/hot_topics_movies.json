The main character gets what he wants or at least what he thought he wanted but at the cost of losing his humanity and essentially becoming corrupted himself. The ending shot of him walking and breaking down into tears is one of the best ending scenes ever in my opinion. \n\nWhat other movies have bittersweet endings?",

Just to give you an idea of how popular she was, her role as Arwen wasn't that big yet she always had her face in the movies' posters which shows how much of a star she was.",

If I just lost my hearing and had to start over my fundamentals of communication AND lost my gateway to music among other things, I\u2019d likely lose my mind and Riz Ahmed\u2019s performance was so powerful to me.\nSecond, Bo Burnham\u2019s Eighth Grade. I watched this twice, one time being a year after I finished middle school. It was too relatable and the feeling of social anxiety in the digital age that the lead goes through has likely made me block the movie from my memory each time. I probably worded this weird but lmk if you have any self-imposed horror picks!:)",

        "content": "On my wife\u2019s recommendation, we watched \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d with our six-year-old girl. She remembered enjoying it as a kid, so we gave it a try.\n\nMaybe this is just a recent bias, but this might be the best family film ever made.\n\nI really love how it\u2019s both simple and complex. Sure, you can enjoy it as a \u201cboy and his alien\u201d story, but its commentary on Cold War paranoia is where it really shines . It\u2019s masterful storytelling for sure.\n\nThe last act is just fantastic. It\u2019s been a long time since a movie, animated or not, has made me feel so deeply. The last shot put the biggest smile on my face.\n\nI think this will become a favorite in our house. I\u2019m a little upset it took me so long to see it, but better late than never.",
