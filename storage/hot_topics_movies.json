They need to plant an idea in this guy's head so they go in a dream within a dream within a dream and Leo deals with some personal stuff along the way, its just a sci-fi heist movie, like Ocean's Eleven but a little trippy. I had always heard about this movies reputation for being overly complicated and if you look up an \"Inception references in media\" video on YouTube, every reference is poking fun at how complicated it is and how nobody gets it but like... it's actually not that hard to understand?\n\nFunnily enough, South Parks parody of it kind of proves my point because they make fun of how characters are constantly explaining stuff but to me that's what made it easy to get. The fact every time they did anything someone was explaining it made it really easy to follow.\n\nThe only part that's really even up in the air is the ending but I believe in happy endings and the evidence points to him being awake.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is, was this movies convulted-ness overblown or is everyone kind of stupid?",

The reviews seem to agree with me on this but (admittedly anecdotally) they have seemed to have next to no cultural impact, especially compared to some of the great IP movies of the last 15-20 years including Nolan Batman, Iron Man, James Bond etc. Almost nobody I know (I\u2019m in my early 20s) seems to have watched them and I never see them referenced in social media. IMO these movies are outstanding popcorn flicks with the right blend of nostalgia for existing fans and genuine quality for newcomers. My question is am I wrong to put these movies in the class of the others I mentioned or if not, why do they seem to have made 0 dent to popular culture.",

        "title": "Movie that takes place after a super villian succeeds?",
        "content": "I was wondering if there are any movies that are set after a super villain's plot to destroy the world has succeeded. I'm not talking about a sequel where the first movie ends with the villain winning. I'm looking for a movie where it starts in the after math of the villain's win and we learn about what happened and then maybe the protagonists try to fix the world or the villain's story can just be in the background of something entirely unrelated happening. Does this exist or did I just come up with a new movie idea??\n\nEdit:\n\nI appreciate everyone who's trying to keep others to my criteria but it's not that serious. It's fun seeing how everyone interprets my ask. But I do want to add some background and clarification. What initially got me curious about this is I was watching Kingsman: The Secret Service. In that Samuel Jackson's character sets a plan in motion to make everyone hyper violent and start killing each other but the Kingsman come in and thwart his plan. So it got me curious to see what the world would have looked like had they failed to stop him. I don't want any sequels at all. I'd like it to be a standalone film (other mediums are ok too), or the start of a series. I want a majority of the story to be set after the heroes fail. If Avengers: Endgame was a standalone movie, it'd be a perfect example. \n\nHowever, a good example I forgot about is an audio book called Third Eye by Felicia Day. It's essentially the story of if Harry Potter failed to beat Voldemort. In the prologue we get the showdown between the child wizard and the villain and the villain wins and takes over the world. Then it jumps forward like 20 years and we see what how the world looks under this dark lords rule.\n\nHope this clears things up!\n\nAlso, thanks for all the suggestions! There have been a lot of great ones so far!",

        "title": "Chasing Amy is interesting....",
        "content": "(SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH)\n\nI am not going to talk about the premises because this is for people who have seen this film.\n\nSo I want to say that this film is a very solid film like an 8/10 but oh boy is it interesting.\n\nI want to state that I think basically every performance is ether pretty good or very good. Jason lee fits the character perfectly,joey Lauren Adams is also incredibly good but can get a little annoying on the ears(not her fault I am aware,that is just her voice but still), Kevin smith has this small but incredible scene and Ben Affleck...well. At first I was kinda mixed on him since I wanted him to be more pathetic but as it turns out. He is sooooo pathetic I just didn't realise it. His performance went from pretty alright to really great. I love genuine the car starts out but as it goes on he voice sounds...well it sounds like he is begging more,like he is trying to kinda manipulate her. It's one of the best scenes in the film( you know what the best is). So overall great performances\n\nSpeaking of Ben Affleck's character I fucking love that he doesn't make up with Amy. It made the 10x better but I am more mixed on the friendship with Jason Lee's character. In one hand Jason lee is kinda correct on how the relationship is changing their friendship with eachother. On the other he is kinda of huge ass but the film never out Wright tells you he hates Amy,here me out. In the the beging Amy and him have this conversation about eating pussy and their laughing their asses off. I think this scene shows how Jason Lee's doesn't hate Amy he is afraid what she will do benn Affleck's and his friendship it's so interesting but... I don't see these guys as friends AT ALL. I know thats kinda of the point but one scene or flashback of them being friends would be nice.\n\n\nThat's most of what I want to say tell me your thoughts!",

        "title": "\"Manchester by the Sea\" is the perfect depiction of how depression kills even when the outcome isn't suicide. A lot of times, there is no escape from mental illness or grief.",
        "content": "I just watched this movie for the first time and I'm both in awe and absolutely devastated.\n\nI've seen a lot of comments from people asking \"What was the point of the movie? There was no progress or character growth\"...yet that was exactly the point of the movie. A lot of movies these days depict depression or mental illness as something that a character wakes up one day and snaps out of it. Movies treat mental illness as something that eventually has a complete resolution and that \"character growth\" is depicted as the character resolving their mental illness. But a lot of times, the reality is there is no escaping mental illness and there is no resolution. You're stuck. You \"can't beat it\".\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder, which is a long-term form of depression with highs and lows, life feels like you have a dark cloud hanging over your head endlessly and permanently. Lee's sunken eyes and spirit and the feeling of a man just waiting to die resonated very deeply with me and which is why this movie affected me to the core. Lee was in a state of psychological paralysis.\n\nThe harsh reality is that depression requires immense effort on behalf of the person to treat. I was in therapy for around 3-4 years and progress was very slow before things got better. Yet even now I don't think I'm cured but depression and mental illness didn't win. Before therapy, life felt exactly like Lee's in the movie. Were it not for therapy and a support system of family and friends, I might have ended things a while back.\n\nIn Lee's case, and in a lot of cases for so many people, depression and mental illness do win. They win even if the person doesn't resort to suicide. Suicide isn't the only depiction of mental illness winning. Lee was a dead-man walking. When Randi tells him \"you can't just die\"...she didn't mean literally. She meant Lee's soul was dying. And Affleck's acting nailed the \"dying on the inside\" reality for so many people. No ambition, no goals, nothing to look forward to, and lack of ability to commit to anything that requires any sort of emotional or mental effort on his part.\n\nI also understand the janitor job. It's a job that doesn't require any degree of investment yet at the same time I think the janitor job gives Lee a sense of helping other people when he himself couldn't help his own children. I don't think picking the janitor job was random. I think the janitor job perhaps made Lee somehow feel better about himself subconsciously because it involves a certain degree of fixing different issues people have inside their homes which could contrast the helplessness he felt not being able to save his children from the fire inside their home. It also gave Lee a sense of organization or routine, which a lot of depressed people need to feel somewhat in control.\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to what many people say, Lee did show character growth and progress. Lee saying that he wants to get a house with an extra room for Patrick to visit is growth. Lee at first somewhat considering accepting guardianship and then seeking out better guardianship for Patrick shows growth and responsibility. Lee taking care of his brother's funeral processions, quitting his old job to be with Patrick, attempting to look for a new job in Manchester before deciding to move back to Boston are all signs of growth. But the reality is that growth with mental illness is very slow that is almost seems non-existent.\n\nNot to mention, the hope his nephew gave him for a better and more hopeful life mirrors my own experience with how my own nieces bring hope into my world despite everything and reminds me of lyrics by Sufjan Stevens: \u201cMy brother had a daughter, The beauty that she brings, illumination\u201d\u2026Nephews and nieces are a blessing to our world and what we carry from our siblings after they\u2019re gone.\n\nIn Lee's situation, continuing to exist is the most beautiful and commendable form of resistance. \n\nWhat a beautiful masterpiece. Easily one of my favourite moves of all time.",

        "title": "\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" is SO much better than \"When Nature Calls.\"",
        "content": "I just watched both movies back to back after not seeing them since I was a kid back in the 2000's. I remember really liking \"Pet Detective\" and feeling let down by \"When Nature Calls\" because it failed to improve upon or at least be as good as it's predecessor.\n\nThe Miami and detective mystery setting of PD lends itself better to Ace Ventura. In PD, Ace Ventura is annoying and strange to everyone around him, but he gets away with it because he is actually a good detective\u200b. Also, Ace isn't as much of a bad ass in WNC. He can catch a bullet with his teeth, but he can't dodge a sphere? His character just seemed inconsistent in the sequel.\n\nDoes anyone agree? Disagree? Let me know!\n\nEdit: I do agree that WNC has a lot of great lines and some great scenes. It did get a few cackles from me. I guess I just prefer PD overall.",

        "content": "I saw John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cThe Thing\u201d when I was maybe 7 years old. The scene with the dogs lived rent free in my head for my whole life as the definition of nightmare fuel. I was a grown man before I could muster the courage to watch it again. Love the movie now, but the way the images from that scene stayed with me as a kid\u2026nothing else like it. No idea why my parents let me watch that so young.",

        "title": "Had some other expectations with this one, and now I am crying. Dead Poets Society(1989)",
        "content": "I watched many shorts and reels of some of the popular scenes of this movie, my expectations were that this would be a light hearted feel good movie, which was also the case for it &gt;!But the last 30 minutes were heart breaking, I didn't expected this movie to take such a sudden and tragic turn.!&lt;\n\nAnyways I loved the movie. Although it may have slow pace, but I really enjoyed the moments in that pace, if it had fast pace then I may not have liked the movie that much. Also many indian movies also seems like directly or indirectly inspired from this movie like Tare Zameen par(2007),  3-Idiots(2009), Tamasha(2015), Udaan(2010) and many more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01vt7ls3urag1.jpg?width=183&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a3ae0b9172d7cebb89df6319fa3e23df7c0390\n\n",
