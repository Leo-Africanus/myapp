No crazy paradoxes or multiverse headaches. That alone makes it hit way harder than any other time travel movie.\n\nMost time travel movies make you wish you could go back and fix stuff. About Time makes you wanna enjoy what you\u2019ve got right now. \n\nHIGHLY recommend. ",

I was taught about the holocaust in school, but there's something different about the experience of watching a film that offers a glimpse into it\n\nI believe this film is more important than ever now and it is easily Spielberg's magnum opus.

The first time I saw that scene when I was 11, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing and in agony. It still makes me laugh like an idiot even now;\n- Blazing Saddles, the infamous farting scene. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I watched that scene;\n- Scooby-Doo (the first live-actiom film), the part where Shaggy is farting and then lets loose a good one, unaware that Daphne is standing behind him;\n- Johnny English, when the title character shows the archbishop's bottom to the whole world;\n- Step Brothers, no part in particular as the whole film is just gleefully childish and outrageously funny;\n- Dumb and Dumber, the part where Harry has the worst case of the shits after Lloyd spikes his coffee with laxatives.\n\nFeel free to share the films that made you laugh the hardest.",

        "content": "One thing that always fascinated me about movies when growing up was the worlds that they created. But some of the more fantastic worlds, I thought, would have been a dream to work on. \n\nI wasn't sure how *Sleepy Hollow* was filmed until I checked out the behind the scenes documentary specifically to find out about both the village and the forest. How did they do that in the day? Turns out, the village was 100% real, built from the ground up for the movie, and the forest was a set designers dream, constructed on apparently the \"world's largest soundstage\" (my original post was going to be about what other movies have immersive soundstage scenes in them).\n\nBut soundstages need not be the limit here. I've always found myself somewhat yearning to be on set for certain films, just to be surrounded by amazing environments, real or fake. I like to imagine I'm walking through the Sleepy Hollow village in as much wonder and awe as Depp's character, even if the job entailed going into one of the shops where camera equipment was temporarily stored to swap out lenses or something more mundane.\n\nTim Burton even mentions (in the making-of) how he appreciates old-time sets that *look* like sets, and I've always felt the same way, even pointing out (in real life, more often to myself than to others) landscapes that appear to look like a diorama at a museum. *Cliffhanger*'s snow-capped mountain path sets epitomize this sort of appeal for me.\n\nAvoiding the Adam Sandler trap of just working in some tropical location to be on a tropical location, what are some other films that would be almost magical to work on\u2014despite being busy and working long hours, you\u2014as crew\u2014would actually adore being on set just because you're *there*. Like inside Harry Potters castle or something.",
