Inclusion of characters from competing studios/Intellectual properties.\n\nThe animation is art. It's perfectly imperfect. Today it would be CGI. Are there even living animators now who could do this or are these techniques lost to history?\n\nIs there anything else remotely like this? I can't think of anything. I'll be rewatching this tomorrow with my kids and they better damn like it ",

I noticed that in the pre- and mid-credit scenes they teased more adventures for the characters, but as far as I know a sequel is not in the works for this movie based on a video game.\n\nThe same thing happened with The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) with Henry Cavill.  Further adventures were teased in the credits, but no sequel happened.\n\nI know there are multiple reasons why this happens.  The movie is a flop, or its stars movie on to bigger and better projects.  I'm just wondering what other movies teased sequels that just never happened.\n\nNOTE:  As many have mentioned, there is a sequel for Uncharted in the works that I somehow missed.  It sparked the initial question, which is still valid.",

        "content": "Besides the things everyone who is familiar with this documentary knows, for example the editing style, Claude Lanzmann wanting to keep it as unedited as possible, pauses in sentences are still included, most of the time accompanied by footage of what the concentration camps look like 'now' (as in the time it was filmed).\n\nThe documentary was filmed in a course of 11 years, it was released in '85, meaning that probably the majority of the interviews take place in the '70's.\n\nThe documentary primarily consists of Claude Lanzmann asking the questions, the translator translating it to the people who are being asked these questions, in their own language, followed by the translator translating the answers to French so that Lanzmann can understand them.\n\nThe documentary shows a side of the Shoah which is not being teached in schools, not even where it all happened, which is Poland and countries surrounding it.\n\nSurvivors, train conductors, the people who ordered the trains, the people who organized it... even the SS officers are interviewed (in the case of the SS-officers, partially 'attempted' being interviewed') in this documentary.\n\nThe survivors, one of such cases being 'Richard Glazar', a Chzech-Jewish man who was part of the 'Sondercommando' in Trablinka, a concentration camp in Poland, described in detail what he had done there. After the documentary, Glazar ultimately committed suicide after his wife died.\n\nListening to these stories creates a motion picture in your mind, one which is, based on the details being told, way more graphic and terrifying than any story you hear in school, way more terrifying than can be told in movies, because these are the people that survived this, whom you are listening to.\n\nThe SS-officers are a hard pill to swallow too, knowing that these people did initially not know what would happen to the jews (being the volunteer officers in the concentration camps), one of whom is 'Franz Suchomel', who explains in detail what is role was, and what he had seen before, during and after the moments the jews were gassed.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me about 'Franz Suchomel', is that he deliberately asked Lanzmann not to use his full name in the documentary, though Lanzmann did, for 'Franz Suchomel' died in 1979, 6 years before the documentary was released, and 12 years after he was released from prison, due to accessory to murder.\n\nThere are more cases of unique stories in this 9' and a half hour documentary, which will bound to change your view of Shoah (the holocaust), no matter how much you think you know about it.",

        "content": "Audiences have come to know the original American Pie series as an example of teen comedy revivalism that relies on crude humor to do most of the heavy lifting. I don\u2019t really want to get into whether the humor or the manner of tackling certain subjects still holds up to this day. Personally I want to take this moment to highlight an ingredient which, in my humble opinion, is essential to the charm of the original series \u2013 I\u2019m going to ignore the spin-offs here \u2013 and that is its subtle, but effective wholesomeness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Deep down American Pie 1 &amp; 2 in particular are movies about growing up, overcoming, learning and moving forward. The common thread throughout all of this is the search for and the preserving of a human connection, whether it\u2019s a lifelong friendship or a family relationship. The characters, as immature as they may be, all stumble along the way but in the end find out that the world has other and better things in store for them than what they thought they were looking for in the beginning. It\u2019s almost as if these movies when all is said and done do want to convey a message: you\u2019re an ignorant kid who\u2019s going to mess up and growing up you will continue to mess up, but you\u2019ll learn and you\u2019ll always have your friends and your family to learn from and they will always learn along with you.\n\n\u00a0Adding to this is the fact that there seems to be a genuine chemistry between the cast members, which includes both the main as well as the side characters. To top it off the original movies serve up a nostalgic soundtrack that reminds me \u2013 and I do realize that I am showing my age here \u2013 of a time where the world at least seemed to be a much more hopeful and optimistic place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Maybe the jokes didn\u2019t age well. Maybe the way these movies go about certain specific subjects didn\u2019t age well. Be that as it may, there\u2019s one thing to me that definitely does hold up. A quality that is missing from the vast majority of movies of that ilk which came out at the time: a nostalgic comforting heart.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0To the next step!\u00a0",

I just feel like the ending leaves a lot to thought, and Jacob and David picking up the Minari was a quiet, short conclusion that speaks 1000 words. \n\nI randomly cried during the scene where David goes to his friends house and I thought it was gonna be a perfect environment and he'll want to stay there a while, an environment where the kid is spoilt, but the scene with the dad where he says \"tell mom I was home all night okay?\" Just meant so much behind everything.",

        "content": "So I just got done watching it. Pretty fun caper that started with more intrigue than I ended up caring for in the end really. But still entertaining.\n\nNow the final shot see's Barbara Harris' Blanche character break the fourth wall and wink to the camera after she miraculously finds the diamond in the house, with her partner exclaiming that she did it, she's indeed a real psychic!\n\nWhat is your takeaway from this? Is she winking because she knows she's always actually been psychic, or is she winking to us because she's not, and found out where it was by other means (perhaps overhearing the other two discussing it).\n\nI don't believe we're ever shown her finding out about it on screen, maybe I'm wrong and if so let me know. Otherwise those are the two options. Either way that wink is iconic for me and I loved Barbara's performance.",

        "content": "So Uwe Bol is making a new movie with Armie Hammer titled The Dark Knight. I've always found it strange when movies recycle names. So I decided to post a (nonexhaustive) list of famous movies that share a name with another major release that is not as well known. This is actually a phenomenom I've thought about alot over the years. \n\n1. Running Scared- Classic 80's comedy starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines vs. 2006 Paul Walker action movie.\n\n2. Gladiator- Early 90s boxing movie starring a young Cuba Gooding Jr vs. Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning sword and sandal epic.\n\n3. Catch Me if You Can- 80s B-movie about high school drag racer* vs. Steve Speilberg movie with Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio.\n\n4. Bad Boys- One of Sean Penns first starring roles vs Will Smith/Martin Lawrence franchise starter.\n\n5. Project X- Matthew Broadrick and Helen Hunt in a movie about the Air Force experimenting on chimps vs. A house party goes WAY overboard.\n\n6. The Rookie- Clint Eastwood, Charlie Sheen, Raul Julia cop movie vs. Dennis Quad baseball biopic. \n\n7. Man of the House- Chevy Chase comedy with JTT vs Tommy Lee Jones comedy.\n\n8. Bad Company- Sexy spy thriller with Lawrence Fishbourne and Ellen Barkin vs. Chris Rock CIA comedy.\n\n9. Crash- Controversial James Spader movie about car crash fetiches vs Controversial Oscar-winner about racism. \n\n10. Hot Pursuit- 80s John Cusack comedy with Ben Stiller and his father Jerry as villains vs. Reese Witherspoon/Sonia Vergara comedy.\n\n\nI know there are other examples of this. Any other ones that standout.\n\n*Not a major release but a movie I really loved as a kid.\n \n\n",
