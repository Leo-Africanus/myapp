Or is nostalgia a necessary ingredient in connecting generations through storytelling?\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014are we celebrating the art of filmmaking, or are we just endlessly chasing the echoes of what once was?

I can suspend disbelief to think it threw on a tattered robe or something, but a well-made vivid red cloak had me scoffing. Suddenly the Simpsons joke clicked and was humorous to me. \n\nThat's all.

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than a month, I ask you for your most favorite movie set plot-wise in a certain european country once a day. Sometimes, it turns out, that one or another of the suggested movies wasn't really set in the given country. That seems to be the case with *To Catch a Thief*, the \"winner\" of the Monaco round, which unfortunately shows no sign of actually being set in Monaco to any great extent. The runner-up in the voting - *Grand Prix* \\- unfortunately doesn't fit the criteria here either. As all the other films have the same number of upvotes (minus downvotes), I'll have to think again about how to proceed. However, yesterday's result is somewhat more rewarding: ***Igla Ispod Praga*** (engl.: *The Black Pin*) wins for Montenegro. \n\nHonestly, I really thought, that *Casino Royale* would win, when we come to Montenegro, but at this point, it seems as people have learned from what I call \"the Belgium accident\", where a not-so-belgian movie made the cut. As always, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens today, when we move on one letter in alphabetical order to N for **Netherlands**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: As the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix has not yet been announced, I will refrain from attaching an updated list of the films here and instead want to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) . make sure to give it a like!",

        "content": "I'm struggling to remember this movie. It was an ensemble cast scavenger hunt around the entire country movie. The one scene that sticks out in my head was a bunch of eggs in a birds nest each had a letter written on it and they had to unscramble the word but dropped a few eggs from the tree. \n\nNot much to go on. But does anyone remember the late 70s or early 80s movie? Thanks!!",

        "content": "My friend and I were watching a big commercial movie recently. he thought it was fun, but I couldn\u2019t help critiquing the screenplay, cinematography, and weak plot. To me, cinema is an art form and a way to connect with people, but so many big-budget movies feel like brainless money grabs (looking at you, Marvel).\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of directors like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Asghar Farhadi, Abbas Kiarostami, Akira Kurosawa, and Satyajit Ray, so I naturally look for deeper storytelling, strong screenplays, and great cinematography.\n\nI\u2019m not judging anyone\u2019s taste. I love my friend and respect his opinion. But I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people around me focus more on the actors than the actual content of the film.\n\nSo, I\u2019m curious: What makes a good film for you? How do you define cinema, and what do you use to measure whether a film is good or not?",

Then we were talking about he movies and I mentioned Bringing out the Dead where he plays a paramedic. That got me thinking of this question. Cop films are a dime a dozen, but the other two are fairly rare. Can anyone think of any actor who hit this trifecta?",
