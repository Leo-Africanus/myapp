I'd heard that it was depressing and gut-wrenching and a hard watch, one many couldn't repeat, and I held off watching it for a while because of that. But when I finally did watch it, I wasn't nearly so moved by it. Yes, it was sad, but I wasn't gutted by it nor bawling my eyes out when it ended. (Frankly, it was a little boring.) Plenty of movies have gotten to me the way this one was \"supposed\" to, but this wasn't one of them.\n\nETA: I've thoroughly enjoyed reading everyone's responses (and I do mean all of them, which I will continue to do until it's clear no new responses are incoming). A few things have struck me:\n\n1) I appreciate that quite a few of you have given movies two or even three or more viewings to see if they can be \"redeemed\" in your eyes. Your openness is refreshing and admirable.\n\n2) I'm also grateful a number of you gave generally balanced opinions and allow for the good or bad even when you went the opposite way.\n\n3) Because you provided more reasoned explanations than simply naming a film or saying something sucked/was great, I liked the extra perspective it gave me on some of these movies. I can bring more appreciation for the opposing viewpoint when I, too, was contrarian.",

        "content": "On this day, June 11, 1982, one of the most beloved and magical films in cinematic history was released in U.S. theaters: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, directed by Steven Spielberg. Although its world premiere was at the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, it was on that June 11th that the world truly began to fall in love with the tiny alien with the bright eyes and giant heart. In the midst of the 1980s boom, E.T. landed just before the summer of blockbusters, at a time when audiences craved stories full of excitement, adventure, and soul. The film didn't just deliver: it broke records. In its first week, it grossed over $100 million and went on to gross nearly $800 million globally. It surpassed Star Wars as the highest-grossing film in history, holding that title for more than a decade, until another Spielberg film (Jurassic Park) dethroned it in 1993. But beyond the numbers, E.T. left an indelible mark on pop culture. Its influence was immediate: phrases like \"E.T., my house, telephone\" became part of popular language, and the iconic scene of the bicycle flying in front of the moon is one of cinema's most recognizable images. The film won four Oscars (including Best Original Score for John Williams) and was one of the first films deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress. The most impressive thing is how, 42 years later, it continues to touch the hearts of new generations. Parents who saw it as children now share it with their children. And why does it remain relevant? Because E.T. was made with sincerity. Filmed from a child's perspective, without cynicism or exaggeration, it addresses complex themes like loss, loneliness, and true friendship with a sensitivity few films have matched. In a world filled with CGI, remakes, and franchises, E.T. shines with its simplicity and genuine emotion. It doesn't need bombast to move. Sometimes, all it takes is a glowing finger, an unexpected friend\u2026 and a bicycle. So today, June 11th, let's celebrate not only the anniversary of its release, but everything E.T. represents: the magic of cinema when it's made with heart. When was the first time you saw E.T.? Does it still move you like it used to?",

It has what are easily among the best performances of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLuise yet I've never personally encountered a single comedy fan who's seen the movie let alone heard of it.\u00a0",
