It\u2019s a high-concept story that was only made better by the wistful musings of the characters, especially Fassbender. His search for humanity in media, philosophy, and poetry is a thing of beauty. Even though it ends well for exactly no one, just the fact that they tried to tackle this subject in the context of a horror-thriller-sci fi was so ambitious and creative I can\u2019t hate it. \n\nTo me, this movie is an extension of concepts explored by Bladerunner and other films, stemming from \u2018Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u2019. It\u2019s about creation and evolution and the pursuit of the soul, by a creature that can neither create, nor evolve, nor has a soul. \n\nThis was the David show, for me, 100%. He steals every scene he\u2019s in. \n\nThe cinematography, score, and ambition of this film deserves way more respect than it gets. ",

        "content": "Typo in the title, my bad. It's ***Crocodile Dundee (1986)***\n\n\nWho hasn't heard the \"that's not a knoife, this is a knoife\" line? It's like one of cinema's most famous lines lmao. But it's also not a good represantation of this movie. I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching this and the pacing was quite mellow without much comedy, atleast for the first half.\n\n\nIt's a slow Tarzan &amp; Jane type of chemistary between Dundee and the girl, it's adorable seeing them interact.\n\n\nThis movie is so 80's. From the fashion sense to the music and the cityscape, the second half of the story is like a window into the past lol. Being so 80's, some jokes are a bit dated too. Not too many, but a couple things here and there won't fly today.\n\n\nThe ending is so adorable, it's the quintessential rom-com ending.\n\n\nI'm gonna be honest though, the Editor Finace guy &gt;!got completely fucked over lmao. His only crime was being a slight bit of a douche, some crocodile leather wearing backwater idiot stole his girl and cucked him out of a fortune. Worst part is, he sent her out to him in the first place lmao!&lt;\n\n\nLast observation, Linda Kozlowski is fucking smoking hot. Goddamn, that red dress in the party scene. Woof.\n",
