        "content": "I finally watched TENET, and I'm blown away how one of my favorite directors could make such a poor film.\n\nWhen TENET first came out, I missed in in theaters, but tried to watch it at home. I lasted maybe 30 minutes, but was so confused and bored, I stopped watching it.\n\nI finally decided to watch it in full, properly, thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right headspace at the time.\n\nAnd for those that might say the film would have been better if it was experienced in IMAX or theatres, I did watch it on a fairly decent setup. 4K Bluray/UB820, LG G5 Oled + Q990D. I fully appreciate the theater experience, but I don't think it would in any way change my feelings.\n\nAnd after 2.5 hours, I think it's the worst film Nolan has ever made, a director who's films I've generally loved.\n\nInterstellar is one of my favorite films of all time, and I've loved his other films like Memento, Dunkirk, Inception, Batman Trilogy, Oppenheimer, etc... Almost without fail, his films have been complex spectacle with fantastic writing and an emotional core that carried the films.\n\nTENET was none of those things, IMO.\n\nTENET is far too complex for it's own good, and even after fully understanding the different flows of time the characters are going through, it's just a bad story. It's complexity for the sake of complexity, without serving the actual story.\n\nThere are precisely 0 characters you care about, there is no emotional core to the film, at all. The final \"idea\" of the film that Neil and the Protag had this great friendship in two different directions was cool, but it was never earned.\n\nI thought John David Washington's performance was pretty awful, he has the charisma of a wet paper bag, and the writing of the film does him no favors. I've liked him in other roles, so I would put more of this on the writing than him to some degree. The writing in general for all the dialog was AWFUL. People talk like CHAT GPT robots, in unnatural ways.\n\nI at least thought the action spectacle would be worth the price of admission, but I thought it was pretty disjointed and unemployable to watch. The fights where people going forward through time were fighting people going backwards just looked disjointed, and unappealing to watch.\n\nSome of the music was kind of cool, but it felt more like soundscapes than a true OST.\n\nOverall, the entire film felt more like an \"idea\" than an actual film, it was insanely disappointing.",

        "title": "How did Taylor Sheridan go from writing heartbreaking, thoughtful, and poignant films to writing disposable, propagandistic, soap operas?",
        "content": "My first exposure to Taylor Sheridan was 2015's \\*Sicario\\*. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, \\*Sicario\\* is a bleak story about the ultimate collapse of jurisdiction, legality, and morality around the War on Drugs as national elements and interests slowly degrade into pure power politics. It has been called the \\*Apocalypse Now\\* of the War on Drugs, and while I don't think \\*Sicario\\* is quite a film of that caliber I do think the comparison stands as legitimate.\n\nThe year after \\*Sicario\\* was released, 2016, saw the release of a crime tragedy set in West Texas titled \\*Hell or High Water\\*, directed by David Mackenzie. \\*Hell or High Water\\* is a great films, as all of the performances, settings, and dialogue create a sincere and disturbing look at rural poverty in America. The film, ostensibly a heist film, features characters fully formed from the land which reared them. The cars they drive, the way they talk, and clothes they wear all appear to the audience as sincere to the setting and theme.  The climactic refrain of the film is poignant, \"I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation. But not my boys, not anymore.\"\n\nAnd the year after that we have 2017's \\*Wind River\\*, directed by Sheridan himself. I have mixed feelings about this film. It tackles the topic, that of the murder of Indigenous women on western reservations, with the appropriate weight and despair. At times it \\*almost\\* rises to the level of Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry in terms of the grandiosity and profound sorrow in the western cannon. It is a film which is so tense at times it almost feels like your back is about to shatter from the strain. The climactic standoff absolutely deserves it's place in film history. And it features an incredible, but brief, performance by Gil Birmingham as a father who almost seems to be transforming into a being of pure grief. However, \\*Wind River\\* also features Jeremy Renner as a white guy who seems to really believe that he is just as native as the Native Americans he lives with, and while Elizabeth Olsen turns in a good performance as the representative of an uncaring federal government, she plays a far more central role in the plot that the great Graham Greene, whose portrayal of an indigenous police chief is commanding of respect.\n\nBy 2018 Sheridan had three critically acclaimed films under his belt, with one as director and one being nominated for Best Picture. Then he writes the superfluous sequel to \\*Sicario\\* titled \\*Sicario: Day of the Soldado\\*, which failed to make any real impact at all. Importantly, however, \\*Sicario 2\\* reduces the immorality and cynicism from the CIA characters and seemingly is more approving of the institutions he criticized in his own previous screenplay. All in all, a strange and disappointing follow up.\n\nAnd then \\*Yellowstone\\* happens, which launches Sheridan into the stratosphere in terms of fame and income. I hate \\*Yellowstone\\*. I hate how its understanding of the west is seemingly entirely based in the Texan hatred of public land and land conservation. I hate how the show's understanding of the rural working class and ranching is almost entirely seen as violent, confrontational, and libertarian. I hate the militarism of the show . But I think what I hate most is how a man who once wrote a heartbreaking film about rural poverty wasted the opportunity to offer any meaningful examination of life in the rapidly gentrifying American West, and instead became the primary advertiser for that gentrification.\n\nAnd then the rest is history. He's now writing disposable show after disposable show about the virtues of the American military establishment, as well as about the virtues of the oil industry decimating the rural farmland he was once such a mourner of. In \\*Wind River\\* oil rig workers were the racist, murdering, rapists, in \\*Landman\\* they're heroes holding up the American way of life.\n\nBut I know the answer already. It's money. Soap Operas aimed at suburban conservatives sell very well, and \\*Yellowstone\\* is the apotheosis of that genre.",

        "content": "Not a movie you liked more on rewatch, but one that suddenly made sense in a different way. Something that hit harder because of age, loss, work, marriage, failure, or just time.\n\nFor me it was Lost in Translation.\n\nI watched it younger and thought nothing really happened. Years later it hit completely different. Feeling disconnected, stuck in routine, surrounded by people but still lonely. The quiet moments made sense. The looks, the pauses, the things not said. It was not about romance anymore. It was about timing, distance, and how some connections only exist for a moment in your life.\n\nCurious what movie changed meaning for you. Thank you.",

When it does, the chainsaw runs for a few seconds and dies. This is my experience with starting chainsaws. ",

There have been a couple of decent ones since\u2026 \u201cFord vs. Ferrari\u201d was not bad.\n\nSo I put off watching this one for some time.   But I was very pleasantly surprised.   The fact that they included essentially the entire Formula One roster in the film didn\u2019t hurt, and it was produced by Louis Hamilton. \n\nThe racing sequences are top-notch\u2026 I found myself gripping the arms of my easy chair at several points.    \n\nThe plot is pretty familiar\u2026.

        "content": "Over the years there's been so much discourse about Die Hard as a Christmas movie, that Richard Donner's X-Mas action movie, Lethal Weapon, has gone unrecognized. We see Die Hard on numerous best Christmas movie lists, and rightfully so. We see so many ardent defenders of Die Hard but in doing so we've neglected this 1987 classic. Make no mistake, Lethal Weapon absolutely qualifies as a Christmas Movie. Not only does it feature the decor of the season heavily, the film opens with \"Jingle Bell Rock\", it has an introductory action set piece in a tree lot, and the movie follows the depressive seasonal slump of a recently widowered cop challenged by the themes of family and redemption, until he's offered a new family and a path to redemption. Despite being set in LA, the filmmakers work in a little \"snow\" into the plot. I think it's time we started defending Lethal Weapon's status as a Christmas movie.",
