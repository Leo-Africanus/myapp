It feels like today however that in movies there is always something to listen to, whether it\u2019s quippy dialogue or music over the top of scenes. I don\u2019t think there are really ever more silent or quiet scenes like there are in films like Bullitt or The Italian Job for example.\n\nWhy is this, and when did it start? Do people just expect to have always something going on at all times now? Watching older films back they just feel oddly silent comparatively and I\u2019m just wondering when the switch was and what started it",

It\u2019s from the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, which might intice you a bit.

        "content": "The scene is from the Special Edition, the one where the xenomorph is born from an ox instead of a dog.\n\nI find this to be the best single sequence in the entire film and it is nothing short of magnificent. The emotional punch of the scene, the sombre atmosphere, Sigourney Weaver's facial expressions, Elliot Goldenthal's score, Charles S. Dutton's monologue ... everything comes together beautifully.\n\nThe editing of the scene is particularly a thing of beauty. As Charles S. Dutton says, \"for within each seed, there is the promise of a flower\", the xeno bursts out of the ox in the next shot, which is immediately followed by Ripley's nose bleeding that serves as foreshadowing for her eventual condition.\n\nIn light of how well executed this sequence is, I find it to be a pity that the rest of the film turned out to be such an incoherent mess. I won't write down everything I find to be wrong with the film, just a few points as I remember them.\n\n1. Elliot Goldenthal's score takes a drastic downturn after this scene. The rock music playing during the gang rape was particularly hideous. Who had that bright idea, I don't want to know.\n2. I had seen the theatrical version long ago and therefore, the subplot of trapping the xeno inside a nuclear waste chamber came as a surprise to me. Now I think the entire sequence and its aftermath was a complete waste of time and was rightly excised from the theatrical cut.\n3. The finale is an utter mess. I had little idea of what was happening and who was where.",

What feels like a slow paced burn turns into a gut punch by the end when you make complete sense of whatever events that have happened.\u00a0\n\nThe movie is about a girl revisiting the memory of her father and her revaluation of the whole trip through the eyes of an experienced adult. She doesn\u2019t read too much into it when she\u2019s in those moments but now that she\u2019s pieced it all together, she sees her father\u2019s pain and suffering and we as the viewers come to feel it in the end too. This is why i feel aftersun is a painful and haunting watch.\n\nThe cinematography and background score really help us fill up the blanks that the movie deliberately leave for us. All of it really ties into an emotional and unforgettable experience. I don\u2019t think im getting over this for a while",

Thanks all for the submissions thus far. Since there are already several answers based on my mistake, let\u2019s just say the movies can be AFFILIATED or Unaffiliated.  More fun to be totally different universes while still being feasibly affiliated.",

        "content": "She is the one who cheats on him, but the movie tries to make it seem as if we should be on her side and that it\u2019s Cal\u2019s fault she did it because he became a \u201cboring partner\u201d.\n\nNot only that, but their family friends: Bernie (reluctantly) and his wife choose to side with Emily and doesn\u2019t receive any emotional support over it until Jacob takes him under his wing to move on from her by teaching him his womanizing ways.\n\nAnd when Emily finds out that he slept with their son\u2019s teacher (who takes him ghosting her too personal), she has the audacity to act so self-righteous and disgusted when she finds out he also slept with nine other women. I get there is her thinking there was a personal motive where she felt this was him getting back at her, but she is the one who wanted a divorce.\n\nHe\u2019s a grown man who\u2019s allowed to explore since he\u2019s no longer married to her. But more importantly, she NEVER once apologizes for hurting Cal first. By the end of the movie, Cal once again has to be the bigger person who makes up for all the \u201cwrongs\u201d he\u2019s done.\n\nThe way this movie tried to tell its messages was very weird. It was an entertaining movie, but it never fails to piss me off at the same time lol",
