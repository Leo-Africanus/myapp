        "content": "Just finished watching Train Dreams, and I have to say, I haven't had a movie affect me like this is a long long time. It really hit home, probably because I grew up in the PNW, and I've had a lifelong interest in the historical logging industry here, but also because the wife and I had our first child, and, well, having a kid makes you put some things into perspective. \n\nIf you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a watch, but more than being just a solid movie, it's a deeply personal reminder of the complex humanity of all of us. Robert in the film is literally a nobody. He doesn't know how his parents are, he leaves no mark on the world, but the depth of his joys and despairs are only heightened by the sheer mundanity of them. \n\nI noticed this in my own life. The joy of falling in love is paired with the fact that it's actually pretty mundane. It happens to literally billions of people on this planet. And I don't think that lessens it, in fact the fact that so many people experience joys and despairs like Robert does in the film just underscores their emotional impact. \n\nThe movie reminds us that everyone deserves deep empathy, and understanding. A nameless logger in Spokane at the turn on the century, who left no mark on the world, that person on the bus or the train who you've never seen and you'll never see again, or that lone person behind the Reddit account responsible for the comment your reading...each and every one of those people has hopes, dreams, fears, joys, and regrets that are like just as deep and emotionally complex as you do. \n\nAnyway, take a moment to remember the complex life of those strangers on the street, or the commenters on the Internet. Even though we don't know them, just like Robert, they deserve some empathy and understanding too. ",
