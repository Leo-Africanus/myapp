So many posts, so many comments, saying how wonderful this movie was.  I gave in and watched it last night.\n\nIt's really good.  Yes, just like you have all been screaming at me.  Good action, good comedy, good SFX, all around a great movie.\n\nI really loved Hugh Grant's performance.  He pulls off smarmy and slimy quite well. \n\nAnd I was leaping out of my seat when I saw [live-action versions](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24550574/80_Kids_Arena.png) of [these guys](https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dungeons-Dragons-cartoon.jpg).

No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)\n\nBut I'm not talking about horror, vs just not \"getting it\" or having adult themes way out of your league?\n\nThe one film I saw because \"cute robots\" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... \n\nBut it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.\n\nI wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",

Lithgow plays respected Dr Carter Nix who happens to have multiple personalities, some of them being psychotic murderers. Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer. \n\nSupporting roles are fine, I liked Frances Sternhagen as an eccentric psychologist trying to get to Carter Nix. Lolita Davidovich wears beautiful dresses. Steven Bauer has a nude scene. And aging actress Gabrielle Carteris plays a teenager again, this time no glasses and trashy.",

        "content": "Ben whitehead did really a good cracking job voicing wallace in the 2024 aardman netflix movie \"Wallace &amp; gromit vengeance most fowl\", as he was able to do a very identical imitation to peter salis (Rip), and  exactly with the same way wallace talks, he easily fills the big shoes and he is a really good successor to peter salis as wallace voice actor.\n\nBecause sadly peter salis passed away in 2017 after retiring in 2010, with the last time he voiced wallace was in the 2008 short film \"matter of loaf and death\".\n\nBut ben whitehead managed to do him jeastice by nailing wallace voice and the way he is speaking perfectly.\n\nI didn't even realise it wasn't the same voice actor when i watched the movie for the first time.\n\nSo what are your oppinions on him as wallace?",

Takes place in the late 1800s.  Mostly takes place in a military fort, or outpost in a desert. Whether it's the Sahara or the middle east, I forget. Seem to remember someone getting whipped or beaten to death. I think one of the officers was very cruel. Wasn't Lawrence of Arabia. ",
