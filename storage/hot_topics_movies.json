        "content": "You ever notice how some actors are in everything for a few years and then just disappear? One day they\u2019re headlining big movies, and the next, it\u2019s like Hollywood pretends they never existed. No big scandal, no retirement announcement, just gone.\n\nTaylor Kitsch is a perfect example. After Friday Night Lights, it felt like every studio was pushing him as the next big star. He got John Carter, Battleship, and True Detective, but after a few flops, he just stopped getting those lead roles. Same thing happened with Josh Hartnett. In the early 2000s, he was in Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Sin City, and then he just kind of faded away. I heard he turned down playing Batman in The Dark Knight, which probably didn\u2019t help. Who else do you remember being everywhere and then suddenly gone?\n",

All I ever knew was how supposedly scary it was, and that\u2019s not necessarily wrong. But between all of the darker material there\u2019s a real sense of whimsy there, and it\u2019s all delivered with such *confidence.* The movie just throws all of these insane ideas out there and expects you to keep up, and I was enthralled the whole time. The main actress has to be one of the best displays of young acting I\u2019ve ever seen in the genre and she\u2019s working against *nothing.* Just props and a chicken for most of the thing. I couldn\u2019t believe when I looked it up and found that it was the director\u2019s only movie. What a wild ride. ",

        "content": "For me it's David Farrier's review of Cats. I read the Cats review thread a few minutes and I cannot stop laughing.\n\n&gt;When I was 13, my parents started breeding cats. Birmans. Seal point Birmans, to be precise. I would wake and be surrounded by cats and all that the cat life entailed. Kitten cats, male cats, female cats. Cat cages, cat shows, cat breeding. Always the breeding, the eternal lifecycle of the cat burned into my retinas. The yowling, the prowling, the fucking.\n\n&gt;When I was 25, I hung out with some Furries in Hamilton. Charming folk, I really liked them. Loved Disney films. Adored My Little Pony. They got turned on by putting on dog suits, fox suits, cat suits. Adults - all yowling, prowling, fucking.\n\n&gt;I'm 37 now, I've just seen Cats the movie. I've never seen the stage show, but I know the songs. I get the gist. Big songs, big numbers. This film is something else. I am 13 again, I am 25 again. I'm at my parents house, hearing cats fuck. I'm watching a Furry put on a catsuit.\n\n&gt;This is the worst thing I've ever seen. This is what death feels like. This is the worst ketamine trip. This is the CGI from Scorpion King. I don't know if I'm five minutes in or five hours. Nothing matters anymore. This is the death of all things. Fuck it.\n",

I don\u2019t even know what I like to do for fun when I\u2019m not at work; I just go about my day and a lot of the time I find myself sitting and waiting for the time to just pass. \nAnyways she told me to watch Soul and or inside out (I have never seen either of them), so I watched soul.\n\nFirst 30 minutes were depressing as fuck\nThe next hour was fun and entertaining\nand the last 20 ish minutes was devistating. She told me it\u2019s supposed to be bitter sweet but I don\u2019t get it. I just felt the movie was to relatable and it reinforced that I am not good enough and that I don\u2019t have any purpose to be alive. \nI don\u2019t see my therapist for a few days but I can\u2019t hold this in.

Their characters are so raw and believable, making the story frightening yet deeply human. It\u2019s the end of the world, but in a way that\u2019s quintessentially British - all mud, grime, and desperation.\n\nAnd there's hope too. We're treated to luvly little ambient numbers as they drive up to Manchester. Little bits of respite as they huddle around a campfire.\n\nAnd the infected. The running, frantic frothing monsters may seem old hat now, but they redefined the zombie genre. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a zombie film since that\u2019s scared me as much as 28 Days. The church scene at the start of the movie is so chilling and upsetting.\n\nCant wait to check out the true sequel to this British masterpiece. Thank God for directors like Danny Boyle, stamping his muddy footprint over cinema.",

Shot from Stan\u2019s perspective, they both look back at him and laugh amongst themselves, with Stan and the viewer unaware exactly what it is they\u2019re laughing about. At some point in the film (it\u2019s been a while), Stan confesses his love for Mary. In my mind, the clear implication from the conversation between Mary and Dr Mierzwiak is that Stan has at some point had Mary erased, and is now unknowingly falling for her again, something Mary and Dr Mierzwiak find to be comical.",

I was having fun laughing at some of the stuff that I now see as overly dramatic but I found cool when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, once it got to the hospital (filmed at St Mary's in Long Beach) scene where Lauren is taken after Pacino finds her in the tub, I was very impressed by the actors in that scene - they seemed to really memorize their hospital lingo and make it believable.  But as I watched more, I kinda felt like the main doctor had to have been someone they just found at the hospital they filmed at and told him to \"pretend this just happened\".\n\nSo I wound up doing some quick research on imdb and got his name, but he's not credited in any other movie.  Some google searching led me to his profile, and everything seems to line up and definitely looks like he was a real doctor, pretty cool:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8buza1izazoe1.png?width=2080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1e96c63c1d057eb2e7ec47a521cec51c3f5e27\n\nAlso, I think the blonde nurse is also a real nurse too, she seems way to natural in her actions in that scene.",

        "content": "Mine was \"A Perfect World\" starring Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood. It came out in 1993, and I'm pretty sure I was closer to 7-8 when I watched it. The reason my mother let me pick it out (from a VHS RENTAL STORE, GASP HOW ANTIQUATED) was because it had a kid in a ghost face costume on it walking with a guy she must have assumed was his father (Costner).\n\n  \nNah, this was about a pair of murderers who break out of prison and kidnap said kid, kind of a road movie with Eastwood as the Texas Ranger chief who is chasing them. It's worth a watch, it's a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first \"anti-hero\" sad movies. \n\nAnyway, anybody else got stories like this?",

        "content": "I was in high school when the first Alien movie came out, I've seen all of them and I love the series.  Decades later, I thought I might not enjoy Alien Romulus. Boy was I wrong. This film has new, younger characters who are believable and (mostly) likeable, a well-written story, interesting subplots/ back stories which don't detract from the main storyline, a new artificial life character who is different from any we have seen before, plus some tub-thumping one-liners which pay homage to Ripley. This is probably the second best movie of the entire franchise, after Aliens.",

        "content": "I'll begin by saying that this movie is absolutely one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen. The bright colors (red, orange, yellow and green) have such an impact on the vibe of the film. With that said, Theo wears ALOT of red and orange colors. Similarly, the OS1 primary color is a bright orange which matches his shirt in the posted frame. Colors like red and pink symbolize love, and In this case, the start of Theodore and Samanthas romantic journey. Theodore continues to wear these bright orange/red shirts during the \"Honeymoon phase\" (as Theodore calls it) of their relationship. It signifies a healthy beginning to true love.\n\nHowever, as we dive into the issues that Theo and Sam face, he wears more neutral colors such as pale blue and white. When Sams prostitute shows up, Theo is wearing a white shirt. In this moment Theo is extremely uncomfortable, as he is being asked to have sex with someone hes never met by his computer girlfriend. This ultimately causes a pretty deep split between the two, probably the biggest we see in the whole movie aside from the breakup.\n\nAlthough It is a pretty obvious detail, the color usage is a very nice touch in my opinion. I love that colors symbolize the strength and status of Theo and Sams relationship as the movie plays on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vmtsjj4twoe1.jpg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0480a652ffe064fcd40d642c62d3100348a651\n\n",
