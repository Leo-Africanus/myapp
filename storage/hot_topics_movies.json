It felt empty, incoherent, jumping from event to event without being embedded in a proper story arc that connected everything. It was a huge disappointment for me. Now I just noticed that a Director's Cut exists, which leaves me twisted: I'm kinda interested to see whether that cut makes up for the weaknesses of the original... But then again I wouldn't wanna waste yet another 3,5 hours. Has anyone been able to compare the two versions yet? ",

None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn't phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.\n\n",

And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones' happy ending. \n\nWith such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn. Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?",

        "content": "I just want to take a moment and appreciate Harrison Ford. In my opinion, he is the best every man action hero that I can recall in cinema. His most iconic characters aren\u2019t the best of the best at every single thing. Even when he wins the fight, he usually has taken a beating throughout and barely manages to make it out alive. The fight choreography is really clumsy, just like how an everyman character should be. I personally love when he throws a haymaker and almost falls over.\n\nIndiana Jones is an academic first and foremost. Deckard is a cop. Han is a smuggler. Jack Ryan is an analyst. His characters find themselves in extraordinary circumstances but you never find their involvement unbelievable. His character is just lucky to make it to see another day. They show confidence in the skills they should and he perfectly portrays when he\u2019s out of his depth. His character finds themselves grit to go on because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but he hopes for the best without knowing he\u2019ll win in the end.\n\nI love watching the over the top action spectacles from time to time where the main hero breezes through waves of bad guys and has the best one liners. But if the goal is to see yourself in a character, I think Harrison Ford is the best action hero of his generation.",

        "content": "I can't count the number of times when I go into a movie expecting one thing and ending up getting something very different. The trailer can be deceiving, so can be comments from fans and critical reviewers. \n\nBut there been situations I've been pleasantly surprised, where I initially read the premise and thought  I'll skip it because the premise sounded bad (boring, stupid, extreme, absurd) but ended up seeing it years later on TV and I was like Wow, can't believe that premise worked!\n\nCase in point the movie Lobster. I won't say it's my favorite but it was definitely worth watching. And the premise is so weird. It's about a bunch of people forced to pick a romantic partner in a short time because the alternative is they will turn into animals. Of course you can laugh at it but it's played serious, which creates a situation that is absurd and yet you can't look away from it. \n\nIt's almost like you decide to pretend you're a cloud or something, but then you do it so well that people being to wonder what it would mean IF you were a cloud. It's almost the opposite of the situation where someone takes a serious theme, like child abuse, and does such a bad job (bad script, editing, casting choices) that it doesn't connect with people at all. \n\nThat's why I like movies with a seemingly bad or weak premise that turns out well. I think that's art, to be able to make me see something or think about it or care about it, when I would not have otherwise.",

        "content": "Recently I've gotten super into the films that make you feel like garbage. Not in the way of a usual sad movie like\u00a0Schindler's List\u00a0, Green Mile, et cetera, but ones that really appeal to a relatable sorrow tone and leave you with a bad aftertaste. I'm talking movies like Krisha,\u00a0Trainspotting,\u00a0Anomalisa,\u00a0I Saw The TV Glow, most\u00a0Lars Von Trier\u00a0movies, ones like that.\n\nWhat are the best/ your favorite movies that make you feel like crap in a grounded or relatable way? The last post I saw discussing these kinds of films is about 6 years old, and I wanted to hear what people think nowadays. My personal favorite is probably Krisha (go figure since I already mentioned it) since it does a great job portraying the negatives of recovery and how hard it is.",

With subtitles i can recognize the words\n\nI\u2019ve seen many young people online saying they can\u2019t understand movies without subtitles. I was surprised that this seems to be a gen Z thing, but no answers to why we can't hear it\n\nI think the audio editing in today\u2019s movies also doesn\u2019t help. The sound effects are way too loud, and the dialogue is too quiet, you can\u2019t watch without the remote in hand\n\nI watched a movie from the 90s this week and, god, the actors spoke so much more clearly. Even with lower audio quality and expressions i didn\u2019t know it was much easier to understand than recent films. It seems like actors nowadays are speaking in cursive, always mumbling",

Set against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, the movie revolves around 5 men, hired to rob a train carrying 500,000$ worth gold, by the rebels.\n\nThe leader of the group is simply known as Dutchman, who hires the other members, played by Peter Graves more known for his role in Mission Impossible TV series.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wvrxq931zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c54a32162f0f2a886e6cac1e6c38fe419a7d486\n\nBud Spencer is Mesito aka The Animal, a strong man, known for his brute strength, the kind of role he usually revels in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75j6dz9i1zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dabea378306d982f173f7e8d213095402717a102\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w86zqapn1zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39cc8f6c4ec762a5fddd9ac46935d34706d32fb\n\nItalian actor Nino Castelnuovo is Luis Dominguez, a former circus acrobat turned outlaw, known for his lethal sling shot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c72zf6y62zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a700f7b2ac9978e2183fe78485b3605f7d9a8e\n\nJames Daly known for his role in the TV series Medical Center is Capt Augustus Bennet, aka the Gambler,  who had served earlier in the same unit as The Dutchman, and is an explosives expert.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s38l06sc4zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea7add83e33cf4d00812f34ffa52f16bb3032f29\n\nJapanese actor Tetsuro Tamba is Samurai, who earns a living in sideshows with his samurai skills.\n\nThe movie is basically on the lines of 5 guys getting together on a crazy mission, which is trying to pull off a gold heist on a heavily guarded train.  Needless to say the entire train robbery sequence is brilliantly shot, you feel the edge of seat excitement, as the 5 men, attempt to pull it off, stumbling at places, but do manage it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3mvo9iq4zae1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46800889caf3c302d78a0a2552da26f39550462a\n\nThe train sequence apart, there are a lot of good action scenes too, especially the cat and mouse game between the Mexican military and the 5 guys, the near misses.\n\nThe movie has some pretty poignant scenes too, one being where the residents of a village, migrate en masse, to escape the wrath of the military for sheltering the 5 guys.  As also some scenes showing the atrocities inflicted by the military on the prisoners and peasants.\n\nThe sequences and bonding between the 5 guys, is well depicted too, as you keep rooting for them to pull off the mission.\n\nEnnio Morricone's music is perfect for the movie, especially the opening credits with montages of the Mexican revolution shown.\n\nThis is the kind of fun movie, perfect for the weekend, to relax with, as you get drawn into a crazy ride of adventure and action.",
