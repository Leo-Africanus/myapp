Familial failure is held together only by their need to help a little girl. Not to help her win, but to simply participate in her dream. A twisted dream defined by poor American standards. But despite the family's failures, they are brought together by what really mattered the whole time: their love for one another and a common goal. \n\n  \nIt's also a great look at early Carell and Dano. \n\n  \nDoes anyone else miss those feelgood vibes that we were getting in the early 2000s from indie movies before streaming was huge?",

        "content": "We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.\n\n\nBut on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  \n\nHe's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command &amp; Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! \n\n\nHe's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. \n\nHe has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.\n\nI personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!\n\n\nHe is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. \n\n\nTim Curry.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/29qFh8i.jpeg",

        "content": "I've just watched San Andreas, which is a fun but unsurprisingly unrealistic movie, but one thing that's stood out to me as particularly immersion breaking is the use of time. It's just arbitrary.\n\nFor example, at the start of the film there's a scene where a rescue helicopter is running low on fuel whilst hovering during a rescue.\n\nThe Rock (I don't even think the character has a name, it's always just The Rock playing himself) says \"we have 5 minutes!\". \n\nAbout 15 minutes later and the helicopter is still going. And then they finally rescue the girl and fly back to base, the lack of fuel completely ignored for the rest of the flight.\n\nThe scene already had plenty of jeopardy, why add low fuel as well if it's going to be ignored immediately?! \n\nAnd then later, The Rock is saving his daughter from drowning whilst appearing to hold his breath for 30mins all while doing intense physical exertion. \n\nBonus points for him watching her drown before deciding to try kicking the blockage to free her...\n\nDo these silly time related discrepancies annoy anyone else more than they should? \n\nIs there a name for this?\n\n",

What are some of the sleeper films that, if you pay attention and stay onboard, they pay off in spades?  \n\nI know after There Will Be Blood there was a lot of pressure for PTA to make a good follow up and the first half of The Master is almost daring you to fall asleep, but as it goes on the movie's character relationships start to really take off.  Any movies you almost turned off only to end up being sucked in by the middle?",

I'm sure there are people in the business out there who have a larger time gap between their continuous oscar nominations, so what are some other examples of large time gaps like Sylvester Stallone? They don't necessarily have to be for the same category. ",
