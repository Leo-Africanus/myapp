The shelves were full of clutter and the refrigerators had pictures all over them and colorful cereal boxes on top. \n\nNow everything looks like a staged showroom set and is perfectly clean. Is it a budget thing? \n\nI remember reading an article a few years ago that referenced Eyes Wide Shut and how the kitchen looked compared to new movies but I can't find it now so maybe someone here knows. \n\nIt's just so unrealistic. Especially in drama movies or tv shows. The houses literally are spotless and lifeless. I was watching When Harry Met Sally and the party scene at their friend's house struck me like wow, the shelves are full of books and clutter and rolled up newspapers and random knicknacks and it looked amazing and real. \n\nStuff now just feels...sterile.",

        "content": "By the time the very end scene comes around I am left feeling brokenhearted yet understood at the same time. Loved by but ultimately still a fallen soldier to the passage of time.\n\nI really don't know what to say about this movie without spoiling it. It follows the vacation time between a young father and his daughter and that's all that really happens. So little conflict you start to think you might be on vacation but there's an air of melancholia behind the fathers performance in almost every scene you can help but feel like these characters are fighting to stay together here forever and their bond overflows your mind of feelings of your own life and who you love. And it starts to make you wonder how meaningful those days you spent with the ones you loved so long ago really were \n\nBut it never feels pretentious or boring or that it's dragging it just moves along and you ride along with it like surfing the waves in the ocean. \n\nIt captures our perceptions of our memories and what that mean to us so well that it's ultimately the only real driving conflict in the whole movie. There are spurts between the dad and daughter here and there but really what their fighting against is the limited time they get to spend with each other. So the make every single drop of it last and it is beautiful \nand devastatingly real.\n\nI can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it. ",

But what made the movie interesting to me, personally, was Gareth Edwards' direction. He really knew how to sell the scale of the dinosaurs and the movie looked beautiful in general because it was shot on actual film.\n\nSo I wondered if there was ever a script that was very good and very fleshed out realized by a director that can't do shit to safe his live. Like, you love the story and hate everything around it. Arw there any examples?",

I love a good parody of serious topics, this felt like the Spinal Tap for a new era. \nThe shots taken at TMZ were hilarious. The way it was shot was so mtv like. Just so good. \n\nI am ashamed that it took 9 years to watch it, but I\u2019m buying the blu ray, because it has high rewatch value. \n\nAbsolutely hilarious! ",

I said the plot centers on making sure a billion-dollar racing team wins some races so they don\u2019t lose control of the ownership. You know, nothing I would really stress about.\n\nGot me wondering about what other really good movies are out there that manage to suck you in/entertain you without the characters really having much important on the line to stress you out. \n\nBorat came to mind. So did My Dinner With Andre.\n\nAny others you can think of? Might be a good list for when you just want to have something on while you\u2019re working.\n\n",
