        "content": "I don't like to praise random films that I like, but as I'm rewatching The Manhattan Project, I'm struck every time by how *good* it is. Far beyond what is expected. \n\nChristopher Collett is incredible. His protagonist is smart, way beyond smart in some ways (and oblivious in othes), but also charming, athletic, has good relationships with adults in his life, and he's also a bit of a smarmy asshole. He's like Zack Morris, if he had the brain of Screech but the inability to think past the immediate like Zack often does. He's almost a prototype for the Mark Zuckerberg character in The Social Network.\n\nThe film doesn't rely on stereotypes. Cynthia Nixon's performance is so elegantly subtle. Her mature perception of the situation, her subtle delivery of dialogue,her ability to evoke emotion with a word or a gesture--it all works so well. And John Lithgow is such a smart and likable guy, it's hard to not feel bad for him as the situation gets worse and worse. And John Mahoney is the perfect no-nonsense military man who also is honest and direct about the role people play in the military-industrial complex.\n\nThe main character is a kid who constructed a nuclear bomb not to harm anyone, but just to see if he could. He's a mad scientist in the purest sense of the label. And the schemes he creates to get the materials, to escape once caught, and to deal with the aftermath are both extremely clever and highly realistic. \n\nOh, and the group of nerds are hilarious. And did I mention Robert Sean Leonard had a small role in it?\n\nMy last plug for watching this film: Roger Ebert gave it four (4) stars.\n",

Absolutely mind blowing all round!!!.\n\nI\u2019m interested in hearing some suggestions for other films that are of an equal level of brilliance (not necessarily sci-fi), as I said I\u2019m not much of a movie guy but suggestions to some real bangers would not go unheard.\n\nThanks in advance!

        "content": "Donnie Darko's director's cut is something I could do without. The original cut was soooo good - everything was *just right* but in the DC they overexplain everything and kill the pacing of the movie somehow.\n\nOn another note, the Justice League 2017 sucked so bad it should have never been made, but ZSJL's stretched 4h+ runtime was just *okay*. Like, it's wayyy better than JL, but still not great. The story was so drawn out, and the slo-mo in every scene was just so uninteresting/uninspired (sesame seed falling from the trucker's burger, Lois putting down her coffee cup). As one reviewer put it, \"You could cut an hour without affecting the plot even a little.\" Also, why format a film for IMAX full knowing it would be released on the HBO streaming service. (Disclaimer: not hating on ZS, it's just my opinion)",
