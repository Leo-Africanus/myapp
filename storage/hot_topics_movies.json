        "content": "Hey r/movies!\n\nWe're Ian Spendloff (Creative Director and Character Designer) and Ross Wilkinson (VFX Supervisor), the Framestore team who brought Mr. Ring-A-Ding to life in Doctor Who Season 2: Lux, from concept and design through to final pixel. Ian is an Emmy winner for his animated sequences on Ms. Marvel, and has also created standout work The Marvels, and the iconic Beats Pills campaign. Ross has worked on Avatar: The Last Airbender (S1) and Avengers: Infinity War. Ask us anything! \n\nWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow (Wednesday 06/04) at 15:00 PM ET to answer your questions. Please feel free to ask away in the meantime.\n\nMore information:\n\nLed by Emmy-winning Creative Director Ian Spendloff and VFX Supervisor Ross Wilkinson, Framestore designed and animated Mr. Ring-A-Ding for Doctor Who Season 2: Lux, supported with visualisation by Framestore Preproduction Services (FPS).\n\nCrafted entirely in the UK, the team took the character from initial concept, design and previs, through to final pixel. Mr. Ring-A-Ding evolves over the episode, starting as a classic 1930s hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animation and transforming into a gruesome and realistic modern 3D character, seamlessly integrated into live-action footage.\n\nBehind-the-scenes \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuI5jP-xZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuI5jP-xZQ)\n\nBios:\n\n**Ian** \\- Ian Spendloff is a highly experienced Director, Art Director and Designer, with a particular focus on character led projects. He has created concepts, narratives, characters &amp; creatures for a host of thrilling projects, spanning advertising, series and immersive entertainment.\n\nIan\u2019s latest major project was a multi-million pound, fully CG theme park dark ride \u2018Pearl Quest\u2019, created for China\u2019s Wanda Group. Framestore were lucky enough to be granted full directorial &amp; creative control of the project, which allowed  Ian\u2019s talent in re-imagining a classic Chinese folklore to shine out over eleven large- scale installation screens. The project attracted a VES nomination for \u201cOutstanding Visual Effects in a Special Venue Project\u201d    \n\nIan was instrumental in the making of Tooned, an animated series crafted by Framestore in partnership with Formula 1 giant McLaren. Tooned was highly praised, winning the Gold Clio, Eurobest and Lovie Awards, with the special edition Tooned 50 landing Ian a place in the D&amp;AD book.\n\nIan also drove the iconic \u2018Beats by Dre\u2019 campaigns, providing the early concepts for the Pill characters right through to the animation. Ian has a  passion for capturing personality in his work, and a natural ability to add humour, emotion &amp; visual depth to any project, regardless of platform.\n\n**Ross** \\- Ross gained his first experience into visual effects during a modelling internship at Framestore in 2008. After a ten year stint at DNEG, he returned to Framestore in 2022 as a VFX Supervisor.\n\nRoss\u2019s keen eye for detail has seen him work on a variety of projects spanning film, episodic and advertising. From Marvel Studios\u2019 box-office smashing Avengers: Infinity War to season five of Black Mirror, as well as visits to the Wizarding World and The Hunger Games franchises. \n\nMore recently, Ross completed work on BBC documentary series Dinosaurs: The Final Day, with Sir David Attenborough. The documentary follows the final days of non-avian dinosaurs through the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, and was a career highlight for Ross. \n\nAsk us anything! Back at 3 PM ET today to answer your questions.",

Just to give you an idea of how popular she was, her role as Arwen wasn't that big yet she always had her face in the movies' posters which shows how much of a star she was.",

Sure, you can enjoy it as a \u201cboy and his alien\u201d story, but its commentary on Cold War paranoia is where it really shines . It\u2019s masterful storytelling for sure.\n\nThe last act is just fantastic. It\u2019s been a long time since a movie, animated or not, has made me feel so deeply.

        "content": "I rewatched Blade Runner recently, and I couldn\u2019t get over the feeling that I was watching a very different film. It wasn\u2019t that it was the latest in the umpteen cuts that have been released. And I hadn\u2019t just forgotten the plot over the years. What got me for the first time was I wasn\u2019t so sure Deckard was the good guy. Not even an antihero.\n\n&gt;!This growing unease really took root when Deckard kills Zhora. It brought to mind \u201cHan Shot First\u201d, but in this case there was no ambiguity. Deckard went to the nightclub with the intent of killing this woman and proceeded to do so by shooting her in the back as she tries to flee.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I\u2019m sitting upright and squinting at the screen trying to process this, when things go from bad to worse. In his apartment, Deckard is making unwanted advances as Rachel gets increasingly upset. She tries to leave, and he won\u2019t let her, and then he proceeds to force himself on her. And I begin to feel insane. This is rape, but it never once occurred to me until that moment.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The hits keep coming. When Pris is in her death throes it\u2019s not just disturbing, it\u2019s sad. All these replicants wanted was to live. They\u2019re fighting to survive. And this culminates when Roy saves Deckard\u2019s life when he had absolutely every reason to let him fall to his death. Was Roy the hero all along? Trying to save his friends and then proceeding to spare his nemesis\u2019 life?!&lt;\n\nSo after I pull myself together, I do some digging. There are number of discussions out there on the very topic of Deckard\u2019s character, including a piece by Eric Haywood, who had an extremely similar take. Has anyone else had this 180 experience? And if so, why? Is Blade Runner a litmus test for us and the world at large?\n\nI still believe it\u2019s an amazing film. It\u2019s aged certainly, but it has aged well. Matured into something that is still thought provoking and relevant. Just a bit more upsetting than I remembered.",

        "content": "**Ballerina - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ballerina_2024): 76% (59 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ballerina/): 62 (32 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/from-the-world-of-john-wick-ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-1236255035/) (70):\n\n&gt;If the dizzying crescendo of intricately choreographed fight scenes is the main attraction in Ballerina, it\u2019s those occasional moments of dry humor that make it a welcome extension of the John Wick universe.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-spinoff-john-wick-1236423083/)\n\n&gt;Part of the majesty behind the Wick franchise is attributable to its legacy. Stahelski knows his cinema and the series\u2019 maximalism is in direct conversation with the silent slapstick stars of yesteryear as much as 1979\u2019s The Warriors. It is, in other words, a unique blend of physical comedy and transcendental action. Ballerina very much continues that tradition, with several fights whose inspirations seem as disparate as Looney Tunes and Police Story. Beyond the usual fare of weaponry, there are inventive uses of restaurant cookery, ice skates as slicing nunchaku, and an entire section that feels as if the town from Beauty and the Beast was filled with highly trained killers.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-john-wick-1236416050/) (60):\n\n&gt;Ballerina is a worthy entry in the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d canon, though I say that as someone who doesn\u2019t think the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d canon is all that. By the end, Ana de Armas has proved that fighting like a girl and fighting like a guy need not be appreciably different, especially if they\u2019re all fighting like a video game.\n\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/ana-de-armas-ballerina-john-wick-review/) (73):\n\n&gt;\u201cBallerina\u201d is a cluttered mess with a boring storyline but the action is often amazing, and there\u2019s a genuine sense of humor to all its weird duels to the death. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been absent from the self-serious \u201cJohn Wick\u201d movies for far too long \u2014 an acknowledgement of their own wackiness.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-kills-busloads-people-orgy-violence-11747832) (58)\n\n&gt;Like dining at Burger King, it's undeniably enjoyable, but may leave you with a queasy feeling when it's all over.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/ballerina-review-john-wick-ana-de-armas/) (70):\n\n&gt;Ballerina gets off to a shaky start that almost feels like it misunderstands what has made the John Wick series so much fun for so long. Yet once the absurdity of the action takes hold, and Ana de Armas gets to prove herself as a fitting potential heir to this franchise, Ballerina captures the blunt, chaotic action that this series thrives on.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-keanu-reeves) (80):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a spinoff that knows why the John Wick series has been so successful, and both effectively follows the rules while adding to the ever expanding world. While it takes a good portion of its screentime to find confident footing, when the second half gets moving, the energy is undeniable as Ballerina becomes one funny, bloody and creative fight scene after another. I\u2019m hoping for an encore.\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/ballerina-review-john-wick-ana-de-armas-1235345736/) (50):\n\n&gt;At its best, this tale of a young female assassin seeking vengeance and wreaking havoc is one more chance to see expertly choreographed mayhem. At its worst, it plays like a Wick-ipedia sub-entry ambitiously pumped up to main-event status. Let\u2019s just say the balance tilts toward the latter more than you\u2019d like.\n\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/from-the-world-of-john-wick-ballerina-review/) (70):\n\n&gt;It makes for a tonally consistent movie, though one that fails to deliver on a deeper emotional level... It's a shame, because the action really is brilliant, even if the plot gives you a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Whoa.\n\nDirected by Len Wiseman:\n\n&gt;Taking place between the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum and Chapter 4, Eve Macarro, a ballerina-assassin, begins to train in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma and sets out to exact revenge for her father's death.\n\nCast:\n\n* Ana de Armas as Eve Macarro\n* Anjelica Huston as the Director\n* Gabriel Byrne as the Chancellor\n* Lance Reddick as Charon\n* Norman Reedus as Daniel Pine\n* Ian McShane as Winston Scott\n* Keanu Reeves as John Wick",

        "content": "I was randomly thinking about Inception today and am 99% confident the entire movie is a dream. While different actors, the clothing worn by his children in both the flashback and the end of the movie are nearly identical in addition to their location in the backyard. The girl is wearing a pink dress in the flashback and subsequently is wearing a pink dress over a white t-shirt. Similarly the boy is wearing a plaid shirt with shorts in both scenes. After not seeing his kids for \\~2 years, the chance that his kids are wearing nearly the same outfit and are in the same location in the backyard is nearly impossible.\n\nWith most directors I think you can let this slide, but Chris Nolan is particular about every detail of his movies. This was an intentional choice that is unlikely to happen in reality.\n\nPs. I think the totem was always a red herring and constructed to give the dreamer the outcome they want.\n\nEdit: The ring theory seems reasonable.  \n  \nNot to throw a grenade back into the discussion, but [this interview](https://youtu.be/3C-AzyS2lWQ?si=jrCCJPHFbChP1tnm&amp;t=83) (time stamp 1:23) with Nolan says he has an idea of how each movie plays out even if the final cut is intended to be ambiguous to the audience. The idea that Cobb doesn't care if it falls or not, isn't Nolan's idea, it's his wife's (Emma Thomas). All I'm saying is if I came home to nearly the exact same scene after two years away from my family, I'm pretty sure I'd be dreaming... but maybe in Inception its reality and the coincidence is there to facilitate the ambiguity.",

        "content": "Deva Cassel (Netflix\u2019s The Leopard), Julien De Saint Jean (The Count Of Monte Cristo) and Romain Duris (Heartbreaker) are set to co-star in a contemporary, French-language version of Gaston Leroux\u2019s classic Paris-set novel The Phantom of the Opera, aimed at a young adult audience and taking its cue from the Twilight franchise.  \n\n\n\nSND, the film production, distribution and sales arm of French commercial free-to-air broadcaster M6, is co-producing and selling the ambitious project and will launch pre-sales at the EFM with a sizzle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFilming will begin this summer at the world famous Palais Garnier opera house, or Op\u00e9ra Garnier, in Paris, against the backdrop of its theatre, backstage areas, domed roof and subterranean vaulted cistern, sometimes referred to as its lake.  \n\n\n\nThe production has also gathered a high-profile crew topped by cinematographer Nicolas Bolduc (The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers 1 &amp; 2), production designer Clovis Weill (Marie Antoinette, Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, A Breath Away), composer Dany Levy (I Lost My Body, Raw) and choreographer Marion Motin (The Substance, The last Call, Christine and the Queens, Stromae) \n\n\n\nLeroux\u2019s original 1910 novel tells the story of a beautiful young soprano who becomes the obsession of a disfigured man living in the watery subterranean labyrinth under the Op\u00e9ra Garnier but resists his advances.\n\n\n\nIn Castagnetti\u2019s contemporary adaptation, Cassel will star as 18 year old Anastasia, who is newly-arrived in Paris and full of hopes and dreams as she takes up a position as a ballet dancer at the opera house. \n\n\n\nAmbitious artistic director, James Figueras (Duris), is reviving Orpheus, the mythic opera by Ernest Dupr\u00e9, inspired by the Greek mythological figure of Orpheus and his journey into the underworld in search of his dead wife Euridice. \n\n\n\nOne night, Anastasia meets the opera house\u2019s mythical phantom (Saint Jean) and they embark on an impossible love story. Meanwhile the prima ballerina, meant for the role of Euridice, barely escapes death and Anastasia lands the star role.  \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a modern re-reading of Gaston Leroux\u2019s classic novel, which has inspired movies, series, graphic novels and musicals but amazingly has never been adapted as a French-language feature film,\u201d said SND Director of International Sales and Distribution Ramy Nahas. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe film will mix themes and genres to create an ambitious romantic film set against the backdrop of Paris, with fantasy, period and thriller elements,\u201d he continued.  \n\n\n\nNahas added that the $20M production\u2019s tone and genre-mixing style takes inspiration from the Twilight movies, which SND released theatrically in France with success.  \n\nEmerging French-Italian actress and model Cassel made her big screen debut in Italian drama The Beautiful Summer and is soon to be seen in Netflix\u2019s upcoming big-budget The Leopard reboot. \n\nSaint Jean recently appeared alongside Pierre Niney in French-language swashbuckler hit The Count Of Monte Cristo, in the role of Edmond Dant\u00e8s\u2019 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Andr\u00e9a, who tragically seeks vengeance on the father who tried to kill him as child.   \n\nEstablished and popular actor Duris was seen most recently in A Missing Part, The Three Musketeers: Milady and The Animal Kingdom.  \n\nThey will be joined on set by members of the Op\u00e9ra Garnier ballet company including its principal dancer Doroth\u00e9e Gilbert, who will play the prima donna dancer in the film, Victoire Bellanger. \n\nSND is co-producing with Paris and L.A.-based production company FullDawa (Riddle of Fire, Uncorked), which has previously produced fiction films and documentaries set against the backdrop of the Op\u00e9ra Garnier such as the 2020 Arte non-fiction work Building The Paris Opera.\n\n  \n[https://deadline.com/2025/02/deva-cassel-julien-de-saint-jean-romain-duris-phantom-of-the-opera-snd-efm-1236280339/](https://deadline.com/2025/02/deva-cassel-julien-de-saint-jean-romain-duris-phantom-of-the-opera-snd-efm-1236280339/)\n\n  \nI highly recommend watching the series The Leopard with Deva Cassel playing Angelica Sedara. She performs exceptionally well in this role in the new adaptation of Lampedusa's book.\n\n",
