        "content": "Adaptations inevitably make changes to the source material, either adding new elements or cutting out scenes or characters. Sometimes though, these changes create plot holes that weren't in the source material, either contradicting something that was already established, or omitting an explanation (which isn't necessarily a plot hole, but still very annoying).\n\nFor example, the Wizard of Oz infamously ends with Glinda the Good Witch telling Dorothy that she had the power to go back home all along with her Ruby Slippers. When asked why she didn't just say that from the start, she claims that Dorothy wouldn't have believed her, which is a rather questionable assertion. The original book has no such problem, there the Good Witch of the North and the Good Witch of the South are separate characters, the Good Witch of the North is the one that gave her the shoes, and Glinda the Good Witch of the South is the one to tell Dorothy how to go home at the end of the story.\n\nSo what other notable plot holes or weird leaps in logic weren't in the source material but were caused by adaptation changes?",

It has a touch of nostalgia even tho I have never seen it until now it\u2019s beautiful. The style is like assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert ford. With a touch of sobering narration. The movie is about a logger in the late 1800\u2019s and it follows his life and lessons he learns as he grows old. I am not the best at articulating what I think or feel. Nor do I rarely comment more then a couple of sentences here and there on any topic let alone a movie. But my god this film had me on the verge of tears and on the edge of my seat. The whole time I am psycho analysing my own life with this movie. As a farther and a partner it hit close to home. Joel Edgerton is an amazing actor and he really done well with this film. The director is Clint Bentley and this is his third Film. The wide and open shots with a Slow Zoom out this director chose to use frequently really set the tone in so many scenes. I highly recommend this film 10/10",

In his early career, that often resulted in roles that made little impression, but over the years it has become one of his unique strengths. For all his clearly enormous talent, Edgerton has only in the past decade or so gained the gravitas that allows him to truly embrace these haunted characters \u2014 not just to play them but to become them.\u201d",

However, some films are just lightning in a bottle, and expansion just seems... off. Straight away, two examples spring to my mind: \n\n\n\n**Die Hard**. Sure, Die Harder, Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard are good, but there's no topping the first one. \n\n\n\n**Home Alone**. I might get some flak for this, but Home Alone as a franchise just goes off the rails. A second one that is a beat-for-beat clone of the first, the third one introduces a kid with NO connection to the MacCalisters, and the fourth just repeats the first again by pretending an entirely different kid is Kevin?

Ironically, most notably superhero movies.\n\nSpiderman 2\n\nX-Men 2: United\n\nBlade 2\n\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier (2nd installment)\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nEmpire Strikes Back\n\nWrath of Khan\n\nI am sure there are more out there that come to mind.\n\nThere are also film series out there where it could be argued that other later sequels are better than the first installment, or maybe even the previous installment.",

        "content": "Such a great satisfying revenge film. Joel Edgerton is amazing in it. His character is so complex and flawed yet you still root for him. I think a lot of us who were bullied or were teated badly due to being different can relate to this movie. The way he goes about the revenge also isn't in a bad or harmful way. He just let's the bully destroy their lives by being themselves. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. A truly unique and amazing revenge film up there with Old Boy and other great revenge films.",

Some of my top are Superbad, Anchorman, Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express. I don\u2019t follow TV or movies anymore, does anyone have suggestions of recent films that are good and fit this category?

That's a great character for a movie to have, I believe. What are some other movies that fit this category, could be of any genre. I think the Indiana Jones series ( the first three) and back to the future also do this extremely well. Have a good day.",
