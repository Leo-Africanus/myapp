Including a few not on the list. Very much appreciated. I'm going to watch Irreversible tonight and I have a few others ready to watch. I won't be watching A Serbian Film because it sounds like I don't need that in my life haha. Thanks all.\n\nand apologies to those I've exposed to movie related trauma\n\nEdit 2: I just watched Irreversible (Spoilers ahead naturally). Honestly I thought that it was a very good film which is possibly cheapened(?) by it's reputation as a 'controversial' or 'shock' film. I actually had heard of it before in the context of a film that was designed to make you sick and the horror of the rape scene.\n\nYes the rape scene is ROUGH. I left out a long deep sigh after to release the tension and man is it painfully long... but in my opinion it is entirely integral to the point of the film. I felt that showing the film in reverse order was ingenious in that it shows us that the victim is nothing that the rapist attributes to her in his rage, which (in his mind) justifies his violence. It provides the context of this persons life before this horrific act and humanises her, after the fact which I felt was actually far more poignant.\n\nIf we had seen the film in the chronological order we would have been left feeling the anger and satisfaction of revenge and would have forgotten about the women and what she has lost. In my opinion this is the main message of the story.\n\nFinally there was an interesting dynamic between three types of men we get introduced to in the film. One, her ex boyfriend is loving but too \"cerebral\" to quote the main character. The rapist which is full of rage and self pleasure and her boyfriend which is a balance between the two. I haven't taken the time to think about the significance of this yet but I feel it's also an important part of the film.\n\nIf I had one problem with the backwards order of the film it's that I would have taken extreme pleasure in seeing that fucker get his head smashed in if I had had the context at the time (Which I just realised is the wrong fucking fella... God damn there is no justice in this movie). Maybe that was part of the point too...\n\nAnyway thanks a lot! I feel I probably watched the best one first lol. Any more suggestions of a similar quality of narrative please comment and let me know!\n\nAlso the shakey camera does calm down after a while thank fuck",

        "content": "I just finished watching this, so I better write this before I forget what happened in it.\n\nThis movie feels like what I'd expect out of a James Bond, but he is played by someone who is 57, and in a movie was released in 1985, probally the lowest era of Bond. \n\nIt has all the goofy stuff you would expect such as, a man getting killed by a butterfly model, a horrible French accent and a villain who kills all his henchmen because he feels like it, only letting one survive. It's not even so Bond has one more henchman to kill he just chills in a blimp for the finale. \nThe villain whose mother was experimented on in a concentration camp, she was given steroids, and stay with me now, so he is super smart but is also a psychopath due to the steroids. This is what I want from Bond villains, by the way, just pure goofiness. \n\nThis is one that I somehow had never seen, despite me watching these a lot when I was younger, this one I never saw. I can't even say it was because the tv wouldn't show it because I watched it on the player. \n\nI'm going to give view to kill, six horse steroids out of seven monocles, or basically 6 out of 10. ",

        "content": "My favorite movie is Return to me. David Duchovny and Minnie Drive were so great. To me that movie seemed so real and I cry every time I see it. My wife was killed by a drunk driver and  David losing his wife was so intense. I got the call to get to the hospital and the movie brought that back. When he went home I felt every scene he acted out. Simple things like going through a sock drawer had a whole new meaning at that time My wife and  were soulmates. There is no way to describe it. She was my everything. When I was watching her die and only the machines were keeping her alive I kept looking at the clock. How long do I have to sit  and watch her die. They did nothing because she had a Basel Skull fracture. They just kept wrapping bandages around her head and the blood would soak through. Finally they said they cant use any of her parts for donation because they were all contaminated. She was riding her bike and was hit from behind. They found her in the road because the driver took off. We don't even no how long she was laying there. I remember the scene when he left the hospital. My wife is dead and now I go home. I miss her so much. [https://fb.watch/xOsdFMpCe0/](https://fb.watch/xOsdFMpCe0/)",

        "content": "There was a mystery horror screening at my local cinema tonight and it was The Monkey, so thanks to u/tanmaycaptain mentioning i should post a review i decided to\n\nHonestly it's an 8/10 for me, it was a really fun time, it genuinely felt like a blend of Final Destination/Deadpool, it sounds crazy but it just worked for the film\n\nIt was a lot more comedic than i was expecting and several moments and the way they were edited made myself and the others in the cinema laugh out loud\n\nThe death scenes too were brutal for some of them, especially the opening one, but some were genuinely hilarious in how they happened and had people laughing at it\n\nThe plot may have been a little thin but it still managed to throw up a surprise in how it did it which i never expected, but it is definitely more of a comedy/horror than outright horror, think more Scary Movie than Scream, but it was a blast and the credits song was a certified classic too\n\nHighly recommend checking it out when it comes out on 21st\n",

        "content": "There are many great shots in this movie, a variety of spectacles both big and small. Those interstitial establishing shots of the American base are perfectly lit. Very showy, nicely dramatic. Particularly at night. But even the modest/unassuming shots, like that cozy image of the two watching the VHS tape and passing around a joint, have staying power. \n\nWhy the shot of the dog? I feel like to describe it would be to reduce it somehow. It just works on a visceral level. If I was pressed to explain, I guess I'd ramble about the unnerving stillness of the dog. And, just as unnerving, the steadiness of his observation. He's watching the returning crew with keen interest. He's sizing up his new circumstances. To what extent has he been \"found out\"? It's not that dogs aren't capable of close observation or calculation. But because of the context of the story, the viewer imagines an extraterrestrial intelligence at work behind the dog's eyes. \n\nCarpenter could have easily made the dog's villainy feel cartoonish, but instead he creates the vibe through a few decisive images, the best of which is this very alien (and alienating, for the viewer) moment of observation.",

The ending was kind of emotional and touching too.  Definitely right up there with The Wild Robot as not only one of the best animated films last year, but that I\u2019ve ever seen.  I would probably say I enjoyed, The Wild Robot, slightly more though. Also for those others who have seen it what are your thoughts on it?",

Like the title says, I\u2019m looking for movie suggestions where either the protagonist gets revenge after a significant amount of time has passed since the original wrongdoing (think The Northman) or has to find the antagonist without much information to go on (just a face, or just a first name, or something). I look forward to the recommendations! ",

        "content": "Julie Andrews didn't get to play Eliza Doolittle because she wasn't famous enough. The studio wanted a name and Audrey Hepburn only said yes because she was told if she said no, the next person they'd be asking would have been Elizabeth Taylor. Julie Andrews wasn't going to play Eliza if Audrey had rejected the part. \n\nThrough the years, Audrey Hepburn got a lot of scrutiny. Her not getting nominated while Julie Andrews ended up winning the Oscar for \"Mary Poppins\", the dubbed singing by Marni Nixon (let's just pretend previous leading stars didn't get dubbed whenever they sang in movie musicals). \n\nBut watching My Fair Lady, I thought Hepburn was fantastic in it. Her Cockney accent, played by a Belgian actress, was pretty impressive and what struck me the most was how funny she was in the film's second half. Her starting out as a clumsy flower girl and then gradually changing her demeanor, showing vulnerability as she struggles to \"change\" and when she finally becomes a \"lady\", she starts to create her own identity and is faced with the tragedy of losing it all and going back to what she used to be. \n\nI thought Hepburn truly nailed these sentiments within Eliza. So much of the praise was directed at Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins that people forget how genuinely good Hepburn is in the movie.",

        "title": "One thing I miss from older movies- the slower pacing of scenes!",
        "content": "I was watching some older movies such as Close Encounters, Star wars, and Alien and realized something was different. Something which I don't think many modern audiences would like, but I liked it so to speak. I just couldn't figure out what it was.\n\nI then watched half of an awful Antman multiverse Marvel movie before giving up and realized what it was. It wasn't the lack of CGI, actors actually being big names, or stunts being real back then. It was the slower pacing of scenes!\n\nFor example, I think in 2001 SO there was like a 10 minute scene of a ship docking. I actually got bored of that as a kid and fast forward if my dad wasn't looking lol. In Alien they spent like 5 minutes looking for a cat and then later she spent what felt like 10 minutes looking for the cat again. And they made it work too as they made it interesting. I can see how modern audiences might not like that but to me that is so much better than what they do to pad out movies in the modern area, which is usually lots of table talk-and I'd say there is actually more talking than what they did in the older movies too.\n\nIt might bad take. I just do miss movies that might stick to the plot being one night to a week over it being like the telling of the whole war. Then again you do have to be careful with what you ask for because the Modern Starwars movies have drawn out scenes like the Casino Planet. IDk then again I probably would take the Casino Planet jobber sidequest over adding more table talk in",
