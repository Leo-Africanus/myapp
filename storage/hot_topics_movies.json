        "content": "So, last night I made a joke to my brother that I was gonna get high and watch some foreign lesbian love story. Then I did precisely that - 3 grams of edibles later and I rented \"Portrait of a lady on Fire\"\n\nThe movie had good reviews, and I'm still treating it like a joke at first. It's about 5-10 minutes into the film I realized every assumption I MAY have had about the movie was far, far off. and any notions of it being like a joke turned into a joke themselves.\n\nThe shots of the movie were\u00a0**so utterly beautiful it sometimes felt like I didn't even have the right to look at the screen.**\u00a0The\u00a0**characters were so utterly realistic it sometimes felt like I was genuinely invading their privacy simply by watching them.**\u00a0I related to them. I liked them. It is the only film I have seen where\u00a0**the cinematography was so good it provided a theater-like experience at home.**\n\nMy point is, I went into a movie expected a joke, and instead got a masterpiece every film student in creation should analyze thoroughly.\n\n**By the end, I was left thinking \"Jesus, that was so, so much better than it had any right to be.\"**\n\nWhat movie was this for you?",

Who was Georgy Fyodorovich Zhukov?,,, im joking with the Middle name , it just feels more Russian that way ,, Zhukov at the time of these events was the 2nd most powerful man in the soviet union , if not the most admired.. the hero of Stalingrad.. he had 5 million men under his command. Safe to say ,he  commanded enough loyalty to maybe take over the 11 countries under his defensive charge. But despite all that , he stays or rather pretends to distance himself from politics for fear of reprisal though this wasn't likely. But he proves himself intrepid when at the right time he steps into the limelight in the most hilarious potrayal of the dickhead hero playing coy but observing everyone and their games.",

It's absolutely gorgeous. The second is the Flight of the Navigator score by Alan Silvestri. The guy left it all on the table for a movie where a spaceship voiced by Pee-wee Herman kidnaps a kid from 1979. Equal parts whimsical and heartwarming.

That, combined with amazing atmosphere and immersion (mostly due to the faux one-shot style) place this movie just above the other greats like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie (whether you like war movies or not) is doing themselves a disservice. ",

        "content": "murder investigation thriller movies which happens in a group inside a house. Doesn't have to be detective movie just finding who did the crime doesnt even have to be murder as well.\n\nWhen murder/ crime happens in close quarters  like a house or mansion or boat train blah blah blah, the people in the group would know that nobody would trust each other out of fear and cause them to act alone which becomes ideal situation for murderer especially when nobody notices the pattern and more people get killed.\n\n  \nEdit : I will come back after few days and then list them here in numbering type format. Thanks everyone.",
