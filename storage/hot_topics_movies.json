She should\u2019ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.\n\nShe\u2019s so believable as twins it\u2019s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which \u201ctwin\u201d was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. \n\nEvery single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they\u2019re twins. There\u2019s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic. It\u2019s so subtle, but packs a big punch. Never in a millions years, did I ever think I\u2019d start to tear up watching The Parent Trap, of all movies\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s so good, and the movie seriously surprised me. I would definitely watch it again \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.\n\nSo this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.\n\nAnd one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.\n\nI know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about \"I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent\" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous). But I'm curious how did people react to this opening after seeing their favourite hero return.",

Granted I know the population will never get this bad but it felt more real to me. \n\nAnd the final twist which I\u2019m sure everyone knows by now, most humans are processed to be converted into food for the rest also feels real. I\u2019ve recently learned much of the food we eat is grown in sewage! A shocking truth but hey what else can we do? We need food! And the rich practically get away with everything! Again who do we know recently this has happened with? \n\nGosh the film has really left me shaken still all these years.",

        "title": "I have a soft spot for \"Die Hard 2\" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three \"Die Hard\" entries.",
        "content": "There's no way, of course, that \"2\" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by \"Vengeance\" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.\n\nBut I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.\n\nI'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest \"Die Hard\" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",

His response was to play the victim like \"Man, why so aggressive?\".\n\nThe thing is, constant questioners IMO, basically know they're being annoying and it anyway. We're watching the same movie. We're up to the same point in the movie since we're watching it together. I don't have any knowledge of the movie you don't, unless you weren't paying attention - but even still, that is not on me to rectify for you, you need to pay attention.\n\nAnd even still, he asks questions I couldn't possibly have the answer for and it's strongly implied the movie will answer them for you anyway as long as you keep watching.

The movie hasn't given us the information yet but you know it will later!\n\nIs it just me, or are constant questioners the worst people to watch movies with?

In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar.\n- In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar's dead wife.\n- In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two.\n- In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others.\n- In Breens movies, the villains/antagonists are corrupt politicians and/or corrupt businessmen. In Megalopolis, the main antagonists are Mayor Cicero and the banker Crassus.\n\nI'm not claiming that Neil Breen wrote the script to Megalopolis. However is it possible that Breens work had an influence on Megalopolis?",

        "content": "I've made a website called OscarsChecklist.com. It's similar to IMDB or Letterboxd, where you can mark which films you've watched, but this one is specifically for ALL the Oscar nominated movies since 1929.\n\nAll of the 10,000+ nominations are here, and you can browse by category, year, film, person and more! You can see your friends' progress, and you'll be able to predict winners, which then allows a live scoreboard to gamify the ceremony!\n\nIt's all free, there's no ads, l've just made it because I knew if I wanted it to exist, other people in the world probably do too.",

        "content": "I am 24 years old atm. I have not seen an animated Pixar picture in a long time. Now I watched Coco, just to see if they are still my cup of tea. I have to say, it felt like traveling back in time to some degree. \n\nBecause when entering the world of Coco, I felt the wonder of child-me again. I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.\n\nIt was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It's pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. \n\nAlso, the movie looks beautiful. The shadows, the lights and the very strong colours make it a visually pleasing experience. What really caught me off guard was the detail on some characters. The wrinkles on Coco herself are borderline photorealistic. \n\nAll in all, this was a pretty fullfilling watch in my opinion. ",

Somewhere in the middle of Arrival, E.T., Paul, and the book (soon to be movie!) Project Hail Mary. Something where humans work together with them, even if it is against another alien species. (I\u2019m of course aware Star Trek exists)",

        "content": "I feel like this was originally supposed to be a part of his super hero, super villain universe. There's all these little clues in there that have no real pay off. Like him snatching the box of swag like it's nothing, the whole weirdly inserted psycho-analyst that seemed way too important (like it was supposed to be the chick who ran that weird organization from Glass), tanking like 3 stun guns, and him escaping at the end. \n\nAnyway, movie was whatever, but honestly just felt like it was originally something different - and not just a $20 million dollar investment in his daughter's career.",

        "content": "Knights are my favorite thing like ever. I love medieval romantic literature, and tales of knights and fairies and ti my knowledge, there is a severe LACK of those movies. I try every now and again to find movies that fit the right tone as Ladyhawke or A Knight's Tale but it's almost impossible. Either the movie is trying to be historical (which I have less than 0 interest in), or is straight up bad (like that one King Arthur Movie a while ago with the dude from Sons of Anarchy) So really wanna learn if there would be more!!!\n\nThanks a bunch if you have any suggestions.\n\nEdit: Y'all have been so great with all of these suggestions, thanks SO much. I'm happy to know there are so many others passionate about this niche like me. Keep it up!! Let's make this post the definitive post to go to when you need to know what kinda Knight Movies anyone would wanna watch.",

        "title": "The Lies (and Deaths) of Christopher Nolan",
        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan\u2019s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. \n\nMemento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. \n\nIn The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier\u2019s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.\n\nAt the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent\u2019s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel\u2019s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who\u2019s already grieving from her death.\n\nA large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.\n\nInterstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.\n\nNolan\u2019s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people\u2019s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.\n\nThere was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan\u2019s movies but I can\u2019t remember it now.

        "content": "Just looking for movies that really resonate that deep 80s Cold war feel. American soldiers undercover in Soviet countries doing covert ops. I love the feel those kinds of movies have and would love to know some good films in this genre. Love the content of games like the first CoD: Black Ops and the Cold War they came out with a few years ago. Some of the later 80s and early 90s Bond films I love too but I really dig the undercover military stuff in Communist/Soviet countries!\n\nEDIT: Basically anything 80s covert Cold War era. Russians invading/intercepting/spying on Americans and vice versa. I really like the idea of agents undercover during the Cold War era looking like your typical joe-schmoe. ",

Pre weird-era Johnny Depp as a rare books dealer; part Indiana Jones adventure, part National Treasure, but with satanic manuscripts instead of doodads and geegaws.  Not really horror, but still spooky and unsettling at times.  Impeccable vibes,\nnot really sure how to describe other than mellow and dusty?
