You could say that Edgar Wright, the director of the new version, has made it into a decent Bruce Willis movie. The staging is crisp with sadistic timing, the human element rarely overshadows the rigorously staged mayhem, and Glen Powell, as a family man from the lower depths who becomes the survivor hero of a deadly competition show that\u2019s like \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d updated to the age of reality-TV insanity, uses his small darting eyes and buff bod and quick delivery to conjure the vicious spirit that is sometimes, according to the logic of a film like this one, decency\u2019s only recourse. Powell, born and raised in Texas, knows how to chisel his features into a mean glare of revenge. But there\u2019s still something fundamentally sweet about him; he\u2019s doing an impersonation of \u201980s-action-hero heartlessness.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/11/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-edgar-wright-stephen-king-future-shock-sci-fi-satire) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;The resulting film is never anything but likable and fun \u2013 though never actually disturbing in the way that it\u2019s surely supposed to be. Yet there\u2019s plenty of enjoyment to be had. Wright accelerates to a sprint for some full-tilt chase sequences; there\u2019s a nice punk aesthetic with protest \u2019zines being produced by underground rebels; and Wright always delivers those sugar-rush pop slams on the soundtrack, including, of course, the Spencer Davis Group\u2019s Keep on Running. It\u2019s a quirk of fate that The Running Man arrives in the same year as The Long Walk, also from a King book: a similar idea, only it\u2019s walking not running.\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/2023415/the-running-man-glen-powell-edgar-wright-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 10\n\n&gt;For all his skills, Wright seemingly can't pin down what he wants \"The Running Man\" to be. The action isn't very exciting, the satire is unoriginal, and the over-reliance on weird product placement (both Liquid Death *and* Monster Energy get distracting shout-outs here) make the entire picture feel manufactured. I had high hopes that Wright could get \"The Running Man\" across the finish line, but the film stumbles right out of the gate.\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-b2862079.html) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;The Running Man is a near-total failure. What should, quite easily, feel like a mirror\u2019s been smashed and its pieces methodically jammed between our ribs feels closer to a friendly knock on the shoulder. The material\u2019s all there, yet there\u2019s none of the urgency.\n\n[IGN - 7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-edgar-wright)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a very well put-together film, and more so than not, it\u2019s full of charming performances, clever little details and some less-outlandish-than-I\u2019d-like social commentary. Even though Edgar Wright\u2019s stamp isn\u2019t clearly on every sequence like some of his previous work, The Running Man sprints where it needs to, giving Glen Powell his first chance to be a full-fledged action hero. It\u2019s a movie that lives up to its heritage but gets a little tonally caught between the book and its first, more Arnold-y adaptation, and does a few different things pretty well instead of doing one thing really well.\u00a0It\u2019s a solid movie, one that I\u2019m looking forward to watching again, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s running quite hard enough.\n\n[LiveforFilm - Sarah Louise Dean](https://www.liveforfilm.com/2025/11/11/review-the-running-man-is-one-powell-after-another/)\n\n&gt;The actors give their all, the world feels real and as always with a Wright movie, the soundtrack is sensational, but there is almost nothing that makes this film a preferential watch to its superior predecessor. Yet there is a light at the end of this booby-trapped tunnel. He\u2019s not the next Schwarzenegger, nor another Cruise. *The Running Man* showcases Glen Powell as the natural successor to Bruce Willis, and that\u2019s a platform worth running on.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-running-man/) \\- 5 / 10\n\n&gt;Edgar Wright creates solid enough action, but it's far from the level of creativity we've come to know from him. It doesn't help that the pacing and tonal issues only mask an action film that comes off more as an aesthetic siphoning of King's work than a meaningful adaptation.\n\n[ScreenDaily - Nikki Baughan](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-running-man-review-edgar-wrights-bombastic-stephen-king-adaptation-doesnt-go-the-distance/5210845.article)\n\n&gt;Edgar Wright\u2019s bombastic Stephen King adaptation doesn\u2019t go the distance. *The Running Man* has a great deal in common with *The Long Walk* \u2013 another dystopian story about desperate men attempting to win a heinous contest of survival, recently adapted by Francis Lawrence. But whereas Lawrence\u2019s film dug into the political nuances of this social set-up, and the psychology of those on both sides of the divide \u2013 and was all the more impactful for it \u2013 here, these potentially more interesting corners have been shaved off to make way for an easily-digestible popcorn actioner.\n\n[AwardsWatch - Jay Ledbetter](https://awardswatch.com/the-running-man-review-edgar-wright-calls-out-americas-wrongs-in-the-latest-and-largely-pointless-stephen-king-adaptation-c/) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;The moral of the story is this: walk, don\u2019t run, to *The Running Man*. It\u2019s a testament to Edgar Wright that *The Running Man* feels like a little bit of a letdown, as it never bores and has ideas on its mind, which is more than most movies can say. Maybe the era of Wright being on the cutting edge of genre filmmaking is simply over; time comes for us all, after all. Perhaps the $110 million price tag put more external pressure on him than he was accustomed to. Whatever the case may be, *The Running Man* is a satisfying film without a tremendous amount of stickiness. Glen Powell\u2019s forehead vein notwithstanding, the film has little pop. It looks\u2026 fine enough. Its editing is\u2026 good for pretty much everybody else but doesn\u2019t inspire like Wright\u2019s best work. The character motivation is\u2026 consistent, at least?\u00a0",

I was taken aback by how carefully it examined the peculiarities of relationships. It was incredibly endearing, and a lot of that stems from how genuine Harry and Sally are shown as people. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are naturally hilarious and that combined amazingly with how skilled at projecting vulnerability they are.\n\nHad I realized Rob Reiner directed it, as a fan of \"Stand by Me\" and \"The Princess Bride,\" I probably would have watched it sooner. It has his signature earnestness in spades. While I normally do not care for how tropey romance films are, and the film leans more into those as it progresses, I actually didn't dislike it as much because it all felt more earned than usual. I felt genuinely happy for Harry and Sally when they were together at the end.",

It is premiering at DOC NYC on November 13th.  Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nThey built Burning Man. They inspired Fight Club. Then they created Santacon\u2026 and totally lost control of it as an anarchy-fueled 1990s prank transformed into a drunken, violent shitshow; and the world's most hated holiday.\n\n**Here's our trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7C0WCqBICw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7C0WCqBICw)   \n\\---------------------------------\n\nToday, Santacon is known as perhaps the single most hated event on the planet. A dreaded day in which tens of thousands of drunk idiots dress like Santa and invade countless cities around the world to live out their drunkest and most violent instincts.\n\nBut it began as something else entirely: A piece of Dada street theater designed to shock people out of their everyday existence by creating a sense of awe and confusion.\n\nThe folks who started Santacon in the \u201890s are the same people who started Burning Man (and also lost control of that as the culture took hold of it) and who served as the real-life inspiration for Fight Club and Project Mayhem. And today, they want nothing to do with their Christmas creation.\n\nWelcome to SANTACON: An immersive documentary about how great ideas can transform into something sinister--and what it's like to accept and live in a world you no longer understand.\n\nTold with exclusive access to the event's original creators and with countless hours of never-before-seen home movies from the \u201890s, you\u2019ll be transported back in time to a world of awe, wonder, and endless possibility.\n\n\\--------------------------------------  \n**More Info:**\n\n[www.santacondoc.com](http://www.santacondoc.com)\n\nAsk me anything!
