I don\u2019t think this is a groundbreaking take but it was really special to me to just have that \u201cah-ha\u201d moment.\n\nWhen you think about The Dude and how much of a ~go with the flow~ kind of person he is, constantly adapting, you can then really see how he is the embodiment of living by Taoists principles. Just an entire movie dedicated to shit happening over and over to a singular individual wrapped up in the strands and complications of everyone else\u2019s problems. You would expect that to be a terrible experience, and at times it can be, but rather than submitting to despair he just abides. As he abides, there are moments of serenity, more often than not in the bowling alley.\u00a0Now he does go through the range of human emotion as you would expect one to go through during all these events, but not only is that normal, that is what is expected of trying to live and abide in balance with all there is and all that can be. The ol ying and the yang you know? The Dude just simply continues to be. I find that deeply moving and deeply spiritual. We are all just travelers in this iteration of who we are and all we can do is continue to trying to abide and not spill our beverage.",

You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

I don't need compelx motivations, it is just the right thing to do because its the right thing to do? I can't think of many examples that do this - everything seems to have a complex back story. ",

But the worst part for me is right before that, when they go to David's home and &gt;!find his wife strung up in one of those spider cocoons. She died, alone, afraid, in agony, not knowing what happened to her husband or son or what the mist and the monsters were. From her perspective, they went to the store, the mist rolled in, and a nightmare started!&lt;\n\nI knew about the ending going in. I did not know about this part, and it really hit me, especially since I'm married and a (fairly) new dad.",

But with 2001: A Space Odyssey, I\u2019m just stuck. I\u2019ve been left in awe, confusion, and something I can\u2019t even put into words.\n\nI\u2019ve already watched breakdowns and analyses of the film and its ending, and yet I still can\u2019t decide if I absolutely love it or just really like it. I\u2019ve never had a movie make me feel this way, like the issue is that I\u2019m not even sure how to process it, let alone rate it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way about the movie? If so is it because it\u2019s some sort of masterpiece or is just rlly good cinema?",
