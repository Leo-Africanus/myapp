It's our first feature, made totally independently and it's taken us about three years to complete. \n\nCheck out the [Trailer!](https://youtu.be/nPQiEFkzpgE)\n\n&gt;Tove is teetering on the edge of self-destruction. Burdened by the weight of her past, her life seems to be spiraling out of control with no way out. That is, until she crosses paths with Jesse.\n\n&gt;Jesse is everything Tove isn't \u2014 calm, grounded, and full of hope. Their unexpected meeting becomes the catalyst for change, igniting a spark of possibility in Tove's dark world. As the two grow closer, Tove is forced to confront the very demons she's been running from. Can Jesse's unwavering support and love be enough to pull her back from the brink? Or will Tove\u2019s inner turmoil ultimately push her further into the abyss?\n\n&gt;In a story about second chances, healing, and the power of connection, Tove must decide if she\u2019s ready to rewrite her story before it\u2019s too late.\n\n![img](wya1ggph3rfe1)\n\nWe're an open book and look forward to your questions!\n\nJocke and Sven",

Of course the original movie required going through the entire gameplay sequence but it's still possible that dying wouldn't have killed you in real life.",

I still haven't gotten around to the James Bond and John Wick films though.\n\nBut oh man, the Mission: Impossible movies might be some of the best action movies of all-time. The first one may be the slow one out of the whole series but even 2 isn't a bad movie in general despite being the worst of the Mission: Impossible movies. Fallout even blows most of the Marvel movies out of the water besides for Captain America: The Winter Solider and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's surprising to me that Tom Cruise does his own stunts for all of the Mission: Impossible movies, if someone like Brad Pitt or Bruce Willis were Ethan Hunt, they wouldn't do most of their own stunts. And the most divisive movie of the series, Dead Reckoning is still actually a really good movie besides for IIsa's death. Just really good movies around.\n\nI really hope that Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is actually the best Mission: Impossible just because of how good it looks.",

He was excellent in The Last Duel, but I definitely feel his look doesn't lend to roles in period films. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, actors like Tobias Menzies and Mark Rylance seem to blend into period settings more than contemporary ones. \n\nThis makes me wonder, what makes some actors look more \"period\" than others? I think super neat dental veneers and plastic surgeries play a role here (for example, Nicole Kidman in The Northman looked distinctly modern), but I don't think that's the full answer. What are your thoughts? ",

Whoopi is absolutely electric in this movie. She bursts in like lightning and so smoothly carries the tone from comedy to drama and back again and she pulls that off effortlessly even in individual scenes. She doesn\u2019t even show up in the movie at all till 40 minutes in. \n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant performance and again she won the Oscar so it\u2019s not underrated or anything, but I think it\u2019s often viewed as a sort of silly performance or even a Magical Negro (ess) one, but it isn\u2019t anything like that.

To cheer myself up, I decided to have a Disney movie marathon while coughing my lungs up.\n\nDisney\u2019s animated Tarzan was among the movies I re-watched. For me, the soundtrack remains a masterpiece. I feel like it was perfectly interwoven with the narrative and just amazing in general.\n\nThe opening scene still hits me in the feels, especially with the accompanying music.\n\nSabor herself still gives off a deadly ambiance also. The terrifying sounds she makes and her overall vibe feel incredibly intense, especially with it being a Disney movie,. The way her claws are animated and the fluidity of her movements just feel super deadly, even after all these years. Combined with the background music, her scenes still give me chills, even with the occasional touches of humor thrown into them.\n\nThat's my movie moment/character that still gives me chills, even after re-watching the movie. What's yours?",

        "title": "\"Bowfinger\" (1999) is such a genius parody of the move business. It's impossible not to laugh at the hijinks and the shade directed at the industry",
        "content": "It's unfortunate it didn't do as well as some of the more popular Eddir Murphy movies because Bowfinger is probably among his top 5 movies ever. Then again, thank god it didn't do a lot or else we would have had a couple of mediocre sequels. \n\nThere isn't a single flaw in this movie. Even the set-up of the unknown dorky twin works because the writing is so good and Murphy plays it up so well, either as the narcissistic egomaniacal asshole Kit Ramsey with his endless rants about not being appreciated or racist paranoia (he mistakes Shakespeare for Shake a Spear), or the geeky Jiff who's used by the untalented director, Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), as a occasional body double for Kit Ramsey, in his movie \"Chubby Rain\". Bowfinger decides to direct a movie by filming Ramsey without him knowing about it.\n\nHe also has aging actress Carol (Christine Baranski), who doesn't know when to overact and wants to have sex with Kit Ramsey, Daisy (Heather Grahame), an aspiring and ambitious actress who can't act but will do anything to go up in her career (said to be a diss directed at Anne Heche whom Steve Martin used to date), Afrim (Adam Alexi Malle), a Videostore owner who helps fund Bowfinger's ambitions among others. \n\nThe film also features strong supporting turns from Robert Downey Jr (during his \"I'm cancelled Junkie\" phase) and Terence Stamp. \n\nA highlarious movie. The highway scene is a classic. It always gives its audience an uproarious laughter.",

The more melancholic, subtle and contemplating the better. Bonus points if they're Korean/Japanese (or Asian cinema in general). \n\nTo give you a better example of what I'm looking for here's a couple I can think of I've seen already: Bleak Night, After My Death, A ghost story, Aftersun, Arrival, Taste of Cherry, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, Fountain, Synecdoche New York, Nine Days, Stand by Me, Demolition, The Father, Another Earth, Third Star.

A prolific character actor, he's even set to appear as the leading villain in a Marvel films as Glacactus in the new \u201cFantastic 4\u201d movie. \n\nHere's a look at his roles in Eggers movies : \"William - The Witch\", \"Captain Volodymryr - Northman\", \"Dr. Wilhelm Sievers - Nosferatu\".
