        "content": "Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.\n\n\nI mean, I've seen lots of violent movies (including all the Saw films) but somehow there's scenes like this that really hit hard and I'm not sure why. Wondering if anyone else has anything similar.",

        "content": "I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn\u2019t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nHoly hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.\n\nOne of his killings (and you\u2019ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I\u2019ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).\n\nThe production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.\n\nIf you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven\u2019t seen it in years. Check it out. I\u2019m interested i hearing what others think.",

How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?\n\nFor example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley. It's like they're rendered too colorful and too dull at the same time, making them lack life or something.\n\nWhat is that? Does anyone else get that feel? What are the words to describe this distinction? Because every time I talk about it I don't get the sense that people actually see what I mean, since I'm not solely talking about the cinematography, I don't think, it's more of a *feeling* of emptiness and fakeness.\n\nEdit: obviously \"give *me* the vocabulary,\" I typed out the title too fast",

        "content": "Are there any movies from say\u2026the last 10-15 years that have come out that you guys think will be considered must-watch classics 20ish years from now? Do you think that they\u2019ll have the same rewatch-ability/lasting impact like movies in the past?\n\nI\u2019m thinking of movies like Godfather, Titanic, Jurassic Park, Breakfast Club, Wizard of Oz, The Shining, etc etc. Movies that my parents would consider the best of the best of their generation. And most have had a lasting impact in cinema and stood the test of time. \n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of big titles that made a lot of money, but it has me wondering what will stay relevant years from now, movies that we show our kids and future generations will still love.

True Grit, Starman, Iron Man, Tron and Tron Legacy, Crazy Heart, The Big Lebowski, and so many more beyond just those listed here.\n\nIf I had to pick one personally, I really enjoyed his work in Tron: Legacy. He was no doubt iconic in The Big Lebowski of course, but I think his role as an older Kevin Flynn in Tron Legacy is something I always look forward to every single time I go and rewatch the movie.\n\nWhat about all of you? What are some of your favorite Jeff Bridges movies?",

        "content": "I just watched Pleasantville and I was blown away. The acting, editing, and cinematography were fantastic. The storyline was truly original, as I can\u2019t think of many films (if any) like it.  It almost felt like watching Truman Show for the first time, which was a huge success at the box office and talked about often. I also felt like the message was so relatable, no matter your age. \n\n\nSo my question is this, why isn\u2019t this film popular? At first glance, it appears it should have been a hit. I\u2019m not saying you should necessarily compare it to the greatest dramas of all time, but it definitely deserves more recognition than it received. \n\nWhat am I missing? Why was this film a box office bomb? ",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nJust a random daydream earlier about how amazing 1993 was with both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List being directly by the same guy. Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).\n\nThoughts?",
