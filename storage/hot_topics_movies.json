        "title": "December 20-22 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' tops 'Mufasa: The Lion King' in the domestic market. While 'Mufasa' leads overseas, its $122.2 million worldwide debut is very underwhelming. Meanwhile, 'Kraven' and 'War of the Rohirrim' collapsed 72% and 73%, respectively.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/pa090wakvn8e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad30e582d782417c82593228c0a7bf97e777c0f\n\nThere was a new box office king, and it wasn't Mufasa or any other lion.\n\nThat honor belonged to ***Sonic 3***, which managed to outgross ***Mufasa*** to top the box office. The latter still won the foreign box office, even if the numbers are way below the expectations. In limited release, A24's ***The Brutalist*** had one of the best per-theater averages of the year so far. While last week's newcomers, ***Kraven*** and ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** had poor drops after their anemic starts.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $139.7 million. That's up a massive 62% from last year, when ***Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom*** topped and flopped.\n\nDebuting in first place, Paramount's ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** earned $60.1 million in 3,761 theaters. That's below the $72 million debut from the previous film, but that's not really a cause for concern as of now; December titles are often known for decreasing openings but strong legs.\n\nWhile not a franchise best, this is still a very solid debut. As the previous film teased, the introduction of Shadow was key to the hype. Adding Keanu Reeves to the mix was also a strong choice to get the Internet going wild. It's a film where Paramount aggressively campaigned and got people talking. The fact that there were 3 ***Sonic*** films in the span of almost five years is impressive, especially when the third film has the strongest reviews so far. While it might sound disappointing that the film didn't outperform the second film, at least it has the December excuse. \n\nAccording to Paramount, 59% of the audience was male and 43% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which is the same score as the previous films. Despite its lower-than-expected opening, it's gonna have some legs through the holidays. For now, $200 million should happen. Paramount clearly believes in the franchise; they already announced development on a fourth film before the film even opened. \n\nHaving to settle for second place, Disney's ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** earned just $35.4 million in 4,100 theaters. That's down a massive 82% from the 2019 film, which broke so many records back then. Even if we have to accept that December lowers the opening weekend numbers, that's still a horrible drop.\n\nDisney clearly believed in the potential of the 2019 ***Lion King*** remake. After all, it earned $1.6 billion worldwide. But the thing is that the film's reputation is not the same as it was 5 years ago. The audience liked the film and ate it up, but like a lot of live-action remakes, the audience moved on afterwards. All while the criticism for the 2019 film just increased. \n\nBut still, how can it explain a 82% drop? Even if we have to ignore the fact that people moved on from the 2019 version, there's the fact that this is completely new story with new songs. There's no nostalgia to be milked here, and the prequel aspect is also a double-edged sword; we already know Mufasa and Scar will live and eventually become enemies. Audiences can simply skip the film and won't really miss anything, unless you're insanely passionate to learn questions like... how did Rafiki got his staff? Even with the presence of a fantastic filmmaker like Barry Jenkins, you can tell this was just a paycheck; it's sitting at a weak 57% on RT. So if you didn't care or forgot about the 2019 film, there are no reasons to check this out.\n\nAccording to Disney, 54% of the audience was female and 39% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a fine \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is lower than the previous film. Even if the film legs out to a 6x multiplier, that would still be just $212 million, which is like 60% down from the previous film. Needless to say, it's unlikely there will be a third ***Lion King*** film.\n\nUniversal's ***Wicked*** was on third place, easing just 38% and adding $14.1 million. That takes its domestic total to $384.5 million, and it should continue holding incredibly well through the holidays.\n\nAfter topping the box office for three weekends, ***Moana 2*** was hit by ***Sonic*** and ***Mufasa***. The film fell to fourth place, and it had another rough drop, officially losing to ***Wicked*** on the weekends. This time, it fell 50%, adding $13.2 million this weekend. While the film has had a huge opening weekend, the legs are leaving a lot to be desired. The film has made $359.1 million, and it has zero shot at hitting $450 million domestically. That's quite disappointing, signaling that the film was very front-loaded.\n\nAngel Studios also released ***Homestead*** this weekend. Opening in 1,886 theaters, it earned a solid $6 million. While critics lambasted the film, the audience gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore. It should hold well thanks to the holidays, but it would be a surprise if it came anything close to $30 million by the end of its run.\n\n***Gladiator II*** is still showing some legs, even if they arrived a little too late to make a difference. The film dropped 40%, adding $4.5 million this weekend. The film has made $154 million so far, and the holidays should get it to around $170 million.\n\nAfter its pathetic debut, ***Kraven the Hunter*** didn't save face on its second weekend. The film earned just $3 million, which marks a horrible 72% drop, almost on par with ***Morbius***. Through ten days, the film has made a poor $17.3 million so far, and with four films opening in wide release, it will continue falling. Even with the holidays, it'd be a surprise if it made much more than $25 million domestically.\n\nAmazon's ***Red One*** had its worst drop so far, falling 65% and earning only $1.4 million. With more theater drops on the way, it's now guaranteed to finish below $100 million, which is quite disappointing.\n\nSo ***Kraven*** had a horrible drop, yet ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** was ready to introduce itself. It made just $1.2 million this weekend, which is a horrible 73% drop and the worst drop in the franchise. The film has earned a meager $7.3 million, and it's gonna struggle to hit $10 million lifetime, which is just pathetic. Just a few minutes ago, it was announced that the film will hit digital at home on December 27, just 2 weeks of theatrical exclusivity. Ouch.\n\n***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** rounded up the Top 10, earning $780,000 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $38.4 million. It has a few more days to make money before completely free falling.\n\nA24's ***The Brutalist*** debuted in 4 theaters. Despite its commanding 215-minute runtime, the film earned $266,791, which translates to a very strong $66,698 per-theater average (third best of the year). With strong awards buzz on the way, the film will continue expanding in the coming weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nIn some consolation, ***Mufasa*** topped the foreign box office. Even though that's by default; ***Sonic*** didn't debut in any market, opting to start its international run on Christmas.\n\nWith that out of the way, ***Mufasa*** debuted with $87.2 million in the overseas markets, for a $122.2 million worldwide debut. That's far below the projected $180 million debut, and a far cry from the original. It had soft debuts across the world, with its best numbers in China ($7.8M), France ($7.7M), Mexico ($7.1M), the UK ($5.5M) and Germany ($5M). Even with the benefit of holidays, it's tough to see the film making much more than $600 million worldwide, more than $1 billion below the 2019 title. Which means it will break the record for the biggest sequel-to-original drop.\n\n***Moana 2*** added $32.8 million this weekend, as its worldwide total is nearing $800 million. The best markets so far are France ($46M), UK ($37.6M), Germany ($29M); Mexico ($26.2M) and Brazil ($24M). That billion is gonna take a few more weeks.\n\n***Wicked*** added $12.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $572 million. The best markets are the UK ($60.8M), Australia ($22.5M), Korea ($13.1M), Mexico ($9.6M) and Germany ($8M). \n\nIn some notable news, ***Gladiator II*** has finally crossed $400 million worldwide, with a $416.3 million run so far.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEK**\n\nWe'll have four films hitting wide release.\n\nThe first is Robert Eggers' new film ***Nosferatu***, a remake of the 1922 film. Eggers is coming off ***The Northman***, which was his highest grossing film. Even though it wasn't theatrically successful, it was reported that it broke even through ancilliaries, which is why this film exists. Pre-sales are very strong for its opening day, and with fantastic reviews so far, it looks like Eggers might have a new highest grossing film.\n\nAnother release is Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown***, which stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The film has earned very good reviews, but Chalamet has received acclaim so far, building strong awards buzz. Perhaps we're looking at another sleeper hit.\n\nA24 is also releasing ***Babygirl***, which stars Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. Once again, another title with decent reviews so far, and Kidman earning Oscar buzz for her performance.\n\nThe final title is Amazon's ***The Fire Inside***, which marks Rachel Morrison's directorial debut, written by Barry Jenkins. The film stars Ryan Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry, and follows the true story of American professional boxer Claressa \"T-Rex\" Shields as she trains for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Amazon's ***The Boys in the Boat*** performed quite well last year, so perhaps this could surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

I'm still bitter she said no to The Color Purple though I understand why, because she said she already lived through it. \n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome is generally seen as the weakest Mad Max movie of the series but I happen to love it, just not as much as Road Warrior and Furiosa. \n\nI liked the arc of Max ending up in Aunty Entity's territory and being forced to fight against another bad guy and becoming kind of a Guardian to a group of lost children who live under the hope of a desired, fantasy land. \n\nThe train sequence is incredible. Tina Turner is spectacular as Auntie Entity: strong, fearsome, bold. I wish we got to see Auntie fight Max in the movie, we rarely see her do much, but when she gets into action, you realize how powerful she is, like when she jumps from her bike into the moving train. \n\nMel Gibson was great as usual as Max. He's a bit more tolerant than usual. The kids didn't bother me because they weren't trying to be cute and cloying, they're more like the kids from the Lord of the Flies (without the turning homicidal part). Helen Buday is particularly adequate as Savannah Nix, the older kid who rebels against Max.",

In order to counter\u00a0the\u00a0Soviets, who are approaching there,\u00a0the\u00a0US Govt, arranges a\u00a0**SEAL**\u00a0team, which would use an experimental, underwater oil rig as a base for their operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltaqjolchz8e1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=388678361db5426bd6735f4bff52ee439adf9d9b\n\nOne of\u00a0the\u00a0team members is\u00a0**Dr.Lindsey Brigman( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio),**\u00a0who designed that underwater rig, while in typical Hollywood style, her ex husband\u00a0**Virgil Brigman aka Bud( Ed Harris)**, is now a blue collar oil rig worker on\u00a0the\u00a0same platform.\u00a0The\u00a0leader of\u00a0the\u00a0team\u00a0**Lt.Coffey( Michael Biehn)** is a grumpy paranoid soul.\n\nThe rig has a bunch of workers, that includes \u00a0**Catfish De Vries(Leo Burmester), Alan Hippy( Todd Graff), Lisa**\u00a0***\u201cOne Night\u201d***\u00a0**Standing(Kimberley Scott)**.\u00a0 As the team begins to search for the missing sub along with the rig workers, there is a whole lot that happens, including a nasty storm, that nearly ends up wrecking the underwater rig. And that is when the team has the encounter with the alien, that keeps changing shape. However Coffey, now decides to nuke the aliens, in the trench where he believes they come from.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgyi7d68kz8e1.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fa7ac22e012b9e95e25339a3154f2703531c88a\n\n\n\nThe movie has some of the best special effects ever, especially the alien encounter for the first time, and the morphing technique used.  Also Lindsey's near encounter with an alien.  Of course the last scene where the entire city rises from underwater,  is what you go to the theaters for, recall seeing it on big screen, and was absolutely stunning.\n\nThe scene where the rig gets flooded, is brilliantly shot, superb editing. As also the scene where Bud descends into the Abyss.\n\nThe human emotions part is the strong factor of this movie, especially the strained relationship between Bud and Lindsey, their ego clashes, and reunion is well shot. It helps that both Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are both good actors. Though would not rate this among one of Harris best performances, he still lends the much needed gravitas, while Ms.Mastrantonio is equally good as the feisty, yet vulnerable Lindsey.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd1kk7sfkz8e1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92acf5c02dc664b5dc73e0363280eb51101e29bb\n\nMichael Biehn, who had earlier appeared in Terminator and Aliens, is suitably nasty as Coffey, making him a strong antagonist, conveying the hate and paranoid nature really well.\n\nOf course being Cameron being Cameron, he does stretch that ending by a good 15-20 minutes, till you start looking at your watch. It's only the ending shot that makes up for the overlong climax.\n\nI personally would rate this among Cameron's best movies, liked it more than more Titanic or Avatar. Notwithstanding  a dragged out climax, it's worth a watch for it's brilliant special effects and some great performances by Ed Harris, Mastrantonio and Biehn.",

It has a message and that message is strong and meaningful, unlike a lot of movies these days. People around me were also crying and we all left the cinema sniffling. \n\nHighly recommend this movie. It is full of lessons about life and death and everything in between. Absolutely beautiful. \n",

It\u2019s weird in all the best ways, super ambitious, and just unapologetically doing its own thing. I get that it\u2019s not for everyone\u2014it\u2019s slow and kinda cryptic, but that\u2019s what makes it so good, IMO. It feels like an old-school myth come to life, and it\u2019s just dripping with atmosphere. Anyone else feel the same? Also, kind of a Christmas movie in a strange way.",
