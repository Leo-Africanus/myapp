There is crossover, but it's also significantly different than my plain old \"Top ten movies\" list.\n\nI think my list would be, in no particular order:\n\n1. Homeward Bound (DOGS)\n\n2. Angels in the Outfield (Best most heartfelt kids sports movie)\n\n3. Back to the Future (It will be hilarious to show them a movie about the far off future of 2015)\n\n4. Just blanket all the Disney movies from the 90s (I miss 2d)\n\n5.  Independence Day (Gotta teach them how to be patriotic and not go quietly into the night)\n\n6. Die hard (They need to grow some hair on their chest too, a little action is a must)\n\n7. Star wars, original trilogy (Yeah its basic, but its also important to me)\n\n8. Singing in the Rain (Every kid loves \"Make 'em laugh\", no exceptions)\n\n9. Galaxy quest (the best Star trek movie lol)\n\n10. Iron Giant (\"I go. You stay. No following.\" tell me you didnt just tear up right now)\n\nWhat about yours?",

I was hooked from start to finish, especially with how the plot took unexpected twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. The way the real Santa Claus stepped up in the story gave me chills, it was like watching a Christmas John Wick.\n\nI\u2019m here to appreciate a fun movie, not a film class analysis but I\u2019d give it a solid 7 because I loved Santa Claus in this movie! Sure, it\u2019s violent (the title says it all), but it was so good and it made me laugh, so I had to write about it here. If you still haven\u2019t watched it, go check it out.

I didn\u2019t watch trailers and incorrectly assumed Conclave was a horror movie, which would be my type of thing.  \n\nI was not prepared for what I watched.   \nThe best word I could come up with:       \n\nGRIPPING.      \n\nThe theatre was 1/3 full at best, but I swear that not a single person left to use the washroom or gets refreshments in the first hour of the film.    The characters, the process, the intrigue pulled you in to such an extent that  there wasn\u2019t a moment to quickly step out that you might find in other movies.    \n\nThe movie challenged social and religious conventions.   It managed to have you suspect virtually every major character of skullduggery at some point in the film.        \n\nThe church and its warts were on display, from treatment of women to racism, regionalism, and modernity.        \n\nIt was the weaving of so many individual stories, the unknowns of a dead man\u2019s thoughts and intentions, the political intrigue\u2026.. all together drawing you in like so many strands of spider silk making it impossible to look away.         \n\nSo there it is.

The \u201csilencio\u201d performance scene stands out to me. The emotions in this movie, the dream like states, the conspiratorial scenes; it all comes together in such a cohesive way. I\u2019m reminded of when they intro Betty, and she\u2019s overacting positivity to the degree of a 1940s American film, almost certainly deliberately. And then the cut to her grandparents smiling maniacally as they take a cab. David Lynch is almost like the Ween of movies, his films capture all genres. Like in Mulholland Drive, there\u2019s horror, drama, comedy, romance, suspense, mystery, and more. This film is an insane achievement for David Lynch in my opinion. ",

        "content": "I watched the first season of True Detective in the course of the last weeks and I was totally blown away, especially by the performance of McConaughey and also by how well written his character was. It made me want to re-watch Interstellar, since I remembered his acting to be really good in this one, as well. \n\nSo I finished watching the movie a few minutes ago and during watching it, it became clear to me that his character's personality as Rust Cohle in True Detective is the exact opposite of Joseph Cooper's one in Interstellar. While Cohle sees humanity as a flawed, cancerous anomaly of mother nature, which, in his oppinion, would do best by stopping reproducing at all, Cooper believes in the good traits of society so much, that he even risks never seeing his family again, to get the chance of finding a new home for the human race. Both find themselves in a cruel world, where the bad habits of humans have negative impacts on their lives and both share the destiny of having lost a loved one, yet they couldn't be more different in their beliefs and their motivation to endure.\n\nI really love both of McConaughey's performances on their own, but it's the thought of him mastering the challenge to impersonate two absolutely contradictory characters in the same year, both in a very authentic way, which leaves me in awe.\n\nMaybe this is and was quite obvious, back in 2014, and has already been discussed, but it came to me right now and I really wanted to share this :)",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nfollowing [the idea of another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fpkzac/favorite_movie_by_state_fin/), I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day since more than a month so far. Yesterday, it was Monaco's turn and I had a hunch that it would be difficult to find a movie that was really set (almost) entirely in that country. When it comes to movies where the plot takes place in more than one country, I really like [the formulation of my predecessor, who once wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e1yi2e/movies_by_state_hawaii/):\n\n&gt;If a movie is split between a few locations I\u2019m looking for where it\u2019s rooted.\n\nFor example, this would rule out *Grand Prix* in case of Monaco. But now my question is whether this should also disqualify the actual winner of the voting: Unfortunately, I've never seen ***To Catch a Thief***, but I thought that most of it was set in France. Even the (rough, I don't want to spoil myself completely) synopses I've read don't indicate that the movie would be largely set in Monaco. So once again I need your help here: Would you say, that the movie is really \"rooted\" in Monaco plot-wise? Thanks in advance - and [here is the link for the discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monaco/comments/1gyr6pc/favorite_movie_by_european_country_monaco_which/).\n\nAs long as the discussion is still ongoing, we will continue in alphabetical order to the next country with an M: **Montenegro**. And these are the rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: As the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix has not yet been announced, I will refrain from attaching an updated list of the films here and instead want to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) . make sure to give it a like!",

Now I am not a big fan of horror movies, but was curious when I noticed the rating for this movie to be PG.\n\nOut of interest, would thing movie still be a PG if it was released today? I guess the puppets would be replaced by CGI, but I know I won\u2019t show my kid this movie - even as is.\n\nWhat would you rate the Gremlin movies today?",

The answer probably went over my head but I\u2019m too dense to realize it \ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for all your replies.

Directed by the first and only time director who did cinematography for a ton of great comedies and Joker and Joker 2 (don\u2019t hold that against him). But the man has an eye for talent and it shows in this movie. Classic trope and montage filled comedy but executed to the highest degree. \n\nEd Helms and Owen Wilson play brothers who bounce off each other beautifully, the typical stuck up and loose and cool characters you\u2019d expect but it\u2019s quickly turned on its head through they\u2019re adventure to find there father and each situation and guest star is funnier than the last.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say more but give it a chance. I can\u2019t believe I never heard of this. It\u2019s charming and nostalgic and just plain hilarious. ",

It's becoming a Star Wars situation where future generations will have the choice of the watch order. For Star Wars it created an issue of knowing Palpatine is the bad guy in the prequels, knowing the lineage of the Skywalkers, knowing who will survive and who will likely die. What about Alien?\n\nIn the release order the Queen is quickly introduced while in the in-universe order it is very late. Ash being a synthetic is not only a surprise because he's a bad guy but also because we didn't know androids even existed, while on the other David is pretty much established as one from the start. It's fun to note that the first Xeno/human hybrid is in the fourth movie in both cases. What would be your suggestion for a newcomer? Why? What other surprise I didn't think of would a new viewer experience?\n\n----------\n\nThe movie release order:\n\n1) **Alien** (1979)\n\n* First appearance of classic Xenomorph\n\n* First appearance of classic facehugger\n\n* First appearance of eggs\n\n* First \"appearance\" of engineer (dead)\n\n* First appearance of synthetic\n\n2) **Aliens** (1986)\n\n* First appearance of Queen\n\n3) **Alien 3** (1992)\n\n* First appearance of Xenomorph variant (runner)\n\n4) **Alien Resurrection** (1997)\n\n* First appearance of Xeno/human hybrid (newborn)\n\n5) **Prometheus** (2012)\n\n* First appearance of black goo\n\n6) **Alien: Covenant** (2017)\n\n7) **Alien: Romulus** (2024)\n\n* First appearance of cocoon\n\n----------\n\nThe in-universe order:\n\n1) **Prometheus** (2093)\n\n* First appearance of Xenomorph variant (deacon)\n\n* First \"appearance\" of facehugger (trilobite)\n\n* First appearance of black goo\n\n* First appearance of engineer\n\n* First appearance of synthetic\n\n2) **Alien: Covenant** (2104)\n\n* First appearance of classic Xenomorph\n\n* First appearance of classic facehugger\n\n* First appearance of eggs\n\n3) **Alien** (2122)\n\n4) **Alien: Romulus** (2142)\n\n* First appearance of Xeno/human hybrid (offspring)\n\n* First appearance of cocoon\n\n5) **Aliens** (2179)\n\n* First appearance of Queen\n\n6) **Alien 3** (2179)\n\n7) **Alien Resurrection** (2381)\n\n----------\n\nNote: Alien vs Predator is ignored as it is a side-universe and contradicts established lore.",
