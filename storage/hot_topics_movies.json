Felt completely disconnected. Barely any mention or meaningful continuation of Pearl\u2019s story, and her presence in the movie was basically non-existent. Just a few brief appearances that didn\u2019t really do anything.\n\nI was expecting something deeper \u2014 like tying it all together, or at least acknowledging Pearl more. Instead it went in a totally different direction and didn\u2019t land for me at all. I kept waiting for it to feel like a proper sequel or conclusion to what X and Pearl built, but it never did.\n\nAnyone else feel like MaXXXine just didn\u2019t belong in the same trilogy?",

From where I am sitting it does a lot of harm to the source material and fails to uphold the legacy the film had. But my opinion isn't the only one so I often wondered what other people thought. I gave the film a shot a couple nights ago. Trying to see if it could match up to the original with Brandon Lee. \n\nMy answer is I don't think it does, but now that I am comparing it to other reboots/remakes. I am wondering if it might be the worst one made. Btw I adore the actors in this but bad scripts do nobody favors. Bill performed amazingly in It and Nosferatu.  So I am just putting this up as a discussion to see what everyone thinks.  ",

Super proud of it for the idea, it's done fully analog, shot on Kodak Gold, enlarged onto Fuji C-Print paper by Tricolor in Switzerland and then a friend of mine drew the titel with a silver pen onto the printed images.\n\nI like it because it represents the film quite well, it's set in the 80s, in a wooden shed where a scientist tries to build a time machine. Being in a cold, uncontrolled shed, it's hard to get perfect development of film, so the colors and exposure is a bit wanky, it really feels like a slightly rushed selfie.\n\nWe made 6 enlargments which we later on handed out to cast &amp; crew, which was pretty cool.\n\nThe film is now also finally on YouTube (You can find it by the title, by Faultea Films), after touring a couple Film Festivals and even winning two of them :) Not the easiest film to understand though.\n\nHappy for feedback!",

        "content": "basically the title. i have been wanting to watch\nNOPE for a while, so i decided to just do it. no prior knowledge, didn't look at anything before i watched it, just went in. i thought it was pretty good, probably an 8/10. after i finished watching it, though, i looked it up on google and imdb just to see that people really do not like it. some even hate it. why? i do not see the reason, and maybe i am mistaken, but i thought the movie was great. just curious on your guys's thoughts.",

I can never take that scene seriously ever, even though the tone is supposed to be super serious. ",

        "content": "This movie absolutely blew my mind.  I cannot even begin to describe how artfully crafted this multi-dimensional thriller is, it keeps you in suspense and guessing what is going on, and what is real in the most subtle ways.  \n\nI have watched it a few times now and somehow it continues to surprise me! I am curious about what the reddit movie loving audience thinks and if you have any recommendations based on this particular film. I would call it a mindbending thriller but with elements of neo noir. \n\nOne of the things I like best about Cure is that the mindbending elements are somehow understated in such a way that makes the film more realistic I think, they create an atmosphere of strangeness that makes you question what you have perceived.

        "content": "My wife and I are on vacation and needed a movie to unwind with after walking around all day, and she suggested Speed. I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid and there's a bunch of stuff I have zero memories of (the bus movie begins with an elevator shaft rescue scene??).\n\nMy favorite part of this movie is Dennis Hopper, though. This has got to be the most unintentionally funny villain in all cinema. The guy will not shut up; he constantly yells JACK (Keanu's character) and its in Hopper's very specific accent so it just all sounds hilarious. I don't think there is a single moment in the film where he has a neutral expression on his face.",

There was tension and chemistry between them and they felt like a real divorced couple who were fighting old lingering feelings between them. And there were more comedic moments between them where I felt like in the remake the parents were just kind of like \"Oh hi. Good to see you after all these years...wanna see my wine cellar because I think I'm falling in love with you again?\". ",
