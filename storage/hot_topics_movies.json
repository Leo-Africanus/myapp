I noticed that in the pre- and mid-credit scenes they teased more adventures for the characters, but as far as I know a sequel is not in the works for this movie based on a video game.\n\nThe same thing happened with The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) with Henry Cavill.  Further adventures were teased in the credits, but no sequel happened.\n\nI know there are multiple reasons why this happens.  The movie is a flop, or its stars movie on to bigger and better projects.  I'm just wondering what other movies teased sequels that just never happened.\n\nNOTE:  As many have mentioned, there is a sequel for Uncharted in the works that I somehow missed.  It sparked the initial question, which is still valid.",

        "content": "Audiences have come to know the original American Pie series as an example of teen comedy revivalism that relies on crude humor to do most of the heavy lifting. I don\u2019t really want to get into whether the humor or the manner of tackling certain subjects still holds up to this day. Personally I want to take this moment to highlight an ingredient which, in my humble opinion, is essential to the charm of the original series \u2013 I\u2019m going to ignore the spin-offs here \u2013 and that is its subtle, but effective wholesomeness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Deep down American Pie 1 &amp; 2 in particular are movies about growing up, overcoming, learning and moving forward. The common thread throughout all of this is the search for and the preserving of a human connection, whether it\u2019s a lifelong friendship or a family relationship. The characters, as immature as they may be, all stumble along the way but in the end find out that the world has other and better things in store for them than what they thought they were looking for in the beginning. It\u2019s almost as if these movies when all is said and done do want to convey a message: you\u2019re an ignorant kid who\u2019s going to mess up and growing up you will continue to mess up, but you\u2019ll learn and you\u2019ll always have your friends and your family to learn from and they will always learn along with you.\n\n\u00a0Adding to this is the fact that there seems to be a genuine chemistry between the cast members, which includes both the main as well as the side characters. To top it off the original movies serve up a nostalgic soundtrack that reminds me \u2013 and I do realize that I am showing my age here \u2013 of a time where the world at least seemed to be a much more hopeful and optimistic place.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Maybe the jokes didn\u2019t age well. Maybe the way these movies go about certain specific subjects didn\u2019t age well. Be that as it may, there\u2019s one thing to me that definitely does hold up. A quality that is missing from the vast majority of movies of that ilk which came out at the time: a nostalgic comforting heart.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0To the next step!\u00a0",

No crazy paradoxes or multiverse headaches. That alone makes it hit way harder than any other time travel movie.\n\nMost time travel movies make you wish you could go back and fix stuff.

        "title": "Movies that make you feel sorry for terrible people",
        "content": "I\u2019m referring to films that push the limits on what you would call a bad guy getting their comeuppance. We all like seeing it happen, but at what point are you just as bad as they are? The first movie in this category I want to talk about is Bully. It\u2019s based on a True story, in the late 90s some kids came to hate a friend of theirs so they brutally murdered him. The most bizarre aspect of the story is that 2 of the boys that participated had never met him before in their entire lives.    \n   In the movie, the murder victim is definitely a rapist and an abusive bully towards his only friend. In real life, he was possibly a rapist, certainly an abusive bully to his friend but the movie omits the fact that they both were (they would often mock a man with Down syndrome in their neighborhood and throw things at him). Feeling sorry for him is a challenge, but if you read his autopsy you just might. He was bludgeoned in the head with a baseball bat hard enough to fracture 2 vertebrae, received multiple stab wounds in the neck, abdomen, and chest, before they finally slit his throat. All of that plays out on screen pretty faithfully. The director of the film is a known creep I believe, but it\u2019s a solid crime flick imo. \n\nOne more movie I\u2019ll name is Hard Candy. It\u2019s a vigilante story. A teenage girl meets up with a grown man she spoke with in a chatroom and goes home with him, where she proceeds to drug and torture him. There\u2019s a \u201ccastration\u201d scene that had me thinking \u201cthis is probably what everyone wants, but\u2026it\u2019s just wrong\u201d The movies ending fell flat for me, but I\u2019d say give it a watch. Feel free to add movies that fit into this category.",

So I decided to post a (nonexhaustive) list of famous movies that share a name with another major release that is not as well known. This is actually a phenomenom I've thought about alot over the years. \n\n1. Running Scared- Classic 80's comedy starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines vs. 2006 Paul Walker action movie.\n\n2. Gladiator- Early 90s boxing movie starring a young Cuba Gooding Jr vs. Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning sword and sandal epic.\n\n3. Catch Me if You Can- 80s B-movie about high school drag racer* vs. Steve Speilberg movie with Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio.\n\n4. Bad Boys- One of Sean Penns first starring roles vs Will Smith/Martin Lawrence franchise starter.\n\n5. Project X- Matthew Broadrick and Helen Hunt in a movie about the Air Force experimenting on chimps vs. A house party goes WAY overboard.\n\n6. The Rookie- Clint Eastwood, Charlie Sheen, Raul Julia cop movie vs. Dennis Quad baseball biopic. \n\n7. Man of the House- Chevy Chase comedy with JTT vs Tommy Lee Jones comedy.\n\n8. Bad Company- Sexy spy thriller with Lawrence Fishbourne and Ellen Barkin vs. Chris Rock CIA comedy.\n\n9. Crash- Controversial James Spader movie about car crash fetiches vs Controversial Oscar-winner about racism. \n\n10. Hot Pursuit- 80s John Cusack comedy with Ben Stiller and his father Jerry as villains vs. Reese Witherspoon/Sonia Vergara comedy.\n\n\nI know there are other examples of this. Any other ones that standout.\n\n*Not a major release but a movie I really loved as a kid.\n \n\n",

        "content": "With brutal and blood films it is often a race to the bottom. If you make a low budget crappy movie, just put some controversial and grusom scenes in the movie, and a bit of nudity, and it will sell. It has worked for movies like \"A Serbian Film\", \"The Human Centipede\" and many more, but which movie are grusom and brutal, yet actually good movies?\n\nI absolutely love:\n\n* Eden Lake (2008)  \n  * A hard and bloody watch, but it is so good and feels real! This sadistic teen feels like a kid you have met in your own life!\n* Rambo 4 (2008)  \n  * Sylvester Stallones and my favorite Rambo movie! Bloody and brutal when naive missionaries attempt to bring Jesus to brutal warlords. A hard watch, beautiful cinematography, and satisfying ending!  \n* No Escape (2015)  \n  * Uncomfortably intense as a normal family attempts to escape a civil war. The movie features tons of merciless killing, and even a scene where an adult man attempts to physically force a young child to shoot her own father. It is uncomfortable, but it is just so tense and well executed.",

        "content": "Following on from my previous question about the saddest songs you know, I thought I'd ask a happier question.\n\nI have a good sense of humour and like a good laugh, so there are a few films that have made laugh hard, but the following really made me laugh to the point of tears or agony:\n- Home Alone 2, when Marv gets electrocuted. The first time I saw that scene when I was 11, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing and in agony. It still makes me laugh like an idiot even now;\n- Blazing Saddles, the infamous farting scene. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I watched that scene;\n- Scooby-Doo (the first live-actiom film), the part where Shaggy is farting and then lets loose a good one, unaware that Daphne is standing behind him;\n- Johnny English, when the title character shows the archbishop's bottom to the whole world;\n- Step Brothers, no part in particular as the whole film is just gleefully childish and outrageously funny;\n- Dumb and Dumber, the part where Harry has the worst case of the shits after Lloyd spikes his coffee with laxatives.\n\nFeel free to share the films that made you laugh the hardest.",

After being accosted by Danielle with a list of demands, the leader of the bandits says \"My lady, you many take with you whatever you can carry\"\n\nShe promptly goes over to the Prince, put him in a Fireman carry, curtsies to the bandits, and walks away, much to general amusement.\n\nInterestingly, this is directly lifted from [The Siege of Weinsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Weinsberg) aka \"The Loyal Wives of Weinsberg\". Once the inhabitants of Weinsberg surrendered, King Conrad III proclaimed that The wives and womenfolk found there may leave with whatever they could carry on their shoulders. When a Duke of his objected, the King said that it would not be fitting to change his royal word.\n\nI don't know the extent to which this will be read as a \"did you know, Viggo Mortensen broke his toe when he kicked that helmet?!\" kind of post. So I hope that some of you, at least, are learning of this for the first time.\n\nAlso, if you haven't watched  Ever After, you really really should. ",
