But rewatching as an adult, I realized Christof was actually telling the truth from his perspective. The real world Truman was escaping to in 1998 was already filled with reality TV, manufactured personas, and the early stages of our current parasocial nightmare.\n\nTruman wasn't escaping artifice for reality - he was just trading one stage for a bigger, more complex one where he'd have the illusion of control.\n\nThis adds such a haunting layer to that final bow and \"In case I don't see ya - good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\" It's not just a goodbye to his fictional world, but almost a greeting to ours.\n",

The movies, the cartoons, and the toys.\n\nBut as I got older I started realizing more and more that \u201cGhostbusters 2\u201d had a less than stellar reputation. That shocked me. I mean is it as good as the first? No. But it\u2019s still a damn good time. It\u2019s got a great plot device(negative charged slime), a scary bad guy(VIGO!), some fun set pieces(court room bust) but most all?\nYou get to spend time with these actors playing these characters. They have this wonderful chemistry together. \n\nThey have such great chemistry. I remember coming across the IMDb score for the 2nd Ghostbusters. Back then it was much lower than it is now. In the 5/10 range. What gives?\n\nI watched Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, fans of the first film, rip the sequel to shreds. \n\nI would read how critics and audiences thought it\u2019s a retread of the first film, it wasn\u2019t funny, didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhy are people still not believing in ghosts after the first film\u201d. That last one never made sense to me. In the entire film only like 3 people say they don\u2019t believe. One or which is an insane judge. Another a kid I mean\u2026it\u2019s 2025 and people still think we didn\u2019t go to the moon or that the earth is flat. So I don\u2019t think everyone would be accepting to the idea of ghosts and marshmallow men. \n\n\nSo what are some other examples of films you loved then found out they weren\u2019t as liked or respected as you imagined?",

She broke down crying and they ended up using another girl to dub Barsi's singing. \n\nThe movie itself is a moving and solid picture.

Because while some reasons people mentioned are legit, like tickers and snacks being more expensive, people displaying antisocial behavior and improper etiquette, and the floors being sticky and such, there are some reasons people have that are pretty dumb to me.\n\nLike people admitting that they go to the theaters less because they own a big TV set now, a sofa, and have the ability to pause the move whenever you want, which makes me ask, \"Why is this a reason to avoid theaters now, especially since you had such options being given to you for a long-ass time now (i.e. VCRs, cable, VOD, DVDs)?\". Like I don't go to a theater thinking the movie's forcing me to watch all the way through. It's okay to miss out on some things. If you're concerned though, then just go beforehand or don't drink as much, or just hold it if your bladder's strong enough lol. I just hate the idea of people saying that the theater experience is \"dated\" now, and will soon become as \"niche\" as arcades.\n\nI do miss the days when we could watch whenever we want and not think about what critics have to say about them and pay tickets and snacks for them at a very fair price. It just really sucks that the theater experience has to be reserved for \"event\" films like Nolan or Villeneuve's movies simply because of how costly it is now.",

They've somehow managed to bridge the gap between critical acclaim and cult following in a way that feels unique in today's fragmented media landscape.\n\nTheir formula seems deceptively simple: find distinctive directorial voices, give them creative freedom, market the films with striking visuals and minimal exposition, and let word-of-mouth do the rest. But the consistency is remarkable.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is how they've become a trusted brand for younger audiences who might otherwise be disengaged from non-franchise cinema. The way their films spread through TikTok and social media feels different from traditional film marketing.\n\nDo you think any other studio has matched their cultural impact in recent years? ",

        "content": "In recent weeks I have seen two different movies (Drop and Warfare) on my own. As much as I do like going to the movies with people to of course be able to react to things together, there is something I have really started to enjoy about going by myself. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like de-stressing after a long day where you just don\u2019t want to have to talk to anyone and can sit in a dark theater, enjoy a snack and watch the film. \n\nI\u2019m not even necessarily super introverted it\u2019s just become my thing, does anyone else enjoy this? \n\nAlso another part of it is if there is a movie you want to see that others don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think you should be stopped from watching it.

        "title": "We need to talk about kevin",
        "content": "So\u2026I finally decided to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin. After finishing the movie, I came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall. One question that keeps coming up is: Why didn\u2019t Kevin kill his mother?\n\nA lot of people interpret it as Kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reaction\u2014and while I agree with that interpretation to some extent, I have a different take I\u2019d like to share.\n\nI think Kevin didn\u2019t kill his mother because doing so would\u2019ve given his actions a clear motive. Let me explain.\n\nThere\u2019s a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those \u201ccrash CDs,\u201d and he replies: \u201cThere is no point. That\u2019s the point.\u201d That line really stuck with me. It shows that Kevin is fascinated by meaningless things\u2014things that have no purpose.\n\nWhich brings me to my theory: he killed his father, sister, and classmates because there was no reason to. His father was kind to him, his sister was just a child, and the classmates didn\u2019t really do anything to him. There was no personal vendetta. And in Kevin\u2019s twisted worldview at the time, that lack of meaning made it worth doing.\n\nBut killing his mother? That would have made sense. That would have had a clear motive:revenge, hatred, resentment. And that\u2019s exactly why he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nAt the end of the movie, when she asks him \u201cWhy?\u201d, he says, \u201cI used to think I knew. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d To me, that shows he\u2019s grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness, and now he\u2019s left with confusion and regret, or at least uncertainty.\n",

        "title": "Watched Bio-Dome (1996) on Earth Day\u2026 and the coincidences were weirdly spot-on",
        "content": "So I half-jokingly pulled Bio-Dome off the shelf tonight and said, \u201cLet\u2019s watch this, it\u2019s Earth Day,\u201d totally forgetting the movie actually takes place on Earth Day. Already kind of a funny coincidence.\n\nThen during the movie there\u2019s this fake newspaper headline that says \u201cPope Condemns Bio-Dome.\u201d We laughed at how random and over the top it was.\n\nBut then I remembered\u2026 the actual Pope just died yesterday. And not just any pope...Pope Francis, who was known for being a major advocate for the environment. He literally wrote an encyclical on climate change. So the Earth Day connection felt extra surreal.\n\nAnd to make it even weirder, there\u2019s a throwaway line in the movie about red food dye, and sure enough, earlier today there was an actual press conference about banning certain petroleum-based food dyes like Red 3 and Red 40.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously just coincidence, but it kind of felt like Bio-Dome accidentally synced up with the real world for Earth Day 2025. Has that ever happened to anyone else, where a totally random movie weirdly lines up with current events?",

Another one that I can't recommend to anyone, would have to be filth. I really loved how this movie takes you on a psychotic ride, and shows a man's decaying mental state perfectly. However like the book, it's a bit much for people. What are some other films you enjoyed that you cannot recommend to anyone? ",

        "content": "Today it's Jack Nicholson's birthday, he turns 88 years old, he's pound for pound one of the top four or five greatest American actors ever in acting history.\n\nAnd i may be wrong, but i think in hindsight, he may have the best and most successful filmography ever in cinema history, certainly my favorite. \n\nI mean, it's so diverse and eclectic, unlike DeNiro who, despite considering him the superior actor with higher highs and better and more masterpieces on his belt, he occasionally returns too frequently into the gangster genre.\n\nAnd still to this day he's the most Oscar nominated male actor in history in the acting categories, with twelve nominations.\n\nLook at his filmography:\n\nEasy Rider\n\nFive Easy Pieces\n\nCarnal Knowledge\n\nThe King Of Marvin Gardens \n\nThe Last Detail\n\nChinatown\n\nThe Passenger\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\n\nThe Shining\n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice\n\nReds\n\nTerms of Endearment\n\nPrizzi's Honor\n\nHeartburn\n\nIronweed\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick\n\nBatman\n\nHoffa\n\nA Few Good Men\n\nWolf\n\nAs Good As It Gets\n\nThe Pledge\n\nAbout Schmidt\n\nSomething's Gotta Give \n\nThe Departed\n\nIt may be controversial to say these days, but he has a claim to be the most successful actor ever.\n\nUnparalleled legend.",
