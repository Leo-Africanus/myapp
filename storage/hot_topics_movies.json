        "content": "Around Christmas time my mother was visiting my family and just casually we started talking upcoming movies. She then proceeded to get excited about the \"new\" twilight movie with all the original cast. She showed this trailer to my wife and myself and it was blatantly fake so we informed her. \nWith that context in mind of both my wife and me being able to spot it, my wife today sent me a trailer for \"The Conjuring: Last Rites\" and she was convinced it was real. There are tell tell signs like clips from previous movies, completely unrelated movies such as \"The Woman in the Yard\" and most egregiously, shots of the cast, alone, just kinda motionless or the camera panning slowly. \n\nMy main issue is the people posting these having no indication it's fake, or a concept trailer or anything, just very misleading. \n\nI don't necessarily have a problem with their existence, creative liberty and all that, and with AI it give people a chance to easily put ideas out there, however, is preface that fake trailers, regardless of intention, should give the watcher the knowledge, easily accessible, to know it is indeed not real.\n\nAm I alone on this?",

But rewatching as an adult, I realized Christof was actually telling the truth from his perspective. The real world Truman was escaping to in 1998 was already filled with reality TV, manufactured personas, and the early stages of our current parasocial nightmare.\n\nTruman wasn't escaping artifice for reality - he was just trading one stage for a bigger, more complex one where he'd have the illusion of control.\n\nThis adds such a haunting layer to that final bow and \"In case I don't see ya - good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\" It's not just a goodbye to his fictional world, but almost a greeting to ours.\n",

It exceeded my expectations massively, the mystery elements matched with the dream-like plot makes it one of the most original movies I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I feel like in the next decade or two it will be held in a much higher regard. \n\nWhat other poorly received movies were/are ahead of their time? ",

I asked what they were talking about, they said they saw a trailer for a live action Up starring Harrison Ford. I didn't remember ever hearing about it. I kept looking through websites and subreddits and I couldn't find anything about it online, turns out they went to the movies on April 1 and their theater played fake movie trailers as an April Fools joke. \n\nI was curious what else they played but that's the only one the could remember.",
