Joel Coen (the Coen Brothers) urged us to make this movie, and it will be in theaters May 9th after premiering at SXSW! It\u2019s my first feature, and I directed it when I was 21. Ask us anything!\n\nWe'll be back at 4 PM ET today (Thursday 5/8) to answer any questions.\n\nHere's our trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu8hLsgODo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRu8hLsgODo)\n\n  \nLogline:\n\nA seamstress gets tangled in her own thread after stealing a briefcase from a drug deal gone bad. In an escalating game of cat and mouse, her different choices lead to drastically different outcomes along the way.\n\nMore information:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sew\\_Torn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sew_Torn)\n\nThe SEW TORN feature film is based on a short film of the same name - which was actually my application to film school! I was incredibly lucky, because the short got passed around and ended up in the hands of Joel Coen (who is my hero - and a huge inspiration). After meeting him, Joel's number one advice was to turn the short into a feature, and to do it independently. The short ended up getting acquired by Searchlight Pictures, had a theatrical release alongside READY OR NOT, and was our proof of concept that helped finance the full length movie.\n\nYou can watch the short film here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ivBwzO1wn4&amp;ab\\_channel=SearchlightPictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ivBwzO1wn4&amp;ab_channel=SearchlightPictures)",

        "content": "Just watched *Grave of the Fireflies* for the first time. I went in knowing it had a reputation for being devastating, but even then, nothing could\u2019ve prepared me for how emotionally brutal it is. It\u2019s not just unrelentingly sad... it\u2019s an unflinching portrait of the horrors of war, not actually through battles or explosions, but through starvation, isolation, and the quiet, slow loss of innocence.\n\nWhat really hit me was how personal it all felt. This wasn\u2019t just a tragedy of circumstance, but it was also a tragedy of pride. Seita\u2019s decision to leave the relative safety of his aunt\u2019s home wasn\u2019t just impulsive; it was fatal. I understand he was a child trying to protect his sister and preserve their dignity, but in trying to shield her from cruelty, he ultimately exposed her to a much worse fate. His pride wasn\u2019t villainous, but it was misplaced, and it cost them everything.\n\nWatching Setsuko deteriorate, not just physically but emotionally, was agonizing. She never had a chance to truly understand what was happening. Her firefly funeral is one of the most haunting and bittersweet scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in animation. Her ashes... the scene was so beautiful yet completely gutting. It really drove home how war erases childhood, not just through violence, but through neglect and abandonment.\n\nThis film doesn't try to make a statement so much as show you the raw, human cost of war. It\u2019s not cathartic. It doesn\u2019t offer hope or redemption. It just leaves you with silence, and maybe that\u2019s the point. Because some losses don\u2019t have meaning. They\u2019re just gone.\n\nIf anyone ever tells you animation can\u2019t be serious art, show them *Grave of the Fireflies*. It broke me and I think that\u2019s exactly what it was meant to do.",

        "content": "I think it was Land Before Time or the Star Wars series, it opened up my eyes to a whole spectrum of space / sci-fi movie genre and eventual fantastical movies! Truly enjoyed with grandparents and siblings, and it was also a good time from childhood that you can go back to, mark of the time then. Plus, watching a movie in the cinema has vibes very different from being on a small screen like the handy devices we have now.\n\nWhat\u2019s your core memory of your first movie in the cinema? ",

        "content": "I have been going through my movie lists. I am a fan of depressing and melancholic movies. Manchester by the Sea is one of my top 3 movies ever. As dark as moat of the movies ive seen, Requiem for a Dream is completely unsettling. It is meant to be. The score is incredible. The use of sounds to create unnerving feelings is powerful. The split screen and use of disturbing images really sets the tone for the absolute nightmare of addiction.\n\nThe movie feels like a made for after school documentary but just keeps descending into a pit of hell.\n\nThe mother character made me feel sorry as a son and decent human for an elderly woman. Fearful of how I would be vulnerable as I got older.\n\nLetos absolutely depraved character shows what a selfish and self destructive person will do to get to where they think they want to be. At any means necessary.\n\nConnellys character made me hyper aware of women in compromising relationships and the absolutely disgusting behavior of people who wish to exploit it.\n\nWayans character shows what a man with some promise and a dream can be horrifically compromised. \n\nThis is a film that should be required viewing for high schoolers to show the horrors of addiction. Addictions to everything. Drugs, alcohol, sex, TV, Weightloss, food, public opinion, peer pressure, self esteem, sex work... ",
