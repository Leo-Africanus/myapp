It basically begins with an all out assault on the autobots and crazy levels of violence and destruction it's like an animated version of the storming of the beach of Normandy from Saving Private Ryan, kids all over the United States were stunned as they watched their favorite characters autobots and decepticons alike are gunned down violently and we watch Optimus Prime himself mow down several decepticon's himself in truck form and the action never really lets up to much.  There hasn't been a Transformers movie that was as awesome as this one is.  ",

Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. \n\n1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren\u2019t even IN other movies. \n\n2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. \n\n3: If your movie isn\u2019t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. \n\nCouple of facts: \n\nFirst movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube\n\nLast movie: Planes trains and automobiles. \n\nBest movie: American Fiction \n\nWorst Movie: The Creeps.  \n\nMovies I watched that I had seen before: 16\n\nMost movies watched in a single day: 5\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a long year and I\u2019ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. \n\nEdit: sexually lol \n\nAs requested Top 10: \n\n1: American Fiction\n\n2: biosphere \n\n3: They Cloned Tyrone \n\n4: 1917\n\n5: Maxxxine \n\n6: the Blackening\n\n7: the vast of night \n\n8: The green knight \n\n9: bottoms \n\n10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)",

Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse\u2019s story. \n\nThe Simpson\u2019s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn\u2019t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it. I also much preferred the animation style it had than what the series turned into a couple years later. ",

In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria\n\n1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified\n2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)\n\nIf we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy\n\nEdit: Link updated so everyone can view my apologies\n\nEdit 2: [https://letterboxd.com/OgarTheDed/](https://letterboxd.com/OgarTheDed/) Adding my Letterboxed so people can track my progress and I will be creating a weekly/ bi-weekly update post (IMPORTANT: there will be very little if any progress until after December 16th due to IRL schedule freeing up then)",

        "content": "Naturally, this is going to get a lot of different answers, but for me, it has to be Jennifer Connelly in *Career Opportunities*. There's just something mesmerizing about her presence in that movie\u2014the confidence, charm, and that unforgettable scene in the department store\u2014it was absolutely captivating to a younger version of me. Then there\u2019s young Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, who exuded such elegance and beauty that it felt almost otherworldly. Those characters and performances left a lasting impression on me and probably defined my early movie crushes. What about you?",

I know people have different opinions but that was so frustrating.",

        "content": "So I was looking at [this list of movies ordered by most box office admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_by_box_office_admissions) and I noticed all the top ones are Chinese. At first I figured \"big population, makes sense\" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?\n\nI tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.\n\nI also noticed a surprising lack of Indian movies, given the reputation of Bollywood and size of India. If population were the sole reason, I would figure India would also take several of the top spots on that list.",

Although as with most comedies, the story isn't too realistic, I still think it says a lot about the importance of family ties vs. more superficial things, like your job and your personal image. It also says that although most families go through lots of personal drama, they're still perhaps the most important thing in our lives, as well as good friends, and it's important to always remember this, especially during the holidays.",
