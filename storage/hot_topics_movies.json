There\u2019s the seedy motels. The downtown courthouse. The posh private school. The jalousie windows. The incessant cricketing of crickets. The music does a good deal of the heavy lifting. That base line alone is both tongue in cheek and moody. Just like the movie. The script is full of twists and turns. None need to make sense when you\u2019re having this much fun. The cast is more than game. If Bill Murray graces your set you must be doing something right. You also get a vintage Denise Richards on full display. I saw this in the theater and couldn\u2019t believe these mainstream actors were going all out exploitation on us. Find this flick and make it your next movie night. You may have to shower after this one\u2026. Enjoy!",

        "content": "Usually, winning an Oscar is seen as a huge boost for ones career and that actor/director/whatever tends to have an easier time finding good movies to work on. However, presumably if someone continues to have box office fail after box office fail afterwards, they would start to lose that success and slowly stop appearing in big movies. Who are some people like this? It doesn't have to be an actor or actress, it can be a writer, cinematographer, etc. I'm curious on what the outlier cases look like.",

When a new friend needs his help, Li enters a karate competition -- but his skills alone aren't enough. With help from Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso, he soon learns to merge two styles into one for the ultimate martial arts showdown.*\n\nCast: Jackie Chan, Ben Wang, Ralph Macchio\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [55%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/karate_kid_legends/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [55/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/karate-kid-legends/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/karate-kid-legends-review-jackie-chan-1236410862/)\n\n&gt;The original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d film remains the best one, because the novelty of subjecting Macchio\u2019s Daniel LaRusso to the \u201cWax on, wax off\u201d Buddhist training of Mr. Miyagi has never been duplicated. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is likable retro corn, but by the end you may just think: Ain\u2019t that a kick in the head.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/karate-kid-legends-review-1236230996/)\n\n&gt;True to its title, *Karate Kid: Legends* dutifully pays homage to its predecessors, even starting off with a clip from 1986\u2019s *The Karate Kid Part II* featuring a young Macchio and Pat Morita. There are numerous callbacks to past installments, and the end credits feature a cameo by one more franchise veteran. At one point, Daniel comments of his late mentor, \u201cEvery time I have a chance to pass on a piece of his legacy, it\u2019s never the wrong choice.\u201d The studio executives who greenlit this project would certainly agree.\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/karate-kid-legends-review-jackie-chan-ralph-macchio-ben-wang/)\n\n&gt;\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d feels like two movies set against each other. One is standard issue \u201cKarate Kid\u201d fare that would have done fine as its own story, and the other is leaning hard on nostalgia despite not giving Mr. Han or Daniel anything to do other than train Li. It still manages to arrive at a fairly charming albeit unsteady picture that should win over a new generation of younger viewers. But for older members of the audience, the second half of \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d feels like an insecure fighter changing his approach halfway through a match.",
