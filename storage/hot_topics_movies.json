        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "I recently rewatched The Darjeeling Limited &amp; The Royal Tenenbaums. I was struck by the perfect use of slow-mo in these movies. Not over-used, underlined the emotions of the scenes, and paired with the perfect song. Zach Snyder comes to mind, I know he can be heavy handed with it, but still I loved 300 when I was younger and I think Watchmen had some good examples. Is there a movie or scene that you think has the perfect use of slow-mo?",

Excellent acting as well as a thrilling plot, and I like how it ends with his victory on the side of the truth, i.e., the New York Times, which was a reliable source of information back in the 70s before the age of widespread misinformation we now live in, against the CIA and their evil plots! I just wish things hadn't turned around since then!",

How did you respond to it ?",

I just randomly decided to watch it and wow, what an emotionally powerful movie. The kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it far after the credits roll. It leaves a pit in your stomach. I guess as a kid the emotional nuances of great movies don\u2019t really grab hold of you. I feel like I watched it for the first time. Now I\u2019m depressed. \ud83e\udee0",
