Non-stop action from the first scene to the last, brilliant directing, amazing bro-mance between Keanu and Jeff Daniels, a super crazy, but not stupid, bad guy in Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock, who is a total bad-ass. The supporting cast was top-notch too. Keanu's acting was also amazing I thought. I hate it when people say his acting is so one-dimensionall. It may be a little one-dimensional nowadays, but that wasn't always the case. I will always love this movie, as it is the epitome of 90's action films.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqh2jqoq3o7g1.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a83a4d48fa5e72b7bf43b53b16d4eaf367489c\n\n",

        "title": "'Avatar: Fire and Ash' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*The conflict on Pandora escalates as Jake and Neytiri's family encounter a new, aggressive Na'vi tribe.*\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nCast: Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Michelle Yeoh, Oona Chaplin, David Thewlis, Jack Champion\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [70%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash)\n\n**Metacritic:** [61 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/avatar-fire-and-ash/)\n\nSome Reviews (updating):\n\n[nssmagazine - Martina Barone](https://www.nssmag.com/en/lifestyle/43723/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-review)\n\n&gt;The repetitiveness to which Avatar - Fire and Ash subjects us cannot be condoned, especially when it chooses to keep spectators seated in front of the big screen for three hours and twenty minutes. The only novelty that adds real surprise in Avatar 3 is the lethal leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin. Head of the Ash People, the warrior is ravenous, brutal, and fiercely unforgiving. With *Avatar 4* scheduled for 2029 and *Avatar 5* for 2031, not only does the third title re-propose visual and entertainment solutions already tested and therefore not unprecedented, but one wonders **what else there would be to say** given the **emotional and spectacular weight** of *Avatar - Fire and Ash*. What else is there to tell that hasn't been told yet, especially considering the film seems like a repetition? What is there to see that hasn't been shown yet?\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron-1236605109/)\n\n&gt;The Story Is Fine, the Action Awesome, as the Third \u2018Avatar\u2019 Film Does New Variations on a No-Longer-New Vision. It's better then the second film \u2014\u00a0bolder and tighter \u2014 and still has its share of amazements. But it no longer feels visually unprecedented.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron-sam-worthington-1236450205/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s easily the most repetitious entry in the big-screen series, with a been-there, bought-the-T-shirt fatigue that\u2019s hard to ignore.\"\n\n[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/avatar-fire-and-ash/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Another visually-stunning spectacle with a rock-solid story that makes the most of its epic length and big budget to deepen its universe. The cast rises to the occasion, especially Oona Chaplin as the villainous Varang.\u00a0While it still works, the plot echoes both prior films in the series so closely that it borders on self-plagiarization.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Keith Uhlich](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;Cameron has never been especially good at writing characters beyond the broadest of strokes, which isn\u2019t much of a detriment when, as in *Aliens* and the two *Terminator* films, the narrative stakes are high and the technological innovations augment rather than overwhelm the comic-book fervor of his vision. The *Avatar* movies, by contrast, are empty vessels of pro-forma spectacle that, true to the very disposable era of entertainment in which we\u2019re living, make bank primarily because of how quickly they can be memory-holed.\n\n[Consequence - Liz Shannon Miller](https://consequence.net/2025/12/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;Yes, the execution defies subtlety, but subtlety has never been a defining aspect of this franchise. Everything is always loud, from the music to the visual design to the emotions. It\u2019s an approach ensuring that Cameron\u2019s message will be heard by even the most distracted viewer. Cameron has ended the world twice over with *The Terminator* movies, depicted the true-life tragedy of the Titanic, and explored the terrors of marriage and motherhood with *True Lies* and *Aliens*. Yet by comparison, *Fire and Ash* finds him unafraid to dig around in the darkest corners of the human soul. That Cameron wants to push into heavier themes at this point in his career speaks well of his ambition as a storyteller, and generates some real excitement for what might come next. Though, considering the budget of these movies\u2026 therapy might be cheaper.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/)\n\n&gt;The only way \u2018Avatar: Fire and Ash\u2019 could be more hypocritical, and taken less seriously, is if the characters also yelled \u201cHypocrisy sucks!\u201d while sitting on Whoopee cushions.\n\n[Los Angeles Times - Amy Nicholson](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-12-16/avatar-fire-ash-review-sam-worthington-zoe-saldana-sigourney-weaver-stephen-lang-james-cameron)\n\n&gt;'Avatar: Fire and Ash\u2019 has dynamite villains and dialogue that\u2019s surf-bro hysterical. But plot-wise, the story is the same as ever. So instead of getting swept away by the narrative, I just settled in to enjoy the details: hammerhead sharks twisted into pickaxes, ships that scuttle like crabs, the drama of an underwater scream",

        "title": "Scorsese\u2019s awareness that De Niro is not really Italian is charming",
        "content": "Robert De Niro is, of course, a legendary American actor who\u2019s played a large variety of roles across many decades in the film business.\n\nWhile De Niro has played everything from a Spanish missionary to a WASPy CIA agent, he is often associated with Italian-American characters in movies like The Godfather Part II, The Untouchables, and the Analyze This series. There is a popular image of him as one of the prototypical Italian gangster types of U.S. cinema.\n\nDe Niro has a recognizably Italian name, which adds to this perception. But he is only a quarter Italian-American. Most of his family comes from Northern European countries including Ireland, England, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s famous collaborator Martin Scorsese seems keenly aware of this and has made a point of casting De Niro in roles where his lack of full Italian heritage is built into the plot. In each of Goodfellas, Casino, and The Irishman, De Niro\u2019s character is a notably non-Italian person navigating the Italian mafia environment while surrounded by Italian-Americans who don\u2019t recognize him as one of their own.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m exaggerating this a little bit? Scorsese did cast De Niro as Italians in his early film Mean Streets (alongside fellow non-Italian Harvey Keitel) and in biopic Raging Bull, playing the boxer Jake LaMotta.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something I just enjoy about the idea that the someone as extremely knowledgeable about human culture and Italian culture in particular as Scorsese - fully Sicilian, once married to Roberto Rossellini\u2018s daughter, director of a film called Italianamerican - looks at De Niro, commonly stereotyped as a quintessential Italian, and recognizes that he is not that.\n\nScorsese has also cast De Niro in various Anglo, Irish and ethnically miscellaneous roles over the decades. Meanwhile he has never cast Joe Pesci in a role that is not specifically Italian-American.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, who like De Niro is only a quarter Italian-American but with a recognizably Italian name, has never played an Italian character in a Scorsese movie.",

It is rated PG, and if you scroll through Bronson's filmography, you'll find that a lot of his pre-Death Wish (and its sequels) movies were actually PG, not R.  This move, Mr. Majestyk, Hard Times - there is a pretty extensive list of PG Bronsons. \n\n In The Mechanic, I do wonder why he took such time, trouble, and expense on the opening \"contract\" that we see.  Perhaps he had a good reason not to simply shoot the guy, but he did do an awful lot of collateral damage in killing his target.  He practically blew up the entire floor of an apartment building, and you have to figure it is likely there were a few other deaths involved.",
