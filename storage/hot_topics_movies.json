It\u2019s my biggest movie pet peeve and instantly ruins the experience for me. Is there a name for this trope?\n\nEdit: I personally think this does not fall under deus ex machina because it\u2019s still somewhat realistic to use an improvised weapon in a fight but it\u2019s definitely similiar to deus ex machina and feels like lazy writing to me\n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s apparently called \u201dWithin arm\u2019s reach\u201d but I like the term \u201dconvenient cudgel\u201d invented by the comments better :)",

The homey vibes and heartwarming feel definitely struck a chord with me, but overall I just thought it was extremely well directed and acted throughout. \n\nPaul Giamatti is also not an actor that I\u2019m familiar with, but his work was incredible here. Amazing character. Domniac Sesso turns in a great performance too for it being his first feature film. Super impressive. Da'Vine Joy Randolph definitely deserved that Oscar nom too. \n\nSuch a Christmas classic in my book. Absolutely loved every second of it.",

One of the funniest, most quotable comedies I\u2019ve ever seen, and I thought making a sequel was even stupider, but they managed to outdo themselves.
