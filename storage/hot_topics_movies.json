I realized that Bernard (Beanie) had the best life out of all his friends, despite his complaining and the frat being his idea. I mean - married with kids, owns his own home, has a string of successful businesses, is still in touch with his college buddies, all while being a pretty hands-on dad. Most people my age would kill for that kind of life as it is seeming more and more unattainable with each passing year. The things we took for granted in 2003...sigh. Meanwhile, Mitch and Frank are still relatable - unlucky in love and dissatisfied with adulthood.\n\nAny movies that come to mind that give you this kind of pause?",

That fascinates me. Also, that's art! It isn't supposed to comfort you.\n\nBeau is Afraid is a masterpiece (Also, Eddington is so relevant and if you liked No Country, check it out in context of modern politics and that we no longer have a shared reality).\n\nBut Beau makes people with panic attacks feel \"seen\". It's an unreal Odyssey. Also one of my favorite films ever.\n\nSo, apparently I like that chaos and tension. I think it's also why I like horror: it's a way to parse my own anxiety, channel it, and realize that life could always be worse. LOL\n\nWhat other films feel like a panic attack, or pure anxiety, or that you might have a heart attack from the tension?",

        "content": "Edward Jessup (William Hurt) is a scientist and psychology professor who decides to combine his experiments in sensory deprivation tanks with powerful hallucinogenic drugs, convinced that it may help him unlock different states of consciousness. The experiments are a success at first, but as Jessup continues his work, he begins to experience altered mental and also physical states. As he spends more time in sensory deprivation, his grip on reality begins to slip away. I loved this movie, for a film in 1980 it was WAY ahead of it\u2019s time. The film is really good, intense, weird and trippy. William Hurt did a good job portraying Eddie a very likable interesting character who has these states of consciousness and wants to fight them off. Very good practical effects when he becomes a caveman and good makeup that was done. His character Eddie and his wife Emily (Blair Brown) have some good chemistry with each other. Bob Balaban who plays Arthur researches Eddie and monitors him while he is in these tanks. If you haven\u2019t seen the film it\u2019s a good interesting watch.",

        "content": "The \"Wilhem scream\" was first used in the 1951 movie Distand Drums. It was then used as an inside joke by Ben Burtt the movie sound designer on the first Star Wars film in 1977. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/mpE0XxBCtOc?si=gS9gNklxTQjw1vPp\n\nI remember hearing it in a large amount of movies all throughout my life. It always used to make me sort of chuckle to myself and say \"Oh wow they used that crazy scream again.\" I even had to explain to my GF what the scream was and show her some examples. Now almost every movie we watch that has the scream in it we willl look at each other and just smirk and roll our eyes at the moment. \n\nWhat makes me bring it up today though is I was watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and they used the scream THREE times in the movie. I am not saying it ruined the movie for me in any way (The Hobbit movies are kinda meh imo) but it really just pulls me out of any movie I hear it in. I know is is a joke used by sound designers as it is just an over the top ridiculous scream. I just wish it was not used as frequently. ",
