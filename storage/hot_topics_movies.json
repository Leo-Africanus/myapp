The way the characters ended up... it was so overwhelming emotionally. This movie truely is a masterpiece and recommended for those who need to know about the dangers of drugs. Still, it left me a impact on my brain and since then, I never really wanna touch drugs ever again.\n\n This movie deserves it reviews and attention.",

        "content": "*When all but one child from the same classroom mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weapons/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/weapons/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Inverse](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2998) \\- [Lyvie Scott](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/lyvie-scott)\n\n&gt;Cregger\u2019s goofy sense of humor aside, *Weapons* is otherwise pretty understated, even refined. His camera moves with glacial, dream-like focus, tracking characters from behind or panning to unveil the latest torment around the corner. That visual style has become a trademark of \u201celevated\u201d horror, but it goes a long way in anchoring a story that could have turned unwieldy fast. Cregger\u2019s chapter-by-chapter story serves that same purpose: It has the capacity to frustrate when it cuts away from a major reveal, only to reset with the backstory of a new character. But it also adjusts the aperture whenever things get too heavy \u2014 a breath of fresh air in a different form.\n\n[CGMagazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3897) \\- [Shakyl Lambert](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/shakyl-lambert) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;*Weapons* is a noticeable step up for Cregger as a filmmaker. It feels like he took what worked in *Barbarian* and tightened up the things that didn\u2019t. It\u2019s bigger in scope but more focused. With a strong story and cast, it\u2019s the most fun you\u2019ll have being scared all summer.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/weapons/)\n\n&gt;There are some who will be moved and struck by \u201cWeapons,\u201d intentionally or unintentionally, so. For 75% of its runtime, it was one of my favorite films of the year. However, for the final 25%, in some ways, it feels like Cregger missed an opportunity to tell a story that is more emotionally rich and relatable. Here is a filmmaker who feels like he\u2019s trying to prove he\u2019s capable of more, but without fully grounding that ambition in character or clarity, instead opting for a facile solution. There\u2019s a version of this movie that could have been genuinely great. You can appreciate the potential in the performances, the themes, and the overall craftsmanship. And to be clear, I\u2019m sure this will resonate and work for some viewers. But for me, much like \u201cBarbarian,\u201d Cregger doesn\u2019t quite bring it all together, making \u201cWeapons\u201d a rare kind of disappointment.",

        "title": "Fight me: Dante's Peak is better than Volcano",
        "content": "Just watched Volcano and Dante's Peak for nostalgia and out of sheer boredom. And I came to the conclusion that Dante's Peak is WAY better than Volcano. The reviews are absolutely baffling to me, since Dante's Peak is sitting around 30% on Rotten Tomatoes, with Volcano setting around 50%. I don't understand how such a classic could receive 30%. Sure, it was kinda cheesy, but come on, its a fucking 90's movie.\n\nAnyway here are my points.\n\nFirst of all, its entire plot is unfeasible. With the plate boundary in LA being a strike-slip, there is physically no way a volcano could form in LA. Dante's Peak is set in Washington State, where a dormant volcano slowly wakes up, and shows minor warning signs such as dead trees and squirrels, and boiling and acidic water. Those can actually happen, and have been observed at real volcanoes. Volcano does not show any signs other than an earthquake (In LA, where earthquakes happen at such times as *every single day*) and 7 people burning. No dead trees, no dead wildlife, no CO2 emissions, no steam, and no ground deformation.\n\nBad VFX and CGI, with an example being a scene where there's 3 flames, all of which are different colors. Looks like it was downloaded from Shutterstock without applying a color correction. And some of the lava looks more like glowing orange and red slime mixed with Oreos, not lava.\n\nThe score is bland, sounds like it was made for a mid-budget TV show, not a movie that costs $90 million. It was even composed by Alan Silvestri, and still turned out bland, with no feeling to it.\n\nAnd some points are just plain awful. One instance when the leads are dangling over lava on a firetruck ladder. It had such a convoluted setup for no reason other than a good CG shot. Another example being Gaby Hoffmann's character cowering under a falling building, only for TLJ to run and push her 3 whole feet out of the way. It's so stupid that I actually laughed at it.\n\nFinally, the lava and volcano itself. I'll give Volcano some credit, it had more realistic lava flows than Dante's Peak, which was slow moving, however, people *do not sink into lava,* let alone lava that is not even a foot deep. And the lava diversion wasn't the smartest. Instead of immediately spraying water onto the front of the lava flow, they wait for it to *pile up* with concrete barriers, before spraying water **not** at the front, but the middle.\n\nAnd the only volcano we see in the movie is at the ending shot. Like, seriously? THE END? Dante's Peak revolves around an over 10,000 ft (don't quote me on that, just a guess based on average height of volcanoes in Washington) volcano that erupts in a manner typical of a Cascade volcano, with steam eruptions, lahars, and minor explosions, as well as a major eruption and a pyroclastic flow that incinerates the nearby area.\n\nDante's Peak has its flaws, but that's because A. Its a movie, and B. Its a movie from the fucking 1990's. Anyway, I would like to see your thoughts on this.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, Dante's Peak music score is absolutely amazing, with James Newton Howard writing the theme, with John Frizzel writing the rest. The whole movie has chilling, and uplifting scores, which helps portray the terror that volcanoes can unleash, and those who are just happy that they survive.\n\nAlso Edit: I also forgot to talk about Dante's Peak's effects. It relied almost entirely on miniatures and practical effects. For example, the freeway that collapsed was a combo shot of a real freeway ramp being blown up, and miniatures. Another is the Volcano, which was a real miniature, and then matted in above the town. The volcano was also actually loaded with ash, and then blown up at Van Nuys airport in California to capture the final eruption and pyroclastic flow. The Lava was CG done by Digital Domain. And the entire town was actually changed up slightly to feel more alive. Certain buildings had the town's name on them, all the shops had fake storefronts installed in them, the motel was built on an existing building, trees were added, and the whole town was covered in ash for a few sequences.\n\nEdit 2: Holy shit didn't expect to get so many comments and answers in so little time. Glad to know its not an isolated sector of society that agrees with me and those replying.",

        "content": "Has anyone noticed lately on certain platforms with various films they are cutting small scenes that aren't hugely important but like you know existed in a previous copy etc? \nExample, I just watched what's eating gilbert grape on YouTube and I clearly remember a scene of gilbert and Tucker in the basement adding the supports for the floor. They cut that and only showed his sister before inspecting and then unloading the 2x6 boards. \nNow I am sure it's because in that original scene they show a hook where the dad hung himself and self harm is a iffy subject. But I feel although a small scene it adds to the weight gilbert feels throughout the film.  Or am I crazy and that never existed lol. ",

Brilliant comedy with some of the greatest musicians of the time, including Aretha Franklin and James Brown, not to mention the Blues Brothers themselves, who were also pretty great! I'm amazed by the live action as well, especially the car chase scene through the shopping mall! (I don't know how that managed not to injure anyone!) John Belushi was irreplaceable, and he will definitely be missed! ",
