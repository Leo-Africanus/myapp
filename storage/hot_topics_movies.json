        "content": "Been watching all the terminator movies recently, and t3 is not what I would call a strong entry. It's a very safe and corporate version of T2, that is until the very last 5 minutes. Judgement day happens as it's revealed that skynet has become an omnipresent piece of software incapable of being simply turned off. The characters pretty much lose everything except their lives, though there is the promise of eventual victory based on this alone. It's such a tragic yet hopeful ending, shot well, scored well, even the monologue from the film's lackluster John Connor is pretty decent. It's sad that the franchise really never got better than these 5 minutes in over 20 years and 3 movies (I like salvation but man is it kind of a fucking dumb movie lol).",

Herzog described Kinski as a very talented scumbag, who he still worked with on multiple films because they figured eachother were the best people for the project\n\nDid Kinski ever get punished for some of the stuff he did? It\u2019s pretty awful. On their first movie, he randomly hit the extras with his sword while they were getting food so hard that they would\u2019ve been killed if they weren\u2019t wearing helmets. Also he got upset when a bunch of them were playing cards, so he took a gun and fired into their hut, leading to another extra having his finger blown off\n\nThen Herzog worked with him again, which seems pretty unsafe for the crew. On their Nosferatu movie, he apparently assaulted the female makeup artists so much that they refused to work again with Herzog until Kinski apologized\n\nPeople know what a menace Kinski was, but I feel like Herzog deserves a little more criticism for constantly endangering the people around him with this whiny little psycho",

He was to the point - stated facts, and stated consequences for those that did not comply - no vagueness or game playing. I thought this was really interesting and I wish the politicians over the past 30 years or so actually did this. I am not sure things would actually turn out as presented in this movie nowadays if you actually talked to people with facts like they did in the movie - \"example - there were only a couple hundred people trying to break into the underground bunker in this movie but if this comet was actually going to hit the earth I think it would be thousands and thousands more.",

At the beginning of Interstellar they show the testimonies of older people on tv talking about what it was like on earth before they had to leave. \n\nOne of them is old Murphy. And not only that, the subtitles say it\u2019s her. I just wonder what the thought of this is here. I never realized it was her till like the third viewing, and then recently with the subtitles on it just flat out says it\u2019s her. Is this an accident or on purpose? Like, if you had never seen the movie and watched it with subtitles on (which unfortunately is recommended for Nolan films) and the first 5 mins it gives it away that it\u2019s her, even though it would be hard to catch that or understand what\u2019s going on anyways. \n\nI just wonder if anyone has noticed that or what to think of it I guess lol. I just found it odd, or maybe not put her name in the subtitle. ",

        "title": "The courtroom scene in True Grit (2010) is one of the best written scenes in movie history.",
        "content": "Every time I watch this scene, there's a new layer of brilliance uncovered. It should be held up as an archetype of how to introduce characters in an entertaining and contextually authentic way without the need for boring exposition. It's just brilliant.\n\nFirst, the character of Rooster Cogburn is slowly revealed as he is questioned first by the prosecutor and then cross-examined by the defense attorney. We learn, in turn, that he is perfectly willing to use violence in defense of the law, that he is perfectly willing to use violence with the law as a cover, and then, finally, that he is simply a violent, vindictive man who casually kills and abuses his authority. It also shows him as a sarcastic and rather funny character who takes his many killings quite lightly, but is someone who at least pretends to have a belief in law and order.\n\nWe also learn, solely through brief reaction shots, a lot about Mattie's character as her interest in Rooster grows to conviction that he is the right man to track down her quarry. \n\nApart from this, the depiction of legal procedure is among the best ever filmed, with accurate objections and extremely accurate lawyer behavior. For example, at one point, the prosecutor asks a technically leading question (\"Did you find the jar with $120 in it?) which doesn't prejudice the witness at all and would have saved everyone's time, except that the defense attorney makes a pedantic objection that the question is technically leading. The judge sustains the objection, so the prosecutor's reaction is one of exasperation and he asks the more general (and technically appropriate for direct examination) question: \"What happened then?\" To which Rooster replies \"I found a jar with $120 in it.\"\n\nThen the cross examination is just an incredible work of dialogue crafting. A lengthy sequence in which Rooster describes his history of killing a particular family and, in a specific incident, describes how one member of the family \"came at me with a king bolt.\" The defense attorney clarifies incredulously \"You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing more than a king bolt? From a wagon tongue!?\" \n\nNow, I guarantee that 95% of 2010 audiences had (and have) no idea what a wagon tongue is and had never even heard of a king bolt. But the scene is so well written, directed, and acted, that you don't need to. The writers don't need to sacrifice period accuracy because the context sets up more than enough for the audience to know what's going on without a full understanding of the details. \n\nThe scene's blocking, editing, and photography is also amazing. It feels dynamic and vital despite taking place in a courtroom where nearly everyone is stationary for the whole scene and where there are tons of extras just sitting in place. Closeups and medium shots are intermixed but not rapidly cut in the modern style-- the scene is allowed to develop and then the Coens get the hell out of it at the soonest possible moment. \n\nThis scene is like a Mozart piano concerto: there's not a single note out of place. Changing anything would be a diminshment. They should teach this to every prospective screenwriting student across the country for the next 50 years.",

The book was readable and entertaining but imo didn\u2019t hold a candle to the film. Rosamund pike\u2019s performance turned Amy into an anti hero (or not based on your definition) and completely devoured every scene she was in. The book spent so much time with Nick who was essentially a stock character and Ben Affleck played it perfectly while giving plenty of room for the actual substance of the story. I think film was a better medium for the nuance of emotions and picked up the slack where the book lagged.\n\nSo my question for Reddit is what film did you think was better than the book and why? Was it a particular performance? Or did the medium suit the narrative better? ",

        "content": "Guessing a lot of Spanish speaking people will be chiming in, since (at least in my experience) that's the #1 most prevalent non-English language spoken in American movies.\n\nMy personal example was watching Nosferatu in theaters in Romania. Both the village scene and the monastery scene had people snickering and laughing because of the unintentional silliness. Especially the moment &gt;!where the old nun throws garlic on Thomas and says \"Dau cu usturoi pentru strigoi\"!&lt; which sounds so authentically goofy to our ears, considering it's supposed to be set in the 1800s, but the accent is very classic \"rural grandma\" that all of us 90s city kids grew up with during summer vacation. It's like if you guys watched Sleepy Hollow and someone starts talking like Jeff Bridges in True Grit.\n\nIt's funny though, cause I definitely remember when I was a kid visiting my grandparents' village, there were old(er) people who had such thick dialects I legitimately could not understand them, and they would be born in like the 1920s-30s. Obviously they couldn't recreate this for Nosferatu, but still interesting to think about how unintelligible 1800s language would seem to us.",

        "content": "Happy Valentines Day, everybody! And too celebrate....on my own...as usual (\ud83d\ude22). I decided to watch one of my favorite Disney movies of all time....*Tangled*. This is not only one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, as I said, but also probably tied with *Frozen* as my favorite of the post-2000s Disney Era. Yes, I know there are objectively better films from the modern era like *Zootopia* and *Encanto*. But for my, *Tangled* is my all-time favorite (along with...well, you know).\n\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful, cozy, and still holds extremely, especially with the colors, the comedy also equally still holds up and I found myself laughing at a lot of points, the songs are memorable and catchy, I see The Light and the scene that goes with it is probably the highlight of the movie and one of, if not the most beautiful moment in have seen in any Disney film ever, Mother Gothel is truly the last great Disney (I love King Candy too, but he still got nothing on Gothel) who i am convinced is the Evil Queen from Snow White Years later and i refuse to think any different, the action is surprisingly solid, and not only is Rapunzel the best Disney princess (besides Kuzco, that is, lol), but also her and Eugene's love story is probably the best I've seen in any Disney film.\n\nThe two work off of each other extremely well, and you absolutely buy their chemistry, as they don't fall in love with one another right away, but instead there romance develops throughout the course of the film, and seeing it happen on screen is phenomenal, which just makes the scene when they eventually confess on the boat (in song form!) and when Rapunzel revives Eugene via her act of true love even more satisfying and heartwarming. The emotional/dramatic moments also work extremely well, and don't even get me started on how much of GOATs Maximus and Pascal are as comedic animal sidekicks.\n\nThe only problem I have is that the climax is admittedly the man saving the women again, but I'm willing to let it slide and view it more as a nitpick as it makes sense within the context of the story, and it's Rapunzel who ultimately brings Eugene back anyways. Not much else to say other then such a beautiful and solid film that I highly recommend, that i am surprised though also kindof glad Disney never did a sequel too (the closest we got was the equally fantastic and goated TV series, which i also highly recommend). With that said, if Frozen 3 and 4 are not crossovers with Tangled, I will be VERY disappointed. Maximus and Pacal interacting with Sven, Bruni, and Olaf is too amazing to think about.",

        "content": "The opening of Raiders is Iconic, and it's easy to see why. It is a thrilling sequence that sets the pace for the film to come. It sits firmly in the halls of great sequences and has been mimicked, parodied, and copied many times since its inception in 1981. One of the greatest feats it accomplishes is establishing the character of Indiana Jones with little to no dialogue.\n\n\n\nThe sequence is great; who doesn't like a rolling boulder and shooting darts, but the sequence is doing much more heavy lifting story-wise than you may notice at first glance? The trials that Indy navigates all serve to highlight the different aspects of the character that will play a larger role later in the film\n\n\n\nFor example, Indy is shown to be capable and intuitive. In this first scene, he finds the temple and thwarts an attack, but later, he shows that he is reckless and impatient, making mistakes that cause the temple to fall. The first sequence shows that all his planning goes sideways as soon as  it's tested. He is good at his job but has rivals. He sometimes trusts the wrong people, and his actions often lead to him being in very preventable situations.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the character, which continues throughout the films, is that he constantly loses. He finds and loses the ark and the grail. He almost never really wins a fight. He is luck and opportunity rolled into one. I think this is why the character has been loved for so long, he is just a guy bumbling through things with the best intentions\n\n  \n",

Not looking for plot twists you didn't like but still fit the narrative pretty well, but more like ones that completely made everything before and after worse off. \n\nFor me, it's The Dressmaker. The first 30-45 mins are okay, seems like a romantic drama starring Kate Winslet and Sarah Snook with beautiful costumes. The movie feels light and funny in parts. But then &gt;! Kate Winslet's fortunes go downhill faster than you can say A Serious Man (by the Coen Brothers). Her love interest, Liam Hemsworth, drowns in sorghum inside a grain silo (she witnesses it). Then more people die in gruesome ways, and Kate Winslet ends up blowing up the town at the end. Tone-wise, it is so off...  !&lt;\n\nThe plot choices completely ruin some of the great things it had going for it.",
