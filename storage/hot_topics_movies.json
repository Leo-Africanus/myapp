        "content": "Hey r/movies!\n\nWe're Ian Spendloff (Creative Director and Character Designer) and Ross Wilkinson (VFX Supervisor), the Framestore team who brought Mr. Ring-A-Ding to life in Doctor Who Season 2: Lux, from concept and design through to final pixel. Ian is an Emmy winner for his animated sequences on Ms. Marvel, and has also created standout work The Marvels, and the iconic Beats Pills campaign. Ross has worked on Avatar: The Last Airbender (S1) and Avengers: Infinity War. Ask us anything! \n\nWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow (Wednesday 06/04) at 15:00 PM ET to answer your questions. Please feel free to ask away in the meantime.\n\nMore information:\n\nLed by Emmy-winning Creative Director Ian Spendloff and VFX Supervisor Ross Wilkinson, Framestore designed and animated Mr. Ring-A-Ding for Doctor Who Season 2: Lux, supported with visualisation by Framestore Preproduction Services (FPS).\n\nCrafted entirely in the UK, the team took the character from initial concept, design and previs, through to final pixel. Mr. Ring-A-Ding evolves over the episode, starting as a classic 1930s hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animation and transforming into a gruesome and realistic modern 3D character, seamlessly integrated into live-action footage.\n\nBehind-the-scenes \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuI5jP-xZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xuI5jP-xZQ)\n\nBios:\n\n**Ian** \\- Ian Spendloff is a highly experienced Director, Art Director and Designer, with a particular focus on character led projects. He has created concepts, narratives, characters &amp; creatures for a host of thrilling projects, spanning advertising, series and immersive entertainment.\n\nIan\u2019s latest major project was a multi-million pound, fully CG theme park dark ride \u2018Pearl Quest\u2019, created for China\u2019s Wanda Group. Framestore were lucky enough to be granted full directorial &amp; creative control of the project, which allowed  Ian\u2019s talent in re-imagining a classic Chinese folklore to shine out over eleven large- scale installation screens. The project attracted a VES nomination for \u201cOutstanding Visual Effects in a Special Venue Project\u201d    \n\nIan was instrumental in the making of Tooned, an animated series crafted by Framestore in partnership with Formula 1 giant McLaren. Tooned was highly praised, winning the Gold Clio, Eurobest and Lovie Awards, with the special edition Tooned 50 landing Ian a place in the D&amp;AD book.\n\nIan also drove the iconic \u2018Beats by Dre\u2019 campaigns, providing the early concepts for the Pill characters right through to the animation. Ian has a  passion for capturing personality in his work, and a natural ability to add humour, emotion &amp; visual depth to any project, regardless of platform.\n\n**Ross** \\- Ross gained his first experience into visual effects during a modelling internship at Framestore in 2008. After a ten year stint at DNEG, he returned to Framestore in 2022 as a VFX Supervisor.\n\nRoss\u2019s keen eye for detail has seen him work on a variety of projects spanning film, episodic and advertising. From Marvel Studios\u2019 box-office smashing Avengers: Infinity War to season five of Black Mirror, as well as visits to the Wizarding World and The Hunger Games franchises. \n\nMore recently, Ross completed work on BBC documentary series Dinosaurs: The Final Day, with Sir David Attenborough. The documentary follows the final days of non-avian dinosaurs through the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, and was a career highlight for Ross. \n\nAsk us anything! Back at 3 PM ET today to answer your questions.",

Just to give you an idea of how popular she was, her role as Arwen wasn't that big yet she always had her face in the movies' posters which shows how much of a star she was.",

        "content": "I was randomly thinking about Inception today and am 99% confident the entire movie is a dream. While different actors, the clothing worn by his children in both the flashback and the end of the movie are nearly identical in addition to their location in the backyard. The girl is wearing a pink dress in the flashback and subsequently is wearing a pink dress over a white t-shirt. Similarly the boy is wearing a plaid shirt with shorts in both scenes. After not seeing his kids for \\~2 years, the chance that his kids are wearing nearly the same outfit and are in the same location in the backyard is nearly impossible.\n\nWith most directors I think you can let this slide, but Chris Nolan is particular about every detail of his movies. This was an intentional choice that is unlikely to happen in reality.\n\nPs. I think the totem was always a red herring and constructed to give the dreamer the outcome they want.",

        "content": "I rewatched Blade Runner recently, and I couldn\u2019t get over the feeling that I was watching a very different film. It wasn\u2019t that it was the latest in the umpteen cuts that have been released. And I hadn\u2019t just forgotten the plot over the years. What got me for the first time was I wasn\u2019t so sure Deckard was the good guy. Not even an antihero.\n\n&gt;!This growing unease really took root when Deckard kills Zhora. It brought to mind \u201cHan Shot First\u201d, but in this case there was no ambiguity. Deckard went to the nightclub with the intent of killing this woman and proceeded to do so by shooting her in the back as she tries to flee.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I\u2019m sitting upright and squinting at the screen trying to process this, when things go from bad to worse. In his apartment, Deckard is making unwanted advances as Rachel gets increasingly upset. She tries to leave, and he won\u2019t let her, and then he proceeds to force himself on her. And I begin to feel insane. This is rape, but it never once occurred to me until that moment.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The hits keep coming. When Pris is in her death throes it\u2019s not just disturbing, it\u2019s sad. All these replicants wanted was to live. They\u2019re fighting to survive. And this culminates when Roy saves Deckard\u2019s life when he had absolutely every reason to let him fall to his death. Was Roy the hero all along? Trying to save his friends and then proceeding to spare his nemesis\u2019 life?!&lt;\n\nSo after I pull myself together, I do some digging. There are number of discussions out there on the very topic of Deckard\u2019s character, including a piece by Eric Haywood, who had an extremely similar take. Has anyone else had this 180 experience? And if so, why? Is Blade Runner a litmus test for us and the world at large?\n\nI still believe it\u2019s an amazing film. It\u2019s aged certainly, but it has aged well. Matured into something that is still thought provoking and relevant. Just a bit more upsetting than I remembered.",

Does anyone else have a remake they feel might have overall superior to the original? Writing? Acting? Directing?",

        "content": "I am making my way through the Mission Impossible franchise for the first time and get to Mission Impossible 4. Early in the movie there are several short sequences of characters speaking Russian. There are no subtitles which I found odd, I dig through the settings, turn subtitles and captioning on, all with no success. All closed captioning offers me is \"characters speaking in Russian'. These were short little exchanges so I figured they just made the movie that way. Weird but whatever. About an hour later a full 5 minute conversation is happening in Russian and I realize no way they actually just made this without subtitles. I dig through the settings and options again with no success. I started doing some googling and found THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. Some titles don't have subtitles for other languages so you just are not allowed to understand the dialogue if you watch on Prime I guess? I switched to paramount plus, went to those sequences, and there were my missing subtitles. Didn't even have to go into the settings. Amazon, Bezos, seriously? Now I will only ever watch on Prime if it's my only option. Making it to where the viewer can not understand necessary dialogue is totally unacceptable.",
