The entire setting makes you undergo that disturbing feeling of war. The fact that the entire cast and crew underwent similar territory as the soldiers, could probably be one of the reasons.",

It's not that it's a bad film, it just was not what I expected. \n\nSequels:\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 was such a bummer after a franchise high with Fallout.\n\nThe Accountant 2 - buddy film molded into the world of \"The Accountant\". It didn't embrace what made the first one a sleeper hit.  \n\nJoker: Folie a Deux - amazing visuals in incredible promotional materials but such a slog. ",

        "content": "This is just a spoiler free recommendation\n\nFirst and foremost, I don't like Kpop. Don't really listen to it. Not a pop person in general. Just listen to a few hits here or there, I'm saying this to highlight I'm not the targeted demographic for this flick. But despite that the premise of this movie, popstars Vs. Demons seemed really intresting to me. So I went in with doubts and walked out with my mind blown. This was one of the best things that came out this year and as far as animation goes, one of the best animated things I've seen in a long while.\n\nThat biggest thing that has floored me about this movie is just the sheer amount of outfits the characters change into. They fucking went HAM on their character designs. The quality and phenomenal taste of this animation is just top notch. Sakuga action scenes at every corner.\n\nI can't praise this movie enough. It's perfect from every angle. It's bursting with Korean culture. It's fucking hilarious, the comedy is on the spot. It's taking in aspects from K-movies, dramas, music, fashion. Everthing. The story is also fucking amazing with it's emotional peaks.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can give this movie is that it's like capturing those imaginary music videos we make in our heads when listening to music and animating it into an hour and a half montage.\n\nThe songs in this movie have potential to be \"Let It Go\" annoying with the overuse. Because they're catchy af.\n\nI didn't know how bad I was aching for a good ~~chick flick~~ (**EDIT**: ***Not*** a chick flick, my bad. I misinterpreted the term. I meant girl led action movie) until this satisfied that desire spontaneously. It brought back a sense of nostalgia for me of watching Totally Spies for some reason. It's the superhero/ teenager work, life balance vibes that they share.",

        "content": "I used to do SFX and my first job out of university was a shock to me because I realized motorbikes and gunshots on screen didn't sound like actual motorbikes or gunshots. I suddenly realized the studio's collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded \"right\" for reasons I can't explain.\n\nSomething I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they're recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud to establish it's loud, then the SFX editor has to radically drop the levels because the actors have been recorded talking in their normal voices. I appreciate it when the director gives them directions to act like they're in a loud place. I was on a set once where the director had the actors put earplugs in so they HAD to yell (everyone in the scene had long hair or were given weird hats to hide the ear plugs).\n\nAnyways, I'm watching Bullet Train Explosion right now and they just used the Wilhelm scream for a student getting punched. I had to burst out laughing because, well, it sounds right when someone falls off a cliff, not when someone falls over a train seat.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Watching Capone (2020) felt like watching a feature-length version of one of those fake movies they make for real movies....Anyone else feel that way?",
        "content": "\nWeather playing on a TV in a room or showing at a movie theater or even taking a larger role within the actual movie. This felt like a prestige drama that belongs within a satire, where a well-known actor is playing a totally deranged role and everyone in-universe is pretending it\u2019s Oscar-worthy. That\u2019s the exact energy Capone gives off.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hit me at first. I started off just kind of baffled, then hit the infamous diarrhea scenes\u2014and that\u2019s when I mentally broke. Not in a \u201cthis is bad\u201d way, but in a \u201cwait... this isn\u2019t a real movie, this is a parody of a movie within a movie\u201d kind of way.\n\nAfter that, I couldn\u2019t unsee it. Tom Hardy isn\u2019t playing Al Capone\u2014he\u2019s playing the role that some fictional actor takes on in a movie about Hollywood excess. You can just feel the scene where the camera pans behind the scenes and he\u2019s like, totally serious about the role and the praise is pouring in. \n\nOnce I saw it that way, I weirdly started to appreciate it. I\u2019d never watch it again, but it\u2019s kind of brilliant as a fake movie that accidentally became real. Like an accidental Tropic Thunder moment, just played completely straight.\n\nDo you think they were trolling us?\n",

The prime example of a simple, fun, and straight to the point premise down right.\n\nGreat music, great acting, great directing and writing, and a very great balance of tones. Not too mention, it ends with the kid literally creating himself a better living by helping his parents when they were younger. Also, Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd are great as always.\n\nIts not just one of the best films ever made, buts its Robert Zemekis's best film in general. Yeah, I said it.\n\nEasy 10/10.",

        "content": "Here's a couple for me:\n\nStar Wars: How people in the Original Trilogy seem to think the Jedi were just a myth, even though they existed for thousands of years prior, and weren't wiped out until 20 years before, meaning there would be plenty of people still alive who had interacted with them. I've heard people suggest the Empire did a 1984-esque campaign to make people forget, but I'm just not buying it. It would be like if some evil dictator wiped out all Hindus, and 20 years later most people thought Hindus never existed, even though there would undoubtedly be people who had Hindu friends and acquaintances still around.\n\nSigns: How water is like acid to the aliens. You know, water, that liquid that covers three quarters of the planet? Imagine if you were looking for a planet to settle on, and found one that was three quarters covered in sulfuric acid, ,where it frequently rains acid, and where the inhabitants are mostly made of sulfuric acid. Do you try to colonize that planet? ",

        "title": "Really well-made movies that have nothing to do with anything sad or traumatic, but you still hate for personal reasons",
        "content": "When people talk about movies they only would watch once, it's almost exclusively sad movies. Requiem for a Dream, 12 Years a Slave, Grave of the Fireflies, Dear Zachary - all these movies are really well made and people give them their flowers, but like no shit people only want to watch them once, they're emotionally devastating. \n  \nMeanwhile I think of Nomadland. Other than the main character's background of losing her things in a recession, the story isn't supposed to be sad. I mean, it's about a woman finding out what makes her happy and brings her joy and peace. And she finds a community of like-minded people. But man, it just instilled such an incredible sense of loneliness in me unlike anything else I've seen. And it came out right after the worst bout of depression I've ever had in my life, so I hate it because I felt like it found joy specifically where I had found misery.\n \nAnd this post was also inspired by how much I hated the new How to Train Your Dragon, which was also, technically, in theory, \"well made,\" but I hated because of its sheer and (other than 1998's Psycho) unprecedented lack of creativity, but unlike with Psycho which arguably made for an interesting artistic experiment, HTTYD was made exclusively for the sake of money and commercialism. Idc if money is the driving force behind your movie getting made, I just care that you're going to make something original\n  \nSo, other non-sad movies that you hate with a passion?",

        "content": "Movies that were absolute, total stinkers, or even painfully average, but had great performances they didn\u2019t deserve. \n\nOne that comes to mind is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. These movies have a lot of problems, even though I enjoy them, but Ewan McGregor\u2019s performance is the one of the things that is consistently good through all 3 movies. He brings a level of emotional depth and nuance to the character the script and direction doesn\u2019t even call for. It\u2019s a testament to how poor the direction is when there are so many other great actors who give awful, wooden performances in those films. Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid all rise above the shitty script and direction as well, bringing life to their characters and chewing the scenery. \n\nAnother film is X Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman gave his best performance as the title character up to that point, and it was completely wasted on the steaming pile of dogshit that was that movie. Liev Schreiber was also excellent in that film, bringing a charisma to Sabretooth that a less skilled actor would have lacked. \n\nMichael Fassbender in Prometheus comes to mind as well\n\nWhat are some other examples?\n ",

        "content": "There\u2019s this one scene from The Choice that\u2019s etched into me. I must\u2019ve watched it when I was 18 I guess, too young to understand the full weight of love and loss. But now I\u2019m 29 and I still think about that scene almost every single day. And I honestly have no idea why.\n\nIt\u2019s the part where Travis builds this little gazebo on the island the one where he and his wife Gabby had shared quiet moments before life got loud. After everything the accident, the heartbreak, the waiting he creates this simple, quiet space. Replaces the wind chimes. Waits with this kind of hope that love would find its way back. And somehow she comes back. Just a man building a place for love to come home to. And she does. \n\n I don\u2019t know why that scene found a home inside me. Why over a decade later it still lingers. I think about that scene more often than I realize. Not because it\u2019s overly dramatic or romantic in a predictable way but because something about it feels\u2026 familiar. The idea of building something with your own hands, out of love, out of waiting, out of pure, aching belief. Maybe it\u2019s the metaphor I keep returning to. The hope. The stillness. The quiet, unwavering kind of love that doesn\u2019t chase, it builds. And waits.\n\nTho still not sure why it haunts me gently the way it does, Sometimes I think we\u2019re all carrying a little island inside us. A place where we hang our own wind chimes. A place where we wait not out of desperation, but out of love. Out of belief. Out of something softer than logic but stronger than time.\n\nIsn\u2019t it wild how one quiet scene can take root in your heart and never leave?\n\n\n\n\n",
