        "content": "*After moving to the countryside, a supernatural encounter starts to transform a couple's love, their lives, and their flesh.*\n\nDirector: Michael Shanks\n\nCast: Dave Franco, Alison Brie\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/together_2025/reviews) (55 reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [76/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/together-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Austin Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/28) \\- [Richard Whittaker](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/richard-whittaker)\n\n&gt;Could a non-married pair of actors have given these scenes such terrifying poignancy? Of course. And there\u2019s no guarantee that a married acting couple would have been able to translate the weight of intimacy to Millie and Tim. If anything, that offscreen chemistry rarely translates and just feels gimmicky. Brie and Franco is like watching Burton and Taylor or Newman and Woodward: as performers who know each other so well, they have synergy but also provide the space for them to reach out and pull back from each other. Their scenes together \u2013 which make up most of the film \u2013 pulsate and breathe. When those elaborate set-pieces start to add in some creatively grisly special effects, they merely clarify the visual component to the established subtext. When *Together* gets weird, it can do so because of how painfully relatable it is.\n\n[NPR](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2070) \\- [Aisha Harris](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aisha-harris) \n\n&gt;*Together* is a fun body horror-comedy about a couple (real-life husband-and-wife Dave Franco and Alison Brie) stuck in a rut but unwilling to do anything about it. When they move to the country, they stumble upon a cursed cave that forces all of their unspoken issues to the forefront in the most visceral and icky ways possible. Writer-director Michael Shanks' third act fumbles a bit in its predictability, but Brie and Franco lock into the offbeat humor of the film's premise, and the special effects are a marvel.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [Kate Erbland](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kate-erbland) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;And, oh boy, does Shanks \u2014 and his very game stars and producers \u2014 take those seemingly trite relationship observations to wild ends over the course of this delightfully unhinged spin on the body horror joint. While it\u2019s easy to poke holes in some of the logic Shanks\u2019 script seems to think is baked right in \u2014 without spoiling too much, we\u2019ve got *a lot* of questions about how much the wider community is clued into what\u2019s really happening\n\n [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;Shanks could stand to develop more finesse (and better writing) in the emotional drama. But even if he\u2019s killing time in his first feature before letting loose a heap of corporeal mayhem, *Together* marks him as a talent to watch. It\u2019s an ideal midnight date movie for the non-squeamish.\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Owen Gleiberman](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/owen-gleiberman)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fun (in a rather bumptious way), it stars two very good actors playing a couple who have as many issues as couples do in real life, and it works as a totally unhinged yet far from mindless thriller built around a Big Idea.",

        "content": "I just saw Bring Her Back and damn what an amazing movie. I loved almost every single aspect of it. One thing that stood out most to me was the use of subtlety. The movie never overexplains and actually treats its audience with intelligence. So many moments I thought \"if this was a generic horror movie they would have done this instead and I'm glad it didn't take that route.\" I like how we're clued into events instead.  \n\\- the taxidermy  \n\\- when she first describes Connor's physical features as Ollie's (whom we see later in the tape), her deleting \"Ollie's\" pictures from Andy's phone  \n\\- the fact that she even calls him Ollie  \n\\- how it draws attention to significant things like the pool from the start   \n\\- we're never told how she set off this entire plan but we can piece it together  \n\\- we get clues to how the ritual works and even when exposition is delivered through the tape, it's not ham-fisted  \nThere's no big monologue. It never gets bogged down by lore and instead focuses on the characters and story.\n\nI love how the brothers use gore in their films. Its restrained in that it's used in a small amount and that's what makes it so effective imo compared to gorefests like Saw and Terrifier. The scene where the main character goes to hell for a brief moment and the head bang in Talk To Me are still stuck in my mind. In this film it's- well I don't even have to describe them. The gore is so explicit and grounded enough in realism to make it revolting. I don't get squeamish easily (I handled The Substance just fine) but I had to look away from those two scenes lol. Also not really gore but I liked the flashes of Ollie being a demon.\n\nGreat performances from the entire cast and fleshed out characters as well. Stand out was Sally Hawkins and the possessed kid - his facial expressions and body language were just so creepy. I liked the visuals of the film as well. The constant use of circular imagery in the film was nice. I'm a sucker for good transitions and that bathtub to puddle transition got me.\n\nI prefer horror that gives the story just as much importance as the scares or gore. In fact it makes these other elements more effective to me. Overall a really bleak and heartbreaking film. The film packaged themes of abuse and grief into the story really well. The Phillipou brothers are 2 for 2 so far and I can't wait to see what they do in the future. I think this is actually my favourite movie of the year so far from what I've seen.",

That wasn\u2019t my take away from the movie though. I felt it was a tremendous amount of women empowerment with no filter. I told myself I needed to rewatch it because I feel like I might\u2019ve missed a few things. I loved it mostly because it made my brain itch and think and it struck emotions that I wasn\u2019t expecting. What were your thought when you watched the movie and would you recommend it to others? Did it make you feel strongly or completely uncomfortable? \n\n\nEdit: Thanks to all who\u2019ve been commenting, this is EXACTLY the discussion I was looking for. Appreciate everyone\u2019s views very much! ",
