        "content": "I didn't go into the movie expecting anything - but it genuinely felt real, and like a hug.\nI don't generally watch things because of actors, or start watching because *this* or *that* actor is in the film.\n\nMy delight when Susan Sarandon appeared was really quite something. Such a fabulous character for her - I can't recall ever seeing her in a similar role previously.\n\nEveryone involved with the film should be proud of what they created. Some genuine laughs were had, and I'd personally put it on my \"watch when in a food film mood\" shelf, which only had Chef on it in the past.",

I know these kinds of films are lazy most of the time, but I genuinely love superheroes and comics and I really enjoy the stories told. Logan, Thunderbolts*, Spiderverse, Nolan Trilogy, The Batman, Superman 78, Deadpool, Kick-Ass, Kingsman, the Cap Trilogy, it\u2019s all brilliant imo.\n\nI can definitely see why people don\u2019t enjoy the genre, but I love it and will defend it to my last breath if need be. There\u2019s something magic about it.\n\n",

Thought it\u2019d be just another action flick, but it turned out way smarter and funnier than I expected, and now I\u2019ve seen it like five times. What\u2019s yours?",
