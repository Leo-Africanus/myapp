But \u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t the same as \u201cexceptional,\u201d and I didn\u2019t see anything in the performance that felt truly singular or irreplaceable.\n\nEvery year, the supporting categories are stacked with performances that bring extreme emotional range, transformation, or narrative weight, many of which don\u2019t get recognized at all. Compared to those kinds of turns, Elordi\u2019s role didn\u2019t strike me as particularly demanding or transformative, nor did it feel like something only he could have pulled off.\n\nTo me, it felt like a well-executed performance that a number of capable actors could have delivered at a similar level. That\u2019s where I struggle to see the case for an Oscar nomination, where the bar is (or should be) set much higher than competence.\n\nCurious to hear what others think? What specifically about his performance stood out to you as awards-worthy?",

I can\u2019t recall the last time a movie has made me cry since I\u2019m not nearly as emotional as I was when I was a kid, but HOLY HELL did this movie bring me close to doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie about a father and his son as they traverse a post apocalyptic United States in search of a boat to see if they can find a safer place to live.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear during the movie that humanity is doomed. A worldwide disaster struck the now ash covered planet, and pretty much all plant and animal life is gone. Because of that, it isn\u2019t uncommon for any remaining people to start resorting to cannibalism.\n\nI ended up watching it on my birthday, and it really put a damper on the remainder of it. Is it arguably a good movie? Yes, but I have no desire to watch it again. Not for a very long time at least.",

        "content": "The rating in IMDb is 5.8/10.\n\nViewer rating is a bit extreme on both sides.\n\nHalf is \u201cjust watch with low expectations and don\u2019t question anything, then it is a very enjoyable movie to watch - same level as Armageddon, and better than most Transfomer movies\u201d\n\nThe other half is \u201cdon\u2019t waste your time, what a horrible movie that doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d\n\nAnyway, I always have this guilty pleasure of disaster/fight the monsters and save the world types of movie.  I love Pacific Rim 1 (I know it mainly it\u2019s because it has Guillermo del Toro as the director), however 2012 is below my limit.\n\nBattleship is \u2026 non stop action.  Hence it doesn\u2019t give you much time to question the plot.  The alien is not super powerful, which kind of a fresh air (?).  In fact, the alien is not really the bad guy.  At least they have no intention to kill living beings, if they don\u2019t have intention to kill first.\n\nCast is \u2026 ok.  Nice to see Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, who I had no idea who he was in my last watch (at least 7 years ago).  I don\u2019t listen Rihanna\u2019s songs so her acting doesn\u2019t bother me.  And I do like they used real life veterans as actor / extra.\n\nIt was a not bad movie to kill time and shutdown my brain in a summer afternoon.\n\nThank you for reading my confession.",

Every conversation that happened on screen was so damn captivating. I was completely immersed. Not a single line was wasted. The soundtrack was amazing the entire way through. The narration was perfect. The acting was top-notch, but the overall message of the film, and the style in which it was told is something I haven\u2019t seen or experienced in a very long time. The best comparison I can make, and one I thought of multiple times during my initial watch (there will be many more) was \u201cBig Fish\u201d a fantastic movie in its own rite. Definitely in my top ten. I think I might like this one better. Never before have I been so moved by a picture. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s heartbreaking but it\u2019s also wholesome and inspirational. I honestly just sat there, jaw wide open, mesmerized by what I was seeing. I\u2019m snowed in on a bitterly cold Saturday afternoon with nothing else to do and chose this movie on a whim. No trailer, no snippet, no recommendation, I didn\u2019t even know this movie existed until a couple of hours ago and know now for a fact that it\u2019s one I will never forget. This might be my new favorite movie!",

        "content": "I watched the movie yesterday after years and I am suprirsed how well it aged and how good it is.\n\nIt somehow managed to stay on the \"romantic comedy\" territory, yet stand against the cliche where there is a happy end for the couple you actually root for but the main character remains single...yet happy\n\nFirst, it has absolutely outstanding music, songs and \"musical numbers\" that don\u00b4t feel forced and don\u00b4t make it a real musical, just fun. That scene around the table was so well done, it felt like something that could happen organically (of course, nobody is such a good singer to make it look so cool but I can see people just start singing for fun in restaurant)\n\nJulia Roberts and Cameron Diaz playing complete opposites, even in color schemes. Jules also running around in darker clothes and jeans as opposite to the light colored clothes of the others made it also very clear she is different. The shasing scene with them commenting \"She is from New York\" was hilarious.\n\nRupert Everett stole the scenes he was in and I loved how he was sort of a moral core for Jules while getting to know him a bit through the short scenes he had.\n\nI was never too fond of Roberts\u00b4 acting myself but I really liked her here and I think to go against the stereotypes, play a protagonist AND an antaoginst at the same time, was awesome. It is a pretty multi-faceted role where you can see her going through some personal development and while doing bad things, her subsequently undermining herself by doing the right thing was so fun to watch\n\nI know Cameron Diaz later said she had not much to do here but smile but I disagree. Kim was not just a \"cute girl\" role, but she was portrayed as a very level headed at points, obviously smart and doing a very well thought through decision to marry this guy, despite her pausing her life for a bit. \n\nThat said...and my only quip....Michael and Dermont Mulroney was such a non entity. I kept wondering why these two obviously very smart and independent women fight for a guy who was not wiling to move an inch from his life and compromise. Him and Julia Roberts had that \"best friend\" chemistry, which is perfectly fine but he lacked charisma and was upstaged by not only both actresses but also Everett who had a considerably smaller role. I never thought he was an interesting or charismatic actor, even back then so it may be also a bit of a miscast for me. If someone else, with a natural charisma was there, I could have understoond why those women drop everything and run into his arms. But maybe it is just me as a woman, who has a bit different type? It is very subjective  and it is my only quip with the movie.",

        "content": "The novel is a US classic. It deserves a comparable movie adaptation.\n\nCharly (1968) was so disappointing though.\n\nThe 2000 TV movie was an improvement. Matthew Modine was a better Charlie. The ending was more impactful too. But it was still an old school network TV movie. It was one of those cases where the cast and crew did the best they can within the limits of what they had.\n\nThe novel is near timeless because you can easily imagine the story is taking place in the modern day. Only a few tidbits here and there gives away its 1960s setting.\n\nWhat a new movie needs is a voice over narration from Charlie. The novel wouldn't be as acclaimed as it is if not for his unique first person POV. That the previous movies neglected this is baffling.\n\nEDITED to add that they can also *sparingly* show his written words on the bottom of the screen as he is narrating. Similar to captions or subtitles. Or a shot over his hand as he is writing. Certainly not throughout the entire movie but at key points to show his improvement and regression.",
