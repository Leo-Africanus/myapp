        "content": "Director: Celine Song\n\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal, Chris Evans\n\n*A young New York City matchmaker's lucrative business gets complicated as she finds herself torn between the perfect match and her imperfect ex.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [90%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/materialists)\n\n**Metacritic:** [73/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/materialists/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250606-materialists-review) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;Moving on from its cynical beginning, Materialists takes the long way around to an ending that is decidedly hopeful. It offers an unblinkered, earned romanticism that suits this moment, and bolsters Song's reputation as one of our most astute observers of relationships.\n\n[SlashFilm - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/1871812/materialists-review/)\n\n&gt;There's a bit of quiet courageousness to the movie in its commitment to depth over trying to nakedly appeal to others, and that's a quality which makes any person \u2014 and any film \u2014 more desirable. So, I'll follow the film's bravery by admitting, right here and now, that I'm in love with it.\n\n[San Fransisco Chronicle - Hannah Bae](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/materialists-review-celine-song-20363208.php) \\- 3/4\n\n&gt;Through most of \u201cMaterialists,\u201d the director and screenwriter\u2019s follow-up to 2023\u2019s \u201cPast Lives,\u201d the camera casts its luxurious settings in a golden sheen. This is the world of a successful, high-end matchmaker in New York City. Responsible for nine marriages, Lucy (Dakota Johnson), as her boss crows during a sparkling office celebration, possesses \u201crazor-sharp instincts and one hell of an eye.\u201d Marketed as a romantic comedy, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is a sharper, more thoughtful film than its genre would suggest. This is a story about perceived value and what its pursuit costs its characters -- emotionally, physically and materially.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Derek Smith](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-chris-evans-pedro-pascal-celine-song/) \\- 2/4\n\n&gt;*Materialists* is beautifully lensed by Shabier Kirchner, who captures the unstained luxe-ness of Harry\u2019s pricey condo and the upscale restaurants he takes Lucy to as lucidly as he does the ramshackle reality of John\u2019s day-to-day life. But Song\u2019s script works only in fits and starts, too often reliant on merely raising the subtext around the types of economic anxieties that affect relationships in numerous rom-coms to literal text. The central trio\u2019s conversations become less entrenched in realism as the film goes on, with the characters sounding increasingly less like individuals in the throes of love and more like they\u2019re espousing an authorial point of view.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-pedro-pascal-chris-evans-a24/)\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not sure \u201cMaterialists\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdate movie\u201d by any conventional definition, unless you and your date love artful cinema and don\u2019t mind having a complex, not-very-sexy conversation afterwards. But I do heartily recommend you see \u201cMaterialists,\u201d and that you see it for what it is, not what it kinda looks like from the outside, as pitched to you by the very sort of romance-commodification salespersons that Celine Song\u2019s movie criticizes. It\u2019s a great movie about romance \u2014 whether it\u2019s technically \u201cromantic\u201d or not.\n\n[AV Club - Natalia Keogan](https://www.avclub.com/materialists-review) \\- B-\n\n&gt;The rom-com has not been resurrected with *Materialists*. Though Song showed much promise with her Oscar-nominated foray into filmmaking, this screenplay feels less intentional in nearly every respect, and the performances from central cast members, save for Evans, don\u2019t adequately enhance the narrative. The ham-fisted insistence that relationships are largely transactional\u2014no matter the amount of money a couple may earn\u2014is void of any meaningful insight, resulting in a story that simply doesn\u2019t pay off.\u00a0\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/materialists-review-dakota-johnson-chris-evans-pedro-pascal-1236257284/)\n\n&gt;Especially for someone relatively new to filmmaking, Song\u2019s thoughtfulness as a writer is matched by unerring instincts as a director \u2014 nailing the balance between tonal variation and fluidity; getting superb work out of her actors; making judicious use of Daniel Pemberton\u2019s gentle, melancholy score; and delivering a sweet, satisfying ending that keeps a lid on the sentiment. Song\u2019s script avoids glibness in dealing with the transactional aspects of partnering and the commodification of certain attributes. There\u2019s a frankness here that\u2019s refreshing as *Materialists* explores ideas of personal value and increasing one\u2019s worth \u2014 including via the obvious path of cosmetic surgery.",

It\u2019s not an essential remake, but at least it\u2019s not an offensive one.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/how-to-train-your-dragon-review-live-action-remake-1236426469/):\n\n&gt;John Powell\u2019s return to compose the music and build on his previously established themes helps the story soar.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/how-to-train-your-dragon-review-live-action-1236422053/):\n\n&gt;It's hard to improve on the first movie, though the last act looks positively iconic in this new incarnation, unlocking the expressionistic power of \"Heavy Metal\" toons and Boris Vallejo paintings.\n\n[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/how-to-train-your-dragon-movie-review-733ec3ea812e6940b65362e594b55fa6) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/09/how-to-train-your-dragon-2025-movie-review/84075887007/) (3.5/4):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, the new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does no harm. Instead, it lets loose a heartwarming, meaty adventure perfect for a new generation of young film fan but doesn't forget to entertain the older movie kids, either.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-movie-review-2025/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;How To Train Your Dragon is fantastic, not just emulating the original but elevating it, all the while also delivering a blockbuster poised to thrill.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-review-2025-live-action-remake-1235129634/) (B-):\n\n&gt;That [director Dean DeBlois] can still find excitement and joy in this well-tread story is a testament to both his work and source material. No one needs a live-action remake, but ones this faithful and sweet are not the problem.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-train-your-dragon-review-2025) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Within all its rigid recitation, there\u2019s a heart and soul that demonstrates how DeBlois has managed to get so much mileage out of the loving story of a Viking boy and the dragon he befriends.\n\n[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-review) (C+):\n\n&gt;Rather than trying to train something new, How To Train Your Dragon is riding an already proven beast... It can\u2019t reach those old heights, let alone any new ones. And it doesn\u2019t try to, nor does its audience really want it to.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/how-to-train-your-dragon/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s clearly made with real love and care, but shows far too much deference to its progenitor. Even in a remake, we need more originality and less playing the hits.\n\n[Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/how-to-train-your-dragon-2025-review/) (2/4):\n\n&gt;As heartwarming as this story remains at its core, it\u2019s hard to shake that you already know how it will play out.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1881070/how-to-train-your-dragon-2025-remake-review/) (6/10):\n\n&gt;We have \"How to Train Your Dragon\" at home. It's the motion picture equivalent of turning tacos into nachos, and even though nachos can be delicious, they're not as good reheated.\n\n[Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/how-to-train-your-dragon-review-live-action-b2764174.html) (2/5):\n\n&gt;All that\u2019s really changed is that How to Train Your Dragon is now distinctly less charming and less playful than before, with even its pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance Toothless losing some of the cute factor.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/how-to-train-your-dragon-review1/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;It somehow elongates its predecessor\u2019s running time by 27 minutes without adding a single atom of noticeably fresh material. Perhaps all the dragons are just flying around a bit more slowly this time, or the vikings have to walk further between huts.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/how-to-train-your-dragon-remake-film-review-gtlslwbj9?region=global):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s loud and diverting and very young children are sure to be entertained. But it\u2019s also utterly dead, right down to its hollow, greedy, cash-grabbing core.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast, Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Mason Thames as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III\n* Nico Parker as Astrid Hofferson\n* Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast\n* Nick Frost as Gobber the Belch\n* Gabriel Howell as Snotlout Jorgenson\n* Julian Dennison as Fishlegs Ingerman\n* Bronwyn James as Ruffnut Thorston\n* Harry Trevaldwyn as Tuffnut Thorston\n* Ruth Codd as Phlegma\n* Peter Serafinowicz as Spitelout Jorgenson\n\nDirected by: Dean DeBlois\n\nScreenplay by: Dean DeBlois\n\nProduced by: Marc Platt, Dean DeBlois, and Adam Siegel\n\nCinematography: Bill Pope\n\nEdited by: Wyatt Smith\n\nMusic by: John Powell\n\nRunning time: 125 minutes\n\nRelease dates: June 13, 2025",

The last moments of the movie in particular are what I find brilliant. As Truman leaves the set, the movie comes to a close. We never get finality on what happens to him in the real world, and it\u2019s an amazing parallel to how the people watching the show are no longer under full observation of Truman himself. It\u2019s one of the best endings to a movie I\u2019ve ever seen, even if it is a cliffhanger.",

A month ago, I had another chance, I found a perfect time for new zealand this december, I was terrified. My family was concerned, some even mad at the idea, I knew I wanted to, but I was scared of doing something without their acceptance -without a 'seal of approval'. Today I told myself to buy the tickets, but I got pulled back again by my parents' suggestions to push it back another year, but that all changed with one suggestion from my sister. \"Watch Dead Poet's Society\" it was a random suggestion not even connected to my struggle, just a movie she enjoyed. I left my laptop open with the qantas website still loaded, and watched the movie. I dont think I've ever watched a movie at such a perfect time as then. It was surreal, I knew what I needed to do. The next thing I did was open up my laptop again and buy those tickets. I'm now 6 months away from New Zealand. Some movies are more than just movies, they are an experience to keep us moving.

Personally I thought it was good enough to not flop the way that it is, but I also think the movie suffered from the way it was marketed as being a team up between Jackie Chan and Daniel LaRusso to teach Ben Wang. I mean, that does happen, don't get me wrong, but it takes a LONG time to get there, because they spend the first half of the movie setting up the actual conflict. The daughter and Joshua Jackson seem to have much more screentime than Jackie Chan does; just saying.\n\nI think if it had been a bit more honest about what the movie was actually going to be, it would be doing better.",

Seth Rogen has never really played a villain to my knowledge, and while a lot of people pointed out that it\u2019s a weird casting choice, I think it could be super smart overall. People are so used to him as a goofy good guy that it would be extra crazy to see Napoleon become the tyrant of the farm.\n\nSince it\u2019s directed by Andy Serkis, I have a hard time believing he would make the movie more sanitized. Even with the jokes at the end, there\u2019s a very sinister undercurrent to the scene, especially with the music. Napoleon saying \u201cpigs should stick with pigs\u201d definitely foreshadows his cruel intentions",

        "content": "I knew about how depressing and disturbing this movie can be but I still wanted to watch it because I felt like it discusses a really important topic that I must know exists. \n\nIt\u2019s like when you learn about a case and you know it\u2019s horrible but you still have to see it because you know this happens to people in real life and this is someone\u2019s reality right now and the least you can do for those people is to just open your eyes and see even if it hurts you. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly how I felt about the movie, Lilya in my perspective embodied innocence and youth and seeing her struggle because of how adults around her are awful and irresponsible made me sad about how a lot of young people have to deal with situations that adults created. \n\nThe most disturbing part of the movie was the last 40 minutes as we see Lilya was actually used for sex trafficking which broke my heart. \n\nI must admit I tried to force myself to see the SA scenes but I couldn\u2019t help but skip them, it makes me so mad and disturbed to see how they filmed her to be in pain and in an uncomfortable situation even if it was just an act. \n\nI felt like it triggered me as well especially that I\u2019ve been assaulted many times from different people, and I ended up thinking about it all night and thinking about people who are living like this right now, you know about them and you know there\u2019s nothing you can do for them which makes me hate how useless I feel. \n\nThe end of the movie broke me but I understand.. Lilya couldn\u2019t help but end it all, if she went back home she\u2019ll go back to poverty and being lonely because Volodya is not there anymore, and there\u2019s a high chance that the bastard that took advantage of her will send someone to hurt her again.  \n\nAnd if she stayed in Sweden he will search gor her and she\u2019ll be stuck in a country that she doesn\u2019t know anything about, and even if she went to police they\u2019ll discover that she faked her passport. \n\nI also realized how the only time Lilya thought she found a person she can trust he sent her to trafficking. \n\nAt the end I\u2019d like to say fk Natasha and Andrei",

        "content": "The Graduate is often mistaken for being deeply ambiguous, but this opinion came from Mike Nichols\u2019 decision not to yell \u201ccut\u201d at the end of the final scene, allowing the characters to fade silent and stare at the camera to show uncertain expressions. This tonal shift feels profound, but it\u2019s more of an aesthetic flourish than a true narrative or thematic ambiguity. The story itself is quite clear: Benjamin rebels against a future he doesn\u2019t want, chases Elaine, and gets what he wants, and they laugh happily at each other when they board the bus. They look into the camera because they are looking into their future.\n\nOn the other hand, Rear Window is more genuinely ambiguous. While the murder is solved, the film raises unresolved ethical questions about voyeurism and whether Jeff's decisions are ethical or not. Was he a hero for stepping in and helping others solve a problem or was he stepping into peoples' boundaries? Even we don't know how Jeff and Lisa would end up.",

        "content": "I hate how Tyler Perry has moved over the years. And I say this not to tear down a Black creative \u2014 but to question why someone with so much power, influence, and access consistently chooses to recycle the same painful narrative over and over again, to the point where it feels less like representation\u2026 and more like exploitation.\n\nIt feels like his movies don\u2019t just touch on trauma \u2014 they traumatize Black audiences.\n\nYes, Black people have endured and survived unimaginable things. Yes, there are deep-rooted issues in our communities that deserve to be spoken about. But there\u2019s a difference between storytelling and trauma-dumping. There\u2019s a line between bringing awareness and dragging your people through hell just because you can.\n\nTake his latest movie as an example \u2014 a single Black mother at the center, and every horrible thing imaginable happens to her. Her landlord kicks her out. Her boss fires her. A cop runs her off the road and threatens her. Her child gets taken away. And just when you think maybe she\u2019ll catch a break\u2026 her child dies too.\n\nWhy? For what?\n\nAt what point does this stop being a story and start becoming suffering as spectacle? It\u2019s not just emotionally exhausting \u2014 it\u2019s deeply disturbing.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern here. In nearly all of Perry\u2019s films and series, Black women are abused, broken, or abandoned. Black men are either abusers, cheaters, or saviors \u2014 never something in between. The characters lack depth. The pain is constant. The message? That suffering is part of being Black. That pain is our destiny. That endurance is our only virtue.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true.\n\nWe are so much more than our trauma.\n\nWe are joy. We are excellence. We are innovators, leaders, healers, artists, and dreamers. We are breaking generational curses. We are loving each other. We are making it. And those stories deserve to be told just as loudly, just as boldly, just as frequently.\n\nWhat\u2019s most disheartening is that someone like Tyler Perry could tell those stories. He has a studio. He has funding. He has a loyal audience. He has access to some of the best Black talent in the world. But instead of evolving his storytelling, he keeps feeding us the same pain \u2014 dressed up as entertainment.\n\nWhen I look at the landscape of Black film and television, I can name dozens of shows and movies that uplift, that stretch beyond trauma, that imagine something better for us: shows like Queen Sugar, Insecure, Abbott Elementary, Black Panther, The Photograph, The Harder They Fall. These works show that we can tell layered stories \u2014 ones that reflect struggle and joy.\n\nBut I truly cannot name a single Tyler Perry production that left me feeling uplifted.\n\nAt some point, we have to ask: Who is this really for? Who benefits from a never-ending loop of Black pain? And when will it be enough?\n\nBecause we deserve more than to see ourselves repeatedly battered by life, by each other, and by scripts that refuse to imagine us as anything but victims.\n\nWe deserve healing stories, hopeful stories, and whole stories.\n\nWe deserve better from someone who claims to love us.",
