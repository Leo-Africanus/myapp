        "title": "January 2-4 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' crosses $1B worldwide; James Cameron becomes first director with four films to reach that milestone. 'Zootopia 2' nears $1.6B worldwide. The series finale of 'Stranger Things' sold $25M-$30M in concession cash to movie theaters.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/9ndiblif7mbg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdac8b4984b3d4d52c969b2622d97647e2f4a804\n\n2026 got to a pretty good start, even though there was a lack of notable newcomers this week. Unsurprisingly, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** held the top spot for the third week. In the process, it broke past the $1 billion mark worldwide. And ***Zootopia 2*** had another insane performance overseas, raising the bar for where it will finish.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $124.4 million this weekend. That's up 26% from last year, when ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** reached #1 on its third weekend.\n\nStaying on top for the third weekend, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** earned $41.4 million. That represents a light 34% drop. Although ***The Way of Water*** actually increased on its third weekend and it was also much higher ($67 million), given that it only started to benefit from the holidays.\n\n***Fire and Ash*** has amassed $307.6 million to date. Last week, it was $44.1 million behind ***The Way of Water***, and now that has grown to $117.8 million. And it will only continue growing over the next days. It could still hit $500 million domestically, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** has enjoyed some great legs thanks to the holidays. It eased just 2%, for a great $19.3 million weekend. With $364 million domestically, it has officially passed the original's gross ($341.2 million). Given the lack of competition on January, it should definitely reach $400 million domestically.\n\nIn third place, Lionsgate's ***The Housemaid*** is breaking past any expectations. It dipped a very slight 1%, earning $15.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $75.9 million domestically, and it should finish its run with over $120 million domestically. The biggest Lionsgate title since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes***.\n\nIn fourth place, A24's ***Marty Supreme*** is showing word of mouth is on its favor. The film dipped just 29%, earning $12.5 million this weekend. Through 11 days in wide release, the film has earned a fantastic $56 million. It's already A24's third biggest ever film, and it will pass ***Civil War*** ($68 million) by next week. Given its great word of mouth and heavy Oscar buzz, ***Marty Supreme*** could get as high as $90 million domestically.\n\nSony's ***Anaconda*** eased just 31%, adding $10 million. After 11 days, the film has earned $45.8 million, and should make its way to almost $80 million by the end of its run.\n\n***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** eased 25%, for a $8.3 million. The film's domestic total stands at $57.7 million, and it should continue holding well thanks to no animated competition in January.\n\nAngel Studios' ***David*** eased 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $69.7 million, although perhaps it seems $100 million will be a bit of a challenge.\n\n***Song Sung Blue*** eased just 17% on its second weekend, earning $5.8 million. The film's 11-day total stands at $25 million, and it could still reach $40 million if it keeps holding well.\n\n***Wicked: For Good*** dipped 39%, for a $3.2 million weekend. The film has amassed $339.8 million so far.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** with $2.6 million, just a 39% drop. The film has earned $125.2 million, and it looks like it will fall off now that holidays are over.\n\nThere was one single wide release this week, Vertical's ***We Bury the Dead***. But it finished outside the Top 10, earning $2.5 million in 1,172 theaters. That's Vertical's best ever debut, although it just speaks volumes on how low they are as a distributor.\n\nIt seems like Park Chan-wook's ***No Other Choice*** is picking up some steam. Even though it's playing in just 45 theaters, the film hit the 12th spot with $1 million this weekend. That's a dazzling $22,247 per-theater average, signaling great word of mouth. It will continue expanding, and could possibly hit the Top 10 next week.\n\nOn December 31st through January 1, 620 theaters screened the series finale of ***Stranger Things***. There are no official figures, although the trades report that it sold an estimated $25 million-$30 million in consessions. As Netflix does not report figures, this was all reported as concession vouchers. They allowed theaters to keep 95% of the sales, a fantastic figure.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nJames Cameron did it again.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** has crossed the $1 billion milestone, thanks to a $169.6 million overseas haul this week. With this, he has become the first director to have four titles reach $1 billion worldwide, after ***Titanic*** and the prior ***Avatar*** films. There's not a market breakdown for now, but its biggest market has been China with $138 million. Given the empty January, it should continue legging out just fine.\n\nBut even with ***Avatar*** taking the spotlight, ***Zootopia 2*** continues destroying records. This weekend was actually better than last week, as it added $81.7 million overseas. That takes its worldwide gross to an insane $1.590 billion. It already passed ***Frozen II*** ($1.453 billion) to become Walt Disney Animation Studios' biggest ever film. \n\nIn China, ***Zootopia 2*** actually increased to $38 million over a five-day holiday. It already surpassed ***Avengers: Endgame*** in ticket sales, but this weekend, it eclipsed that film's \u00a5$4.249 billion total to become the biggest ever Hollywood title in the market. That's roughly \u00a54.250 billion ($604.1 million), which means it has both the adjusted and unadjusted record.\n\nNot content with taking down ***Frozen II***, ***Zootopia 2*** is now aiming for another record: the biggest ever Hollywood animated film, ***Inside Out 2*** ($1.698 billion). It's just $108 million away, which means it could get there as early as next week. After that, ***Zootopia 2*** will try to reach $1.8 billion, and could get as high as $1.9 billion. Which means that there's a possibility that it outgrosses ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** to become the biggest Hollywood title of 2025.\n\n***Anaconda*** added $13.4 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $88.3 million. The best markets are Australia ($5.8M), the UK ($5.3), and Mexico ($4M). In the next few days, it will cross the $100 million mark.\n\nWhile there's no complete overseas breakdown, ***The Housemaid*** is proving to be a success outside America. It has crossed $130 million worldwide, and with the legs it's showing, it should easily get to $200 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Now You See Me: Now You Don't* | Nov/14 | Lionsgate | $21,013,793 | $61,882,396 | $211,216,528 | $90M\n\n- A vanishing act. Lionsgate's ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** has closed with $211 million worldwide. It clearly shows there's still interest in the franchise, although it also shows it already hit a ceiling. It didn't quite change the fact that it's the lowest grossing film in the franchise, as this is a 37% drop from the second film. Lionsgate is clearly confident in this franchise, and they already have a fourth film in development. But given how the film performed, it's likely that it will continue the franchise's decline at the box office.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nAlright, we finally getting some notable wide releases.\n\nAs it's now a tradition, Gerard Butler has another January film. That's ***Greenland 2: Migration***, sequel to the 2020 film. Even though it only made $52 million worldwide (pandemic you know?), the film was a huge success in PVOD, which is what motivated Lionsgate to pick up the rights to the sequel. Although the film's $90 million budget is a huge concern.\n\nParamount is also releasing ***Primate***, the first major horror title of the year, following a family's chimpanzee who goes bananas and starts killing people. The film has premiered at Fantastic Fest and earned some great reviews so far (92% on RT). Will this surprise?\n\nIn limited release, Row K Entertainment will start its run as distributor with Gus Van Sant's ***Dead Man's Wire***. It stars Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Tony Kiritsis, who was involved in the 1977 Indianapolis hostage standoff. The film debuted in Venice with a fantastic response (98% on RT), although usually a film of this caliber is released in fall to contend for fall season. Nevertheless, it should score a great per-theater average ahead of its wide expansion next week.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

And yet, it left me speechless.\n\nI don't think I've ever had so much fun and felt so involved watching a film. Byrne and the rest of the band not only manage to bring all their songs to life perfectly, but they do something even more difficult: they make them believable. The cinematography is simple, precise, and tries to make room for all the characters, while the audience is revealed only in the final moments. The set design changes as the songs progress, and the frontman's movements reflect the mood of the song. The song list is also wonderful, each one better than the last.\n\nSo, what do you think of Stop Making Sense?",

I seem to remember, I have seen David Lynch , Janes Cameron , Stanley Kubrick and David Fincher being angry and annoyed on set. \nSo is all footage of Spielberg on set heavily edited, or is that just not the kind of director he is? \nI know he used to be harder on sets, and especially on E.T. he changed his approach.

        "content": "I recently rewatched First Blood, and while I genuinely enjoy all the sequels, I usually recommend the first film as a standalone tragic character study. In my head, the rest of the franchise exists in a \u201cwhat if\u201d universe and can live there just fine.\n\nThe original ending\u2019s ambiguity feels essential to the character\u2019s arc. Once later films provide clearer resolutions, more backstory and direction, the emotional weight of that first story shifts in a way that makes it feel less complete on its own.\n\nAre there other films you feel were better served by ambiguity rather than explanation or continuation? And I\u2019m not anti-sequel...another example for me is Stranger Than Fiction. Had that ending remained more open (and maybe tragic) I think we\u2019d still be debating it as something truly special.",

I'm really into Synthwave and I found Cliff Martinez on Spotify and ended up living the Drive score which in turn sent me to the movie. I could rent it for 4 bucks on Amazon, or buy it for 5 bucks, so I bought it.\n\n  \nOnly to find it doesn't have the actual original score anymore. It's still great, but the music I've been listening to is so much better. So it looks like the movie was scored twice, or re-scored for the UK, and that's all Amazon offers streaming now.\n\n  \nI'm about to buy the Blue Ray but I was curious if any of you have the Blue Ray and can confirm if it is the OG score.\n\n  \nThanks!",

        "content": "I'm from the generation whose 007 was Roger Moore. So let's just say I have a certain affection for him. I was rewatching Moonraker and I realized he wasn't too different from, I don't know, when he did \"The Saint\" or \"The Persuaders\" That is, a very British character, with great aplomb, who never takes himself too seriously. And let's just say he did that very well. I tried to look at his filmography and I don't think there are many films where he tries to do something different. Maybe \"The Wild Geese,\" but I last saw it like 30 years ago.\n\nSo I ask, what's the general opinion about this actor? That he could only do one thing and did it very well? Or are there gems in his filmography where he was able to showcase his talent?\n\nOh, I saw he was also in Curse of the Pink Panther. I remember his cameo. It was one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen in a movie.",
