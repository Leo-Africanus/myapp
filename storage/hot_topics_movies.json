        "content": "Kraven the Hunter - Review Thread\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kraven_the_hunter): 16% (49 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kraven-the-hunter/): 33 (24 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-jc-chandor-1236083842/) (20/100):\n\n&gt;Punishingly dull.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):\n\n&gt;I\u2019ve seen much worse comic-book movies than \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn\u2019t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That\u2019s a dereliction of duty, but it\u2019s one I didn\u2019t commit on purpose. I simply hadn\u2019t bothered to think about it.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):\n\n&gt;It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope\n\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):\n\n&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don\u2019t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d might be very, very bad (and by \u201cmight be\u201d I mean \u201calmost objectively is\u201d), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today\u2019s audiences might consider as \u201cgood.\n\n[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):\n\n&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):\n\n&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which \"Kraven the Hunter\" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows \"Kraven\" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Crowe\u2019s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there\u2019s not much to like elsewhere\n\n[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):\n\n&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it\u2019s best that this misbegotten series quits while it\u2019s just-barely ahead.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):\n\n&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):\n\n&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.\n\nDirected by J.C. Chandor:\n\n&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.\n\nRelease Date: December 13\n\nCast:\n\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven:\n* Ariana DeBose as Calypso Ezili\n* Fred Hechinger as Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon\n* Alessandro Nivola as Aleksei Sytsevich / Rhino\n* Christopher Abbott as the Foreigner\n* Russell Crowe as Nikolai Kravinoff",

I know it isn't a great movie by any means but it made an impression on me of a man who would do anything for his child in a system you expect to help him.  Instead you learn how bad the system is and what is forces a man of conviction to do.\n\nAs with the news, I flashed back to this moving thinking of what drives a man to violence when he is trampled by the system.  How doing something crazy is sometimes the sanest option you have left.",

        "content": "Hi so with the 28 years later trailer I have seen a lot of people complaining about 28 weeks later and I dont know why. I loved how it was very different from any other zombie media I have seen where the virus was contained only in UK, and eventually basically eradicated. The only thing I dislike is how stupid everyone is, but thats a given for zombie movies. I actually liked 28 week more than 28 days, so Im curious why people hate it so much.",

The characters are layered and flawed, and these flaws are displayed wonderfully through the interactions and decisions made over the course of the movie. This movie made me feel like none other. I\u2019m 17 going on 18 in a few months, childhood is nearly gone, and I would do anything to go back. This movie confronted me with the challenging reality that I will never have experiences like that again. While I do cherish those memories deeper for it, I can\u2019t help but feel sad about how infinitely out of reach those experiences are from me.",

        "title": "Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience",
        "content": "*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.\n\n*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.\n\nThey're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.\n\nIn addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.\n\nThe subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.\n\n\"It's poetry. It's the poetry of war.\"",
