Pike River is a drama that depicts a mining tragedy that affected an entire community and their fight for justice and accountability.  It was made in close collaboration with the real subjects so questions around process of working with real people to tell their stories in a dramatic form might be of particular interest to some.  But it's an AMA so happy to answer any questions at all, of course, including random questions about New Zealand! Can\u2019t wait to connect with you all on Monday - Rob Sarkies\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4)\n\n  \n**Synopsis:**\n\n&gt;On Nov. 19, 2010, a coal mine explosion in New Zealand kills Anna Osborne's husband and Sonya Rockhouse's son, along with 27 other men.

        "title": "Are there any great recent Legal Dramas?",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been craving a legal drama recently so I watched Philadelphia. I was thoroughly satisfied with the film, but I came to a realization that I had been dismissive of for years now\u2026. \u201cThey don\u2019t make them like they used to\u201d. Now I\u2019m 20 years old, so since the films I\u2019m gonna talk about most got released whilst my parents with in high school, but for some reason the 90s were the golden age of legal dramas. \n\nMy favorite legal drama of all time is My Cousin Vinny, A Time To Kill, which was released in 1996 is my 2nd favorite legal drama of all time. A Few Good Men, which was released in 1992 is my 3rd favorite legal drama.\n\nThe Trial of The Chicago 7, released in 2020, is clearly an outlier, because it\u2019s probably my favorite movie of that year, but if I name other films I love in the genre it\u2019d be Primal Fear 1996, Sleepers 1996, and now Philadelphia 1993.\n\nThere are a few recent films I\u2019ve watch in the genre I\u2019ve rather enjoyed, namely being Lincoln Lawyer 2011, Just Mercy 2019, Runaway Jury 2003, Fracture 2007 (though it\u2019s been a while and I\u2019ve forgotten most of it), the Judge 2014 (same as Fracture), and one I didn\u2019t like quite that much was Roman J Israel Esq.\n\nI look at all the ones I\u2019m yet to see and am most excited about, and I see a pattern emerge. Presumed Innocent 1990, The Pelican Brief 1993, The Firm 1993, The Rainmaker 1997, The Client 1994. \n\nObviously I\u2019m leaving out others on my watchlist lie The Verdict 1982 and Dark Waters 2019, but there seems to be a sharp decline in Legal Dramas being made, especially those released in theaters. Since Covid, the closest I\u2019ve gotten to seeing a legal thriller in a cinema was Oppenheimer, and my god was I transfixed by it.\n\nHave there been any that have slipped under my radar? Or is it a dying genre?",

        "content": "his is a movie that often gets a bit of hate, as it won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1990 over the favorite Goodfellas. I do love Goodfellas, but this to me is an equally great movie, on it's own merits. Unlike some Best Picture Winners, this actually deserved it a whole lot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00hucqshg1ig1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35212b3a58ff67600e90e23d3c420b1fc343e5d\n\nThis movie spells epic in so many ways, just that Buffalo Hunt scene, would place it among the classics. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c33a2yvjg1ig1.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=848666d29f6a599c26f53147072554f4e846a326\n\nAnd to think this was Kevin Costner\u2019s first movie as a director. Interestingly none of the studios backed the movie, saying the Western was a dead genre, Costner, put his faith in the movie, and the rest as they say is history*.*\n\nThe movie opens with a brilliant battle scene, where Field Lt. John Dunbar( Kevin Costner) a Union soldier, makes a suicidal run into the Confederate line, that makes him a hero. However when asked for a choice of his posting, he chooses the Frontier, a decision that results in raised eyebrows of Major Fambrough( Maury Chaykin). His reasoning is simple\n\n*\"Yes Sir.. Before it's Gone\"*\n\nThe Frontier then was considered a punishment posting, where no one was really interested in settling then, but then Dunbar puts it about himself\n\n\u00a0*In trying to produce my\u00a0 own death, I was elevated to the status of a living hero.*\n\nA reluctant hero, who was just content to live by himself, away from all the pomp and glory. \n\nThe shots were Costner proceeds into the wilderness just on his horse is superbly done, and Capt Cargill who hands him charge of  \u00a0Ft. Sedgwick his outpost, is more than relieved to leave the place.\n\n*I\u2019ve looked for that wagon from\u00a0\u00a0 Fort Hays just as you have\u2026 day\u00a0\u00a0 after miserable day. All I can say\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is that I\u2019m proud of you. Get your\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 things men, we\u2019re leaving this place.\u00a0\u00a0 The army\u2026 can go to hell.*\n\nDunbar however sees this as a place where he gets to see Buffalo and the Indians, a sentiment not shared by his associate Timmons who sees it as Hell. Timmons is ambushed, slaughtered and scalped by a group of Pawnees, in a rather gruesome scene.Dunbar is totally alone now in the wilderness, having to face hostile Native Indians, and his only companions now are his horse, and a wolf which he befriends calling it \"Two Socks\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3hhdztng1ig1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a716dd91c9df51410373e38622658b330f0ab533\n\nActually for close to 15-20 minutes, Dunbar is the only character in the movie, framed against the wilderness, as you can feel the sense of isolation. And then the nearby Sioux tribe members begin to make their contact with him Kicking Bird( Graham Greene), the old veteran Ten Bears.And Wind in The Hair who has nothing but contempt for the White men, and feels the same towards Dunbar.  He also gets drawn to Stands with a Fist( Mary McDonnel), a White woman raised by the Sioux, fully adapted to their way of life.\n\nThe way Costner explores the relation between the White and Native Indians, their initial feeling of mistrust, how he overcomes them slowly, the bonding he has with Kicking Bird is superbly shot.  The dialogues especially giving an insight into the ways of the Sioux and dependence on hunting. \n\nWhile sympathetic to the Native Indians, Costner also shows their more negative side, the intra tribal conflicts that were as violent. One very poignant scene, where the Sioux have lost badly in a battle with the Pawnees, and the mourning that follows the death of the tribe members, including Stands with a Fist, when we see her for the first time. Also usage of native Indian actors brings in that authenticity, where they don't end up as side shows.\n\nAgain the movie does not get into the White Savior mode here, Dunbar is more a person who is trying\u00a0 to\u00a0 understand\u00a0 their\u00a0 way\u00a0 of\u00a0 life, sympathetic to their cause, in fact the Sioux turns out to be his savior later on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6d9740sg1ig1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8590bb7b38d32a7bac72be111819dd8aeada8105\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3edmzwqg1ig1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68bc71253400bb76f5c5fce83e8c013cb24a501c\n\nThe Buffalo Hunt scene of course is one of the greatest movie scenes ever shot, especially that shot of the buffalo running across the vast open plains, and John Barry's BGM just elevating it.\n\nKevin Costner has had some great movies in the 80s- Bull Durham, The Untouchables, No Way Out, however his career went into a free fall in the mid 90s with some utterly disastrous choices, before he came back in the 2000s.  The Western is a genre he is absolutely home at, be it this one or Open Range which he directed later.\n\n\u00a0Dances\u00a0 with\u00a0 Wolves\u00a0 is\u00a0 that\u00a0 epic\u00a0 motion\u00a0 picture\u00a0 that\u00a0 skilfully combines\u00a0 the\u00a0 elements\u00a0 of\u00a0 drama, grandeur,\u00a0 characterization\u00a0 along\u00a0 with a strong\u00a0 social context,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 right\u00a0 amount of\u00a0 detailing,\u00a0 to\u00a0 make it a\u00a0 classic.\n\nIt also resurrected the Western in a more revisionist way, a genre that was almost dead in the 80s. In fact it was Silverado in which Costner starred, that sparked his interest in the Western genre. \n\n",

But my mental well-being has also changed dramatically.\n\nScrolling videos made my brain feel like porridge. I'd suddenly realize after 5 seconds that I was watching an obnoxious ad. No focus at all. Totally spaced out.\n\nWatching a movie actually makes me feel good. Being engaged in a storyline, maybe watching a feelgood movie like I did yesterday (The Intern) \u2026 It makes me happy and relaxed. It makes me enjoy life *more* afterwards.\n\nReading and working out is great as well, but it never made me not want to scroll. Watching a movie fulfills my desire for easy entertainment, without making it impossible to do something productive after.\n\nTomorrow marks a month of watching a movie every single day. Well, sometimes I watch half one day and the other half the next. I still think it counts.\n\nEdit: [Yes, I know I'm on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qxdevy/comment/o3w4oe1/?context=3)",
