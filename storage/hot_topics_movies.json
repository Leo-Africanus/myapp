        "title": "My wife (not an animation fan) has told me I can pick one animated film for us to watch. Which one??",
        "content": "***EDIT #4- Putting this at the top because it's an important development: she wants me to clarify that she hasn't always disliked ALL animated films. She liked the first Toy Story (although hasn't shown any interest in the sequels) and swears i convinced her to watch \"a movie about two girls and there were race cars (?what?).\" Also, anime is back on the table for some reason, so that opens up a lot of possibilities.\n\n\n***EDIT-this has gotten way more traction than I expected. I appreciate everyone 's input so far and it's unlikely I'll be able to respond to everyone. A couple of notes:\n\n1- I don't know exactly why she doesn't like animation. She just can't seem to get interested. I've tried in the past, I have. It hasn't captured her attention.\n\n2- Despite some very good recommendations, I'd like to avoid traumatizing her completely (Grave of the Fireflies, for example)\n\n3- She likes a variety of genres, so it's hard to narrow it down. She's also incredibly difficult to shop for, in the same way. She's very much a \"I'll know what I like when I see it\" person.\n\n****EDIT #2- Some great options so far. Lead contenders right now are probably Up, Wild Robot, Wall-E, Spiderverse, Incredibles, Iron Giant, Flow (I haven't seen this one yet either), Shrek.\n\nAbsolute no-no's, and you should be ashamed of yourselves (you know who you are) Heavy Metal, Watership Down, Grave of the Fireflies\n\n****EDIT #3- I've tried in the past. I thought we were on to something when she said she'd watch the Buzz Lightyear movie, but that was a stinker and she hasn't tried again since then.\n*.*.*.*\n\n\nMy wife has never enjoyed animated movies, so I'll usually watch any animated films on my own when they're released on a streaming service. She has just told me that I can pick any one animated film for us to watch together. Anime and any significantly older film (like classic Disney) won't fly. What should it be? I think it's got to be something that hits deep emotionally. Up? Wild Robot? What are your thoughts? \n\nThis could be my only chance to add animated films to out list of watchables.",

        "content": "*\"When the girl of his dreams (Amber Midthunder) is kidnapped, everyman Nate (Jack Quaid) turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected strength in his fight to get her back.\"*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine_2025/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [69/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/novocaine-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1236157792/)\n\n&gt;The numerous fight scenes, which often lapse into extreme gore, are as amusing as they are exciting. *Novocaine*, which amusingly employs REM\u2019s \u201cEverybody Hurts\u201d to accompany the opening credits, would probably have eventually worn out its welcome (it still feels overlong at 110 minutes) were it not for Quaid\u2019s terrific performance.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1235101694/)\n\n&gt;The film makes a great case for Quaid as action hero, Midthunder as romantic charmer, and Berk and Olson as being ready to step out of their horror-centric background.\n\n[Collider - Jeff Ewing](https://collider.com/novocaine-2025-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a gory, bonkers action-comedy premise anchored by a set of strong performances and a surprisingly poignant meet-cute, making for a wildly memorable action outing.\n\n[Screen Rant - Rachel LaBonte](https://screenrant.com/novocaine-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Suffice to say, *Novocaine* takes you on a rollicking adventure that, once it begins after Sherry's abduction, doesn't really let up. Sure, there's some tonal awkwardness with the actual bank heist scene \u2014 it's far more distressing than anything else in the movie \u2014 but between the humor and Quaid's performance, there's so much fun to be had here that it's easy to just sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\n[IGN - Lena Wilson](https://www.ign.com/articles/novocaine-review)\n\n&gt;Novocaine offers more depth than its gimmicky \u201cman who feels no pain\u201d premise may lead you to believe. This movie breathes new life into old ideas, with an original hero buoyed by the charm of Jack Quaid and a heroine who ably beats the damsel-in-distress allegations. Novocaine is smart, but not so self-aware that it\u2019s likely to alienate anybody; sharp, but not without feeling.\n\n[Looper - Audrey Fox](https://www.looper.com/1806454/novocaine-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Novocaine is packed full of inventive action set pieces that are alternately gruesome, goofy, and sometimes even both at once. It may not be for everyone, but it kind of feels like the gold standard for this very specific brand of action comedy.\n\n[DEADLINE - Gregory Nussen](https://deadline.com/2025/03/novocaine-review-jack-quaid-1236313943/)\n\n&gt;This is not the blistering action satire that *Hot Fuzz* is, but it\u2019s not the somber, balletic revenge plot of *Wick*, either. *Novocaine* is, frequently, a riot, but one wishes Jacobsen\u2019s script would have gone through another draft to iron out some flimsier details. It doesn\u2019t help that some late plot developments feel bizarrely convenient or else invalidate much of its own setup.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Rocco T. Thompson](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/novocaine-review-jack-quaid/)\n\n&gt;We\u2019re used to heroes who can take a licking and keep on ticking, but *Novocaine* takes action-movie invulnerability to brutal comic extremes. Starring Jack Quaid as a timid not-quite-everyman on the trail of the bank robbers who kidnapped his would-be girlfriend, the film offers little novelty beyond its hero being a human pin cushion, but it\u2019s stuffed with enough creative violence to make even jaded action fans squirm in their seats.",

        "content": "I'll be the first to admit, Congo isn't a great movie. But it's a lot of fun, well acted, good pacing and fun scenes. It seems like a great 90's Popcorn action-adventure movie. I do know that ever sense Congo came out it's been considered one of the worst movies ever. For a long while in the late 2000s to early 2010s, when list articles were more common, Congo would often appear on the lists of worst movies or biggest box office disappointments. \n\nBut why? I get it doesn't follow the book at all. The book has more of a darker/horror-adventure tone and the film is more light hearted PG-13 adventure. Is that basically why everyone choose to hate it? I am also going to go on a whim that most of the audience never read the book either and there are many other movie adaptations that don't follow the book closely and are still consider good movies.\n\nWas it basically all the same critics and audiences that also hated on Waterworld which for a long while was also considered a bad movie or the worst movie. \n\nCongo isn't perfect but I always rewatch it every few years and find myself enjoying it every time.",

It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take full ownership of their boys-with-toys mojo in this slick but dismally soulless odyssey across the American Southwest in a retro-futuristic alternate version of the 1990s. Following Cherry and The Gray Man, the brothers continue their post-Avengers streak of grinding out content for streaming platforms, amassing big budgets and marquee-name stars for quick-consumption movies destined to leave zero cultural footprint.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-russo-brothers-netflix-1236157136/)\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is emotionally incoherent because the moral of its story is contradicted by the emphasis of its telling. It\u2019s no wonder the filmmakers appear to side with their villain. As Skate puts it: \u201cOur world is a tire fire floating in an ocean of piss.\u201d Despite all of the clout and capital at their disposal, the Russo brothers can think of nothing better to do than stick our faces in it.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-electric-state-netflix-movie-review-1235101527/): D\u2013\n\n&gt; There\u2019s no rule that says book-based films shouldn\u2019t diverge from what\u2019s on the page. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d and Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cStarship Troopers\u201d certainly did, and those stories found their audiences in both mediums. In this case, however, the filmmakers have diluted the source material, showing a clear lack of interest in making their creation just as haunting, searing and satisfying as the original product.\n\n-[Courtney Howard, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-electric-state-review-1236330760/)\n\n&gt; I\u2019m not surprised that Netflix and the Russos want to tell a story about how humans and machines can live together in peace, but I struggled to find much humanity in a picture so gleefully soulless.\n\n-[Matt Goldberg, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/)\n\n&gt; There is a gallery of wacky individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing some undemanding work for voice-artists including Brian Cox, Woody Harrelson, Alan Tudyk and Colman Domingo. But there\u2019s no soul, no originality, just a great big multicolour wedge of digital content.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-simon-stalenhag): 2/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State is somehow both punishingly obvious and completely incoherent. Ultimately, however, the only real point is that pop culture should be revered as humanity\u2019s prime sustenance. Cosmo is based on a children\u2019s cartoon that\u2019s presented as the only real emotional bond between Michelle and her brother; the surrounding landscape is nothing but malls and fairgrounds, temples to consumerism where characters practically salivate while listing off menus items from Panda Express; and there\u2019s a searingly earnest piano cover of \u201cWonderwall\u201d at the end. The Electric State isn\u2019t about dystopia. It\u2019s the dystopia itself.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-electric-state-review-netflix-b2710157.html): 1/5\n\n&gt; The Electric State loses some of the quiet profundity of the original text, but as a breezily watchable retrofuturistic jolly, it has just enough juice.\n\n-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-electric-state/): 3/5\n\n&gt; Throughout, the film essentially functions as a plea to its viewers to put technology aside and embrace the power of human connection. It's a noble message \u2013 and one which most audiences members will surely be able to emphasise with \u2013 but in truth it feels hollow coming from a work that seems so clearly to have been made with the Netflix algorithm firmly in mind.\n\n-[Patrick Cremona, Radio Times](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/scifi/the-electric-state-review/): 2/5\n\n&gt; Should we expect more from a Netflix movie by now? Probably. But The Electric State is indicative of too many blockbuster offerings from the streaming service that do just enough to get you to watch, but are rarely good enough to be memorable.\n\n-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a64069135/the-electric-state-review-netflix/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nIn a retro-futuristic past, orphaned teenager Michelle traverses the American West with an eccentric drifter and a sweet but mysterious robot in search of her younger brother.\n\n**DIRECTORS** \n\nAnthony &amp; Joe Russo\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nChristopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely (based on the novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nStephen F.
