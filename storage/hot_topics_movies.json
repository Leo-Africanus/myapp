I'm sure there are a bunch of horror films, but I really struggle to think of any other films that play this completely straight -  usually if it ends with the protagonist losing then they made a mistake somewhere along the line.\n\nI'd exclude biopics and movies in series from this as they are part of a larger story (eg: Empire Strikes Back ends with Han being frozen and Luke losing to Vader, but you know it's only the middle of the story) \n\nI'm sure I'm missing obvious ones but one of the only examples I can think of is actually Don't Look Up, where the main characters are correct, try to warn everyone, do it as well as they can... but it doesn't make any difference.",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nMy daughter (11f) and her friend (11f) are having a sleepover. They want to watch a movie to make them cry. So far we have tried A walk to Remember, Bridge to Terebithia, Titantic, the notebook, Marley and Me. No tears or anything. Just laughter. I think these girls have no souls. Any suggestions? We have to keep it pg-13 and below. Thanks! \nEdit for movies I forgot she watched at a different time:\n\n\nForgot they have seen most Disney movies prior- not Fox and the hound so will tell them that. \n\nHave also watched My girl with no tears \n\n\nSecond update: they have decided on Old Yeller. I will let you know. Also I made a mistake and my daughter\u2019s friend cried at the end of A wall to Remember- so it\u2019s just my daughter who has problems. \n\nThird update: they tried old Yeller but couldn\u2019t get into it. Her friend hasn\u2019t seen My girl and my daughter saw it a while ago so they are giving that a shot. \n\nWe watched the preview to Stepmom on Amazon and it wasn\u2019t a real trailer so I couldn\u2019t sell it. \n\nShe also got mad at me because I rounded her up to 11 and she is actually 10.8 years old and wants accurate recommendations based on her correct age. \n\n4th update. They finished my girl. Her friend cried. My daughter said she just couldn\u2019t cry  she wanted to share this picture for all the my girl fans [https://imgur.com/a/dwobAmV](https://imgur.com/a/dwobAmV). Her friend is still crying from it and started crying when she read the speech. So there is hope for her. \n\nI just want to say my daughter has a dark sense of humor and loves to laugh but she is the sweetest kid. She is the first to offer help. Shes very kind and sweet. She helps her teacher during lunch. She also has a strong moral compass and compassion to animals and people. She stands up for her friends and her beliefs and is just a generally a great kid. I\u2019m sure in a few years so will be a crier like me. Thank you all for your suggestions. We will make our way through a lot of these. \n\nI think tomorrow we will do a Schindler\u2019s list family movie night. My husband is thrilled..\n\nI think we will have to do grave of the fireflies tomorrow as well. Lots of suggestions. I haven\u2019t heard of it. ",

Corey's \"Leviathan Wakes\" or something like it which warned against having corporations and governments gaining too much power and were inspired to put humanity on a brighter path.\n\nThere is an excellent TV show that was on Syfy but cancelled and then saved by Amazon called \"The Expanse\" but a movie would probably reach a bigger and wider mainstream audience.\n\nI think it would be cool if we were living in a world where the Mass Effect trilogy was getting a series of good big screen adaptations and were blowing people away with the new sci fi universe, aliens, and spaceships and showed people that \"Space Opera\" isn't just Star Wars or Star Trek.\n\nI think it would be cool to have Iain M. Banks's vision of the future, \"The Culture\" realized on the big screen.\n\nHopefully the success of the new Dune movies make Hollywood seriously think about giving us new sci fi movies.",

And he knows, as sure as God made little green apples, that one of these days that Polish prick's [Roman Polanski] gonna fuck things up and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.\u201d \n\nI may be reading into this a little much (or maybe this was obvious) but I just realized that this quote may have more importance than I had initially thought. At the end of the movie, we know that Sharon Tate ultimately survives the Manson murders in contrast to what actually happened. Is it possible that this quote from Steve McQueen may have been Tarantino\u2019s thoughts for how Polanski and Tate\u2019s marriage would have worked out if she had survived? Especially since Polanski has turned out to be an extremely awful person, this may have been the thing that McQueen was pointing to when he said that Polanski\u2019s going to fuck things up one day. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

        "content": "*Spoilers ahead*\n\nLike me you've probably seen clips of the beginning where rick jr and his dad buy those equation aks from that gun fair, so while I was looking through netflix I recognised the title and decided to watch it.\n\nIt's a good movie probably one of the better ones on netflix Australia, it's similar in a way to goodfellas both show the rise and fall of their main characters but in ricks case he wasn't a user just a dealer.\n\nThis movie is loosely based on the true story of Rick Wershe jr but the movie covers the main plot point. That rick got fucked by the federal government. \n\nIt's a decent movie with some powerful scenes such as when rick jr and his dad drag dawn (rick jr's sister) out of the crack house where she was residing and detoxing her in their house, the scene shows just how difficult it is to have a family member battle addiction and the uneasiness even after the addiction is broken an example would be rick sr looking out for dawn on his porch making she doesn't \"make a wrong turn\".\n\nI don't have the way of words many others have so I digress but I believe this is film is a must watch even with it's pacing issues or the low reviews. \n\n",

The plot of this movie is absolutely terrifying. Aside from how scary the movie is, the writing in this movie is one of the best ever. Also the acting by little child is simply phenomenal. 5/5 movie.",

Very interesting psychological crime thriller staring Sigourney Weaver as an agoraphobic criminal psychologist along with Holly Hunter &amp; Dermot Mulroney as 2 homicide detectives. They team up to investigate a serial killer who is terrorizing San Francisco by committing\u00a0copycat murders using the same methods as past famous serial killers, down to the exact details.\n\nI found the movie very suspenseful &amp; engaging with several unexpected twists. There's definitely similarities to other crime thrillers from that time period, especially Silence of the Lambs, but it also has its own style &amp; aesthetic to it that makes it stand out to me. It's also a rare movie from this time period that has fully developed female characters in leading roles.\n\nSigourney Weaver in particular is great as the criminal psychologist who develops agoraphobia. She once said that she was most proud of this role but regretted that the movie is often overlooked.\n\nThis movie was released with quite a bit of critical praise but I feel like no one seems to talk about it or even remember it. Definitely worth watching if you're interested in psychological crime thrillers.",

I'm trying to watch some of the campier ones. Please post as many as you can remember.",
