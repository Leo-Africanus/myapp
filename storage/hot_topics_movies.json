        "content": "I feel like there are probably more WW2 Nazi movies than any other genre. by comparison I can only think of may be 5 or 6 about the Japanese .\n\nWhy such the disparity?\n\nFor one it's a bit disingenuous and disrespectful to portray WW2 as a purely European conflict.  And from a strictly entertainment standpoint, you could write up a million different scripts that would put Private Ryan to shame.\n\nAlso, the few movies I have seen about Japanese in WW2 tend to portray them as noble warriors when in reality they were every bit as evil and diabolical as the Nazis, and committed some of the worst atrocities of the last hundred years.  \n\nTheir treatment of POWs was also probably the worst fates suffered during any US military war. They would literally mass execute captured soldiers and sailors, often by beheading....\n\nWhy is there no Inglorious Bastards Japanese version to date?",

        "title": "'Nightbitch' (2024) with Amy Adams got pretty terrible reviews and we almost skipped it but are very glad we didn't. I cannot recommend it highly enough for current and recent toddler-parents.",
        "content": "9:30pm, our three-year-old daughter is finally down, and my wife and I decide to crash on the couch and watch TV for \"20 minutes\" before switching off our consciousness for a few hours and doing it all over again.  I was an indie film nerd in my former life and am slowly getting back into it after the mind void of the first two years of parenthood.  As it turns out, that 20-or-30-minutes before lights-out every night is the perfect time to start up a weird new film and determine whether or not it's worth sticking with.  If it's intriguing, that is the film of the week and we'll watch it in three segments over the next few evenings.  If it's not, no big loss.\n\nSomething about *Nightbitch* appealed to me, probably Amy Adams and the unique premise, but I knew that it had pretty terrible reviews (and not just from casual film viewers but from indie film nerds too -- generally not a good sign).  But I suggested it to my wife, thinking that it would probably be a stinker and that we'd give it 20 minutes and then never think of it again.\n\nWrong.  We kept our eyes pried open for an hour-and-a-half to see it through to the end.  We had no choice --we were in a state of enraptured catharsis.  We have been discussing the film whenever we have a free moment for the past three days.  This ridiculous film somehow opened up a little hidden vault of empathy that my wife and I didn't know that we had for each other.  Watching it together on the couch after a day of battle did more good than ten couples counseling sessions.  That was **us** up on the screen in so many ways, and we were seeing each other and ourselves in this detached and absurd way that just melted away all of our built-up defenses.  It also made us take notice of the ways in which our individual personal strengths had averted at least some of the struggles that the on-scene couple was going through.\n\nI understand why *Nightbitch* was not popular.  As a *film*, it's no *Casablanca* or anything, just a pretty standard indie dark comedy, sometimes a little on-the-nose or messy.  For someone who has never been through the...  experience...  of toddler-parenting, I can see how it would feel like 100 minutes of nausea-inducing psychological torture with a healthy side-serving of cringe.  But, if you're going through this, or went through it recently enough that your brain hasn't smoothed over the rough edges of your memories -- this film was made for you, made for us.  And for those of you, I know that you might be thinking, \"Why would I want to see that on the screen?  That's my every day.\"  Well, that's where the artistic aspect of it all comes in.  The film presents the struggle that we all know too well in absurd, darkly humorous ways that just might give you a fresh perspective on parenting and on yourself.  And I think anyone would go a little bit easier on themselves (and their partner, should they have one) after viewing *Nightbitch*.",

        "content": "I grew up thinking the wife in Pursuit of Happiness was a bitch but as an adult, I completely understand her. \n\nThe movie tells us at the very beginning they were doing decently enough as a middle class/working class family *until* Chris invested their entire life savings into a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device whose concept and price tag would have been immediately bullshit to any sensible person. A man as intelligent as the movie sells Chris to be, would have to be extremely arrogant in order to pursue it. \n\nImagine you have a small child and your husband throws everything away on a delusional business idea. That alone alone would be justifiable enough for a divorce but to make matters worse, he refused to count his losses and get a real job to help support their family. She worked countless hours and seemed to do the brunt of the child care while he wasted all day and night trying to sell those machines. When he gives her last minute calls to tell her she\u2019ll have to pick up their son, he is almost sociopathic in his annoyance when she complains about how it effects her job or that she won\u2019t have any break. When she is finally at her wits end from the stress and desperation of their situation, he tells her that he wants to take a low paying internship to be a stockbroker. His wife and child were a breath away from starving on the streets while he jumps from one outlandish dream to the next. She was right to cut her losses at the moment. \n\nHer only failure was not fighting harder to keep custody of their son since she seemed to have slightly better financial stability and job security. She should not have let Christ guilt and bully her into believing their son was better off with him. Chris loved his son but a person who would selfishly allow their child to be homeless on the street so he could keep a low paying internship instead of getting a decent paying job has no right to keep custody of that child. Chris could have still been an active parent by visiting him instead of forcing his son to live that way. \n\nThe only reason why it\u2019s heartwarming is because he got the job in the end instead of he and his son being shanked one random night while living in public bathrooms. The reward doesn\u2019t justify the risk he took with his son\u2019s safety just so he could be a father. ",

        "content": "We see that in Back to the Future Part II (1989), that old Biff Tannen steals the time machine and uses it to go back to 1955 and give the Sports Almanac to his younger self, introducing a new much darker timeline that significantly changes world history. The world presented to us in this alternate timeline could even be described as dystopian, which isn't surprising given the easter eggs we see in the film. We find out that in this timeline, the Vietnam War continues deep into the 1980s, and Richard Nixon isn't exposed in the Watergate Scandal (likely do to Biff who probably is friends with Nixon in this timeline), meaning Nixon abolishes that two term limit and continues to be president by 1985 (ala Watchmen).\n\nIn the Escape From movies including Escape from New York (1981) and Escape from L.A (1996), we know that America seemingly goes right down the crapper for reasons never fully explained to us. We know that in 1988, the crime rate in the US has risen by a whopping 400%, in the midst of what can only be described as World War III. In this timeline, the Soviet Union continues to be a dominant world power and forms a powerful alliance with China against the west. We know this has escalated into a full war, since it's mentioned that Snake Plissken flew in Leningrad, which is obviously enemy territory, and Hauk even mentions that they're at war. For reasons unknown, this war doesn't go nuclear, but maybe they signed some type of mutual agreement, who knows.\n\nEither way, we never find out why in the Escape From universe, these historical events are so drastically different to our own. Why does tension between the US and the Soviet Union escalate to the point of war by the late 80s? I think if we apply the Back to the Future II timeline, it suddenly makes a lot of sense. In a timeline where Biff attains wealth and power, he befriends President Nixon (a man who we know deliberately sabotaged the war effort in order to get elected), and uses his wealth to keep Nixon's scandals hidden from the public, maybe with the idea that Biff himself will run for President one day. We also know as mentioned earlier that because of this alliance, the war in Vietnam doesn't end in 1975, but rages on a decade longer. It's not too hard to believe that these events would cause a timeline where the Soviets more directly begin warring with America. Clearly, peace cannot occur in a timeline where Biff and Nixon are controlling America.\n\nAnother thing, is that Escape From New York shows crime rates have risen by 400% in the US. In BTTF2, we see that crime rates have clearly risen. Biff has bought out the police department and clearly little to no criminals are actually being arrested, likely the only people being arrested are Biff's business or political opponents. I mean we see that things like drive-by shootings happen on a regular basis and fucking TANKS are just rolling down the street, almost like Hill Valley has become a war zone. It's not hard to think that THIS is where the crime rates rise by 400%, because of Biff and Nixon corrupting America beyond recognition.\n\nWhy then, you might be wondering, do we not see or hear about Biff in either of the Escape From movies? Simple: he's dead. It was revealed at some point that eventually the abused and practically enslaved Lorraine, sees no way out of her situation than to simply kill Biff, which she does by shooting him in 1996, shortly after she discovered his involvement in George McFly's murder. Escape From New York takes place in 1997, meaning Nixon and Biff would both be dead, Nixon in 1994 and Biff in 1996. The world we see in the Escape From movies, is a world permanently damaged by their combined power. America may have a new President by 1997, but it doesn't matter, the damage has been done, and the new President was shown to be a fairly artificial person by film's end anyway, meaning America is far from the road to recovery.\n\nAnother interesting detail to note is that Buck Flowers was in both Escape from New York and Back to the Future. In one he plays an inmate who Snake initially believes is the kidnapped POTUS but turns out to be a drunken prisoner. In BTTF he plays the former Mayor of Hill Valley: Red Thomas, and eventually becomes Red the Bum by the 80s. What if Biff sent Red to the New York prison due to vagrancy outside his Tower, or plain old wanting to get rid of old politicians? Maybe in this alternate timeline, Red attempts to run for Mayor again and actually gains popularity due to being more of a representation of the common American that the Nixon-Tannen Administration neglect. So, they conspire to have him arrested and sent to the New York prison. Maybe that's why he thinks he's the President in Escape From New York. He's recalling his days as Mayor.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the newspaper reporting George's murder mentioned the Indian Wounded Knee Occupation of 1973. While that is period accurate, it could also tie into Escape From New York, since the World Trade Center is actually occupied by Native American criminals. Maybe in this timeline, the Wounded Knee Occupation went on longer because of Biff having the President's ear, resulting in Natives continuing to protest against the US government, and eventually ending in many Natives being arrested and sent to New York. There they take over one of America's greatest symbols as a further sign of protest. \n\nIn Escape From L.A, we even find out that an earthquake in 1998, completely separates Los Angeles from the rest of the continental United States. Hill Valley is in Caifornia, and President Uncle Ben mentions that LA held the most so-called sinners, and that the earthquake was God punishing the wicked. If LA isn't that far from Hill Valley, which is where this entire timeline revolved around, it's not surprising that LA would be equally if not more crime-ridden.\n\nIn short, in this timeline, Biff Tannen befriends Nixon, keeps him from becoming scandalized and allows the Vietnam war to rage on until at least 1988. War with the Soviet Union and China ensues, and crime rates rise by 400% due to the government's focus on their problems overseas, combined with general negligence. When Nixon and Biff die in 1994 and 96, a new President is elected who is also vain and because of Snake switching tapes at the end, peace is not made, and the war rages on, eventually leading to a tyrannical theocratic dictator of a President to take power, and leaving Earth with only one realistic route to peace: using the Sword of Damocles satellite to rid the world of it's power, and start the world over again with a clean slate.",

        "title": "The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan, one of my favorite films",
        "content": "*The Village*\u00a0by M. Night Shyamalan is one of my all-time favorite films. It\u2019s a film I feel is highly underrated and doesn\u2019t get enough credit for its depth and complexity. For me, it\u2019s a cinematic gem that dives into the human psyche, exploring how fear shapes societies and personal identities in a way that few films dare to.\n\nAt the heart of The Village is its exploration of fear\u2014not just the fear of the unknown or the creatures in the woods, but fear as a tool of manipulation.\u00a0&gt;!The Elders intentionally cultivate this fear to control and limit the villagers\u2019 lives.!&lt;\u00a0Fear isn\u2019t just an emotional response to a threat; it\u2019s a driving force in the village, shaping everything from their beliefs to their behavior. What makes this film so powerful is how it shows fear as both a societal construct and a personal experience. The fear instilled in the villagers dictates their choices, confines them to the \u201csafe\u201d world they know, and even affects those who perpetuate the fear. This dynamic reinforces the chilling truth that the fear we\u2019re taught to embrace can sometimes be more damaging than the very threats it\u2019s meant to protect us from.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the film is Ivy, the blind protagonist. At first, her blindness might seem like a disadvantage, but as the story unfolds, it becomes a symbol of strength and resilience. Ivy represents the idea that even when we are \u201cblind\u201d to the truth, we still have the ability to overcome obstacles.\u00a0&gt;!In fact, her blindness becomes an asset, allowing her to see past the lies the village has been built on. She\u2019s able to question what others blindly accept as truth, and in doing so, becomes the hero of the story.!&lt;\n\nWhat really stands out to me is the way the film builds up the fear of the monsters. Throughout the movie, we, like Ivy and the rest of the villagers, are terrified of these creatures. The idea of the monsters becomes so much scarier than the monsters themselves. The fear is what\u2019s truly terrifying, not the actual beings.\u00a0&gt;!The Elders have carefully crafted this fear to maintain control, and the film does a great job of showing how fear can be more powerful than reality itself. When we finally see the \u201cmonsters\u201d for what they really are, it\u2019s a revelation\u2014not just for Ivy, but for the audience. It\u2019s in this moment that we see how much the villagers have been lied to, and it\u2019s a powerful shift in perspective.!&lt;\n\nThere\u2019s so much more I could touch on, but these are just a few of the key reasons I believe The Village is a masterpiece. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s layered with symbolism, thoughtful commentary, and emotional depth.\n\nA few other things I love:\n\n* The muted colors throughout the film, which create a sense of isolation, and the use of\u00a0&gt;!red!&lt;\u00a0as a symbol of danger and warning.\n* The haunting score, especially the violin solos that not only enhance the emotional weight of the story but also promote a sense of silence that mirrors the isolation of the village.\n* &gt;!The fact that even when the truth is revealed, the villagers continue living in this world of fear. It\u2019s a stark commentary on how difficult it can be to break free from a reality that has been ingrained in us, even when the truth is fully understood.!&lt;\n\nIf you haven\u2019t watched\u00a0*The Village*\u00a0in a while, I highly recommend giving it another chance. It\u2019s a film that challenges you to think deeply about the nature of fear, control, and how we shape our own perceptions of the world around us.\n\n(This is my first post, so I\u2019m not sure if I used too many spoiler bars. Even though the film is over 20 years old, I wanted to ensure this review doesn\u2019t spoil anything for those who haven\u2019t yet had the chance to experience it.)",
