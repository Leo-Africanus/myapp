        "content": "Hey reddit, we're Michael Dougherty and Quinn Lord, director and lead actor from 2007's TRICK 'R TREAT. It's being re-released in theaters next week. Here to answer your questions.\n\n*More information:*\n\n**4K re-release trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-IlZeWpXs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-IlZeWpXs)\n\n**Tickets to see it in theaters:**\n\n[https://www.fathomentertainment.com/releases/trick-r-treat/](https://www.fathomentertainment.com/releases/trick-r-treat/)\n\n**More information:**\n\nMichael Dougherty is a writer, director, animator, and producer known for his work in a variety of genre films, both big and small. Beginning his career as an animator and illustrator, Dougherty's animated work was featured on MTV, Nickelodeon, and a line of twisted greeting cards published by NobleWorks. He then co-wrote the blockbusters X-Men 2 and Superman Returns before making his directorial debut with the classic horror comedy, Trick 'r Treat (2007), starring Anna Paquin, Dylan Baker, Quinn Lord, and Brian Cox. Trick 'r Treat has since become a perennial favorite that has spawned a growing line of toys, comics, theme park attractions, and Halloween decor, and a sequel is in development with Legendary Pictures. Dougherty later set his sights on Christmas, which resulted in Krampus (2015), a holiday horror comedy starring Toni Collette, Adam Scott, David Koechner, and Allison Tolman. Much like Trick 'r Treat, Krampus has become an annual holiday classic. Most recently, Dougherty co-wrote and directed the blockbuster Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) starring Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, and Ken Watanabe, and co-wrote the story for its sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), starring Brian Tyree Henry, Rebecca Hall, and Alexander Skaarsgaard. Collectively, Dougherty's work has grossed over 2 billion dollars at the box office.\n\nQuinn Lord was born on February 19, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He is an actor and producer, known for Imaginaerum (2012), The Man in the High Castle (2015) and Fringe (2008).\n\nWe'll be back later today (Wednesday 10/8) at 3 PM ET to answer your questions. Ask us anything!\n\n",

To the shock of many who knew her, detectives on the scene treated her death as a suicide until her autopsy results came back with the cause of death ruled a homicide.

        "content": "*Mankind encounters AI beings for the first time when a highly sophisticated programme, Ares, leaves the digital world for a dangerous mission in the real world.*\n\nDirector: Joachim R\u00f8nning\n\nCast: Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Jeff Bridges, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [54%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron_ares)\n\n**Metacritic:** [48 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tron-ares/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Next Best Picture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/tron-ares/) \\- 4 / 10\n\n&gt;\u201cTron: Ares,\u201d like many long-delayed legacy sequels, has long since crossed the threshold of necessity. It feels like a nostalgia-bait artifact designed purely to revive interest, a fact made even more evident by the inevitable sequel-baiting that will undoubtedly go nowhere. What\u2019s worse for a movie that hopes to celebrate the beauty of humanity is that its message is told through the perspective of an artificial intelligence, aided by an almost hilariously Sorkin-esque portrayal of a billionaire who believes he\u2019s making the world a better place. It\u2019s a fantasy that falls short of being as sensorily stunning as it needs to be. If anything, \u201cTron: Ares\u201d is less a film than a cinematic pin dropped in a franchise map that\u2019s going absolutely nowhere.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-evan-peters-1236394401/)\n\n&gt;*Tron: Ares* is a separate story rather than a direct sequel to *Legacy*, meaning Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde\u2019s characters are AWOL. It\u2019s also a marked upgrade from its predecessor, with more dynamic visuals and muscular action sequences. Only occasionally does an actor look like they are cowering from some green-screen threat (Lee more than others). More often, the stakes are elevated thanks to greater use of physical sets and in-camera effects than in previous installments.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-greta-lee-jeff-bridges/) \\- 1.5 / 5\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a cheekiness to the composers\u2019 deft incorporation of older styles into their present-day approach to soundtracks, but after a time even their cleverness exposes the film\u2019s hollowness. For a story that seeks to champion the unpredictability and finite quality of life, *Ares* ultimately feels trapped by the inertia of working within the parameters set by its no less flimsy predecessors.\n\n[AwardsWatch - Erik Anderson](https://awardswatch.com/tron-ares-review-what-kind-of-legacy-is-this-c/) \\- 'C+'\n\n&gt;But the problem isn\u2019t that *Tron: Ares* lacks any good ideas\u2014it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t know what to do with the stray threads it tugs at. By the back half, we\u2019re down to the most uninspired impulses of studio filmmaking, complete with a character who exists purely to spout non-joke wisecracks (Arturo Castro as Eve\u2019s friend Seth) and a climax that visually resembles every Marvel movie featuring some giant piece of floating machinery threatening the streets of New York. *Tron* will always have its dazzling baubles to ooh and aah at, but at the end of the day, *Ares* feels much like the AI tech companies keep insisting on shoving down our throats: technically impressive, but also frivolous and empty.\n\n[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/tron-ares/) \\- 3 / 5\n\n&gt;It has about as much depth as a floppy disk, but some lovely, shiny CGI and a stunningly ear-shattering score from Nine Inch Nails makes for a fun if forgettable bit of futuristic fluff. Bio-digital jazz, man!\n\n[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/tron-ares-review) \\- 'B-'\n\n&gt;Or maybe the early-2000s vibes of *Tron: Ares* really are that powerful, bending time to pluck a semi-canceled leading man from his prime. Certainly the movie\u2019s ideas about A.I. (which it variously conflates with video game avatars, 3-D printing, and old-fashioned robots) don\u2019t feel especially informed by anything happening in 2025. In the world of this movie, we\u2019re still dawning on a potential new age of information revolution, or whatever, and the coming hybridized life is what we make of it, off-grid or on. And in the context of our world, that\u2019s enough for *Tron: Ares* to work as escapism. The result is a pretty dumb movie with beautiful visual effects, cleanly shot action, and a kickass soundtrack. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the future of blockbusters was only this bleak?",

        "content": "And Samantha Morton wasn't meant to be some sort of a place-holder either. She was the first choice. It was only when Spike Jonze started editing that he \"felt that something wasn't right\". Although ofc the cynic in me says that Scarlett Johansson was used just because she's very famous and the movie gets more attention (like they wrapped filming and maybe got extra funding or something).

The plot is as relevant today as it was 30+ years ago which goes to show how forward thinking the writers were. Data is the main goal, not money or gold.\n\nThe cast play together like honey. There's not a moment wasted and I dare say without this movie, then there would be no Mission Impossible movie. Most of the breach points in MI are blatently copied or influenced by this film. \n\nI love it and it's not nearly appreciated enough.",
