My wife was killed by a drunk driver and  David losing his wife was so intense. I got the call to get to the hospital and the movie brought that back. When he went home I felt every scene he acted out. Simple things like going through a sock drawer had a whole new meaning at that time My wife and  were soulmates. There is no way to describe it. She was my everything. When I was watching her die and only the machines were keeping her alive I kept looking at the clock. How long do I have to sit  and watch her die. They did nothing because she had a Basel Skull fracture. They just kept wrapping bandages around her head and the blood would soak through. Finally they said they cant use any of her parts for donation because they were all contaminated. She was riding her bike and was hit from behind. They found her in the road because the driver took off. We don't even no how long she was laying there. I remember the scene when he left the hospital. My wife is dead and now I go home. I miss her so much. [https://fb.watch/xOsdFMpCe0/](https://fb.watch/xOsdFMpCe0/)",

This alone is hilarious, but he continues to sell the joke by wearing it tied around his neck\u2014reinforcing his excitement. \n\nIt's just a perfect amount of absurdity and so relatable emotionally that humanizes the hell out of this otherwise 1 dimensional character.\u2014like \"this guy runs a pretty happy gang!\". I can't help but laugh thinking about it. \n\nMy other favorite line is from The Life Aquatic -\n \n&gt; **Steve**\n&gt; \n&gt; So, what do you do?\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ned**\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm a pilot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Air Kentucky.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Steve**\n&gt; \n&gt; Air Kentucky.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Ned**\n&gt; \n&gt; Copilot, actually.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Steve**\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah.

Including a few not on the list. Very much appreciated. I'm going to watch Irreversible tonight and I have a few others ready to watch. I won't be watching A Serbian Film because it sounds like I don't need that in my life haha. Thanks all.\n\nand apologies to those I've exposed to movie related trauma\n\nEdit 2: I just watched Irreversible (Spoilers ahead naturally). Honestly I thought that it was a very good film which is possibly cheapened(?) by it's reputation as a 'controversial' or 'shock' film. I actually had heard of it before in the context of a film that was designed to make you sick and the horror of the rape scene.\n\nYes the rape scene is ROUGH. I left out a long deep sigh after to release the tension and man is it painfully long... but in my opinion it is entirely integral to the point of the film. I felt that showing the film in reverse order was ingenious in that it shows us that the victim is nothing that the rapist attributes to her in his rage, which (in his mind) justifies his violence. It provides the context of this persons life before this horrific act and humanises her, after the fact which I felt was actually far more poignant.\n\nIf we had seen the film in the chronological order we would have been left feeling the anger and satisfaction of revenge and would have forgotten about the women and what she has lost. In my opinion this is the main message of the story.\n\nFinally there was an interesting dynamic between three types of men we get introduced to in the film. One, her ex boyfriend is loving but too \"cerebral\" to quote the main character. The rapist which is full of rage and self pleasure and her boyfriend which is a balance between the two. I haven't taken the time to think about the significance of this yet but I feel it's also an important part of the film.\n\nIf I had one problem with the backwards order of the film it's that I would have taken extreme pleasure in seeing that fucker get his head smashed in if I had had the context at the time (Which I just realised is the wrong fucking fella... God damn there is no justice in this movie). Maybe that was part of the point too...\n\nAnyway thanks a lot! I feel I probably watched the best one first lol. Any more suggestions of a similar quality of narrative please comment and let me know!\n\nAlso the shakey camera does calm down after a while thank fuck",

Lol.\n\nFor real though, Paddington 2 is not only one of the best sequels of all time, but also one of the best films of all time (period) and now tied with Spider-verse as my favorite movie of 2018, and I mean it. \n\nPaul Kings directing and writing is top notch as always, being able to balance multiple tons while still making you feel warm and fuzzy instead, the characters are still beautifully and wonderfully written and very charming and likable, especially Paddington, his earnestness, honesty, and hopefully optimism shines through ten fold here, and while it has a lot of funny moments, the emotional/dramatic moments of the film land hard, like seriously, the ending had me crying.\n\nNot much else to say (that hasn't been already said) other then, i can't wait to see Paddington 3, and Hugh Grant and Brenden Gleeson are easily the best parts of the movie.",

It's not even so Bond has one more henchman to kill he just chills in a blimp for the finale. \nThe villain whose mother was experimented on in a concentration camp, she was given steroids, and stay with me now, so he is super smart but is also a psychopath due to the steroids. This is what I want from Bond villains, by the way, just pure goofiness. \n\nThis is one that I somehow had never seen, despite me watching these a lot when I was younger, this one I never saw. I can't even say it was because the tv wouldn't show it because I watched it on the player. \n\nI'm going to give view to kill, six horse steroids out of seven monocles, or basically 6 out of 10. ",

He looked like Johnny Depp. He definitely had that young stud image that Hollywood gagged for in the 90s but that didn't seem to work for him long run. And he could certainly act. \n\nDid Leonardo Dicaprio overshadow him back in the day?",

        "content": "Hi r/movies,\n\nI'm looking for films where the protagonist uncovers crucial information through research, not just through investigative work, but specifically because structured or organized information enables the discovery. Think archives, indexes, databases, classified records, or any system where the way information is stored plays a key role in solving the mystery or exposing the truth.\n\nA great example is *Spotlight*, where journalists rely on old diocese directories and newspaper archives to identify patterns in clergy assignments. Similarly, *All the President\u2019s Men* hinges on tracking connections through public records. I\u2019m also thinking of *Zodiac*, where characters analyze police reports and historical newspaper clippings to trace the killer\u2019s communications.\n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in films that highlight the power of organized information\u2014whether it\u2019s through libraries, government records, scientific databases, or any structured system that enables discovery. I\u2019d love to find more examples that showcase the importance of librarianship, archives, and information organization in uncovering the truth.\n\nWhat are your favorite movies where structured information plays a crucial role?",

        "content": "There are many great shots in this movie, a variety of spectacles both big and small. Those interstitial establishing shots of the American base are perfectly lit. Very showy, nicely dramatic. Particularly at night. But even the modest/unassuming shots, like that cozy image of the two watching the VHS tape and passing around a joint, have staying power. \n\nWhy the shot of the dog? I feel like to describe it would be to reduce it somehow. It just works on a visceral level. If I was pressed to explain, I guess I'd ramble about the unnerving stillness of the dog. And, just as unnerving, the steadiness of his observation. He's watching the returning crew with keen interest. He's sizing up his new circumstances. To what extent has he been \"found out\"? It's not that dogs aren't capable of close observation or calculation. But because of the context of the story, the viewer imagines an extraterrestrial intelligence at work behind the dog's eyes. \n\nCarpenter could have easily made the dog's villainy feel cartoonish, but instead he creates the vibe through a few decisive images, the best of which is this very alien (and alienating, for the viewer) moment of observation.",

The music is fire, and characters are lovely (I love Logan Lerman as Charlie!)\n\nI first watched it when it was in a really bad state, when it seemed like I was alone and it would never get better. I really got into not only the main character, but also the secondary ones (played by Emma Watson and Erza Miller). Each with their own interests, and you can get into all of them. The musical arrangement is an incredible pleasure!\n\nDo you have your favourite coming-of-age drama movie, which means so much for you?\n",

The movie can be made back then or it can be new, doesn't really matter much. \nBut I want there to be songs from the 90s or 00s that we remember and that makes you feel nostalgic. \n\nPreferably something light hearted, like a romcom/chick flick, but I'm open to all suggestions. And by \"good movie\" I don't mean it has to be Oscar worthy, it can be a cheesy feelgood movie that is mostly good because of nostalgia.\n\nBoth in the mood for some 00s pop punk songs (you know good charlotte, sum 41, blink etc) and some more poppy feelgood songs like idk Natasha Bedingfield, Britney, Backstreet boys. So basically anything you'd find in a playlist for the ultimate 90s/00s. Thank youuuuu ",
