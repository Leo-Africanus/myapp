More dumb jokes. \n\nIMO they really did an amazing job bringing back the vibe of the originals. So freaking refreshing. \n\nLeslie Nielsen fucking crushed that role. \n\nLiam Neeson also crushed it.

The stunt guys are always wearing big wigs, hats, beanies, or layered clothing to hide the protective pads their wearing. It's nuts. The fight choreography is gorgeous in this, Tony Jaa's movement is so fluid and rhythmic, he really brought out the beauty of Muay Thai.\n\n\nThe story is also pretty decent, the simple story of a country bumpkin having to team up with a scummy city slicker to return hope back to their village is pretty cute.\n\n\nI think it's a tie for me between the fight club battles and the final fight for the best fight scene in the movie",

        "title": "All these years later, The Vast Of Night just gets better.",
        "content": "Just rewatched this movie tonight in my backyard on a projector and am once again blown away by it. I have seen everything. I don't rewatch movies often. This little film always hooks me without fail.\n\nThe first scene when we follow Everett through the gymnasium, you instantly fall in love with him. He's magnetic thanks to the performance by Jake Horowitz, who screen presence is immediately likeable and natural, he sort of reminds me of RDJ with his ability to not just create chemistry with the other actors but with the audience, almost leaping out of the screen at you. This guy could win Oscars someday. The writing is also so complex and funny, lots of talking over each other between characters but never too chaotic. The old turns of phrase like \"I'll be at the water of you\" or \"He's a nowhere man, a real pale one. You don't want to waste time talking to that tomb stone.\" Or my favorite \"Cut the gas cube, you were a mile wide!\" Are all classics and so well delivered. Right off the bat you are leaning in, you aren't even thinking about aliens, you just want to watch Everett and Faye wander this perfectly realized 1950's town and vibe.\n\nThe film is also like an ASMR stim with its eerie score and the characters fiddling around with the 50's technology. Faye's scene as she listens to the radio and answers calls is so damn hypnotic you don't even realize it is a single unbroken shot for something like 8 or 9 minutes. This movie is impressive, but so immersive you aren't really distracted by all of the next level filmmaking happening. When the movie starts to get spooky it delivers chill inducing moments with its combination of sounds score and visuals on such a high level, you'd think it cost millions to make, but was made for under a million. This is like if Modern Fincher directed an early Spielberg film.\n\nThe tracking shot taking us from the phone operating station, through the gymnasium and then to Everett at the radio station is magnificent and should be studied in film courses. Its an unbelievable achievement. Every time I show this movie to someone, even if they aren't a geek like me, they make some kind of comment about how cool it is. This is the kind of film that asks for you patience but you don't mind giving it. It's stimulating because it's so convincing. Even when there are fx shots later in the film, it's sense of reality is never broken. The fact this film has you sit through two monologues with light to no visual activity, and that those may be the two most captivating scenes in the film shows you how high of a level Andrew Patterson is working at. These two scenes are chill inducing.\n\nThe ending haunts me. I noticed on this watch that everything was burned where the aliens arrived and that there were ashes left behind when the characters disappear, leading me to think we are meant to wonder whether they were abducted or vaporized. \n\nThe Vast of Night is, in my opinion, the greatest alien film ever made. As a debut it's alongside Boogie Nights, Reservoir Dogs, and Jaws. I can't stop thinking about it. It's rhythm is in a class of its own.Andrew Patterson is some kind of Unicorn in the filmmaking world. His directorial voice is so fully formed, his writing is like listening to a book come to life, yet we know nothing about him as if he is intentionally avoiding the limelight. The film is head and shoulders above any film released that year, and I'm still upset it didn't get any awards recognition. I would have put it up for Best Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Editing, Score, and Picture and it would not have been close in some of those categories. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves as years pass on.\nEvery time I show it someone I get to watch them fall in love with it the way I did. Few films are this special. Even though it's a simple premise, it does the absolute most with it.\n\nI may just watch it again this week. I would highly recommend watching it on a projector out doors, it just feels right.\nAnybody else love this film? Got a favorite scene? Or how about any recommendations for hidden gems that punch way above their weight? ",

As a teen, I plastered my walls with music posters by\u00a0Frank Kozik\u00a0and\u00a0Coop. In college, I tumbled into a lifelong love affair with movie posters from around the world. \n\nI have a special love for hand-painted posters, as well as foreign posters for Hollywood films. Ghanaian movie posters, which you can\u00a0[see and read about here](https://alexrollinsberg.substack.com/p/untamed-art-the-glorious-madness), tick both of these boxes. \n\nWhat are your favorite movie posters?\n\nA quick history of these Ghanaian movie posters: The rise of home video brought movies to the most remote corners of western Africa. Mobile cinema operators crisscrossed the countryside, screening films in churches, homes, and open-air markets. To draw crowds, they needed eye-catching advertisements. But there was a problem: Ghana\u2019s military government forbade the import of printing presses. So the mobile cinema operators turned to local artists, most of them self-taught sign painters.\n\nSome had not yet seen the movies, while others had a selective regard for the characters and plots - adding guns, gore, and other salacious embellishments to lure audiences. Using recycled flour sacks as canvases and a mix of house and oil paints, they unleashed their eye-popping visions.\n\nWith the rise of the internet, cinema clubs faded away, and so too did the demand for hand-painted Ghanaian movie posters. Or so it seemed.\n\n5,700 miles away in Chicago, Brian Chankin was running a tiny underground video store when a friend handed him a book called\u00a0[*Ghanavision*](https://amzn.to/4ipviMF), a tribute to the obscure art form. He was mesmerized. Chankin started collecting the posters and hanging them in his shop. Customers clambered to buy them. As demand grew, Chankin decided to track down the artists. This was the dawn of his Chicago-based gallery, Deadly Prey, which has elevated local African poster artists to global sensations. ",

        "content": "There are quite a few upcoming young actresses under 25 that have done good work and show a lot of promise for having a long great and successful career.  Which of them do you think will end up flourishing into the future A list actresses with a great trajectory, accolades and filmography?\n\nHere is a list of some of the most popular ones along with their age for reference:\n\n* Milly Alcock (25)\n* Sophie Thatcher (24)\n* Rachel Zegler (24)\n* Isabela Merced (24)\n* Thomasin McKenzie (24)\n* Sadie Sink (23)\n* Sophia Lillis (23)\n* Jenna Ortega (22)\n* Millie Bobby Brown (21)\n\nPersonally I think out of this group Sadie Sink will end up having a great and lasting career and will end up being part of the new generation of A listers. She has already shown her range and acting shoes in several projects like The Whale and Stranger Things,  is very charismatic and likeable and looks to be easy to work with.\n\nHow about you? Which one do you think will end up having the best career?",
