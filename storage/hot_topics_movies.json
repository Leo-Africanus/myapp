        "title": "December 26-28 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' crosses $760M worldwide on its second weekend. 'Marty Supreme' opens with a great $27M on its first four days, A24's second best ever debut. 'Anaconda' and 'Song Sung Blue' open solidly with $23.6M and $12.4M, respectively.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wygzklyid6ag1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b048a1a740aec7190835df598197ffeee82c7a\n\n2025 came to an end with a very lucrative post-Christmas weekend.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** easily held the top spot for a second weekend, while holdovers had a very strong weekend. The biggest newcomer was A24's ***Marty Supreme***, which over-performed projections and posted the studio's second biggest ever debut. ***Anaconda*** and ***Song Sung Blue*** followed suit, as both had solid debuts as well.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $170.6 million this weekend. That's up 7.1% from last year, when ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** repeated at #1.\n\nEasily holding on to #1, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added $64 million this weekend. That represents a very light 28.2% drop, which is better than ***The Way of Water*** (52.8%). But that's not a great comp; ***The Way of Water*** didn't have Christmas Day till its second Sunday, while ***Fire and Ash*** is already in the post-Christmas slot.\n\nThrough 10 days, ***Fire and Ash*** has cleared $217.6 million domestically. It's currently $44 million behind ***The Way of Water*** through the same point. Given that that film was barely starting its Christmas run, that gap will continue to widen. For instance, its third weekend was slightly higher than its second weekend, and it's unlikely ***Fire and Ash*** can replicate that. Right now, ***Fire and Ash*** should reach $500 million domestically.\n\nOf all holdovers, ***Zootopia 2*** benefitted the most. It jumped 34.7% for a $20 million weekend. That's higher than ***Moana 2***'s fifth weekend jump. The film has amassed $321 million, and it could surpass the original's domestic gross as early as next week.\n\nA24's ***Marty Supreme*** expanded to 2,668 theaters and grossed a great $17.7 million ($27 million four-day). This is A24's second biggest ever debut, behind ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million). The debut is also higher than Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's previous Christmas title, ***A Complete Unknown*** ($11.6 million).\n\nConsidering this is A24's most expensive title ($60-$70 million), this is a pretty great start. There was the challenge of winning over audiences with a ping-pong sports drama; sports films are often successful, but there aren't many ping-pong films. What helped is that A24 did a fantastic job with marketing, selling the film as more than just a sports film, instead showcasing it as a \"quest to be the greatest to ever exist.\"\n\nBut the real credit has to be Chalamet. A very popular star, this was his biggest gamble so far. ***Dune*** and ***Wonka*** were IP films, and ***A Complete Unknown*** was a Bob Dylan biopic. ***Marty Supreme*** is a completely original film, sold entirely on him. And as you can see, it worked; 50% of the audience reportedly watched the film because of Chalamet. The cherry on top was the universal acclaim it garnered: 95% on RT, and 88 on Metacritic are some of the year's best reviews.\n\nAccording to A24, 57% of the audience was male, and 63% was 25 and over. Highly popular with Gen Z: 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is fine for an adult drama. It's A24's second best grade. With huge Oscar buzz on the horizon and with a weak January ahead, ***Marty Supreme*** should enjoy some great legs. Don't be surprised if it can reach $80 million domestically. If it gets there, it'll become A24's highest grossing film.\n\n***The Housemaid*** dipped just 19% on its second weekend, earning $15.4 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $46.4 million, and there's a strong possibility that it could reach $100 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, Sony's ***Anaconda*** debuted with $14.5 million ($23.6 million four-day) in 3,509 theaters. This is below the 1997 film's debut ($16.6 million) and slightly ahead of ***The Hunt for the Blood Orchid*** ($12.6 million). Adjusted for inflation, the new version sold less tickets than either film.\n\nGiven its low $45 million budget, this is a very good debut. Especially given the film's bizarre premise: two friends who grew up with the original ***Anaconda*** and proceeding to reboot it, only to be chased by a real anaconda. It's one thing to reboot a horror film, but it's very different to retool it as a comedy (even if the original 1997 is a hilarious film by itself). \n\nTo give it a chance to succeed, Sony gave it the prime Christmas date, and got two comedy names in Jack Black and Paul Rudd to lead the film. Turns out all audiences needed was \"Jack Black and Paul Rudd getting chased by a large snake.\" Reviews were mixed (51% on RT), but those were actually the best in the franchise. By this point, you pretty much know what you're gonna get with this. I mean, the trailer used Sir Mix-A-Lot's chorus to \"Baby Got Back\".\n\nAccording to Sony, 53% of the audience was male. They gave it a \"B\" on CinemaScore, a so-so grade for a comedy, but better than the original's \"B\u2013\". It should hold well over the coming weeks; right now, ***Anaconda*** should reach $70 million domestically. Not a bad performance for a horror comedy.\n\nAngel Studios' ***David*** dipped 42.5%, adding $12.5 million. That's quite a rough drop, considering the great word of mouth and Christmas corridor. But it seems like the film's audience was more limited than anticipated. Through 10 days, it has made $49.5 million, and it looks like it will finish with a little below $100 million.\n\nIn seventh place, ***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** eased 28.3%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. Through 10 days, it has amassed $38.1 million, and will probably end its run with a little above $70 million domestically.\n\nIn eighth place, Focus Features' ***Song Sung Blue*** debuted with $7.6 million ($12 million four-day) in 2,578 theaters. The debut is below last year's other music drama ***A Complete Unknown***, although that had a more iconic figure than in ***Song Sung Blue***.\n\nIt's hard to ask for much better numbers. The film's selling point is Neil Diamond's music, but it's not a Diamond biopic. Instead, it follows Mike and Claire Sardina, who performed as the Neil Diamond tribute band Lightning &amp; Thunder. Getting known names like Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson is a plus, but it's still a limited audience. At the very least, the positive reviews (75% on RT) helped attract audiences over the past days.\n\nAccording to Focus Features, 61% of the audience was female, and a massive 94% was 25 and over. It skewed old, with 48% of the audience 55 and over. They gave it a great \"A\" on CinemaScore, suggesting strong word of mouth. Right now, look for ***Song Sung Blue*** to finish with around $35 million.\n\nAfter its very weak drops, ***Wicked: For Good*** got some help from the holidays. It jumped 8.2% for a $5.2 million weekend. That takes its domestic total to $331.6 million.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** with $4.4 million. It dipped 42.5%, tying for the steepest drop in the Top 10, indicating that it won't benefit much from the holidays. The film's domestic total stands at $118.9 million, and it looks like the film will tap out with less than $130 million.\n\nNeon released Park Chan-wook's new film ***No Other Choice*** on Christmas Day in 13 theaters. It earned $312,687 ($625,656 four-day), which translates to a solid $24,053 per-theater average. With some awards buzz and critical acclaim on its side, the film will continue expanding in the next few weeks.\n\nSearchlight expanded Bradley Cooper's ***Is This Thing On?*** to 33 theaters, earning $203,000. It will continue playing in limited release before a wide expansion in mid January.\n\nSpeaking of Searchlight, they also launched the buzzy title ***The Testament of Ann Lee*** in 4 theaters. It earned a modest $71,000 ($111,000 four-day), which is a middling $17,750 per-theater average. The film will continue expanding, but given its poor performance in many awards circles (and also missing practically all of the announced Oscar shortlist categories), it seems like it will struggle to reach audiences.\n\nMUBI also released Jim Jarmusch's new film ***Father Mother Sister Brother*** in 4 theaters, earning $48,395 ($94,971 five-day) for a weak $12,099 per-theater average.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added a strong $181.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $760.4 million after two weeks. It could reach the billion mark as early as next week. The best markets are China ($99.6M), France ($54.4M), Germany ($43.1M), Korea ($32.1M) and the UK ($27.7M). Based on its holds, it should reach $1.7 billion by the end of its run.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** is not done with its run. It added $67.9 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $1.420 billion. There's two big stories here: it broke the $1 billion mark overseas, the first Hollywood title to break it this year. But perhaps the most insane record: in China (where it has earned a colossal $561 million), the film crossed 100 million tickets. It's the first Hollywood title to reach 100 million tickets in a single country since ***Titanic***. The best markets are China ($561.1M), France ($55.9M), Japan ($52.2M), Korea ($49.1M) and Germany ($34M). Given that it still has a lot of gas left, this might reach $1.7 billion worldwide.\n\n***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** began its international run with a good $22.1 million, taking its worldwide total to $60.2 million. Its best debuts were in the UK ($3.9M), Mexico ($2.7M), Germany ($2.6M), France ($1.8M) and Israel ($1.7M). Given that it still has some markets left and very little competition, this film should be set for a solid run through January.\n\n***Anaconda*** debuted with $20 million overseas, for a $43.6 million worldwide debut. Its best debuts were in Australia ($2.4M), Mexico ($2.1M), the UK ($1.7M), Germany ($1.2M) and Brazil ($1M). This is easily hitting $100 million worldwide, and could get to up to $170 million.\n\n***The Housemaid*** also started its international run with a pretty good $18.5 million, taking its worldwide total to $64.9 million.\n\nWith $4.3 million overseas, ***Wicked: For Good*** has finally crossed $500 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**ANNOUNCEMENT**\n\nThis was posted earlier than usual because Actuals could be delayed due to the holidays. Even then, the difference is very minimal. Next week, it'll return to the usual Weekend Actuals.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Occurred to me the other night when my wife and I were talking about the first album we ever bought as kids. I laughingly admitted mine were Kriss Kross and Ace of Base. She had a good laugh, and tried to remember the lyrics to \"Jump Jump.\" I tried to remind her by bringing it up on Spotify and she emphatically stopped me (No! Please no! I don't need that song stuck in my head all week!). So I joked I was going to secretly make it her alarm clock music. It then reminded of the gag from Groundhog day and got me thinking that \"Jump Jump\" would actually be an older song to someone now than \"I Got You Babe\" was to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. And then it reminded me of the cruel march of time... But I digress...\n\nIf Groundhog Day were remade today (please don't Mr Hollywood producer person), what song would our protagonist be waking up to every morning?\n\nEdit Edit: Lotsa folks getting hung up on the exact year difference. Not too concerned about the exact year difference. Just a similarly old song for today would work.\n\nEdit: Some of my favorites listed so far:\n\nSpice Girls - Wannabe. Just opening every day with \"Yoooooo I'll tell ya what I want!\" would be hilarious\n\nSmash Mouth - All Star. Ditto: \"SOoooommmeBODY Once told me...\"\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Today. How poetic\n\nChumbawumba - Tubthumping\n\nLen - Steal My Sunshine\n\nWho Let The Dogs Out\n\nBittersweet Symphony\n\nGreen Day - Basketcase\n\nSheryl Crow - Every Day Is A Winding Road\n\nBare Naked Ladies - One Week. Starting every day with \"YIIIIITsss beeeen ONE WEEK!\"\n\nCher - Believe. Nice reference to the original.\n\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go One. Fits the sappiness and relevance of I Got You Babe.\n\n4 Non Blondes - What's Up.\n\nCardigans - Love Fool\n\nRembrants - I'll Be There For You.",

        "content": "As the saying goes, the past is a foreign country, and as such movies from the past can also seem like a foreign country. Movies usually try to reflect the reality of the time they're made in, but something that seemed normal in the past can seem unbelievable to modern audiences even if they're aware of the historical context.\n\nFor example, I recently rewatched White Christmas, and the song [\"What can you do with a General\"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0rRe9gmFC4&amp;list=RDD0rRe9gmFC4&amp;start_radio=1) and the whole plot point about the retired general always seemed strange to me. The premise is that normal soldiers returning from WWII had better employment prospects than retired generals, with the general now running a failing inn while all of his former subordinates are doing very well. In modern times, this seems completely alien. Nowadays enlisted persons have a much harder time finding a decent job or even any job at all after their military service, especially if they lack a proper education/useful transferable skills or they have health problems, while high-ranking officers have a very easy time getting a good job thanks to their education and connections. I am frankly not even sure if the whole thing about retired WWII generals having a hard time finding a job was true, but it is definitely true that WWII veterans had a much easier time after their service than soldiers in later wars.\n\nAnd on that note, pretty much any old movie where a father with his own income in a job that isn't even that prestigious can provide for a whole family with a nice house that he owns. This is now a fantasy to anyone thinking of starting a family.\n\nSo what other then contemporary historical realities depicted in movies seem strange now?",

A smaller group fleeing to complete the mission themselves. Hiding from a corrupt and oppressive government. Navigating an active war zone in some of the final scenes.\n\nI still enjoy the rest of the movies but Cuar\u00f3n would have been better suited and produced something amazing rather than serviceable.\n\nIt could have been like Paddington 2 - genuinely great filmmaking from a genre you wouldn't expect.",

        "content": "Snyder is talented... but it's very domain based talent and storytelling/taste are not his strengths. So him seeing himself as an epic auteur hasn't worked out well.\n\nAs a pulp stylist he really delivered - with strong and exploitative material that played to his strengths - in Dawn of the Dead and 300 where I think most directors would flounder. And nothing about his narrative and thematic flounders of the past 16 years suggest he's lost *this* aspect of his flair - he's still an incredible stylist.\n\nHe's a 21st century Frank Fazetta - but in time. He's also about as much of a storyteller. If he embraces that rather than trying to deconstruct and reconstruct epics with full creative control, he could turn into one of the all time great pulp directors. Like, if he had directed PRIMITIVE WAR, that would have been rad. Or imagine a Zack Snyder COCAINE BEAR. Or VFW. They'd be unreal.\n\nI think this is why he's so divisive - his fans cannot see why people don't get no other director can deliver in the ways he can on an unimaginably large scale (Nolan and Cameron, as directors, also see and are in awe of this talent), and his detractors cannot get past his appalling instincts with story and theme while tackling thematically and narratively ambitious material.\n\nIf Snyder spent the rest of his career doing stuff like Joe Carnahan scripts instead of trying to become the next Lucas/Nolan, he would absolutely kill it. Cheap high concept exploitation Snyder would carve out an unimpeachable niche all of his own.",

Also, it has what is probably my favourite scene in a movie that I've seen in a long time (the loud music one).\n\nAnd other than the craft level, the actual plot of the movie was also really good!! I loved the weird way this movie simultaneously critiques capitalism and the actions of the narrator (everybody keeps on saying that they have no other choice, even though the movie (cleverly, comedically) often points out that they do have at least *some* semblance of choice,\n\nThere's so much more I could gush about with this movie (the acting, the ending montage, the whole dynamic between the MC and his strangely supportive wife, the cello playing, the humor, but wow--super reccommend this movie!

The movie explores death, corruption, existential crisis that people have and the identity with the *\"no man can walk out of his own story\"*.\n\nSo my question is, are there any movies liken Rango? I mean, animated movies that have great character developement and have sensitive topics (such as death and the existential crisis that Ran go has) that are talked about in a great way and has some black humour jokes that make it enjoyable for adults?

        "title": "Those who watched Home Alone for the millionth time this holiday: What did you discover and/or appreciate anew during your latest viewing?",
        "content": "There\u2019s a brief shot where Kevin, having evaded the police after inadvertently stealing a toothbrush, crosses a bridge. Meanwhile, a train passes by underneath. The winter atmosphere here is precise, credible, bordering on the straightforwardness of B-roll documentary footage. (\u201cAdventures in Babysitting,\u201d the first film from director Chris Columbus, incorporates a similarly immersive winter atmosphere into the edges of its opening scenes.) The framing/composition of this shot is striking but also simple and unfussy, like most of the great images in Home Alone. It\u2019s a long shot in which Kevin, free from the law but not from his own conscience, is dwarfed by the chilly December landscape. No one else is in sight, emphasizing the loneliness of the accidental shoplifter. \n\nI suddenly found this image very moving as a depiction of isolation: Kevin is clearly in over his head (at least at this point in the story) and missing his family. Somehow the shot had breezed by on countless other viewings, never prompting much thought on my part. But now it stopped me in my (train) tracks. I also pondered how much it might have cost to arrange for the train\u2019s appearance for such a fleeting bit of interstitial footage (or maybe it was just a matter of taking advantage of the existing train schedule). At any rate, it was worth the effort \u2014 it provides a good capstone to the preceding chase scene, reestablishing the melancholy after the lively ice rink moment. \n\nI also noticed that, in 4K, the wool coat of Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) has a sense of texture and dimensionality that it lacked in the VHS/television transfers of the 90s. (Not so surprising given the format, but interesting.) In fact, the movie\u2019s aesthetic generally looks so authentic, lived-in, and fine-grained, especially in comparison to many contemporary films of a similarly commercial/family-centric ilk. Various settings and visuals in the film remain believable, just like the viewings in the old days. But now they are also richly nostalgic.  \n\nPut simply, they don\u2019t make movies quite like this anymore. The visual design of the film isn\u2019t necessarily overproduced or showy, but it\u2019s so expertly presented and crafted. Paired with the film\u2019s beautiful and openly sentimental tone, this makes for a very emotional yearly viewing experience. \n\nLastly, with each passing year I find myself appreciating more deeply just how much Roberts Blossom brings to this movie.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks to those who left good-natured and/or interesting replies. On a separate note, there\u2019s a weird/insulting tendency on this website where certain users see a formal, proofread post and assume it *must* be AI. Have communicative standards been so lowered that even a mildly in-depth but otherwise basic piece of writing is somehow suspect? I\u2019ve never used AI for *anything*. I wouldn\u2019t even know how. I wrote this post in about 15-20 minutes, proofread it, and double-checked Pesci\u2019s character name. This isn\u2019t complicated. I\u2019m using the same cadence/style as most of my other posts. Like [I said in the comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pxxpd0/those_who_watched_home_alone_for_the_millionth/nwfffev/?context=3), these paranoid/baseless accusations only end up stigmatizing basic forms of communication. I\u2019ve seen these accusations in a lot of threads and it smacks of insecurity or, at the very least, schoolyard-level pettiness.",

        "content": "The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announced on Sunday the death of the icon of 1950s femininity, film actress, singer, muse and inspiration to great artists, but also an animal rights advocate.\n\nShe was undoubtedly one of the greatest French and global stars, an icon of a generation, a symbol in her own way of the emancipation of women and sexual freedom: Brigitte Bardot passed away on Sunday, December 28, 2025, at the age of 91, her Foundation announced to AFP.\n\nBrigitte Bardot was\u00a0[hospitalized in Toulon in November](https://www.franceinfo.fr/culture/cinema/brigitte-bardot/brigitte-bardot-rassure-sur-son-etat-de-sante-et-se-declare-en-convalescence_7649732.html)\u00a0and underwent surgery. She was also hospitalized in January 2023 due to respiratory failure. An actress and singer known by her initials, \"BB\" was part of France's cultural heritage, but she also dedicated a large part of her life to animal rights.\n\nFrom the moment she appeared on the film scene, she revolutionized attitudes. Curves to die for, a sensual yet innocent way of moving\u2026 She would be the most beautiful woman in the world. Brigitte Bardot, the young woman from a privileged background in Paris, dreamed, like many little girls, of a career as a dancer. Very quickly, she became a model and landed her first role in \\*\u00a0*Le Trou normand\\**\u00a0alongside Bourvil.\n\nFrom then on, she was a force to be reckoned with, and much to her parents' dismay, Roger Vadim, then a young film assistant, became her mentor. A year later, at the Cannes Film Festival, the young actress caused a sensation on the Croisette, driving the photographers wild.\n\nBardot was already on par with the stars of the time. Kirk Douglas, captivated, tried to lure her to the United States. Behind the scenes, Vadim continued to mold her and finally obtained the right to marry her in 1952. She had just turned 18.\n\n*And God Created Woman*\u00a0, the first film directed by her husband. She was 22 years old, and it was primarily in the United States that the film caused a scandal. \"And God created Bardot,\" the Americans say. France then embraced the myth of the young Frenchwoman. A global star was born.\n\nIt's 1958, and Bardot, now BB, is the embodiment of the free woman. A fashion phenomenon. An entire generation dresses, does their makeup, and styles their hair like her. Everything she touches turns to gold. And it's opposite Jean Gabin in the film \"\u00a0*En cas de malheur\" (In Case of Emergency*\u00a0) that she will reveal her acting talents.\n\nIn 1960, she starred in her favorite film,\u00a0*La V\u00e9rit\u00e9*\u00a0, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, a story of a crime of passion. It was then her foray into the New\u00a0\u00a0Wave, with Jean-Luc Godard and Michel Piccoli, that would leave a lasting impression on film buffs. This was the legendary\u00a0*Contempt*\u00a0at the Villa Malaparte in Capri, and her famous line:\u00a0*\"Can you see my backside in the mirror? -Yes. -Do you think my buttocks are pretty? -Yes... very.\"*\n\nMen came and went in Bardot's life\u00a0\u00a0: Vadim, Trintignant, Charrier. Her second marriage to the latter (\u00a0[who died in September\u00a0\u00a02025](https://www.franceinfo.fr/culture/cinema/le-comedien-jacques-charrier-deuxieme-mari-de-brigitte-bardot-et-pere-de-son-fils-est-mort-a-l-age-de-88-ans_7474855.html)\u00a0) was short-lived, but she had a son with him, Nicolas, who was raised by his father. Bardot became the symbol of all French people as Marianne, before finding herself, towards the end of the 1960s, a new Pygmalion in Serge Gainsbourg.\n\n# The hysterical crowd at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival\n\nOn the occasion of the release of Louis Malle's\u00a0*Viva Maria*\u00a0, starring Jeanne Moreau, she said of her:\u00a0*\"Watching her walk is like listening to great music.\"*\u00a0A second marriage followed, this time to Gunter Sachs. The couple faced the hysterical crowds at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. Brigitte Bardot could no longer bear the public life.  \n  \nA few unlikely films followed:\u00a0*Les Novices*\u00a0with Annie Girardot,\u00a0*Les P\u00e9troleuses*\u00a0with Claudia Cardinale,\u00a0*and Shalaco*\u00a0with Sean Connery. From this period emerged only one charming comedy by Michel Deville,\u00a0*L'Ours et la Poup\u00e9e (The Bear and the Doll)*\u00a0, where she finally played a tender character opposite Jean-Pierre Cassel. She finally worked under the direction of Nina Campanez and deflowered Francis Huster's character. When the film was released in 1973, no one yet knew it would be her last. She was 39 years old and wanted a change of pace.\n\nThe myth of the most beautiful woman in the world will continue to resonate in the annals of cinema. But it is elsewhere that she will play the role closest to her heart. It is now at La Madrague, in Saint-Tropez, surrounded by her dogs, that Brigitte Bardot is launching her new crusades for animal rights.\n\nIn 1977, she denounced the slaughter of baby seals. For the public, a new Bardot had just been born. A five-day trek across the Canadian polar ice caps led to a ban on the seal fur trade. But the media pressure was too intense, and BB was not yet taken seriously.\n\n# From the free woman to the conservative woman\n\nNine years later, she was selling personal belongings, jewelry, and memorabilia from her former profession. Three million francs were raised to fund her foundation and allow her to dedicate herself more fully to the protection of all oppressed animals. She also bequeathed her property to the foundation. From the abandonment of pets to animal experimentation, and even the hunting of turtledoves, she was involved in every fight. But, little by little, the free-spirited young woman of the 1950s gave way to an increasingly conservative, even reactionary, woman.\n\nBy marrying Bernard d'Ormale, an industrialist with ties to the National Front, she demonstrated her affinity for Jean-Marie Le Pen's ideas. The publication of her memoirs was surprising due to her aggressive, even racist, positions. This is also why she was convicted in 2003, following her statements about the slaughter of sheep during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.\n\n*\u201cFreedom is being yourself, even when it\u2019s unsettling,\u201d*\u00a0proclaims Brigitte Bardot in the epigraph to her book, \\*\u00a0*Mon BBc\u00e9daire\\* (Fayard Publishers)*\u00a0, released on\u00a0\u00a0October 1, 2025, in which she shares her views on the world. From the letter A for abandonment to the letter Z for zoo, Bardot writes a few lines on chosen words and the names of places or people she has known. In eroticism, the actress\u00a0sees\u00a0*\u201cgames of love where everything is permitted with imagination, unsettling perversity, and amorous mischief.\u201d*\u00a0The animal rights activist believes that France has\u00a0*\u201cbecome dull, sad, submissive, sick, damaged, ravaged, ordinary, vulgar\u2026\u201d*\u00a0The right wing is the \u201c\u00a0*only urgent remedy for France\u2019s agony,\u201d*\u00a0adds the woman who has openly acknowledged her affinity with Marine Le\u00a0\u00a0Pen\u00a0\u00a0(National Rally).\n\nAs an actress, animal rights activist, and citizen, Bardot always spoke with the same freedom, even at the risk of causing a scandal. That's what we'll remember about her life.",
