        "content": "As the saying goes, the past is a foreign country, and as such movies from the past can also seem like a foreign country. Movies usually try to reflect the reality of the time they're made in, but something that seemed normal in the past can seem unbelievable to modern audiences even if they're aware of the historical context.\n\nFor example, I recently rewatched White Christmas, and the song [\"What can you do with a General\"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0rRe9gmFC4&amp;list=RDD0rRe9gmFC4&amp;start_radio=1) and the whole plot point about the retired general always seemed strange to me. The premise is that normal soldiers returning from WWII had better employment prospects than retired generals, with the general now running a failing inn while all of his former subordinates are doing very well. In modern times, this seems completely alien. Nowadays enlisted persons have a much harder time finding a decent job or even any job at all after their military service, especially if they lack a proper education/useful transferable skills or they have health problems, while high-ranking officers have a very easy time getting a good job thanks to their education and connections. I am frankly not even sure if the whole thing about retired WWII generals having a hard time finding a job was true, but it is definitely true that WWII veterans had a much easier time after their service than soldiers in later wars.\n\nAnd on that note, pretty much any old movie where a father with his own income in a job that isn't even that prestigious can provide for a whole family with a nice house that he owns. This is now a fantasy to anyone thinking of starting a family.\n\nSo what other then contemporary historical realities depicted in movies seem strange now?",

A smaller group fleeing to complete the mission themselves. Hiding from a corrupt and oppressive government. Navigating an active war zone in some of the final scenes.\n\nI still enjoy the rest of the movies but Cuar\u00f3n would have been better suited and produced something amazing rather than serviceable.\n\nIt could have been like Paddington 2 - genuinely great filmmaking from a genre you wouldn't expect.",

        "content": "There\u2019s a brief shot where Kevin, having evaded the police after inadvertently stealing a toothbrush, crosses a bridge. Meanwhile, a train passes by underneath. The winter atmosphere here is precise, credible, bordering on the straightforwardness of B-roll documentary footage. (\u201cAdventures in Babysitting,\u201d the first film from director Chris Columbus, incorporates a similarly immersive winter atmosphere into the edges of its opening scenes.) The framing/composition of this shot is striking but also simple and unfussy, like most of the great images in Home Alone. It\u2019s a long shot in which Kevin, free from the law but not from his own conscience, is dwarfed by the chilly December landscape. No one else is in sight, emphasizing the loneliness of the accidental shoplifter. \n\nI suddenly found this image very moving as a depiction of isolation: Kevin is clearly in over his head (at least at this point in the story) and missing his family. Somehow the shot had breezed by on countless other viewings, never prompting much thought on my part. But now it stopped me in my (train) tracks. I also pondered how much it might have cost to arrange for the train\u2019s appearance for such a fleeting bit of interstitial footage (or maybe it was just a matter of taking advantage of the existing train schedule). At any rate, it was worth the effort \u2014 it provides a good capstone to the preceding chase scene, reestablishing the melancholy after the lively ice rink moment. \n\nI also noticed that, in 4K, the wool coat of Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) has a sense of texture and dimensionality that it lacked in the VHS/television transfers of the 90s. (Not so surprising given the format, but interesting.) In fact, the movie\u2019s aesthetic generally looks so authentic, lived-in, and fine-grained, especially in comparison to many contemporary films of a similarly commercial/family-centric ilk. Various settings and visuals in the film remain believable, just like the viewings in the old days. But now they are also richly nostalgic.  \n\nPut simply, they don\u2019t make movies quite like this anymore. The visual design of the film isn\u2019t necessarily overproduced or showy, but it\u2019s so expertly presented and crafted. Paired with the film\u2019s beautiful and openly sentimental tone, this makes for a very emotional yearly viewing experience. \n\nLastly, with each passing year I find myself appreciating more deeply just how much Roberts Blossom brings to this movie.",

        "content": "The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announced on Sunday the death of the icon of 1950s femininity, film actress, singer, muse and inspiration to great artists, but also an animal rights advocate.\n\nShe was undoubtedly one of the greatest French and global stars, an icon of a generation, a symbol in her own way of the emancipation of women and sexual freedom: Brigitte Bardot passed away on Sunday, December 28, 2025, at the age of 91, her Foundation announced to AFP.\n\nBrigitte Bardot was\u00a0[hospitalized in Toulon in November](https://www.franceinfo.fr/culture/cinema/brigitte-bardot/brigitte-bardot-rassure-sur-son-etat-de-sante-et-se-declare-en-convalescence_7649732.html)\u00a0and underwent surgery. She was also hospitalized in January 2023 due to respiratory failure. An actress and singer known by her initials, \"BB\" was part of France's cultural heritage, but she also dedicated a large part of her life to animal rights.\n\nFrom the moment she appeared on the film scene, she revolutionized attitudes. Curves to die for, a sensual yet innocent way of moving\u2026 She would be the most beautiful woman in the world. Brigitte Bardot, the young woman from a privileged background in Paris, dreamed, like many little girls, of a career as a dancer. Very quickly, she became a model and landed her first role in \\*\u00a0*Le Trou normand\\**\u00a0alongside Bourvil.\n\nFrom then on, she was a force to be reckoned with, and much to her parents' dismay, Roger Vadim, then a young film assistant, became her mentor. A year later, at the Cannes Film Festival, the young actress caused a sensation on the Croisette, driving the photographers wild.\n\nBardot was already on par with the stars of the time. Kirk Douglas, captivated, tried to lure her to the United States. Behind the scenes, Vadim continued to mold her and finally obtained the right to marry her in 1952. She had just turned 18.\n\n*And God Created Woman*\u00a0, the first film directed by her husband. She was 22 years old, and it was primarily in the United States that the film caused a scandal. \"And God created Bardot,\" the Americans say. France then embraced the myth of the young Frenchwoman. A global star was born.\n\nIt's 1958, and Bardot, now BB, is the embodiment of the free woman. A fashion phenomenon. An entire generation dresses, does their makeup, and styles their hair like her. Everything she touches turns to gold. And it's opposite Jean Gabin in the film \"\u00a0*En cas de malheur\" (In Case of Emergency*\u00a0) that she will reveal her acting talents.\n\nIn 1960, she starred in her favorite film,\u00a0*La V\u00e9rit\u00e9*\u00a0, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, a story of a crime of passion. It was then her foray into the New\u00a0\u00a0Wave, with Jean-Luc Godard and Michel Piccoli, that would leave a lasting impression on film buffs. This was the legendary\u00a0*Contempt*\u00a0at the Villa Malaparte in Capri, and her famous line:\u00a0*\"Can you see my backside in the mirror? -Yes. -Do you think my buttocks are pretty? -Yes... very.\"*\n\nMen came and went in Bardot's life\u00a0\u00a0: Vadim, Trintignant, Charrier. Her second marriage to the latter (\u00a0[who died in September\u00a0\u00a02025](https://www.franceinfo.fr/culture/cinema/le-comedien-jacques-charrier-deuxieme-mari-de-brigitte-bardot-et-pere-de-son-fils-est-mort-a-l-age-de-88-ans_7474855.html)\u00a0) was short-lived, but she had a son with him, Nicolas, who was raised by his father. Bardot became the symbol of all French people as Marianne, before finding herself, towards the end of the 1960s, a new Pygmalion in Serge Gainsbourg.\n\n# The hysterical crowd at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival\n\nOn the occasion of the release of Louis Malle's\u00a0*Viva Maria*\u00a0, starring Jeanne Moreau, she said of her:\u00a0*\"Watching her walk is like listening to great music.\"*\u00a0A second marriage followed, this time to Gunter Sachs. The couple faced the hysterical crowds at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. Brigitte Bardot could no longer bear the public life.  \n  \nA few unlikely films followed:\u00a0*Les Novices*\u00a0with Annie Girardot,\u00a0*Les P\u00e9troleuses*\u00a0with Claudia Cardinale,\u00a0*and Shalaco*\u00a0with Sean Connery. From this period emerged only one charming comedy by Michel Deville,\u00a0*L'Ours et la Poup\u00e9e (The Bear and the Doll)*\u00a0, where she finally played a tender character opposite Jean-Pierre Cassel. She finally worked under the direction of Nina Campanez and deflowered Francis Huster's character. When the film was released in 1973, no one yet knew it would be her last. She was 39 years old and wanted a change of pace.\n\nThe myth of the most beautiful woman in the world will continue to resonate in the annals of cinema. But it is elsewhere that she will play the role closest to her heart. It is now at La Madrague, in Saint-Tropez, surrounded by her dogs, that Brigitte Bardot is launching her new crusades for animal rights.\n\nIn 1977, she denounced the slaughter of baby seals. For the public, a new Bardot had just been born. A five-day trek across the Canadian polar ice caps led to a ban on the seal fur trade. But the media pressure was too intense, and BB was not yet taken seriously.\n\n# From the free woman to the conservative woman\n\nNine years later, she was selling personal belongings, jewelry, and memorabilia from her former profession. Three million francs were raised to fund her foundation and allow her to dedicate herself more fully to the protection of all oppressed animals. She also bequeathed her property to the foundation. From the abandonment of pets to animal experimentation, and even the hunting of turtledoves, she was involved in every fight. But, little by little, the free-spirited young woman of the 1950s gave way to an increasingly conservative, even reactionary, woman.\n\nBy marrying Bernard d'Ormale, an industrialist with ties to the National Front, she demonstrated her affinity for Jean-Marie Le Pen's ideas. The publication of her memoirs was surprising due to her aggressive, even racist, positions. This is also why she was convicted in 2003, following her statements about the slaughter of sheep during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.\n\n*\u201cFreedom is being yourself, even when it\u2019s unsettling,\u201d*\u00a0proclaims Brigitte Bardot in the epigraph to her book, \\*\u00a0*Mon BBc\u00e9daire\\* (Fayard Publishers)*\u00a0, released on\u00a0\u00a0October 1, 2025, in which she shares her views on the world. From the letter A for abandonment to the letter Z for zoo, Bardot writes a few lines on chosen words and the names of places or people she has known. In eroticism, the actress\u00a0sees\u00a0*\u201cgames of love where everything is permitted with imagination, unsettling perversity, and amorous mischief.\u201d*\u00a0The animal rights activist believes that France has\u00a0*\u201cbecome dull, sad, submissive, sick, damaged, ravaged, ordinary, vulgar\u2026\u201d*\u00a0The right wing is the \u201c\u00a0*only urgent remedy for France\u2019s agony,\u201d*\u00a0adds the woman who has openly acknowledged her affinity with Marine Le\u00a0\u00a0Pen\u00a0\u00a0(National Rally).\n\nAs an actress, animal rights activist, and citizen, Bardot always spoke with the same freedom, even at the risk of causing a scandal. That's what we'll remember about her life.",

I checked out books from libraries about surviving in the wild in a deserted island, rainforest, north pole etc. Wanted to be a vocanologist, virologist for a while\n\nAnd the human drama! People say they are melodramatic, but people in real life are more melodramatic and is more realistic than people admit to themselves imho\n\nAs much as I love disaster movies that are more factual and cool that have been coming out since then, 90s disaster movies had something special and, should I say, more human.\n\nWatching Deep Impact made me want to talk about these 90s disaster films so much. People around me don't get my passion for these movies\ud83e\udd72\n\n",
