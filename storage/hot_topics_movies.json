        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "For me it is Jurassic World.  When I first saw it in theaters I thought it was great and the second best movie in the franchise behind the original.  \n\nAfter watching it a second time on streaming I realized it was just like every other big budget, heavy on cgi movie that is churned out.  One that has to depend on nostalgia, and where the acting is just not good at all.  \n\nJurassic Park is my favorite movie ever and I think the Lost World is a worthy sequel.  But I don\u2019t think any other film in the franchise is higher then a 5/10. \n\n",
