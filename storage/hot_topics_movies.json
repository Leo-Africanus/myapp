        "content": "&gt;He\u2019s about to break every rule he\u2019s ever lived by. Watch the trailer for #Crime101\u200b now, starring Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, and Halle Berry. See the movie only in theaters February 13.\n\n&gt;Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose high-stakes heists unfolding along the iconic 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime with hopes of this being his final job, his path collides with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads, forcing the two to collaborate. Determined to crack the case, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) closes in on the operation, raising the stakes even higher. As the multimillion-dollar heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are forced to confront the cost of their choices--and the realization that there's no turning back. \n\n&gt;Adapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter). Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte round out the cast.",

George C Scott plays Lee J Cobb\u2019s character and he is absolutely fantastic in it! James Gandolfini and Courtney B Vance are also in it and play it great as well.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly a word for word remake with a couple of new scenes, but it\u2019s honestly almost as good as the original, usually remakes are mediocre or crappy, this one is honestly one of the better remakes out there.",

Was it a shock to see him get blasted and see those liquid metal impacts?\n\n  \nI was 7 when that movie came out so I don't remember the advertising behind it really at all but I sure do remember all the toys that came out.  The trailers I've seen definitely spoil it, but curious if the marketing made it impossible not to know or if people still went in blind.  I think James Cameron did such an amazing job in the first 20 minutes of the movie leaving it ambiguous and hope it had that type of impact on some people.",
