So many posts, so many comments, saying how wonderful this movie was.  I gave in and watched it last night.\n\nIt's really good.  Yes, just like you have all been screaming at me.  Good action, good comedy, good SFX, all around a great movie.\n\nI really loved Hugh Grant's performance.  He pulls off smarmy and slimy quite well. \n\nAnd I was leaping out of my seat when I saw [live-action versions](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24550574/80_Kids_Arena.png) of [these guys](https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dungeons-Dragons-cartoon.jpg).

No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)\n\nBut I'm not talking about horror, vs just not \"getting it\" or having adult themes way out of your league?\n\nThe one film I saw because \"cute robots\" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... \n\nBut it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.\n\nI wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",

Lithgow plays respected Dr Carter Nix who happens to have multiple personalities, some of them being psychotic murderers. Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer. \n\nSupporting roles are fine, I liked Frances Sternhagen as an eccentric psychologist trying to get to Carter Nix. Lolita Davidovich wears beautiful dresses. Steven Bauer has a nude scene. And aging actress Gabrielle Carteris plays a teenager again, this time no glasses and trashy.",

        "content": "People often talk about scarring, the most gruesome, or films you watched too young, etc. But there's a softer side of that trend, and it's simply the feeling of existentialism within the context of the film, whether storyline, visual vocabulary, subtext, etc. So what are some other films that feel this way, like:\n\nSilent Running\n\nWatership Down\n\nThreads or the Day After Tomorrow\n\nAniara\n\nUntil the End of the World\n\nMindwalk\n\nMy Dinner with Andre\n\n",

        "content": "I stumbled on Of Horses and Men recently, and honestly it blew me away.  It's dot this dark, dry sense of humor, a bit of brutal weirdness, and some moments that are straight-up haunting, kind of like if the Coen brothers took a trip to rural Iceland and decided to make a film about people and horses. \n\nVisually, it's stunning. There's something about the way it captures isolation and the weird intimacy between the people and animals that feels super unique. It's not really like The Northman plot-wise, but if you were into the raw, mythic, earthy vibe of that movie, you might really dig this one.\n\nHas anyone else seen it? I feel like it deserves way more love.",

I only watched it once and don\u2019t remember what I thought of it, but after watching it again (unrated version), I was laughing so much.\n\nOliver Platt killed it. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at the oil scene. Jack and Michael were good as the buddy duo. A talented cast delivering it on dialogue and action. \n\nIt reminded me of Brooks\u2019 HOTWP1. Ramis\u2019 last film might be a sleeper comedy in the future. ",

The quality of the video is much better than I expected for some 1983 Czech footage.\n\nThe link for more is in the description at youtube.

He got the credit yet she's the one who dominated the last act as her character runs for the Train station. \n\nA heartwarming film, personally.",
