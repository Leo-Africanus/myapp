        "content": "Hi r/movies,\n\nI\u2019m Mark Dossett, creator of The Town That Cried Bigfoot \u2014 a lost 1978 documentary about a small-town Bigfoot hoax that spirals into murder. But the deeper you dig, the stranger it gets \u2014because none of it\u2019s real. Not even the town.\n\nI built this film completely backward \u2014 starting with real 1970s news footage I found, then reverse-engineering a fictional murder, a cryptid hoax, and a made-up southern town buried inside real news footage.\n\nLet\u2019s just say... if you Google \u201cWeyburn, Virginia\u201d while watching, you might start to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAsk me anything about editing the truth into lies, creating fake towns, tricking Google, Bigfoot folklore, Blair Witch-style worldbuilding, or how the hell any of this even worked. Or anything else you want to discuss.\n\n**Film info:**\n\nThe Town That Cried Bigfoot\n\nGenre: Faux Documentary / Mystery / True Crime (kinda sorta)\n\nRuntime: 47 minutes\n\nWritten, Directed &amp; Edited by: Mark Dossett\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\nIn the winter of 1978, four desperate councilmen in Weyburn, Virginia staged a fake Bigfoot sighting to save their town from economic ruin. The plan worked \u2014 until someone turned up dead.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker\u2014 none of this ever happened. The footage is real. The town is fake. The hoax is real enough to show up on MapQuest. This is a hoax within a hoax \u2014 crafted to feel like a lost documentary buried in public access archives.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnpr9EBMhsg)\n\n**Where to Watch:**\n\nAmazon Prime Video: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXDM6RLN)\n\nGumroad (Download the full film for $5 and support the filmmaker):\n\n[https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film](https://1978bigfoot.gumroad.com/l/film)\n\nOfficial Merch: [https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com](https://weyburn-shop.fourthwall.com)\n\nAlso streaming on select free platforms: Stash TV, Fawesome TV, and Xumo.\n\nAsk me anything!

        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie): 78% (40 reviews) with 6.80 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/f1-the-movie/): 67/100 (16 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; The impressive craft of these scenes extends to Kosinki\u2019s exploration of the various technologies, like road simulators, used to help drivers gain any advantage. Of course, there are some unrealistic elements in F1, moments that might have sticklers raising an eyebrow, but the film doesn\u2019t feel any less dramatic than the real thing.\n\n-[Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-damson-idris-joseph-kosinski-1236291870/)\n\n&gt; The action is hardly dull, but the sheer disconnect between the wowee zowee immediacy of the race footage and the mezzo mezzo excitement it inspires suggests that tuning out the noise isn\u2019t as easy as Sonny Hayes might seem to think. \u201cSometimes when you lose, you win,\u201d Ruben tells his old friend. And sometimes when you win, this solid but underwhelming blockbuster contends, you still lose.  \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt-1235133092/): C+\n\n&gt; With the action confined to stadium racetracks, you wonder why Kosinski didn\u2019t give the audience more of a consistent eagle\u2019s-eye overview; that would have helped. But maybe he just counted on the thrill of speed, and the specter of death, to be the film\u2019s engine. Is there a suck-in-your-breath cataclysmic crash? Of course there is, but we\u2019re invited to exhale from its consequences too easily. In \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d someone asks why race drivers do what they do, and a racer\u2019s girlfriend replies, \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to go very fast.\u201d Yes it is, but that in itself isn\u2019t enough to make a marvelous movie.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/f1-review-brad-pitt-javier-bardem-damson-idris-1236432987/)\n\n&gt; Top Gun: Maverick's Joseph Kosinski assembles an all-star crew in front of and behind the camera for F1, and they craft a technical marvel of a movie. It\u2019s gorgeous and thrilling to look at, with top-notch editing backing up Brad Pitt\u2019s IMAX-consuming charisma. It's a faithful devotee to the sports-movie formula that\u2019s kept from greatness by a few too many unnecessary components and a finish line that maybe should\u2019ve been closer than two and a half hours away. But in spite of that, it\u2019s still a hell of a ride.\n\n-[Clint Gage, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinsky): 7/10 \"good\"\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d is slick enough to capture your attention for an hour and a half. Again, unfortunately, it\u2019s 2 1/2 hours long. The repetitive story, stale characterizations, portentous self-celebration and oddly flaccid take on the masculine drive just keep puttering along, long after our interest has waned. It\u2019s a classic car that looks brand new \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t had a lube job in decades.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt/)\n\n&gt; Motor racing is a sport in which constituent team members seem to be competing against each other as much as against the opposition, and so it ought to be an ideal subject for a movie treatment. There\u2019s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular.\n\n-[Pete Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt): 4/5\n\n&gt; Whether or not it finds it audience (and there are probably a lot of easter eggs for viewers who know a hell of a lot more about Formula One than I do), F1 is proof that brand Pitt is still a viable option and, like Tom Cruise, can still hold a movie the old-fashioned way, putting pedal to the metal.\n\n-[Damon Wise, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt-joseph-kosinski-old-school-racing-drama-1236435474/)\n\n&gt; Joseph Kosinski has done it again. F1 combines unparalleled access, pioneering filmmaking and moving redemption arcs to deliver an exhilarating cinematic experience. What will he attach a camera to next?\n\n-[Sophie Butcher, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/f1-the-movie/): 4/5\n\n&gt; With those warnings in place, buckle in. For flash and rumble, F1 doesn't have an equal this summer. Roll down the windows and enjoy the ride.\n\n-[Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/f1-review-brad-pitt-phenomenal-racing-scenes-dull-script-11755916)\n\n&gt; \u201cF1\u201d leans extremely rousing, though intrigues when it mines the strategic idiosyncrasies of the motorsport and the psychological and physical toll it takes to be a champion. There\u2019s a mental health angle touched on that, if explored more, would have led to a great albeit bleaker movie. Not that this thing deserves a participation trophy. Watching Pitt burn this much rubber, and with macho panache, puts \"F1\" in the winners' circle.\n\n-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/17/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt/84222638007/): 3/4\n\n&gt; F1 couldn\u2019t feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that\u2019s the current obsession of millions, yet couldn\u2019t feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P. This what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.\n\n-[David Fear, Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/f1-review-brad-pitt-formula-one-1235353444/)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nSonny Hayes, a Formula One driver who raced in the 1990s, has a horrible crash, forcing him to retire from Formula One and start racing in other disciplines.

        "content": "I remember when Snatch was one of those films that everyone had on DVD in the early days, saw the Sherlock films in cinema and always wanted a RocknRolla sequel, his style was so distinct\n\nBut then I fell off Guy Ritchie until The Covenant and then I watched his films since Aladdin.\n\nI noticed that he had played it straighter than I would have expected in Aladdin, The Covenant and Fountain of Youth and I wondered why. that zany super British way he would cut together scenes.\n\nI didn't like Wrath of Man, felt very B grade.\n\nThe Gentlemen and Operation Fortune felt most like him since and Ungentlemanly had elements of his zaniness.\n\nThen I saw King Arthur, which was such an over the top hyper Guy film, that I almost expected some freeze frame 4th wall breaking moments. I loved it, it's so crazy.\n\nHowever it being such a big box office bomb and critical failure. I wouldn't be surprised if it made him more wary to be himself as much and became more of a director for hire.\n\nLooking forward to rewatching King Arthur again actually, it's so nuts.\n\nEDIT: The montage, the dlalogue, the big ass snake towards the end, the slow mo 360 degree camera shots are so insanely over the top hahahaha, it's time to make it a cult classic.",

But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1888624/elio-pixar-movie-review/) (75):\n\n&gt;The frenetic pace may keep kids hooked, but parents will appreciate the sequences when Elio hits the pause button and allows audiences to sit in the silence \u2014 of complicated ideas, of emotionally challenging conversations, and of the wonders around us we too often fail to appreciate.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/elio-review-pixar/) (70):\n\n&gt;But despite how charming and fun Elio is, it still falls prey to some of Pixar\u2019s occasional problems. Yes, this is a story of intergalactic adventures and a wide universe of possibilities, but it still can get a bit convoluted at times.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/elio-review-pixar):\n\n&gt;Overall, it\u2019s an entertaining bit of summer fun.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/elio/) (80):\n\n&gt;Robert Zemeckis\u2019 Contact for kids. A slow start gives way to a charming, visually inventive adventure that might just inspire a new generation of astronomers to look to the skies.\n\nFor centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers\u2014in Disney and Pixar's all-new feature film\u00a0*Elio*, the universe calls back! The cosmic misadventure introduces Elio, a space fanatic with an active imagination and a huge alien obsession. So, when he's beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide, Elio's all in for the epic undertaking. Mistakenly identified as Earth's leader, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and somehow discover who and where he is truly meant to be.",

        "title": "Pete's Dragon (2016) is a fun remake that is often overlooked",
        "content": "With how many weird and unnecessary remakes are coming out right now, I wanted to bring up one of my favorite remakes which was the 2016 remake of Pete's Dragon. \n\nThe origin Pete's Dragon came out in 1977 and was one of the earlier films to have cartoons interact with live actors. It was one of the Disney classics that my mom had on VHS and not many people seemed to know about it.\n\nThe original movie had a much darker tone, with an orphan child in New England being used as slaves for a family of hillbillies. He escapes with the help of his dragon (who can turn invisible). The movie then starts with the hillbillies singing about the horrible things that they will do to Pete if they catch him (including drowning him and cooking him). He eventually escapes into town and meets the town drunk and lighthouse keeper, played by the amazing Mickey Rooney. Pete eventually has to balance his new civilized life with the lighthouse keeper and the keeper's daughter (whose fiancee was lost at see) with having a giant invisible dragon, all while trying to stop a snake oil salesman from killing his dragon for parts (There is literally a song about chopping up the dragon for different cures).\n\nThe remake on the other hand still has a slightly darker overtone, but takes place that the original one was filmed. It starts with an orphan boy in the woods being raised by his dragon friend. Instead of a drunk light house keeper, it's just a local hunter (Robert Redford), who once saw the dragon in the woods and is considered crazy. The daughter is a forest ranger (Bryce Dallas Howard) who doesn't believe her dad. She is engaged to a man (Wes Bentley) who, along with his brother (Karl Urban) run a lumber business. There are no murderous hillbillies. \n\nGetting back to my point at hand, the reason why I consider this a great remake is that it gave a large amount of time before remaking it (39 years). It had a lot of the heart and several references to the original, while also updating it for newer audiences. The overall concept was the same but it also became it's own film, making it feel almost like  a spiritual successor in it's own way. I still love the original film for nostalgia reasons but this new one is one of my go to feel good films. And the nice part is I don't always feel the need to compare them, which a lot of remakes make me do. I often end a remake watch with the idea of \"Wow, they ruined that\", which is a shame since there are so many great older films that could be updated for our current world.\n\nTL;DR - Pete's Dragon is a modern remake of a much older movie that doesn't try to be a complete remake but it's own film that shines on its own",
