Don't get me wrong he still liked the movie and said it DID \"move him\", I just need something to push him over the edge of tears, yk? What he told me It's apparently honest stories about strong friendships or true love that make him cry, also nothing like purposeful tearjerker (ex: Titanic). Any recommendations? He doesn't discriminate, so can be pretty much anything.\n\nBtw he cried over Futurama, to be exact the part where Leela and Fry read their future together, but that's like the only example I have...",

        "title": "So many erotic thriller from the past decade seem to be afraid to be erotic or thrilling",
        "content": "In the days of Yore, before internet porn and Instagram thots, the erotic thriller held a special place in American pop culture. \n\nMovies like Basic Instinct or Fatal Attraction in the 80's, Wild Things or Poison Ivy in the 90's pushed boundaries and tantalized viewers. They were scandalous enough that you might be quiet about watching them in the theater, but not graphic enough to be in \"that section\" at your local video rental store.\n\nHowever, I feel like these movies are all but long gone both in terms of the number they are produced in and in what they portray on screen.\n\nFor example, Babygirl released this week. I won't give any spoilers, but a lot of the reviews and comments seem to be on how for as much sex as is in the movie, it isn't really erotic. Nor is the \"mystery\" aspect all that thrilling.\n\nSimilarly, Miller's Girl released earlier this year with Jenna Ortega at the height of her fame and the story being about her sexual relationship with her professor. Yet it was so bland, seemingly afraid to \"go there\".\n\nA few years ago, The Voyeurs came out with Sydney Sweeny fresh off her Euphoria season. There was sex. There was murder. There were plot twists. There was revenge. Most of all, it was meh. \n\nI am curious, why is this (if you even agree with the premise)? Is it because graphic material is so readily available? Has society become more sex-averse? Is it something else?",

        "title": "\"Dead Calm\" (1989): A pulsating, nerve-wrecking thriller about a couple separated from each other in the wide Pacific ocean, struggling to survive.",
        "content": "I love this movie. Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman play a married couple who've gone through the trauma of losing their child in an accident and are dealing with it by going on a vacation on their Ocean on the Pacific. Mid-travel, they find an abandoned boat with one survivor who rows himself to their Yach for help, but when the husband decides to go to the stranger's sinking schooner to see what is in there, he's confronted with a horrifying, shocking truth, which causes the separation of the couple and puts their lives in danger. \n\n\"Dead Calm\" was a disturbing, tense and suspenseful film. Both leads experience a different kind of danger, the husband is trapped on a sinking boat that is quickly submering, leaving him into MacGyver move, whereas the wife is trapped in the Yacht with a psycho and she's forced to do everything she can to stay alive. As the movie progresses, the film becomes more about the wife and Kidman manages to dominate the movie as her character, Rae, finds her inner strength, while Billy Zane's Hughie, exudes danger and menace but at the same time, sex-appeal. You can see that he's a time bomb, seemingly nice and hot but whose temper becomes increasingly psychotic as he reaches his unhinged limit (which isn't hard to do so). \n\nI must say I had no idea Kidman was 20/21 in this movie. She looks pretty mature for her role and she is very headstrong  halfway through it. You could tell she was about to be big.",

        "content": "Although most of the time Hollywood executives make reasonable decisions, most of which we never know about and we never really give them credit for, they often also do things that we consider to be quite dumb. Sometimes those decisions actually paid off in the end (like the Hobbit being split into 3 movies which ended up being huge box office hits despite their questionable quality) and other times there is at least something resembling an argument for why the decision was made even though many would disagree with it (like WB canning Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme as a tax write-off, or 20th Century Fox allowing George Lucas to have the Star Wars merchandising rights because at the time merchandising for movies wasn't seen as profitable).\n\nBut sometimes they make decisions so stupid and baffling that you wonder how the hell these people still have jobs. Like why the hell did Sony keep doubling down on their Spider-Man without Spider-Man movie franchise? Venom was a hit, but Venom is Venom, an already popular character. Nobody but big comic book fans or people who watched certain Spider-Man cartoon were aware of who Morbius, Madame Web, or Kraven were. You'd think that the failure of Morbius would have made them reconsider, but nope they instead doubled down by releasing Madame Web and Kraven in the same year, and they flopped just like everyone predicted. The movies were just plain bad, the scripts were terrible, the acting was meme-worthy at best, they made movies about villains but instead turned them into anti-heroes that barely do anything villainous, there was no fun \"popcorn\" spectacle to at least keep audiences interested like with Venom, and the marketing didn't make anyone want to see the movie. Contrary to popular belief, they didn't need to make all of these movies to keep the Spider-man film rights, they did it only because they genuinely believed audiences would go see them. And they could have included Spider-Man in these movies if they'd wanted to, but they chose not to under the belief that it would confuse audiences.\n\nSo what other Hollywood executive decisions do you believe were genuinely stupid ideas?",

I don't know why this was the case, but anything below that I usually didn't bother to watch. \n\nIn the last year I have been starting to slowly realise how bad of a metric that is. For example, Annihilation is 6.8/10 on IMDB and for years I put it off because of this exact stupid reason, it didn't met the quota of 7.5. After my friend nagged me multiple times to watch it, I finally gave in and oh my god that movie is amazing. There was particulary one scene that blew me away and immediately after watching the movie I started thinking of how many good movies I missed because of some stupid random metric I followed for years.\n\nSo my question is, are there any other movies that have under 7/10 rating on IMDB but are actually really good movies?",

        "content": "Both films have the same basic premise; Eastwood portraying a mysterious, nameless gunslinger (dubbed \"The Stranger\" in \"Drifter\" and \"Preacher\" in \"Rider\") who rides into an isolated community with a hidden agenda and gets involved in violent antics. But what they also share is the implication that both the Stranger and Preacher are not even human, but supernatural revenants back from the grave for retribution. Eastwood himself has especially liked this aspect and played it up since both films' releases (he even called Preacher an \"out and out ghost\") and it gives what would have been straight-forward Westerns an air of eeriness and dark fantasy (especially \"Drifter\", which often comes off like a horror movie).\n\nOf course, there's a lot of difference as well, since Preacher is a truly heroic figure (as expected give how much \"Rider\" owes to \"Shane\") while the Stranger is a VERY dark anti-hero. But the shared element of them being supernatural figures makes for an interesting back to back viewing.",

A yearly rewatch since 2003 at the least.\n\nThe jump in quality is astro-fucking-nomical from VHS to 4K.\n\nCan remember renting this in '98 from the Video Ezy. Riding my push bike home with 10 VHS for $10. Watching it in my dingy arse smelly teenager room.\n\nTo now, 4K, 50' inch LCD. Spotting the awesome flower decal on Esmeralda Villa Lobos's shirt. Or pieces of Martin's skull and brain in Jules hair after Vince shoots him.\n\nAnyone else got similar journeys of their own?",

        "content": "Regardless of your thoughts of the Shrek movies, or whether you believe the latter two films of the tetralogy get too much hate, almost all can agree that Shrek 1 and 2 are far superior to 3 and 4. I\u2019ve always wondered what caused this sudden drop in quality. The films weren\u2019t released very far apart from another and Shrek the Third picks up pretty much exactly where Shrek 2 left off. Yet, for whatever reason, the storytelling and quality of jokes simply come up lacking. Worse yet, the pacing in Shrek 3 seems glacial compared to the rapid-fire speed of the precious film. Does anyone have any theories as to why this happened?",

Kind of wish there where lol\n\nEdit: Here's the trailer\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BKU85IV0_Bw",

As absurdly illegal as \"Lethal Weapon\" climactic executions of criminal cartels might seem, the government had legalized it, at least in terms of insane \"Lethal Weapon\" world where nobody says a goddamn thing about this, in the next movie. Their diplomatic immunity was revoked, they'd murdered 9 cops or whatever--obviously that would be no bullshit in fictional or real world--and invite extreme reactions. \n\nSo me and my friend were asking AI and all the answers are bullshit. I guess I stop at script-intent: these movies were very fast. Maybe they wanted you to think Riggs and Murtaugh were on suicide mission, but now it was kinda-legal, at the end? Obviously: these are the bad guys. They got shot in the head.",
