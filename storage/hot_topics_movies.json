        "content": "And this is coming from someone who isn't even a Transformers fan. IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).\n\nTrailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.\n\nAfter having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.\n\nSadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. \n\nOne way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.\n\nBy no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. \n\nBut overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, this might sound harsh but whoever done the marketing and trailer deserves to be fired. Whoever you were, you ended up dooming this amazing movie to fail.\n\nP.S.: I didn't think Brian Tyrian Lee of all people could have pulled off a great Megatron.",

        "content": "A recent strange phenomenon is how Hollywood goes out of its way to hide the fact that musicals are musicals in the marketing. The trailers won't show any of the characters singing and will make it look like it's a normal movie. The reason for this seems to be that marketing teams know that some people don't like musicals, so they think they can get them to buy a ticket by tricking them into thinking a musical is not a musical and I guess hope that they won't bother doing any research beforehand. Wonka and Mean Girls are some recent examples of this.\n\nBut Hollywood does this kind of deceitful marketing all the time. Most infamously, the movie [Kangaroo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyLeUjuT_k)'s marketing made it look like a fun family movie with a talking kangaroo that raps, but in reality it's a comedic crime movie for adults and the kangaroo barely appears and only talks in one scene where a character is hallucinating. In fact, the movie was originally R-Rated and was going to be called Down and Under, but then was retitled and edited to a PG rating by producers because the kangaroo scene was the only think test audiences liked.\n\nSo what other movie marketing campaigns tried to basically trick audiences into thinking that the movie was going to be about something else or even of a different genre?",

I was absolutely blown away by the visuals as well as the acting by the main character Rohan Chand (at just 14 years old).  I was shocked to find out it was made in 2018, I feel like the visuals are above and beyond much of what I see from movies made today in 2025. And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I'd ever normally expect from an actor that age. \n\nOf course there was massive departure from the \"original\" story, but that didn't bother me at all, it's its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. \n\nThe only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn't do justice to their nostalgia for the \"original(s)\". \n\nThe few reviewers who mentioned uncanny valley also baffle me.  I'm as adverse as the next guy to poorly animated humans and other creatures who speak, but I felt none of that in Mowgli. The animals with speech were remarkably believable and relatable. \n\nI searched and read threads on reddit from just after it came out, and most seemed to share the same criticisms as the critics, but I'm curious if that is still the consensus?\n\nThose who loved, and loathed, this wonderful movie, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions.

        "content": "There are plot twists, and then there are *those* plot twists. The kind that make you sit in silence during the credits, questioning everything you just watched. The ones that make you want to immediately rewatch the movie just to catch all the hints you missed.\n\nFor me, *The Sixth Sense* was a game-changer. The way the twist recontextualized the entire movie was genius\u2014I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Then there\u2019s *Fight Club*, which completely shattered my perception of what I had just seen. The unreliable narrator trope had never hit me that hard before.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on *The Prestige*. That final reveal still lives rent-free in my head. The moment you realize just how far Borden and Angier went for their craft? Chilling.\n\nWhat\u2019s a movie twist that absolutely blew your mind? The kind that made you rethink everything as soon as the credits rolled?",

        "content": "Seth Rogen has been a major figure in the film industry for almost two decades now, and in that time, a lot has been said about him, his abilities, the type of movies he makes and more recently, his political values\n\nThe one thing I've rarely seen people discuss is his insane record in terms of well made [movies and shows ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sethrogen)(both as a performer and producer)\n\nJust in the past few years, he has acted in movies like Dumb Money, Fablemans, Long Shot and American Pickle, while producing TMNT:Mutant Mayhem, Joy Ride, Good Boys and Blockers. That's without talking about his hit-making run in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, or his TV show resume, which is arguably even more impressive (he's literally about to come out with a show that has near-universal critical acclaim pre-release)\n\nUnlike other leading men who have a lot of well regarded stuff in their filmography, Rogen isn't really playing a numbers game. The man hasn't really been in a whole lot, it's just that a large portion of what he does do, is some version of good\n\n",
