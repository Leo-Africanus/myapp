I just want to take a moment to express my deep gratitude for your kindness and support over the past few months-it truly means the world to me. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about Sing Sing and the process of creating Like a Bird. However, I want to preface that I cannot speak on behalf of A24 or their team, as l'm not involved in their decision-making. That said, I'm more than happy to share insights about my experience writing the song and everything that happened within that creative space. If you haven't heard Like a Bird yet, would mean the world to me if you did and feel free to check out my debut album called SEA/SONS that I release in 23\\\\u2019. It features Gary Clark Jr. and Mavis Staples. Also, feel free to follow me on social media (@abrahamalexander) to stay updated on everything happening along the way! Looking forward to the conversations\n\nBest,\n\nAbraham",

I always thought he made that prayer up.

I really like finding out peoples favourite movies on specific actors because I like to see the wide variety of picks people have and learning of underrated gems. \n\nSome of his movies like The French Connection (1971), Unforgiven (1992), The Conversation (1974), and Enemy of the State (1998) are my favourites from him and he's become one of my favourite actors.\n\nHis good guy roles and bad guy roles are both fantastic but I think my personal preference would be when he's the villain because he's so good at it.\n\nHis portrayal of Lex Luthor is also my favourite in Superman (1978).\n\nThis year he'll have been retired for 21 years, with his last movie being released in 2004.\n\nI think that he only has one credited voice acting role which would be General Mandible in Antz (1998).  \n\n\nWhat are your favourites?",

I also don't mind the shakycam in those movies too as at least you can focus on what's going on in those scenes.\n\nBut one thing I will say is how it kickstarted shaky cam in action movies for the worse. After Bourne Supremacy, every filmmaker decided to start including shakycam in action movies. Batman Begins was an early example of shakycam in action movies and then we had dozens more that had shaky cam until the trend finally went away once people found out that people couldn't replicate Bourne's shakycam. Even in The Bourne Identity, there was some shaky cam (especially the first act) in that film also.\n\nI ain't talking about The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Jason Bourne (2016) as we talk about those an another day in a separate post. But for a while, shaky cam in action movies were a huge trend around Hollywood.",

Channing Tatum also delivers an incredible performance. such a great movie overall and i wish it got more recognition because wow.",

        "content": "Spoilers obviously\n\nMine is from Pirates of the Carribean At World's End.\n\nThe scene where Lord Cuttler Beckett dies. He had everything, he was the most powerful man on earth, he thought he was going to win and kill all the pirates... but then the Dutchman betrayed him and fired at his ship together with Black Pearl. He's helpless, there is nothing he can do. His army panics, they are abandoning the ship... and their captain? He just walks down the stairs, surrounded by chaos, destruction, explosion until the fire consumes him and the death takes him. And all that, together with glorious music by Hanz Zimmer.\n\n\nAlso my other beloved death scenes are Maximus Decimus Meridius, Darth Vader and Boromir. ",

        "content": "I do feel like the obvious answer has to be Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition DVD special features, but when I think back I can't remember a time I wouldn't bring up the Shrek DVD special features either. Clerks special edition had a lot of cool extra content and feature too, pretty much any Kevin Smith project had great feautres. I would say anything with Kevin Smith, PTA, Wes Anderson, Tarantino, and Cohen Brothers I was always super into.\n\nGrowing up I would take an 8th of shrooms and bring 3 DVDs up to my room and just have a marathon while I couldn't sleep. \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was always a go-to for me, \"Life Aquatic with Steve Zisou\" was an amazing film that I liked a lot more on rewatch (definitely recommend an 8th to get very detail oriented for themes and even fun easter eggs), and usually a fight between \"Kung Pow:Enter the Fist\" if I wanted to just laugh my ass off, or \"O' Brother Where Art Thou\" if I really wanted to take my brain away and enjoy a masterpiece. \n\nIs there one in particular that comes to mind? It doesn't need to be pigeon-holed to just a movie I guess, DVDs for shows have great special features as well. \n\nThank you for commenting and keeping things respectful! ",

        "content": "Hello\nI'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny\u2014but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.\n\nMost movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts\u2014and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)\nIf you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!\nI hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything \ud83d\ude05. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!",
