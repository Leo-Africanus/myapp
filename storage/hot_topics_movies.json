        "content": "Dang, what a movie.\n\nNow I would not say that it is the best movie of all time, of course, but I have to say that I was hooked from beginning to end. They did everything really well, from the acting, fight scenes, story, plot, and even nailed the quiet moments of the characters.  It felt like Steins; Gate having a baby with Helldivers 2. \n\nTom Cruise's acting in this movie was excellent for me, as the realism of his being put on the frontlines that he never experienced was immaculate. I have always known him as the \"Mission: Impossible\" guy, but he totally showed how he is a genuinely good actor. Emily Blunt as the full metal was really cool as well. Her chemistry with Tom really felt like they were real people fighting to save the world. \n\nOverall, this movie was such a treat. Going into a movie blind is the best way for me to watch, as it can surprise me in so many ways. Since I'm a massive fan of Steins; Gate and Helldivers, this movie gets a 9/10 for me. I'm kind of saddened to the fact that no one really remembers this movie.",

One of the characters was this extremely violent ghost haunting in the subway system, played by Vincent Schiavelli. \n\nThat character scared the crap out of me. His appearance was one thing, but the other thing was his mental state and awful afterlife situation. He was able to speak rationally, even kindly, to other characters for a little while, before his paranoia overcame him and he would be violent and terrified again. He was killed because he was pushed into an incoming train, or maybe he jumped. Who knows how long ago - maybe a very long time ago. It was like he went mad from being in limbo for so long, or maybe he was a crazy homeless person before, but he was wearing really beautiful clothing. So we are maybe supposed to doubt it. I was always very upset by and afraid of him.\n\nDid you ever watch a movie not designed for scares and just get totally frightened of a character? Maybe you were a kid too, or maybe it was something else that got you. Who was the character? Why did you get scared?",

        "title": "1986's \"The Wraith\" is one of the strangest cult films of the 80s; a genre-hopping road rage revenge flip that also happens to be inspired by a Clint Eastwood Western.",
        "content": "That's not a joke; the writer/director admitted he based it in no small part on \"High Plains Drifter\" with the plot of a mysterious and apparently supernatural avenger coming into a small town to wreak havoc. Except while \"Drifter\" is deliberately ambiguous, \"The Wraith\" is about as subtle as a brick to the face as its otherworldly vigilante drives around in a fantastical car that can appear and disappear at will and dresses up in a quasi-superhero outfit. And while \"Drifter\" was morally ambiguous, this one is straight up revenge wish fulfillment with the villains (let by Nick Cassavetes long before he followed in his dad's footsteps behind the camera) all cartoons you can't wait to see eat it. (Two of them are like an evil Bill and Ted prototype with one dressing like a \"Mad Max\" cosplayer and the other with teeth that'd make a dentist weep.) Plus, the acting is...well, often shaky to say the least. (Sherilyn Fenn as the leading lady is absolutely gorgeous, but her acting notably improved between this and \"Twin Peaks\" a few years later.)\n\nThat said, goofy as it is, the movie is a lot of fun. It comes off a lot of the time like an 80s music video expanded to feature length, has lots of fun car chases and explosions and numerous future name actors like Charlie Sheen as the charming newcomer who romances Fenn (gee, wonder if he has anything to do with the titular avenger) and Clint Howard, sporting an \"Eraserhead\" hairdo as the most sympathetic of the bad guy gang. (Randy Quaid also shows up as the local sheriff investigating the matter but also openly not caring if the punks get wiped out.) And I find it impressive how many genres this film encompasses. Is it an action movie? Teen drama? Road race? Horror? Fantasy? Revenge saga? A little bit of everything. Throw in a quintessential 80s soundtrack and you've got a fun if singularly bizarre time.\n\nAnd yes, if it sounds like \"The Crow\" as well some of the time, you're not alone.",

        "content": "I've been getting into watching movies again, however most of the time I cant see them beyond the story and the cinematography. I feel like I've watched so many good movies but I cant observe the deeper level  nuances, such as the underlying themes and metaphors, or see the director's vision as I watch along, and only get it after watching a video essay on the particular film, and then end up feeling like an idiot for not seeing it. I'll give you an example. Just today I watched the Darjeeling Limited, and it was apparently criticized for the metaphor of the fathers luggage that they carry around representing the emotional baggage they hold, and it really is obvious and I feel really dumb not getting things like that, because I know I would appreciate the movie 10x more if I was able to pick up on those ideas. Is there any way of bettering or improving this ability? I wanna see movies more as art, not just entertainment.",
