        "title": "\"The Boys from Brazil\" is on prime. I had never seen it before but I liked it.",
        "content": "It was made and set in the mid 70s. It's really kind of a thriller/mystery/detective storyline with a touch of sci-fi mixed in. The mystery being solved is not the ending either, which I kind of generally appreciate in a movie. The ending is kind of a 'be careful what you wish for' type closing.\n\nI can't believe that at age 56, I had never seen it. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but the story moves along well and is not complicated to follow. The mystery unfolds at a satisfying pace.\n\nFictional tale based on the historically factual tragedy of Nazi war criminals from WW2 escaping prosecution by fleeing Europe to South America. The movie imagines how these evil people would spend their time under the radar of modern civilization. \n\nPlus, Gregory Peck in what I would call an unusual role for him as an actor. Watch it. It's not a waste of time.",

Idk if just something wasn\u2019t clicking for me but literally it felt like 0 chemistry. Like very underwhelming to watch.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to bash the movie, I think those actors are extremely talented and maybe to most people their chemistry seemed fine but I just could not see anything and turned it off half way through. Maybe the way they like interact is so different to each other or just doesn\u2019t really flow. Idk\n\nAnyone feel similar? Or do you feel their chemistry was great? Very curious as to what people\u2019s take is on this. ",
