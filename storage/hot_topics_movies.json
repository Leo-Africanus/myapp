The writers wrote the story, then upon speaking to their representatives, they learned that Bad Robot was looping in pre-existing screenplays into the Cloververse, which became a cause for concern for the two writers. It was Paramount who decided against this, and allowed the film to be developed and released independently of the Cloververse as intended. \n\nEdit: As suggested in the comments, don't forget to provide sources to properly prevent the spread of more rumours.

        "title": "I watched and rated every 1990s Pauly Shore movie this weekend",
        "content": "As we all know, Pauly Shore was the pinnacle of comedy in the 1990s, and Hollywood has been chasing that high ever since. With recent real world events wreaking havoc on my mental health, I decided to spend this weekend zoning out with The Weasel and bringing myself back to the simpler days of my childhood. It's been a long time since I've watched a Pauly Shore movie, and I knew before I started that this could possibly turn into a harrowing experience, but I was determined to stick it through.\n\nFull spoilers ahead.\n\n___\n\n**Encino Man \u2013 1992**\n\nPauly Shore\u2019s leading man career started with *Encino Man*. As you\u2019re probably aware (unless you're too young to remember), this movie also served as Brendan Fraser\u2019s breakout role, and he would then go on to carve his own path through the \u201890s. Co-starring Sean Astin, *Encino Man* tells the story of best friends Dave (Astin) and Stoney (Shore). After an earthquake uncovers a frozen caveman (Fraser) in Dave\u2019s backyard, the two friends thaw him out and discover that he\u2019s still alive. They name him Link, get Dave\u2019s parents to believe he\u2019s a foreign exchange student from Estonia, and enroll him in high school as a senior. Link is immediately popular, shenanigans ensue, and at the end of the movie, he gives bad boy villain Matt (Michael DeLuise) his comeuppance at prom by spinning him in circles and throwing him into a cake. He\u2019s then crowned prom king, and the movie ends with a party at Dave\u2019s house where Stoney and Link discover that another earthquake has uncovered a living cavewoman\u2014Link\u2019s partner from the ice age.\n\n*Encino Man* is a strong introduction to everything Pauly Shore sort of represented at the time: being yourself, shunning cultural expectations, and just having a good time. The biggest surprise upon re-watching this film was realizing that Matt isn\u2019t the real villain in the story (although he is an asshole). The real villain is Sean Astin\u2019s character Dave. From the very beginning, he makes it clear that he only wants to use Link so he can get popular and finally grab the attention of his crush, Robyn. And he sticks with this until the final act when he realizes that Link is more trouble than he\u2019s worth\u2014so he literally ditches him on the side of the road like a dog, leading to [the most dramatic scene in the film]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npOGUD3g454). Stoney, meanwhile, is the voice of reason. He teaches Link important things like weezing the juice, eating grindage, and flirting with nugs. But most importantly, he teaches him about friendship.\n\nWhile Encino Man isn\u2019t my favorite Pauly Shore movie, I definitely consider it necessary viewing if you want to understand what it means to be The Weasel. And a fun fact for those doing their own Pauly Shore marathon: Brendan Fraser\u2019s Link makes a cameo appearance in several other Pauly flicks!\n\nRegular movie rating: 6/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 7.5/10\n\n___\n\n**Son in Law \u2013 1993** \n\nThe Weasel goes to the country in this fish out of water tale. Becca (Carla Gugino) is a South Dakotan farmgirl. After graduating from high school, she goes to college in the lawless land of California. Her first two months are rough, and right when she\u2019s about to give up, her RA Crawl (Pauly Shore) intervenes and convinces her to stick around and let loose. One transformation montage later, Becca is now weezing and munching grindage with the best of them. Now it\u2019s Thanksgiving break, and it\u2019s time to see her family for the first time since becoming Becca 2.0. When she learns that Crawl will be alone over break, she brings him home to South Dakota. At dinner on their first night back, Becca\u2019s high school boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier) proposes. Becca doesn\u2019t want to marry him, so Crawl intervenes by saying that he and Becca are already engaged! Everyone is shocked, and the rest of the film is Crawl learning to be a bit more country while teaching everyone else to live a bit more like the Weasel. The movie ends with the family finding out that Travis roofied Crawl and Becca\u2019s best friend Tracy (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) to make it look like they slept together. Becca and Crawl kick him to the curb, and the two announce that they\u2019re putting the wedding on hold for now.\n\nI legitimately enjoy this movie, and it\u2019s my second favorite Pauly Shore film. Yes, it\u2019s dumb and critically panned like all his movies, but Pauly shines through much better in this than in Encino Man since he contrasts so well with the good ol\u2019 country folk of South Dakota. He even gets through to Becca\u2019s parents and grandparents about not judging people by first appearances. This movie also has a great supporting cast including Lane Smith (fresh off *The Mighty Ducks*), Cindy Pickett (aka Mrs. Bueller), and Patrick Renna (who won our hearts as Ham in *The Sandlot* that same year).\n\nRegular movie rating: 7/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 9/10\n\n___\n\n**In the Army Now \u2013 1994** \n\nDespite the \u201890s homophobia and Arabphobia, I think this movie is Pauly Shore\u2019s strongest, as he mostly abandons his Weasel persona for a straight up goofball comedy. Bones (Pauly Shore) and his best friend Jack (Andy \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit\u201d Dick) want to open their own stereo store but don\u2019t have enough money\u2014so they join the army reserves. Under the impression that after basic training they\u2019ll never see combat, they of course get called up due to a conflict in Chad. Specializing in water purification along with their squad mates Christine (Lori Petty) and Fred (David Alan Grier), they discover that they\u2019re actually really good at their jobs. But after a mission they\u2019re assigned to goes wrong, they become stranded in the desert until they\u2019re eventually captured by Libyans, who are preparing to fire chemical weapons at U.S. bases. With the help of another captured American soldier, Sgt. Stern (Esai Morales), they escape the prison during an attack, rendezvous with a special ops supply drop, and pinpoint the weapons with a laser targeting system so the Americans can blow up the Libyan base and save the day. The movie ends with Bones and Jack opening their new store.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this movie way more times in my life than any reasonable person should, and it\u2019s definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Having Pauly Shore just be a regular idiot rather than his Weasel character makes all the silliness much more palatable, as his usual schtick would be way too annoying and unbelievable in a military situation. Once again, a strong supporting cast makes this film better than it should be (even Andy Dick is bearable). Lori Petty doesn\u2019t disappoint as the badass female soldier and Bones\u2019 love interest, and one of my favorite character actors, Art LaFleur, appears as the squadron\u2019s commanding officer. However, since this is Pauly Shore at his highest, things can only go down from here\u2026\n\nRegular movie rating: 7.5/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 10/10\n\n___\n\n**Jury Duty \u2013 1995** \n\nAnd the decline is incredibly steep. Even on the Pauly Shore bell curve, this movie is awful, just absolute shit all around. Tommy Collins (Pauly Shore) has no job, no money, and nowhere to live when his mother and her boyfriend decide to drive their trailer to Vegas to get married. Luckily for Tommy, he\u2019s just been chosen for jury duty. He manipulates the system to get put onto a case that will take a long time to prosecute so he can keep taking advantage of the free lodging and food (he gets himself into a fancy hotel suite while the rest of the jurors are staying in crappy rooms). Once jury deliberations begin, he continually stalls by claiming the defendant is innocent, pulling off his worst Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men impression (a scene of which literally features in this movie to hammer home to the audience what\u2019s happening). All good things come to an end, though, when another juror, Monica (Tia Carrere) discovers Tommy\u2019s plan. The judge declares a mistrial and the jury is dismissed. But Tommy believes in himself, discovers that the real killer was actually on the jury the whole time, and the killer is caught at the end thanks to plot conveniences.\n\nI laughed *once* during this movie, and it was near the beginning after a dumb but clever joke about tuna fish. While this was obviously written for Pauly Shore, I can\u2019t actually put all the blame on him because the writing is dreadful and does him no favors. The three credited screenwriters are clearly trying to go for a Zucker brothers vibe with the humor a la *The Naked Gun* and *Top Secret!*, but they fail at almost every opportunity. That, along with way too many dated transphobia jokes, make this an absolute slog to watch. The real crime, though, is that this movie wastes an absolutely STACKED cast. Just look at this [IMDB page]( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113500/)! Along with Stanley Tucci and Shelley Winters (in a very small role as Tommy\u2019s mom), this trash is filled with some amazing character actors. It\u2019s such a shame that so much talent was wasted here.\n\nRegular movie rating: 2/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 2/10\n\n___\n\n**Bio-Dome \u2013 1996** \n\nNot as bad as Jury Duty, but still terrible, *Bio-Dome* is the story of stoner best friends Bud (Pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen \u201cDefinitely the worst brother\u201d Baldwin), who accidentally get trapped in a Bio-Dome\u2014a yearlong environmental science experiment to see if humans can survive in a carefully crafted microcosm world. After completely destroying the experiment to the chagrin of the scientists inside, they realize that they owe it to everyone to try and save the dome. Several plot conveniences later, they do, and the movie mercifully ends.\n\nThe first two thirds of this movie made me want to claw my eyes out, but the final third does have a handful of jokes that made me chuckle (though I literally can\u2019t remember them even though I\u2019m writing this 10 minutes after finishing the movie). My biggest issue with this film compared to other, much better stoner flicks, is that Bud and Doyle seemingly go out of their way to be complete inconsiderate assholes. They have less common sense than a six-year-old and are so selfish for most of the movie, it defies logic. Most of the \u201cjokes\u201d throughout the film are for their own amusement, as they constantly laugh at their own antics. There are also a couple of horribly dated \u201csexual assault for laughs\u201d jokes, such as when Bud and Doyle sneak into bed with two of the female scientists (one of whom is played by Kylie Minogue). The high point of this movie is a very brief appearance from a young Tenacious D.\n\nRegular movie rating: 3/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 3/10\n\n___\n\n**The Curse of Inferno \u2013 1997** \n\nEven though I grew up in the \u201890s and saw what I thought was every Pauly Shore movie that decade, I somehow never even heard of this. I only found out about it when looking at his IMDB page to see what order to watch these films in. It doesn't even have a [Rotten Tomatoes score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_curse_of_inferno), and that site lists this as 1996, while IMDB lists it as 1997. Was this actually released in theaters?\n\nRegardless, this one was a surprise, as it\u2019s not a \u201cPauly Shore movie,\u201d but rather a movie with Pauly Shore in it. *The Curse of Inferno* is sort of a Coen Brothers-esque caper about two friends, Chuck (Pauly Shore) and Harold (Max Perlich), who rob a bank at the same time as two other robbers. They hide the money in the bank before escaping, but when Chuck has a change of heart and decides to return the money, he finds out it\u2019s gone. The rest of the story is a bit of a mess. The money is actually being laundered by a greedy local businessman, Moles Huddenel (Ned Beatty), who wants to get it back. At the same time, the local sheriff (Blue Deckert) is also trying to get the money. And the police officer, Layla (Janine Turner), who Chuck falls in love with, is actually an FBI agent who\u2019s using Chuck to take down Moles. Everything works out in the end, and the FBI take down both the sheriff and Moles.\n\nI was not expecting a \u201cserious\u201d Pauly Shore film. It\u2019s not a great movie, but it\u2019s definitely not terrible. Pauly does an admirable job reeling in his usual zaniness for a more restrained, dimwitted country boy character. The biggest problem is that the plot is just very convoluted. With a better script, this could\u2019ve been a \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d film of his career. He certainly doesn\u2019t have the acting chops of other comedians in serious roles like Robin Williams or Jim Carey, but I can\u2019t help feeling that this film did him a disservice and might have dissuaded him from attempting other more serious roles in the future. I'd love to live in the alternate reality where Pauly Shore abandoned his past stereotypes and tried to be a real actor. Even though it\u2019s not a great movie, I do recommend checking this one out simply for the novelty of seeing Pauly Shore in a drama.\n\nRegular movie rating: 5/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: Not applicable\n\n___\n\nSo, what did I learn from this marathon? Probably that Pauly Shore is exactly who I remembered him to be, but in another timeline, perhaps he could have been something more? His comedy is absolutely a relic of the '90s, and even though two of these movies were hot garbage, I am glad I decided to watch them all. He's still kicking around today and collecting paychecks, but the heyday of The Weasel is certainly over.",

        "title": "I might just be dumb but I genuinely enjoyed 'Trap'",
        "content": "I actually saw this at an early screening so it was before any of the reviews had come out, and having been all over the board with M Night, I never really know what to expect, but the concept for this one was more interesting to me than either of the last two movies he's made, so I was at least curious to check it out.\n\nAs far as the 'believability' of it, I was a little surprised how many people seemed to just totally be in shock that M Night would make a film with a ridiculous concept, given that he also made a movie about a beach that makes you old, meaning I wasn't exactly holding out for stark realism. I admit, it is an absurd premise, but when the movie is being pitched as 'Silence of the Lambs at a Taylor Swift concert', I'm not going into it expecting anything other than entertaining schlock, which is exactly what I got. It feels like a slightly shitty De Palma movie, but I'll take a flawed, original concept over fucking Venom 3 or Red One any day.\n\nThe main reason this works at all, for me at least, is Josh Hartnett. M Night movies live or die on their characters, and while this is nowhere near Bruce Willis in Unbreakable or James McAvoy in Split, I still thought he really understood exactly what he needed to bring, and the fact that it was contextualized as 'an obsessive serial killer in a highly tense situation having to feign normalcy' made the signature weird Shyamalan dialogue make a lot more sense, especially when the daughter would call him out on sounding weird.\n\nHis performance (and the film in general) has been compared to the Hitman games, and I think that's pretty apt. It's also a movie where the overall quality of the production combined with the ridiculousness helps make it feel like 'polished/\"elevated\" schlock', which studios aren't really making a lot of anymore, for better or for worse.\n\nAfter rewatching it on streaming the other night just to see if anything had changed from the early version I saw (it hadn't), I can definitely admit the hype of being at a screening gave me a bit of a rose-tinted view of it the first time, but in general I still thought it was a fun movie with more self awareness than Shyamalan usually has, and had enough fun with its concept that I was a little bummed when it seemed like most people really weren't digging it, at least at first. Curious how y'all felt about this one.",

        "title": "A lot of Blumhouse movies are the cheapest and worst written horror movies you'll ever see.",
        "content": "Here's the thing Jason Blum I think he's a very smart producer where he sets a limit on most of his movies budget to $5-10 million dollars so they can easily make a profit for the studio and he's discovered new talent like Jordan Peele and Christopher Landon to name a few. Plus horror is a hot genre in cinema right now so why not fund more of them.\n\nBut damn a lot of other Blumhouse movies are just too cheap, cliched, amateurish, and honestly too safe even for R-rated horror movie standards for my tastes. Like for god's sake I've seen horror films from A24 and Neon or other horror films that premiered at festivals  like Sundance or SXSW that were produced in the same budget if not lower than a Blumhouse movie, and they look and feel way more professional and most of them are directed by first timers. Not too mention they didn't need major studio hindering and interference to make movies up to their standards",

        "title": "The real meaning of the phrase 'The Quick and the Dead'.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/skeogtwb6k1e1.jpg?width=312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b580fe6ce5512c0481fa262cdaccb9b90e56b2\n\nI always thought the title of this kitschy western about cowboys &amp; girls duels was cool. But I didn't realise it's a word play on the olde English meaning.\n\nI was watching an episode of 'Wolf Hall' on the BBC. A drama about 16th century English king Henry the 8th.  \nIn the drama, Thomas Cromwell laments that he has wronged people who are no longer alive. He talks about how you can change the mind of someone who is alive but not someone who is dead. But he uses odd middle English phrasing.  \n  \nHe says, \"*You can persuade the quick, but how do you remake your reputation with the dead*?\"  \n  \nInstead of 'alive' he uses the phrase 'quick'. Which made me think of The Gene Hackman, Russel Crow, Sharon Stone, Leonardo Decaprio movie 'The Quick and the Dead'. A title which obviously refers to those who are a quick draw surviving and those who are not quick being killed.  \n  \nUpon researching how a phrase 'quick and dead' made it into medieval dialogue, I found that the movie title is actually inspired by the Apostles' Creed used in some Catholic and Protestant church services \"*He shall come to judge the quick and the dead*\"  \n  \nIn this case, \u2018quick\u2019 is derived from the Olde English \u2018cwic\u2019 to mean, \u2018alive\u2019 or \u2018moving\u2019 or \u2018animated\u2019.  \n  \nSo the movie title of \u2018The Quick and the Dead\u2019 literally just means \u2018The living and the dead\u2019. But of course, it\u2019s also a clever wordplay about quick draw gunfighters.",

        "content": "What. A. Fantastic. Movie.\n\nSo I'm on rewatch number: ??? and once again I'm left entertained and satisfied by this wonderful movie from Peter Weir. \n\nI think this is Russell Crowes best role. Of course his performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius was iconic but his performance as Captain Jack Aubrey was, imo, on another level. I'll admit I haven't read the books so I'm not 100% sure he physically resembles his book counterpart.\n\nOpposite him is a wonderful Paul Bettany as Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Their friendship is the heat of the movie and Crowe and Bettany sold me on what is a living friendship between two rather different men. \n\nMy favorite character is Mr. Blakeney. His entire character arc is fantastic start to finish, post his arm surgery is some great story telling seeing as he leads a boarding party to great effect. \n\nThe best sequence is of course the expedition on the Galapagos island where Stephen intended name a tortoise after Aubrey. I do think using Prelude is cheating seeing as it's a excellent piece of music. \n\nWe also get a few haunting scenes.\n\nWe have a man over board situation where the Captain is forced to cut wreckage loose ultimately dooming the sailor...and that sailor's friend had to assist in the cutting.\n\n Mr. Holm being scapegoated as a Jonah ends up committing suicide in a terrifying way...we see his eyes fade into the inky darkness of the sea as Mr. Blakeney looks on helpessly. \n\nThe best scene is the higher ranking officers at dinner getting hammered and making weevil puns.\n\nIt's a 10/10 movie and a crying shame we didn't get any other movies from Weir.",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than 20 days, I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. For example, two days ago, it was Italy's turn in this little filmic journey and I have to say: While I'm a bit disappointed, that literally nobody mentioned *A Roman Holiday* or (if you want a genuine italian movie to win) any part of the *Don Camillo* series, I think we have another deserving winner here. It got really exciting again: At one point it looked as if  *Ladri di biciclette* (engl.: *Bicycle Thieves*) would be the first film from the 40s to make the list, and in between there was a real neck-and-neck race with *La Vita E Bella* (engl.: *Life is Beautiful*), but in the end ***Nuovo Cinema Paradiso*** (that was only called *Cinema Paradiso* in the English distribution for whatever reason) has brought it home.\n\nBecause I started the next round a bit earlier yesterday (in order to watch *Gladiator II*, another movie mostly set in Italy), I have another winner to announce. The victory here was very clear - the only controversy in some parts of the world might be that I see the region in question as a country in its own right. Nevertheless, I am happy to give ***Zgjoi*** (engl.: *Hive*) a spot in [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). before we move on to the next country: **Latvia**. For those of you who are still new here, here are the two rules of this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n# \n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italia - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "content": "I'm a sucker for a good Western movie but somehow, mostly due to negative critical response, I had never watched Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp. I finally watched it last night and I was blown away.\n\nI know it often gets unfavourably compared with Tombstone, and I love Tombstone, but to me it's far more absorbing and an all round better film. You get a far better understanding of the Earps, their flawed personalities and what led to the OK Corral shootout and consequent vendetta.\n\nI struggle to understand what the critics issue with it was? Yes it was long, at just over 3 hours, but it never felt bloated. I never felt that any of it was over indulgent. The shootout at the OK Corral was, as far as I'm aware, pretty much true to life. Far more abrupt and less Hollywood than it's usually depicted.\n\nAlso the performances were superb. I never thought anyone could surpass Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, but Dennis Quaid was absolutely sensational and brought a dark, unhinged menace to the role that I really enjoyed. You can tell he's really struggling to hold his fraying will to live together.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind strapping in for a 3 hour biopic.",

        "content": "My wife and I started this tradition a couple of years ago, and now it'll be the [4th year](https://letterboxd.com/alex15210/list/2024-bleak-week-4/) of watching the most gut-wrenching, emotionally devastating films that we can stomach in the week leading up to the winter solstice.\n\nWe try to find films from various decades, countries, and subject matters, and we always try to include one documentary and one animated film. Here is this year's list (in no particular order):\n\n- When the Wind Blows\n- Deliver Us From Evil\n- Incendies\n- Vagabond\n- Frownland\n- Pixote\n- A Visitor to the Museum\n\nAnd if you're interested, here is our lists from:\n\n- [2021](https://letterboxd.com/alex15210/list/2021-bleak-week-1/) (only 6 movies because we really needed an emotional recovery day)\n- [2022](https://letterboxd.com/alex15210/list/2022-bleak-week-2/)\n- [2023](https://letterboxd.com/alex15210/list/2023-bleak-week-3/).\n\nMy \"favorite\" (?) films so far have been Threads, Streetwise, Kes, They Shoot Horses Don't They?, Limbo, and Boat People.\n\nAnd here is our general [Bleak Week watch list](https://letterboxd.com/alex15210/list/bleak-week-watch-list/) if anyone wants to add some suggestions. (Note: yes, we've already seen Requiem For a Dream, every Haneke film, The Road, The Mist, etc.) We're also planning to binge all of B\u00e9la Tarr's films.",

        "content": "I'm sure there's a range here, but generally when you see something like Seven Bucks for The Rock or Plan B for Brad Pitt, what can you expect the behind the scenes work to be to get this production credit?  In The Rock's case it almost seems like it's just a requirement for him appearing in the movie.  Does he actually get involved in getting the movie made beyond slapping his name on it?  Meanwhile I've seen a lot of Plan B movies that don't have Brad Pitt in them, so I'm guessing they're actually involved in getting the movie produced.\n\nSo what's the typical involvement like? What differentiates a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson from a movie Starring Dwayne Johnson &amp; Produced by Seven Bucks?  And why/how are these different than just \"Executive Producer Nicole Kidman\" or something?",
