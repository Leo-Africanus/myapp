One that has to depend on nostalgia, and where the acting is just not good at all.  \n\nJurassic Park is my favorite movie ever and I think the Lost World is a worthy sequel.  But I don\u2019t think any other film in the franchise is higher then a 5/10. \n\n",

        "title": "Shane Black's 'Play Dirty' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*An expert thief rolls out the biggest heist of his life in Play Dirty, an action-packed thriller from director Shane Black. Parker (Mark Wahlberg), along with Grofield (LaKeith Stanfield), Zen (Rosa Salazar) and a skilled crew, stumble onto a score that pits them against the New York mob in this gritty, clever caper.*\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, LaKeith Stanfield, Rosa Salazar, Keegan Michael-Key, Chukwudi Iwuji,\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [66%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_dirty_2025_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [55 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/play-dirty/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Collider - Nate Richard](https://collider.com/play-dirty-review-mark-wahlberg-lakeith-stanfield-shane-black/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;If you watch *Play Dirty* expecting something on the level of *The Nice Guys* or *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, you will be disappointed. However, the latest action-comedy from Black proves that he's still capable of delivering an equal parts funny and action-heavy comedy with all the trademarks that make us love him as a filmmaker. It's a straight-to-streaming movie starring Mark Wahlberg, and considering some of the movie star's other recent films, such as *The Family Plan* and *The Union*, *Play Dirty* is far better than you'd expect it to be.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/play-dirty-movie-review-prime-video-mark-wahlberg-1235153455/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;More to the point, it\u2019s a \u201cParker\u201d reboot with an eye toward franchise potential, which is something about it that would\u2019ve made Westlake happy (he only allowed productions to use that name if they agreed to produce a whole series of films based on his books). And while this isn\u2019t *quite* the stuff of vintage Black, it\u2019s close enough that I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing him crank another one out every two years for the next decade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/play-dirty-review-mark-wahlberg-amazon-prime-video-movie/)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n&gt;You can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, but you have to know how to crack them, or you could end up with a bowl full of shells. And you have to know how to cook them, or else they lose their texture. \u201cPlay Dirty\u201d makes for a decent omelette, but the recipe is a little off, and that\u2019s annoying because we\u2019re hungry for a great Parker movie. We\u2019ve had a lot of adaptations, actually, but only a few did the job right (John Boorman\u2019s \u201cPoint Blank\u201d remains the gold standard). But if you\u2019re starving for caper flicks, \u201cPlay Dirty\u201d is just hard-boiled enough to satisfy. It just isn\u2019t up to Parker\u2019s own high, and highly professional, professional standards.",

        "content": "So I was curious about little details from older movies that modern audiences might not realize or fully appreciate/understand.\n\nTake Jaws for example, the famous scene where Quint crushes the can of beer in his hand.  I didn't realize until someone pointed out to me that beer cans were much thicker and were made of steel instead of aluminum.  They were difficult to crush unlike modern cans and doing so was seen as a genuine feat of strength.\n\nOr something else I recently learned was that there was also an old etiquette rule where men who were seated would stand up if a woman entered the room out of respect.  This is now an outdated custom which has been in decline since the ~~90s~~ 70s.  \n\nI'm sure there are some people who might still do it especially in more formal settings, but at 25 this is a rule I was never taught.  \n\n*Edited for mistake and spelling \n\n*Thanks to everyone who commented, it's been fun reading your answers! I did not expect this to blow up like it did!\n",

However, when Jeffrey falls for a divorced mom, his double life starts to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.*\n\nDirector: Derek Cianfrace ('The Place Beyond The Pines', 'Blue Valentine')\n\nCast: Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, Peter Dinklage, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple, Ben Mendehlson, Toni Revolori\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [82% (34 reviews)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roofman)\n\n**Metacritic:** [67 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roofman/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Empire - Sophie Butcher](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/roofman/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum\u2019s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/roofman-review-channing-tatum-1236510112/)\n\n&gt;In the end, it\u2019s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing. Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies all those years ago, as the star\u2019s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who\u2019s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith. While she plays Leigh as closed off to love, leave it to Tatum to find that unconventional point of entry.\n\n[TheWrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/roofman-review-channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-are-a-charmingly-doomed-couple-in-dark-rom-com/)\n\n&gt;The tonal juggling act isn\u2019t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give Roofman its life. It\u2019s a sad movie, really, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn\u2019t make sense, maybe it\u2019s the whole point.",
