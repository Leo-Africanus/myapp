I knew that Paul Giamatti was in this film and I knew it took place somewhere between the 70s and the 80s. And let me tell you from the minute it started I was hooked on the performances the characters the overall feeling of just not being with your loved ones during Christmas time and spending it with strangers really touched me that I never knew a Christmas movie could before. There will always be the classic Christmas movies that we all can fall on, but there isn\u2019t too many that I can recall within this current decade that has hits me as much as the holdovers. From the sentimental moments Da vine Joy, to the hilarious back-and-forth with Dominic and Paul , to the heartbreaking moments with Dominic\u2018s parents. I will now watch this film every Christmas time.\n\n",

I couldn\u2019t find anything anywhere. Not online, not in print shops, not even after trying to reach out directly to the film\u2019s production team (I actually tried\u2026 zero response \ud83d\ude05).\n\nSince so many fans seem to have the same struggle, I finally decided I\u2019d just recreate it myself, staying as true to the \u201890s look as possible.\n\nSame black-and-white vibe with that subtle blue tint\u2026 Alyssa\u2019s face framed the same way\u2026 the serif title in the exact spot\u2026 even the quote under the red censor bar rebuilt accurately. I matched the typography, the shadows, the contrast, everything. And it\u2019s clean enough for an 18\" \u00d7 36\" print.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this here because I know how many people love this movie and how impossible it is to get a proper poster.\n\nIf anyone wants the full printable files (only if it\u2019s allowed by the mods, not trying to break rules), just drop a comment, I\u2019ll directly reach out to you or DM.\n\nHope this makes at least a few Chasing Amy fans smile today. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "content": "Many times when I'm watching a movie, I wonder how crazy it would be if a well known character walked in and solved the whole thing in a matter of minutes. Imagine a horror movie where a family is being tormented by ghosts/demons, and suddenly John Constantine shows up and defeats the demons, only to reveal the movie wasn't a standard horror flick but a backdoor DC origin story. It got me thinking: have there ever been movies that were deliberately marketed one way, and then a character shows up at the end of the movie that totally changes the movie and what it's about?",

        "content": "I laughed a ton watching this movie. I am wondering if other people appreciated that aspect of it as well? I think my favorite horror movies are scary and disturbing but also weirdly funny. Such as Ari Aster movies.\n\nAlso the guy who played the drug addict was so fucking good, I don't even know who the actor is but you just recognize when someone is truly great at acting.\n\nLastly and probably an unpopular opinion.... I think the main girl is a bad actor. I could never not think about her \"Acting\" while watching her. She is the only part of the movie I was not into.",

Tomorrow is the last day to watch it on Netflix, so if someone is reading me and has Netflix, Prisoners is a must-watch.\n\nFirst, the acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman were fvcking magnificent on this movie. Every scene that they have together makes you feel and understand their respective situations perfectly.\n\nSecondly, no soundtrack: whoever decided to add little soundtrack to this movie had a great idea, because it is only used in crucial moments and never in ankward situations.\n\nI really think that the plot and the pacing were good.\n\nTo sum up, I think that Prisoners is a great movie that, although being hard to watch sometimes, it's a great experience. \n\n10/10.",

        "content": "Growing up John Candy was very much a beloved entertainer in my house and was one of my fathers favorites. Any and all movies/shows were seen, for good reason, the man was a comedic machine. The fact that he was taken from us at an early age felt like you were robbed of something great.    \n\nFrom the moment the doc starts it focuses on his death, first scene is Bill Murray teary eyed talking about his lost friend who has overall a good person in life. If you're watching the documentary you most likely know the sad story of him passing away in his 40s, but this documentary beats you over the head with it.    \n\nDan Ackroyds eulogy over Video of John's funeral is shown next, while very moving it's incredibly somber and leaves you with this feeling of melancholy that the documentary doesn't shake from there on out.   \n    \nHis whole life story is told in stories and vignettes that have the tone of \".... He was amazing and hes dead now\"    \n  \nThe man has months of recorded work showing his comedic skills, between movies &amp; TV shows,  but these all get generally glossed over. It's not that the documentary is poorly/cheaply made, there are interviews from his close friends (childhood friends, famous ones from SCTV &amp; Hollywood) and family (his children are heavily involved) and many behind the scenes videos from personal collections.    \n  \nAll and all this should be a fantastic documentary about a man who gave it all for comedy, he personally told Conan Obrien \"You don't try comedy, you DO comedy\" an anecdote that Conan tells as if it was a religious relevation. Perhaps it me, but I didn't get that sense of importance/impact of him in this doc.",
