It's not like he misunderstood the movie. It's just a terrible lesson to take from it. I've also seen American History X spoken of as a movie about how &gt;!going woke won't save you from black violence, since the kid is killed by a black kid at the end after getting over his racism!&lt;  \n\nAny other examples you can think of where the plot of the movie could easily teach you an atrocious life lesson?",

It's also very long. And for that reason I give it a 5/10. \n\nEdit: No disrespect to Kubrick either. Of his I would recommend Full Metal Jacket (8.5) and The Shining (8). ",

It's a fantastic power ballad with a great duet between Grace Slick and Mickey Thomas. But until I watched the video, I had totally forgotten it was on the soundtrack for *Mannequin,* which is just awful. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. Just a remarkably unremarkable high-concept romcom. But the song is so great, it was nominated for an Academy Award, so you can technically say \"Oscar-nominated film, Mannequin.\"\n\nAnyway, this got me thinking, what's the best song written/recorded for the worst movie?\n\nIt was actually pretty hard to come up with a bigger quality differential than \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" and *Mannequin.* The best (worst) I could come up with was [\"I Will Always Love You\"](https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=QS6b4pYl_s4wzSSq), not because *The Bodyguard* was \"bad\" (it's fine), but because Whitney Houston's cover was **so** amazing, even Dolly Parton was like, \"It's fine, I'll just sing Jolene.\"",

I can\u2019t even clearly explain why it worked so well for me.\n\nIt got me thinking about what I actually value in movies. How does something this small and understated leave such a strong impression, while movies with 10\u2013100x the budget often can't? What do you think makes it great?",

        "content": "Watching the gradual deterioration of the characters is a ride as it feels like you are there with them but feel hopeless unable to help. The ending montage accelerates like a nightmare in real time, and I couldn't quite process what I was seeing. It happens so fast, that while what was happening was horrifying, I just felt like I was numb to it. Trapped in an endless cycle too.\n\nThe real horror of this movie isn't the uncanny visuals. I was really freaked out by how grounded in realism it all is. Characters become unrecognizable and do depressingly repetitive tasks and chores. It is so much a reflection of real life, that while I was disturbed, I find myself just feeling that's just how life goes for some.\n\nEllen Burstyn's monologue about being alone and wanting to matter was the highlight. It floored me. Got the ultimate point of the movie across better than the surreal images.\n\n\"I'm somebody now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me and they'll all like me. I'll tell them about you, and your father, how good he was to us. Remember? It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow all right. What have I got Harry, hm? Why should I even make the bed, or wash the dishes? I do them, but why should I? I'm alone. Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got, Harry? I'm lonely. I'm old.\"\n\nAfter watching it, I get why people are uncomfortable by it. I do believe it is brilliantly made and \"Requiem for a Dream\" should be required viewing because we could make drugs obsolete in no time. But I will never watch it again!",

Chunk ends up screaming, snatched by the other brother, and we see Davi keep singing almost in disappointment. \n\nAs long as I can remember, I\u2019ve used this encounter to gauge my interactions with adults. If I ever felt that feeling of when he busted out the opera, it was BAD touch, and it sends chills every time I hear it. So well done",
