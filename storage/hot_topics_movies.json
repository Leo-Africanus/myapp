We\u2019ve both spent decades working in the industry, garnering awards, and working on some of the biggest movies in Hollywood.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on Ridley Scott projects previously, and between the two of us, we\u2019ve worked on franchises like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Alien. With an eye for detail, and a love of storytelling, our passion for outfitting the right actors in the perfect wardrobes is very special to us both.\n\nIf you want to know more about the process, the methods, and the artistry of costume design for big, epic movies, we\u2019re here to take your questions.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\n\n* [Janty Yates](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946765/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703178&amp;usg=AOvVaw3l_HfawFgp6Rgx07DWbfZl), Costume Designer. Yates has worked in this field since 1989 and has two Academy Award nominations, including one win. Gladiator II marks Yates 18th collaboration with Ridley Scott\n\n* [David Crossman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189366/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703575&amp;usg=AOvVaw382KB9AjxnnfM3CtG96Jeu), Costume Designer \u2013 Military Costume.

It was a very fun movie all around with some pretty wild and creative kills\n\nHowever, the Black Friday scene stuck out to me as the highlight of the movie, a hilariously grim opening of a violent shopping spree. Seeing people cruelty snatch waffle makers out of each others hands as they bleed from broken glass was pretty wild, then the scalp getting torn off when the woman\u2019s hair was stuck to the customers shopping cart. Great opening",

        "content": "So I watched this movie yesterday not really knowing anything about it except that Nic Cage was in it. The movie itself was pretty average although I now understand it\u2019s a cult classic having read up on it after watching.\n\nI gotta say, Nic Cage gives an incredibly wild performance which I\u2019m still trying to determine if this was a classic case of Nic Cage overacting antics or he was in fact just brilliant. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure is he was 100% committed to the role, and I was there with him all the way despite the quality of the movie. It\u2019s like watching someone who is way over the top, but he makes you believe that he believes in himself and what he is doing.\n\nHe\u2019s a remarkable person, strange and fascinating, eccentric and spot on at times in his acting performances. The guy can act when he puts his mind to it, as witnessed in Pig where he was much more subtle. Then you see him in something like Colour Out Of Space, his performance was eccentric to say the least but still watchable all the same like you can\u2019t take your eyes off of him. At times you cringe when he goes off the reservation and other times you\u2019re in awe of his more memorable performances thinking \u201cIs this the same guy??\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his Vampire\u2019s Kiss role?",

By \u201cturn\u201d I mean that you think a film is going in one direction, then turns and goes into a completely different direction. \n\nI just rewatched the film *Cold in July*, and there\u2019s like, three turns in that film. \n\nHe shoots a home invader, and you think that\u2019s what the movie is about. Then we find out that the person they\u2019re blaming for the home invasion isn\u2019t the person they say it is. The film goes absolutely bonkers from there. ",

        "content": "This is a strange trend that I discovered recently. In the early 90s, there were FOUR movies that all centered around two characters going on crime sprees, all in the Western part of the US and all of them either starred Brad Pitt or Juliette Lewis or both and they all came out within a couple years of each other or less:\n\nThelma &amp; Louise - Brad Pitt\n\nTrue Romance - Brad Pitt \n\nNatural Born Killers - Juliette Lewis (yes, I know that this and True Romance were originally one script written by Tarantino)\n\nKalifornia - Brad Pitt AND Juliette Lewis \n\nHow did this come to happen that these 2 actors found themselves in al of these movies and that they all came out between 91-94??  \n",

I would love to watch something like it that has the same coming-of-age vibe but is very well done and maybe Asian-inspired as well. I like the high school thing as well as the summer vibes but I love how it is overall produced directed and acted amazingly. None of this awful acting. Something that was set in high school or summer that has an Asian cast properly and a male lead set at any time but is just really good. Maybe some romance as well but's it something that you understand what the character is feeling even when they don\u2019t speak Cinda things.",

        "title": "In The Birdcage (1996), Is Val Really So Bad?",
        "content": "**The Birdcage** is my favorite comedy. Funny thing, my PASTOR loves it too. He's the reason why I saw it. \n\nI was looking at 1/2 star reviews on Letterboxd because looking at bad reviews of movies you love is funny. Anyways, a bunch of negative reviews of this say that Val, the son, is the biggest villain in cinema history and he's homophobic to his own gay parents and such. \n\nI've seen the movie a handful of times, and I don't see it that way. \n\nVal clearly loves his parents, he gives them a kiss when he comes home, he doesn't show hatred to them, or anything like that. Sure, he gives them little time to redecorate their home, but he doesn't call them slurs or such. \n\nVal has also clearly never made his family change before. He mentions to his Dad that when he was a kid, he was told that he should tell teachers that his father is a businessman, not the owner of a gay drag club. So, it was his fathers who have made him change in the past. \n\nIt's always been clear to me that Val loves his 2 fathers, and that the changes are to not turn away his to be father-in-law. If Val's fianc\u00e9's family was much more accepting of gay people, he wouldn't have done that. \n\nI've never seen Val as the jerk. Kevin always was. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nNote: I'm not saying that Val is completely justified in every action he does.  I don't morally approve of Val kicking Albert out, for instance. Like all good characters (in terms of writing), he has a character arc. But the Letterboxd reviews that say he's the worst villain ever? Come on, he's not Cruella De Vil! \n\n",

A number of our favourite movies have come up a few times, which is gratifying but our \"to watch\" list has just got a lot bigger.",

The robot turns out to be the protagonist's mother.\n\nSeriously though, this is a movie full of twists and turns, but that's the only thing that makes it great. \n\nIt checks all the boxes, be it editing or the haunting musical score. And yes you got your violence and nudity, if that's what you want.\n\nThe story itself, as I said, is full of surprises and keeps you engaged to the end, even if you're not a scifi fan. \n\nThe acting is terrific, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and of course, Alicia Vikander, all give it their best.\n\nI love the setting and Rob Hardy's cinematography, Most of them shots are stationary with shallow depth of field but the composition is wonderful. I particularly enjoyed those shots that were filmed through the glass and with slow but fluid camera movements and soft lighting. \n\nAnd one last thing that really elevated the movie is the themes it addresses. It's Frankenstein, existentialism, consciousness, what it means to be human, etc. \n\nTotally worth checking it out.",
