        "content": "Hey reddit, I'm filmmaker Curry Barker, and my new film, OBSESSION, is heading to TIFF this week! You might know my directorial feature debut, MILK &amp; SERIAL (2024). \n\nOBSESSION will have its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this Friday, September 5, as part of the Midnight Madness program. The film stars Michael Johnston, Inde Navarrette, Cooper Tomlinson, and Megan Lawless.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:** \n\nObsession plunges into a fever dream of longing, delusion, and the chilling cost of getting exactly what you desire. Bear, a hopeless romantic, gets pulled into a spiral where passion and terror become inseparable.\n\nFrom Curry Barker (Milk &amp; Serial), this visceral, atmospheric thriller fuses psychological horror with a haunting supernatural edge. Starring Inde Navarrette (Superman &amp; Lois), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), Cooper Tomlinson (Milk &amp; Serial), and Megan Lawless (The Death That Awaits), Obsession is a twistedlove story that dares to ask: How far would you go to be loved back?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TIFF's write-up of the film:**\n\nWoe is Bear (Michael Johnston), who has long carried a torch for his childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette). When another attempted profession of love fizzles, Bear wistfully wishes for romantic reciprocation, unfortunately doing so while in possession of a trinket with supernatural properties of The Monkey\u2019s Paw variety.\n\nSuddenly, Nikki is all over Bear, and he is quick to indulge in this long-desired turnabout while ignoring the ramifications of her intensifying fixation. Before long, Bear\u2019s fantasy turns to nightmare as Nikki\u2019s personality begins to twitch with a disturbing dysphoria that sinisterly suggests her autonomy has been usurped by a malignant entity that wants them both, body and soul.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for\u201d may be a staple in the horror genre, but writer-director Curry Barker enlivens this well-worn premise by lacing its inherent irony with a wickedly wry tone and an anxious tension that\u2019ll plummet the stomach of even hardened Midnighters. Having honed high-concept absurdism and creeping dread from his online productions, Barker deftly demonstrates a savvy command of tone and terror reminiscent of fellow sketch comedian Zach Cregger\u2019s Barbarian.\n\nAs with that auspicious debut, Barker\u2019s first feature preserves an uncomfortable relatability in its hyperbolic scenario. Though literally featuring a customer service call from (and possibly to) Hell, Obsession cuts to the quick as it lays bare the innate violence in romantic objectification with an unforgiving candidness. That's made all the more disarming, thanks to exceptionally nuanced performances, particularly from Navarrette whose \u201cFreaky Nikki\u201d oscillates between doe-eyed desire and devastating torment that will chill you to the bone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**My bio:**\n\nCurry Barker is a writer-director with a bold, visceral style. His work blends raw emotion with psychological horror and dark comedy. He co-created That\u2019s a Bad Idea, his sketch comedy channel, and directed Milk and Serial, both known for their brutal honesty and striking, cinematic visuals.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 5 PM ET today (Tuesday 9/2) to answer any questions.",

        "content": "*Teens participate in a grueling high-stakes contest where they must continuously walk or be shot by a member of their military escort.*\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Pts. 1 &amp; 2 , and The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes)\n\nCast: Cooper Hoffman, Ben Wang, Mark Hamill, David Jonsson, Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Charlie Plummer\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_long_walk_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [80/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-long-walk-2025/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Total Film - Lauren Milici](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/the-long-walk-review/)\n\n&gt;The Long Walk is not for the faint of heart, but it is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made, and one of the best dystopian sci-fi movies to hit the big screen in a really long time.\n\n[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \\- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;It can exhilarating as Frances Lawrence and JT Mollner bring a bit of edge to this beloved Stephen King adaptation. Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson are both excellent, delivering riveting performances that emotionally reel in the audience. It can also feel repetitious at times, trying to replicate the highs of some of the more exciting set pieces, building towards an expected ending.\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1953442/the-long-walk-review/) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;\"The Long Walk\" is an emotionally obliterating all-time great Stephen King adaptation, and undoubtedly one of the best films of 2025. The camaraderie shown by the group is not unlike the foxhole friendships developed between soldiers during wartime, but given the hopelessness of their situation, it starts to feel like we're watching the American version of \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Wang provides a majority of the much-needed levity with his sharp tongue and fearless delivery, while Baker's warm, gentle optimism represents the best of humanity.",

Hopefully the current world leaders who have our fate in their hands are listening. \u201cThere is *still* time brother\u201d indeed.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-idris-elba-kathryn-bigelow-1236359097/)\n\n&gt;Eight years since her last feature, Kathryn Bigelow returns with an unrelenting chokehold thriller so controlled, kinetic and unsettlingly immersive that you stagger out at the end of it wondering if the world will still be intact. Though it\u2019s less a war film than a drama about the aggressive threat of war, *A House of Dynamite* is very much of a piece with the director\u2019s later-career gut punches, *The Hurt Locker* and *Zero Dark Thirty*.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/02/a-house-of-dynamite-review-kathryn-bigelow-nuclear-endgame-idris-elba-rebecca-ferguson) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;There are times when A House of Dynamite might seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the highest reaches of power \u2013 with everyone looking and feeling like actors in elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-house-of-dynamite-review-1235148629/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie \u2014 with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole \u2014 also wants to shake you out of your slumber\n\n[The Playlist - Marshall Shaffer](https://theplaylist.net/a-house-of-dynamite-review-kathryn-bigelow-returns-with-another-explosive-political-thriller-venice-20250902/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;The world is not governed by machines, as \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d painstakingly showcases across all its frenzied operations. It\u2019s run by humans. Bigelow\u2019s film pinpoints a terrifying tragedy lurking unspoken in today\u2019s world order: whether citizens place their trust in people or procedures, neither can be counted on to prevent mass destruction.\n\n[BBC - Nicholas Barber](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250902-a-house-of-dynamite-review) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;A House of Dynamite is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker (2008) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), and once again she balances her knack for building excruciating tension with her devotion to deeply researched, no-nonsense military and political authenticity. The resulting drama, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Tuesday will be released on Netflix in October, is more riveting than most thrillers, and more terrifying than most horror films.\n\n[The Independent - Geoffrey Macnab](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-netflix-b2818601.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;*A House of Dynamite* stands as a grim and timely warning about the renewed dangers of nuclear proliferation. Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick\u2019s *Dr Strangelove*. Unlike Kubrick, Bigelow doesn\u2019t offer much humour \u2013 satirical or otherwise \u2013 but this is a white knuckle ride of a movie in which the tension is ratcheted up to near breaking point early on, and then simply keeps on rising. German composer Volker Bertelmann\u2019s ominous score, heavy on the strident strings, puts viewers on edge even more.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-review-idris-elba-kathryn-bigelow-1236504169/)\n\n&gt;\u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d a countdown-to-nuclear-disaster thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is jacked up with so many familiar MOR tropes that even though it\u2019s trying to be realistic about what it shows you (spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t really succeed), it still has the feel of a self-consciously jittery high-end cautionary potboiler. Don\u2019t try this at home! Or in the White House Situation Room!\n\n[RogerEbert](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-house-of-dynamite-movie-review) \\- 4 / 4\n\n&gt;Bigelow's ability to take a series of hypotheticals and render them into narrative actuality has never been more pinpoint accurate or merciless.",
