        "title": "May 16-18 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Final Destination: Bloodlines' debuts with a colossal $51M domestically and $105M worldwide, the best in the franchise. 'Hurry Up Tomorrow' flops with just $3.3M. 'Thunderbolts*' crosses $300M worldwide, but it's dropping faster than anticipated.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/z1hsynpn7t1f1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ad3fdce57bfee2ec5ba408ed8fea55e0bf0778\n\nThis weekend, WB successfully resurrected another iconic horror franchise.\n\n***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** easily topped the box office, achieving the best debut in the franchise by a wide margin. Meanwhile, the other wide release, ***Hurry Up Tomorrow***, flopped with one of the most front-loaded debuts in history.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $101.3 million this weekend. That's up 11% from last year, when ***IF*** topped the box office.\n\nDebuting on first place, WB/New Line's ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** debuted with a fantastic $51.6 million this weekend. That's easily the franchise's biggest debut, passing ***The Final Destination*** ($27.4 million). In fact, within just 3 days, it's already the fourth biggest film in the franchise. By tomorrow, it will move to second place. And in a few days, it will pass the fourth film to become the biggest film in the franchise.\n\nNot only that, but this was also higher than any of the ***Scream*** and ***Alien*** films. It's the 11th biggest debut for a horror film. Absolute craziness. That raises the question: how did the franchise jump from $27 million to $51 million? \n\nSimply put, ***Final Destination*** is one of the most iconic horror franchises of the century. How many people refused to board planes or drive behind log trucks because of these films? Quite a lot. The franchise allowed itself to find new audiences by releasing films with a good frequency: 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2011. And as each film is pretty much standalone (except maybe the second), everyone can jump into any point to watch these films.\n\nNeedless to say, the 14-year gap helped the film build anticipation and intrigue. The franchise has become very popular among Millennials and Gen Z, which are key demos for a horror film. The trailers did a fantastic job in showcasing everything everyone loves about these films: brutal and insane Rube Goldberg-style deaths. The franchise may have not been popular with critics, but they were won over with this one. It's sitting at a fantastic 93% on RT, suggesting that people should give this one a chance. And finally there might have been interest in seeing the late Tony Todd one last time in his role, no matter if it was a big or small role.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 52% of the audience was male. We mentioned Millennials and Gen Z loved the franchise and the demos corroborate that; a massive 73% was 34 or under. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is pretty good for a horror film, tying for the best in the franchise. There's some rough competition in the coming weeks, so it's unlikely it will hold incredibly well. Nevertheless, the film is already a hit. For now, we're projecting a $130 million domestic total for ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***. Expect WB to greenlight a sequel any minute now.\n\nIn second place, ***Thunderbolts*** dipped 49%, earning $16.6 million this weekend. That's not as bad as last week's drop, but it indicates ***Final Destination*** was bigger than expected competition. The film has amassed $155.5 million so far. The film is currently beating ***Captain America: Brave New World*** in daillies, although it remains $8 million behind. Depending on how much it drops against ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** and ***Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning***, there's a strong chance it could miss $200 million domestically. That'd be very disappointing.\n\nIn third place, ***Sinners*** was barely affected by the arrival of ***Final Destination***. It eased a light 31%, earning $15.2 million this weekend. One thing on its favor was that it regained some IMAX 70mm screens this weekend. It's slightly behind ***Thunderbolts***, but it looks like it will start gaining a lead; [on Thursday, it beat ***Thunderbolts*** by almost $200K.](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-chart/daily/2025/05/15) By next week, it could go ahead of it. The film has earned $240 million, and it's heading towards around $280 million lifetime.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** dipped 22%, adding $5.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $416.7 million, and it should finish with around $430 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, ***The Accountant 2*** had another great hold. It eased just 29%, earning $4.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $58.8 million, and it should finish with over $65 million domestically.\n\nDebuting in sixth place, Lionsgate's ***Hurry Up Tomorrow*** flopped with an awful $3.3 million in 2,020 theaters.  That's one of the weakest debuts for any film playing at over 2,000 theaters. That's even worse than Jenna Ortega's ***Death of a Unicorn*** ($5.7 million), which was another failure a few months ago. It's not even Trey Edward Shults' best debut as director, as it's barely half of what ***It Comes at Night*** ($5.9 million) made back in 2017.\n\nThe one question everyone should be asking right now: is anyone remotely surprised by this? OP here certainly doesn't. The Weeknd may be popular (he's the third most popular singer on Spotify with 116 million monthly listeners), but he's no stranger to flops. Back in 2023, he released the critically panned HBO series ***The Idol***, which was cancelled after ending its 5-episode run. There's been reports that he changed the series' original premise, mainly because it was \"heading too much into a female perspective.\"\n\nSo what was his next move? A companion film piece to the album of the same name. But that set a challenge: it meant that the film would appeal to no one outside The Weeknd's fanbase. Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan are well respected actors, but they're not immune to failure either. And while the presence of an acclaimed filmmaker like Trey Edward Shults aliviated some concerns regarding the quality, it turns out it was all for nothing; the film is currently sitting at a horrible 16% on RT. Turns out we were witnessing ***The Idol 2.0***, except this time it was in theaters.\n\nFinally, the one thing that makes this debut worse than it already is: how front-loaded it was. The film earned $1.65 million in Wednesday and Thursday previews. It made just $684,959 on Friday, followed by steep drops on Saturday and Sunday. Basically, its Friday ($2.3 million) represented a colossal 70% of its weekend gross. This NEVER happens, pals. NEVER. [The makes it the second most front-loaded film in history](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/legs/front-loaded-opening-weekend), where most of the top spots belong to Indian films. What does this mean? What was previously said: it was for Weeknd fans, and Weeknd fans only. Zero appeal beyond that. Ouch.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 55% of the audience was female, and 44% of the audience was in the 18-24 demographic. Critics annihilated the film, and the audience agreed. They gave it a horrible \"C\u2013\" on CinemaScore, incredibly poor word of mouth. And that's when The Weeknd's fanbase is already boosting the grade. Seeing how front-loaded it was, the film will finish with just $5 million domestically. That's 0/2 for The Weeknd's career as leading actor. Save your tears for another day.\n\nAfter its incredible start in 6 theaters last week, A24 expanded ***Friendship*** to 60 theaters. The result? It managed to crack the seventh spot, with a pretty great $1.4 million this weekend. That's a strong $23,338 per-theater average, which is the best of the weekend. Through 10 days in limited release, the film has already earned $2 million. Now its true test begins this week, when A24 expands it into wide release.\n\n***Clown in a Cornfield*** was deeply affected by ***Final Destination***. It collapsed 63%, earning $1.3 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has made $6.3 million so far.\n\nFacing the wrath of ***Final Destination***, Sony's ***Until Dawn*** collapsed 58%, adding $811,159. The film's domestic total stands at $19.6 million, and it only has $2 million left in the gas (at most).\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***. It dipped 38%, adding $724,688. The film has made $40.1 million so far.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nDeath was also welcome in the rest of the world.\n\n***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** outperformed projections, debuting with a fantastic $54 million overseas, for a $105 million worldwide debut. It's already the highest grossing film in the franchise in so many countries after just one weekend. The best debuts were in Mexico ($5.5M), the UK ($5.3M), Philippines ($3.4M), India ($3M) and France ($3M). This is an easy profit here, ladies and gentlemen. Look for the film to finish with over $250 million worldwide, and it could get close to $300 million assuming it holds well against the incoming competition.\n\n***Thunderbolts*** took another rough drop this week. It dropped 54% and added $15.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $325 million. The best markets are the UK ($18.4M), China ($15.2M), Mexico ($13.7M), France ($8.6M) and Australia ($7.8M). We have to face reality: this is not good at all. It's not holding very well, and competition is incoming. Right now, the film will probably finish below $400 million. This is flop territory. \n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** added $8.3 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $929 million. The best markets are the UK ($72.1M), Germany ($37.6M), Australia ($34.6M), Mexico ($32.5M) and China ($28.7M). Right now, it looks like the billion milestone is unlikely.\n\n***Sinners*** added $3.8 million this weekend, allowing the film to cross $300 million worldwide, three times its budget. The domestic market is doing all heavy lifting (75.9%), but at the end of the day, it's a hit. \n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Drop* | Apr/11 | Universal | $7,397,015 | $16,600,805 | $28,355,317 | $11M\n\n- Can anyone check for signs of life on Blumhouse? Cause ***Drop*** closed with an underwhelming $28 million worldwide. That's incredibly weak, and it's one of their worst performers ever. The budget may have been $11 million, but it still had an extensive marketing campaign. For the film to not hit $30 million is simply terrible. Considering this, ***The Woman in the Yard*** and ***Wolf Man*** all underwhelmed, Blumhouse really needs to reconsider whatever the hell it's doing. \n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nBrace yourselves, for we're heading for perhaps the best Memorial Day weekend in history, thanks to two films.\n\nThe first is Disney's ***Lilo &amp; Stitch***, their latest live-action remake. The original earned $273 million worldwide back in 2002, and its popularity has grown in the past years. Thanks to an incredible marketing campaign, high interest (it's Disney's second-most viewed live-action film trailer) and incredibly strong pre-sales, ***Lilo &amp; Stitch*** will easily break some records this weekend.\n\nThe other release is Paramount's ***Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning***. It's the eighth film in the franchise, although both Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie claim it won't necessarily end the franchise. Still, Paramount has built a big marketing campaign, selling the film with the \"one last time\" angle. They're not scared of going against ***Lilo &amp; Stitch***, as ***The Final Reckoning*** has an exclusive 3-week IMAX run. It has already premiered in Cannes, where reviews are positive but not as strong as prior installments (81% on RT, 69 on Metacritic). Due to an insane amount of delays (due to the strikes and COVID), the budget has ballooned all the way to $400 million. Paramount may have to accept the film won't recoup all that investment in theaters. Nevertheless, considering they're selling the film as the final one, the very least it should do is be the highest grossing film in the franchise (***Fallout*** is top with $791 million). But will it?\n\n#**ANNOUNCEMENT**\n\nAs Memorial Day delays actuals by a day, the post will go up on Tuesday.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

Weird-looking and not handsome, I think it's actually one of my favorite Johnny Depp roles. His weirdness actually seems more authentic when he's a weird looking character. \n\nAnd a great ensemble cast as well, with stars like Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy etc, but also some truly fantastic \"voice actor\" performances.\n\nThis was so much better than I expected, from top to bottom, highly recommend.",

        "title": "Anaconda (1997), which features Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, is unintentionally hilarious, iconic, and so-bad-it's-great.",
        "content": "*Anaconda* showed up in my suggestions on Hulu, and I watched it for the very first time. I could not stop giggling throughout the film. The transition scenes from one plot point to the next are hilariously bad; I've rarely seen worse continuity editing. The film is peppered with prolonged scenes where the camera is just focusing on the scenery and nothing else is happening. Jon Voight's character is an absolute wordsmith who provides a misspoken English sentence in almost every line of dialogue. Voight's incomprehensible accent is just one of several in the film, and their delightful dialog is only enhanced by the characters abruptly changing their mood throughout the film--like when Denise is balling her eyes out, abruptly loses every ounce of sadness to accuse Jon Voight of hatching villainous schemes, and then goes back to crying. The fact that Ice Cube and JLo are just part of the cast like it's nbd is so fabulously iconic \u2b50 \n\nAnyway, that's all I wanted to say. The film is so bad that it's good, and it effectively elevates bad filmmaking decisions to an art form. How do you feel about *Anaconda*? ",

        "content": "*A music mogul faces a life-and-death moral dilemma when he gets caught up in a ransom plot.*\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, A$AP Rocky, Jeffrey Wright\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [90%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highest_2_lowest)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/highest-2-lowest/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/05/highest-2-lowest-review-denzel-washington-aap-rocky-spike-lees-music-industry-crime-drama-cannes-film-festival-1236403669/)\n\n&gt;The first film shot in Lee\u2019s native NYC in more than a decade is one of his best. It has been in various forms of development over 30 years for the likes of David Mamet, Chris Rock and others, and now Washington helped get Lee on board with it for a new take from screenwriter Alan Fox, who adapts material from Ed McBain\u2019s book *King\u2019s Ransom* and the original Kurosawa movie. The premise fits like a glove with the music industry, and Washington is smooth as silk, delivering one of his best recent performances as a man caught in an impossible moral quandary. With his fifth collaboration with Lee (*Malcolm X, He Got Game, Inside Man, Mo Better Blues*), he really finds his groove on this one to be sure.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-1236402884/)\n\n&gt;In the end, Lee has taken \u201cHigh and Low\u201d to new highs, delivering a soul-searching genre movie that entertains while also sounding the alarm about where the culture could be headed.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-denzel-washington-spike-lee-1236221654/)\n\n&gt;Lee\u2019s adaptation doesn\u2019t match the complexities of class and hierarchy and even dynamics in a marriage that are such a fascinating part of the Kurosawa. Then again, he\u2019s not trying to, and this is a universe away from the disappointment of *Oldboy*, his 2013 remake of the Park Chan-wook thriller. The director is in the role of the flashy, panache-y showman here, and he plays it to perfection, delivering a big, highly polished chunk of movie that\u2019s pure enjoyment.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich - 'B'](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-denzel-washington-1235124498/)\n\n&gt;\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is naturally at its best when it deviates from its source material. The film\u2019s wholehearted embrace of Black culture is baked into David\u2019s desire to protect Stackin\u2019 Hits from buyers who might dilute the brand of its history, but it\u2019s also suffused into the various changes that Lee\u2019s version makes to the story\u2019s third act, which pivots away from the darkness of Japan\u2019s post-war heroin epidemic and towards the aspirational aspects of hip-hop. The tension between David and Paul keeps \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d upright even when the movie around it threatens to go slack. Lee doesn\u2019t share Kurosawa\u2019s patience for long, talky, single-location sequences, and his attempts at Ice Spicing up this relatively low-event movie can be more trouble than they\u2019re worth, even if Ice Spice herself is acquitted on all charges for her two seconds of screen time.\u00a0\n\n[The Playlist - Gregory Ellwood](https://theplaylist.net/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-once-again-brings-out-the-best-in-denzel-washington-cannes-20250519/) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Now, not to backtrack from what might seem like a rave review, we\u2019ll remind you that \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has quite a rough start, and Lee\u2019s excesses are not for everyone. It\u2019s no shame that this thriller isn\u2019t even in the top pantheon of Lee joints, as he refers to them. The man has some masterpieces on his resume. It might be in Washington\u2019s, however. He\u2019s so viscerally engaging that you want to see the movie again just to enjoy his performance. Is that a result of the collective experience of having the gang back together again? Or is Washington just on a roll? Either way, let\u2019s just hope we don\u2019t have to wait another 20 years to find out.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/19/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-and-denzel-washington-remake-kurosawa-in-fine-style) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;This is a big, muscular picture which aspires to the crowd-pleasing athleticism of Spike Lee\u2019s sports icons; it\u2019s very enjoyable and there\u2019s a great turn from Washington.\n\n[The Wrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-denzel-washington-asap-rocky/)\n\n&gt;\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is a mixture of gleaming, professional filmmaking and curious choices. It\u2019s a showcase for a classic powerhouse, Washington, and an upstart one, ASAP Rocky. Overhauling and updating Kurosawa\u2019s film by turning the lead character from a shoe executive to a music mogul, it simultaneously drags the story into the social-media age and uses it to pay tribute to older urban dramas.\n\n[The Independent - Geofrrey Macnab](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/highest-2-lowest-cannes-review-denzel-washington-b2753613.html) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Lee is working with a top cast, but actors such as Wright and Wendell Pierce (playing one of King\u2019s music company managers) have sketchy roles. This is ultimately Washington\u2019s show. He remains as magnetic as ever, switching in a second from affability to menace, demanding respect from his sons and colleagues alike, and trying to keep multiple plates spinning at once as both his business and private lives go off the rails. It\u2019s another of his virtuoso star turns, but it\u2019s ultimately weakened by his refusal to show any emotional vulnerability whatsoever.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-reteams-with-denzel-washington-for-ambitious-crime-thriller/5205115.article)\n\n&gt;Beyond the shaky character dynamics, the plotting often feels disjointed, despite a terrific action sequence that pays homage to a similarly riveting set piece in Kurosawa\u2019s film. But such moments are squandered in an overstuffed story that unconvincingly also wants to tackle the materialism in the hip-hop world and the scourge of social media. Ultimately, the picture\u2019s energetic swirl comes across as slightly hollow, its barrage of themes and impulses never finding harmony.",

It didn't really help.\n\nNow *Bring Her Back* both holds AND reverses the perspective of grief from it's three main characters and gruesomely, I mean GRUESOMELY, explores it. It's production is so clean, Sally Hawkin's performance is amazing in the most disgusting way. I haven't despised a character so much since Percy in *The Green Mile*.\n\nThe story unfurls without over exposition (besides one weird subtitle lol) which makes us feel passenger to the youthful protagonists. Ultimately, it is so unapologetic in the way it shows the lengths and depths of grief, similar to Talk to Me but kinda....like....maybe more brutal. Not by much. But damn do I respect the filmmakers for this.\n\nSide note, once the credits hit, someone behind me sprinted to and out the emergency exit door and drove like 35 mph out of the parking lot, hit a curb, and kept driving. I think this movie will or can be incredibly triggering, especially for certain parents.\n\nAbsolutely amazing horror film. Philippou's are a very real deal.",
