Regardless of the film\u2019s shortcomings, it\u2019s a thrill to have this giant of an actor back on a movie screen, hopefully next time with a more satisfyingly fleshed-out screenplay.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/28/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The younger Day-Lewis shows promise as a film-maker \u2013 Anemone certainly\u00a0*looks*\u00a0serious, the correct scowls and swirling skies and wordless, eerie montages to suggest weighty themes, big emotions and ominous suspense. The tools to back up that style with emotional punches that land like the real ones of the brothers \u2013 best believe they tussle it out, because of course \u2013 are not yet refined, but in this father-son duo, at least, I have faith.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236530758/):\n\n&gt;There are flashes of talent in \u201cAnemone.\u201d Ronan Day-Lewis, who has come up in the world as a visual artist, knows how to frame a shot, and he\u2019s canny about playing off the mystique of his father. The whole plot, with Jem entreating Ray to come out of his self-imposed exile, is almost a sly metaphor for how Daniel Day-Lewis would take a sabbatical from acting to become a cobbler or cabinet maker, or for his retirement now. Yet for most of its 125-minute running time, \u201cAnemone\u201d just sits there.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/09/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-ronan-day-lewis-sean-bean-1236557832/):\n\n&gt;*Anemone*, is a film that doesn\u2019t live in or anything\u2019s or anyone\u2019s shadow, even though that\u2019s what the story is essentially about, a plot point made all the more salient by the casting \u2014 or perhaps that should be\u00a0*positioning*\u00a0\u2014 of acting giant Day-Lewis Sr. in his first starring role since\u00a0*Phantom Thread*\u00a0(yep, another PTA production). Press-wise, the fervor for this long-anticipated return has already done a lot of heavy lifting, especially for savvy arthouse audiences. But, although he could so easily have rested on his old man\u2019s laurels, Day-Lewis Jr. instead exploits those\u00a0*expectations*\u00a0of his father\u2019s power (more of that later), and he does so in a fuss-free way that serves the story surprisingly well, right up until the actor finally coughs up his elusive character\u2019s shocking backstory.\n\n[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anemone-review-ronan-day-lewis-1235153177/) (B):\n\n&gt;This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn\u2019t placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It\u2019s disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can\u2019t put them back together again. But everything that\u2019s come before is so rich that you\u2019re ready to forgive it. The title, by the way, comes from the flowers that bloomed from Ray\u2019s own father\u2019s planting. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.\n\n\n# \n\nCast:\n\n* Daniel Day-Lewis\u00a0\n* Sean Bean\u00a0\n* Samantha Morton\u00a0\n* Samuel Bottomley\u00a0\n* Safia Oakley-Green\n\nDirected by Ronan Day-Lewis\n\n",

        "content": "*A man claiming to be from the future takes the patrons of an iconic Los Angeles diner hostage in search of unlikely recruits in a quest to save the world.*\n\nCast: Sam Rockwell, Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Pena, Zazie Beets\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100% (5 reviews)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_luck_have_fun_dont_die)\n\n**Metacritic:** N/A (updating)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[SlashFilm - Rafael Motamayor](https://www.slashfilm.com/1979287/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;What follows is a truly bonkers, balls-to-the-wall, hilarious sci-fi adventure that starts out as \"Repo Man\" and ends up going full \"Akira.\" It's bold, it's got a great cast, it's one of the timeliest genre movies in years. It is great to have Gore Verbinski back.\n\n[IGN - Matt Donato](https://www.ign.com/articles/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-review-sam-rockwell-haley-lu-richardson) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;At its best, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die is a laugh-filled yet incredibly dark and poignant fever dream that pleads for a safer AI tomorrow. Verbinski's command over utter chaos is nothing short of marvelous, even if the pacing slows while jumping between storylines that eventually all fit together. There's a hopefulness that tries to prevent the film from feeling fatalistic, like there's nothing we can do about AI at its most harmful. But it's also quite entertaining, as Rockwell leads his ragtag squad into escalating unknowns that he actually knows after so many failed missions. As offbeat and dreamlike as Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die becomes, ballooning in scale as time ticks down, its timeliness and prescience are still its most impressive factors. A film this wacky shouldn't be this straightforward, and yet here we are, cleaning the glitter off our bodies; you'll understand soon enough.\n\n[Fandom Wire - Sean Boelman](https://fandomwire.com/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-fantastic-fest-review/)\n\n&gt;Ultimately, much of the film rides on the back of Sam Rockwell, who is giving one of the most unhinged, fun performances of his career. In the years since his Oscar win for *Three Billboards*, he\u2019s been taking on more \u201cserious\u201d work, and while he\u2019s great at that too, it\u2019s nice to see him return to his zanier *Confessions of a Dangerous Mind* and Justin Hammer side. He is incredibly charming and thrives in this comedic space, and his lead performance makes the over-two-hour runtime\u00a0",

        "title": "Sunshine (2007), I cannot believe I put off watching it for so long.",
        "content": "Yesterday I watched Danny Boyle's Sunshine from 2007. This is a movie that \"I've been meaning to watch\" pretty much ever since it came out. I remember being in grade school and seeing the trailer and thinking \"that looks cool, I should watch it\", and then I never actually did. From time to time the movie would pop up somewhere and again I'd think to myself \"I should watch it\" and then I'd forget and years would go by again. Well yesterday was finally the day I sat down and watched the film and I was honestly blown away. I seriously did not expect it to be that good.\n\nFor starters I am a huge sci fi fan, and usually I tend to gravitate towards realistic, \"hard\" science fiction as much as possible. Think of the Martian, The Expanse, Gravity, Apollo 13, etc, stuff that tries to be as realistic as possible. That being said it's not like I don't understand the concept of creative license and I do believe that the story always takes precedence over technicalities and realism. \n\nSunshine is a bit weird in that regard because part of it is very grounded and realistic while other parts of it are pure fantasy. While a bit jarring at first while trying to figure out where the movie stands exactly on that regard, it was absolutely the right call for them to make. The story is gripping, engaging, and the feelings and emotions are masterfully conveyed to the viewer mainly visually rather than dialogue. Which leads me to my next point, the visual effects for this movie are incredible. It's hard to believe it came out in 2007 because it puts many modern movies to shame. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised because the late 2000s were a golden age in terms of VFX as the convergence of classic film making effects and CGI came together in the best way, with film makers using each to their strengths while using each other to cover their weaknesses. This is in contrast to today where there is often an over reliance on CGI. \n\nThis movie was made for only 40 million. That was a more hefty sum back then in terms of a movie budget but by today's standards that's low budget. And yet you would never call this movie \"cheap\". The set design is impeccable, the CGI is impeccable, the practical effects blend seamlessly with everything, and of course the story is the real star of the show, keeping you engaged and pulling you into the mind of the crew throughout. \n\nGo watch the film now.

        "content": "That's it. That is all I want to say. \n\nI mean these are hands down some of the most powerful demons we got in horror - rivaled imo, only by the Cenobytes. \n\nThe are practically indestructible outside of total bodily dismemberment (and even then that wont stop some of them). They can spread like wildfire depending on the type of Deadite (Blood in the modern movies, insanity and mental weaknesses in the original). They can twist and bend their host bodies in ways that should not be possible. Are very strong - physically and psychically... \n\nBut what makes them so great is the fact that unlike any other demon in cinema - Deadites have a sick sense of humor! They get off on the psychological torture of not only their victims but their host body as well. They find injury hilarious and will go to extreme lengths to intensify any wounds they sustain. \n\nThey love verbally berating their victims, using memories and voice queues to mess with them. They will use any and all tools and weapons at thwir disposal to kill their prey although a lot of the time they content themselves with just beating on people for their own amusement instead of outright murdering them instantly. \n\nAnd on top of that, they are the Theater Kids of the demon world. They don't HAVE to rhyme or sing or dance but they do for their own amusement...\n\nThey dont have to eat shards of glass or peel their faces off or eat chunks of hair or use their fingers and mouth to play records but they do becausr they are extra. They are drama queens who loce making everything about themselves. \n\nDamn it I love Deadites!! \n",

        "content": "So casually watching The Godfather 2 and didn\u2019t notice this about Fredo till now. \n\nWhen Michael and Fredo are having drinks after Fredo arrives in Havana, Michael maps out what will happen to him later that night. I realized for the first time Fredo looks almost like a splitting image Vito Corleone. The mustache, hair half way back, tired eyes, he\u2019s wearing a suit and tie. His whole appearance in The Godfather 2 resembles Vito. Contrast that to The Godfather 1 where after he\u2019s been in Las Vegas and Moe Green for awhile he wears flashier clothes, clean shaven and sunglasses, more jovial. \n\nI think the reason for Fredos change is (movie speaking) is that after Moe Green and Mike becomes Don at the end Godfather, Fredo is in limbo. A mentor he took after is dead, Mike is the new Don and there\u2019s nothing for Fredo. He probably thinks to himself \u201cIf I can\u2019t be powerful like Mike, maybe I can matter by being loved like Pop\u201d So he try\u2019s to model himself like Vito. \n\nRoth/Ola and everyone knows Fredo has always been the weakest Corleone. Even as Fredo tries to emulate Vito, Roth/Ola see through that and are able to manipulate Fredo easily. Fredo wants so badly to matter and be respected like Vito but never does. \n\nAll In all that Havana scene is fantastic because while Michael lays out his thinking about Roth and who wants Michael dead, Fredo never shows his hand during that scene possibly channeling his inner Vito. \n\nSo let me know what you think and if this has been discussed before I\u2019d like to know!",
