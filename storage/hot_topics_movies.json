There are even a few I've watched that have left me feeling nauseous; not from any particular content, but more from color saturation/camera techniques/I don't even know.

        "title": "'Anaconda' (2025) Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anaconda_2025): 46% (57 reviews) with 5.40 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anaconda-2025/): 44/100 (25 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; While the new film dutifully serves up the callbacks you\u2019d expect, you never get a sense of why these buddies connected to this property more than any other. It\u2019s enough to make me wish I could have seen Doug\u2019s The Anaconda instead. Sure, his \u201cindie-style\u201d project seems to feature a nonsense plot, amateurish acting and extremely questionable action. But at least it would be a labor of love. Gormican\u2019s Anaconda is just a big-budget IP extension trying to pretend it\u2019s something sweeter and scrappier than it is. You don\u2019t need to fall prey to its pretense.\n\n-[Angie Han, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/anaconda-review-paul-rudd-jack-black-1236454664/)\n\n&gt; \u201cAnaconda\u201d constricts its premise a little tighter as it moves along (if only because the absurdity ratchets up in a way that forces the film to adopt a clearer sense of itself), and there are some undeniably amusing bits of stupidity along the way. The post-modern stuff tends to fall flat, but, say, the sequence where Jack Black runs for his life with a regurgitated hog strapped to his back is hard to deny. And honestly, all I\u2019ve ever asked of a movie \u2014 any movie \u2014 is that it make at least two jokes at Jon Voight\u2019s expense, and on that score I have no choice but to acknowledge that Gormican\u2019s meta-sequel delivers, if only just. Still, this self-reflexive Hollywood sendup is so slapdash and unsure of itself that it ultimately feels less like a bad in-joke than a case of a snake eating its own tail. \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anaconda-movie-review-2025-paul-rudd-jack-black-1235169505/): C\n\n&gt; The movie could have really used some of that anarchic, industry-skewering \u201cTropic Thunder\u201d energy. The only risk taken here was asking Sony \u2014 plus any surviving members of the original cast \u2014 to poke fun at themselves, which only goes so far when the film has no fangs.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anaconda-review-1236610556/)\n\n&gt; Anaconda is a disappointing follow-up for Gormican, who cannot crack the code on Sony's bewildering aquatic not-really-horror reboot. A cast of proven funny people are lost in a thick brush of hacky bits and ineffective storytelling, unable to machete their way through to a redeeming climax. There are brief bursts of creature-feature excitement and belly-tickling humor, but way more stretches of bafflingly unclear ambitions that feel like they're struggling to keep the \"movie within a movie\" gimmick afloat. It's Anaconda without the aqua-horror chills, throwback practical effects, and midnight-movie entertainment \u2014 what an odd choice.\n\n-[Matt Donato, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/anaconda-2025-review-jack-black-paul-rudd): 4 out of 10 \"bad\"\n\n&gt; If \u201cAnaconda\u201d had actually been made for $40,000 \u2014 no stars, all new faces \u2014 its pluckiness might have shined through and a message of some kind might actually have been made. Or at least, to quote Gormican\u2019s movie, \u201cThemes!\u201d Instead we get a movie where big name actors punch downward, at the helpless \u201cAnaconda\u201d movies, and at audiences who like \u201cAnaconda\u201d movies, and at all the low-budget filmmakers who work very hard to make good movies, even the schlocky ones. When all is said and done, it can\u2019t hold a candle to all the genuine, ultra-low budget, unapologetic claptrap it\u2019s lampooning. Well, except for \u201cAnacondas: Trail of Blood.\u201d They can\u2019t all be winners. The new \u201cAnaconda\u201d proves that.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/anaconda-review-paul-rudd-jack-black-thandiwe-newton/)\n\n&gt; Regrettably, the one star of Anaconda that gets the shortest shrift is the most important one: the snake. While the film features some monstrous attacks, they play out like something out of an especially uninspired SNL digital short. Sure, the original film and its increasingly lower-budgeted sequels may be funny, but they still pay respect to their creature-feature roots. If Gormican and company had more seriously considered why this particular piece of I.P. continues to resonate, the film may have potentially balanced the horror and comedy elements in a manner that would have satisfied both fans and newcomers to the series.\n\n-[Mark Hanson, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/anaconda-review-jack-black-paul-rudd/): 2/4\n\n&gt; Rudd and Black make the new Anaconda easy enough to accept as a comedy with a dash of clunky effects-based creature action, rather than a full-blown horror-comedy. Intense fandom of the earlier film isn\u2019t necessary to have a good-enough time at this one, and Gormican deserves some credit for smuggling a mid-2000s-style studio comedy back into theaters under the guise of IP (the universal desire for which also gets shouted out here, naturally). Anaconda never reaches the delirious heights of Steve Martin\u2019s similarly themed comedy Bowfinger. But it shares more DNA with that movie than some silly giant snake.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/23/anaconda-review-jack-black-paul-rudd): 3/5\n\n&gt; Anaconda may be getting the benefit of the doubt here because of how few studio comedies make it to theaters. In another era, it might easily have gotten lost in a wave of post-modern updates that included The Brady Bunch and Starsky &amp; Hutch. Its plot offers few surprises, but its simple foundations and character motivations give Rudd and Black so much room to play that it\u2019s an amiable time. The two stars keep the energy and charisma in strong supply, while their film uses low expectations to its advantage, knowing that a good comedy doesn\u2019t need to squeeze too hard.\n\n-[Matt Schimkowitz, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/anaconda-review-2025): B\u2013\n\n&gt; Anaconda\u2019s early scenes, set in Buffalo and seemingly shot there, look appropriately shabby; the interiors are cluttered and drab, and filled with overexposed daylight pouring in from unshaded windows. For a couple of minutes, Rudd and Black\u2019s characters get to act like authentic friends who\u2019ve lost touch and reconnected over their mutual love of movies, over this art form\u2019s power to tell stories that unite people in the dark through their shared connection and humanity. Then they go and run from a CGI snake for an hour. One sad I thought had watching Anaconda: If this is the only stuff modern Hollywood makes now, would these aspiring auteurs even want to work there anymore?\n\n-[Matt Singer, Screen Crush](https://screencrush.com/anaconda-2025-review/): 4/10\n\n&gt; The thing about a film like the original Anaconda is that arguments about whether it was good or not are beside the point \u2014 it fell squarely into that prime Blockbuster Video era in which a film could be so inescapable that its quality for a certain generation is incidental. A sequence in which Doug, Griff, Kenny, and Claire reminisce gleefully about scenes from this bit of pop-culture ephemera they caught during college gets at this fact perfectly, that what they\u2019re pining for is not the movie itself, but this stretch of their lives in which they had time to hang out with their friends. The rest of Anaconda, which involves a quirky Brazilian snake handler played by Selton Mello and a mysterious local with dangerous secrets played by Daniela Melchior, unfolds clumsily and, worse, too earnestly, as though the point all along were to rediscover the magic of filmmaking. Son of Rambow this isn\u2019t. Anaconda may have always been asking too much of its source material, but this reboot has been fatally defanged.\n\n-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-jack-blacks-anaconda-asks-too-much-of-nostalgia.html)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nFour childhood friends: Doug, Griff, Kenny, and Claire, seeking to recapture their youth, travel to the Amazon to film an amateur remake of the 1997 film *Anaconda*. Their project unravels when a real giant anaconda emerges, turning the light-hearted shoot into a perilous fight to stay alive. The movie that they're dying to remake?

I suggested he watch some films from that decade but being 12 he\u2019s showing his ignorance by not even entertaining the idea of watching 80\u2019s movies. I watched John Carpenters The Thing with him a month ago and he seemed lukewarm on it, even though I knew he was scared shitless. \n\nSo what 80\u2019s films would he actually enjoy? I suggested he check out The Goonies, well, because it has Bob from Stranger Things in it. Other than that I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be receptive to any other movies I throw his way. I\u2019m open to suggestions ",

        "content": "Some movies don\u2019t stop to explain themselves. They move forward and assume you\u2019re watching closely. Characters don\u2019t always say what they feel. \n\nScenes don\u2019t always resolve in neat ways. You\u2019re expected to read between the lines.\n\nNo Country for Old Men does this in a very deliberate way. Important events happen without buildup or explanation. Violence arrives suddenly and leaves just as fast. The film never tells you what it all means. It just places you in that world and lets you sit with the consequences.\n\nThen there\u2019s Lost in Translation. Almost nothing in it is spelled out. The connection between the characters' lives in small gestures, half conversations and shared silence. You understand what\u2019s going on because you\u2019ve probably felt it yourself at some point.\n\nWhat I like about movies like these is how they stay with you. You think about them later. You replay scenes in your head. On a second watch, things land differently because you\u2019re bringing more of yourself into it.\n\nI\u2019m curious which films made you feel this way. Movies that trusted you enough to stay quiet and let you do some of the work.",

        "content": "This is kind of niche but I notice that a lot of the time the protagonist doesn't realize the paradox until it's too late or they never realize what kind of situation they were in at all.\n\nI watched TENET recently, where the entire foundation of the movie is, putting a LONG exposition short, &gt;!based on effect coming before cause. But cause must happen eventually. It's paradoxical, but the protagonists use this to their advantage when they understand how things work. Unlike a bootstrap paradox, where the point of origin doesn't exist, you at least know what the cause is in TENET.!&lt;\n\nNow I'm not necessarily looking for something similar, but it fits the idea of the protagonists being in a bootstrap, and they can either accept it or fight against it (most likely failing, otherwise it wouldn't happen at all, right?). I don't care if they break the paradox or if they continue the cycle, I just want them to realize it sooner than the point of no return.",

        "content": "Christmas 1992.\n\nThe lights in your theater dim. The trailer for Jurassic Park looks INCREDIBLE. Your movie starts.\n\nAfter getting in trouble for shooting his bullying older brother with a BB-gun, a 10-year-old boy travels to New York with his parents a few days before Christmas. After a traumatic incident a couple years ago, his parents don't like to let him out of their sight, and after the BB-gun shooting there's no way they're letting him stay home with the rest of his siblings.\n\nThe family checks into Trump's Plaza Hotel, where the boy's father is attending a business conference. As his parents mingle at a Christmas mixer with the other businessmen and their wives, the boy disobeys their command to stay with the childcare workers who have been tasked with watching all the much-younger children of the other executives, giving his babysitters the slip so he can wander the halls of the hotel, causing mischief and exploring.\n\nSuddenly, gunfire rings out as a slick group of Euro-trash terrorists disguised as a catering company seize control of the Christmas party, taking dozens of high-value hostages. In another part of the hotel, their children are ALSO taken hostage. All of their children, that is, BUT ONE...\n\nNow back in his room watching an old gangster movie, the boy doesn't initially realize that the gunfire isn't a part of the movie he's watching. Eventually, after drawing himself a luxurious bubble bath and setting up a TV where he can watch it while soaking, he steals some money from his parents' bags and goes out into the hall to find a vending machine. On his way, he runs across an MP5-toting terrorist, who gives him chase.\n\nThe boy runs back to his room and slams the door, locking out the terrorist in the nick of time. As the terrorist works to kick down the door, the boy looks desperately for a place to hide. The door bursts open and the terrorist storms in, taunting the boy as he tosses the room in search of him.\n\nWith only the bathroom left to search, a maniacal grin spreads across the terrorist's face. He moves slowly towards the bathtub, certain the boy is hiding in the water under a foot of bubbles. \"I've got him!\" he whispers into his radio. BUT, just as he's about to plunge his hands into the water, the boy slips out from behind a robe hanging on the wall, kicks the terrorist in the balls, and shoves him headlong into the bath. As the terrorist bellows with rage and tries to get up, the boy pushes the TV into the bathtub, horrifically electrocuting the terrorist to death.\n\nIn the aftermath of his first kill, the boy arms himself with the terrorist's MP5. It's one hell of an upgrade from his old Red Ryder. Next, he finds the terrorist's radio, which the terrorist had dropped to the floor after getting kicked in the nuts. With it, he works to make contact with the police and slips off into the night, using the hotel's ventilation system, elevator shafts, and dumb waiters to move about undetected.\n\nBack in the conference room where all the hostages are corralled, the boy's parents notice that the terrorists are extremely angry. They overhear talk of a terrorist being killed and a kid who is missing from the childcare center. They look at each other, wide eyed, and whisper:\n\n\"Only Kevin can drive someone that crazy...\"\n\nElsewhere in New York, a phone rings. A man gets up from dinner with his wife and kids to answer it. It's the chief of police, calling to tell the man they've got a situation. The man tells the chief he's not working tonight and he has to get back to his family. He's about to hang up.\n\n\"Wait!\" pleads the chief. \"You're going to want to hear this.\"\n\nThe man groans and keeps listening. The chief informs him that terrorists have seized dozens of hostages at The Plaza Hotel, but that one 10 year old boy is on the loose, has killed a terrorist, and is feeding information to the cops. SWAT has the building surrounded, but it's too dangerous to go in. The Chief thinks their only hope is to send in one man to find the kid and take over feeding the cops information from the inside. \n\n\"You're the only man on the force with experience in this kind of thing,\" finishes the chief. \"It has to be you.\" The man thinks. Looking back at his family and pondering the situation. For a moment, he says nothing.\n\n\"He's just a kid, John. He's alone, he's scared, and he hasn't seen diddly squat from us.\" The man sighs. He knows what he has to do.\n\n\"Fine... But there better be a limo waiting to pick me up when this is over,\" the man agrees, because it'll be a cold day in hell before Detective John McClane let's Kevin McCallister DIE ALONE.",

I know it\u2019s not particularly popular because of the overly dark and gritty aesthetic as well as some questionable choices regarding Ms. Cratchit. HOWEVER I really appreciate how much time they dedicated to Scrooges past to explain how he became this gnarled old bastard instead of just kind hand waving it off. Guy Pierce also plays a fantastic Ebenezer.  \n\nAnyway, what are your favorite versions? Give me some new variants to watch this year. ",

Dolores isn\u2019t just cruel, she\u2019s smug, self-righteous, and hides her abuse behind fake sweetness, which makes her even worse.\n\nAnother one is President Coin from *The Hunger Games*. I hated her from the get-go. She presents herself as calm and reasonable, but it becomes clear very quickly that she\u2019s just as power-hungry and manipulative as Snow, if not more so. Her willingness to sacrifice innocent lives for control makes her incredibly unsettling.",
