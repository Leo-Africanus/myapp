        "title": "'Five Nights at Freddy's 2' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2): 13% (47 reviews) with 3.70 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/five-nights-at-freddys-2/): 32/100 (15 critics) \n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; In 2021, two years before the movie version of \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d came out, there was a jokey indie horror movie called \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d that was a total knockoff of the \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d concept. It starred Nicolas Cage as a drifter who gets stranded in a small town, where he\u2019s forced to spend from dusk till dawn cleaning the title emporium. The animatronic mascot attacks in that movie were genuinely violent (and 10 times as inventive as the ones in the \u201cFreddy\u2019s\u201d films), and Cage, who literally didn\u2019t speak a word of dialogue in the entire movie, had so much aura that he turned the act of cleaning into something hypnotically satisfying. \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d made a total of $450,000 at the box office, but it was nifty and riveting horror camp. \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2,\u201d which will likely make $60 million this week, is slapdash product that never quite figures out what it\u2019s doing. It operates according to one rule: The gamers must be served.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-josh-hutcherson-1236599283/)\n\n&gt; Five Nights at Freddy's 2 gives sequels, video game adaptations, and gateway horror movies a bad name. Cawthon adheres too rigidly to his franchise's muddy mythology, coyly withholding some information and dumping exposition elsewhere\u2014both at the bafflingly wrong times. Tami is a gun for hire here, bringing no secret sauce to the pizza party. The saving grace of outstanding animatronics is worth embarrassingly little when \"generic as sin\" is the nicest compliment anything else deserves. No film is meant to please everyone, but even considering the diehard fanbase Cawthon has cultivated, it's hard to tell who Five Nights at Freddy's 2 will impress with a film so bad that it'd be a franchise killer anywhere else.\n\n-[Matt Donato, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-review): 3.0 \"awful\"\n\n&gt; This reviewer could have done with considerably more mechanical monster mayhem, actually, and the denouement promises just that, before falling flat. A flaccid Freddy Fazbear finale. Our expert suspected the sequel was aimed more at setting up future installments than delivering a satisfying movie experience in and of itself. He sums: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of awesome if you\u2019re a fan of the games, but if you\u2019re not, there\u2019s nothing to like about it.\u201d\n\n-[Michael Ordo\u00f1a, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/)\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat idiot designed this?\u201d Mike asks himself, the film pausing for its audience to knowingly chuckle. \u201cThis dumb thing is from the game, Mike,\u201d they all are supposed to think in unison. \u201cIt\u2019s dumb in a way we recognize and therefore enjoy.\u201d Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2 spends so much time on set-ups like these that a majority of its 104 minutes seem to be those pauses. In fact, its entire third act is just expectation for a third movie that hopefully never comes. It is a bare minimum branding experiment, a dumb thing designed to be recognized with the hope that enjoyment will simply follow.\n\n-[Jacob Oller, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review): F\n\n&gt; Those sorts of things don\u2019t seem to interest Cawthon. By all evidence, he is singularly unqualified to write towards human experiences that aren\u2019t marblemouthed attempts at references. He\u2019s protecting a franchise, of which Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 positions itself as an installment, rather than a real movie. As such, it doesn\u2019t bother with a proper ending \u2013 though the beginning and middle it provides suggest that this may not matter. Its shrug of a quasi-cliffhanger may not matter to its young target audience, either. Some of them, though, along with anyone else not inherently besotted with game iconography and YouTuber cameos, may start to wonder what it would be like to watch a real horror movie \u2013 or just one made with the comforts of baseline hackwork. Like a lot of movies, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 has its own souvenir popcorn bucket. This may be the first one where the bucket is more entertaining than the feature.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/04/five-nights-freddys-halloween-review-game-horror-film): 1/5\n\n&gt; The first film confined the murderous animatronics to the restaurant but in Freddy\u2019s 2 they escape their digital shackles, creating the potential for funny and frightening encounters with everyday people. But Tammi and Cawthon never successfully exploit the scenario, conjuring up only dull horror sequences and uninspired comedic bits. The killer mascots may spring the coop, but this sequel never breaks free of its own conventionality.\n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-maniacal-mascots-remain-star-attraction-of-dull-horror-sequel/5211622.article)\n\n&gt; Cawthon, who single-handedly penned this stopgap slog, is poisoning his own creation. Tammi's direction is swallowed up by baked-in pacing issues and storytelling logic on the same level as a 2nd grader trying to improvise an explanation for why they didn't bring their homework. But that's exactly what made the games so popular in the first place, because the ludicrous lore allowed for fans to fill in the blanks and build community in the process. \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2\" plays out like a movie written by Reddit fan theories that will only make sense to people who were forged in the discourse mines. \"FNaF 2\" fails to deliver on anything cool promised in the trailer (FazFest is shown for like, 5 minutes max), and well-placed Easter eggs, cameos, and one-liners does not a good movie make.\n\n-[BJ Colangelo, Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/2042991/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/): 4/10\n\n&gt; Mike and Vanessa battling the Marionette and its minions is pure comedy. One scene in particular is so egregiously silly, you can't help but cackle like a hyena. It is absolutely critical to the film's resolve and somehow comically absurd, and that's definitely not what Tammi and Cawthon intended. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is meant to be a horror experience, so belly laughs shouldn't have been on the menu. The climax needed a different edit to rectify this major problem that derails the film.\n\n-[Julian Roman, Movie Web](https://movieweb.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/)\n\n&gt; The result? The movie fails to tie up any loose ends surrounding Mike and Vanessa's slightly confusing relationship, the Marionette's revenge, and new character Michael's purpose, and wastes otherwise exciting characters such as Matthew Lillard's Afton, Skeet Ulrich's Henry Emily, and McKenna Grace's paranormal investigator Lisa. This could all be put down to Blumhouse wanting to leave as many doors open as possible to keep fans on their toes for further Five Nights at Freddy's movies. However, it's hard not to feel shortchanged, as though we have waited two years for a Five Nights at Freddy's 1.5.\n\n-[Megan Garside, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/): 2.5/5\n\n&gt; Despite the odd flash of gore (this is a \u201815\u2019 certificate, so expect minimal scares), the film\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s utterly boring. More uninspiring than a supermarket Margherita pizza, it\u2019s one of the poorest movies of 2025.\n\n-[James Mottram, NME](https://www.nme.com/reviews/film-reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-josh-hutcherson-matthew-lillard-3915960): 1/5\n\n&gt; It\u2019s an incoherent mess, something that, back in the day, would be straight to DVD. \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d has an after-school special vibe with no real horror and no real awareness that it should. \u201cWhat kind of kid would want to come here?\u201d asks Mike. Indeed.\n\n-[Mark Kennedy, Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-review-19c0cb318d6049c518f51c7f7ff4a330): 0/4\n\n&gt; When life is one giant question mark, people crave periods. But one can still have hope that at least a hint of integrity can worm its way into the most low-tier, craven entertainment products. Abandon any such hope if you buy a ticket to \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d. There\u2019s simply nothing of value here, not even the thrill of an adrenaline rush from a cheap jump scare. Any attempts at shock are hollow and laughable. The viewer is likely to leave the theater feeling similar to how Josh Hutcherson appears in this film, understandably checked out, vacant, and simply worn down.\n\n-[Cody Dericks, Next Best Picture](https://nextbestpicture.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2/): 1/10\n\n&gt; Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is less of a movie and more of a series of fan service moments, Easter eggs, and teases of the overarching game lore, held together by baffling plot choices and characters acting with complete stupidity at every possible turn. It\u2019s a sequel more invested in setting up the next entries than anything else. The killer animatronics are still just as dazzling, with Megan Fox\u2019s Chica bringing a spark of murderous personality, but this all amounts to a collection of game nods and nothing else. It\u2019s sure to dazzle the devout fanbase who simply want to see their favorite characters and references on screen, but, with bafflingly silly logic and an entire third act dedicated to expositional setup for more, it\u2019s an inaccessible misfire for everyone outside of the fandom.\n\n-[Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3920001/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-killer-animatronics-cant-save-convoluted-sequel/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town's first ever Fazfest. Former security guard Mike and police officer Vanessa have kept the truth from Mike's 11-year-old sister, Abby, concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. But when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy's, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nEmma Tammi\n\n**WRITER**\n\nScott Cawthon\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nLyn Moncrief\n\n**EDITORS**\n\nTimothy Alverson &amp; Derek Larsen\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\nDecember 5, 2025\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n104 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$36 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt\n\n- Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa Shelly\n\n- Piper Rubio as Abby Schmidt\n\n- Matthew Lillard as William Afton\n\n- Theodus Crane as Jeremiah\n\n- Skeet Ulrich as Henry\n\n- Mckenna Grace as Lisa\n\n- Teo Briones as Alex\n\n- Kellen Goff as Toy Freddy\n\n- Megan Fox as Toy Chica\n\n- Matthew \"MatPat\" Patrick as Toy Bonnie",

        "title": "A love letter to Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)",
        "content": "This little-known and undoubtedly controversial movie has, via \u201cslow burn,\u201d become perhaps my favorite movie of all time. I\u2019ve never posted here before, but I want to tell others about why I love it so much and perhaps explain what I feel are some very incorrect and/or dismissive takes on it, particularly from critics when it first came out. \n\n\nWithout spoiling anything, this is a mockumentary-style film that satirizes teen beauty pageants. It is set in a small town in Minnesota, and there is no shortage of satire in that regard, either. At times it feels almost as if someone involved in production was a victim of a teen beauty pageant - the satire is sometimes so biting that it feels like someone is deeply angry that teen beauty pageants exist and made a film to blow off some steam. \n\n\nPerhaps it is best to start with why some people *didn\u2019t* like it. In some ways, Roger Ebert\u2019s 2/4 stars encapsulates the critique: it\u2019s funnier on paper than it is when it comes time to actually make the damn thing; once the scenes have actually been shot and the screenplay has been faithfully executed, we are left with a number of extremely uncomfortable visuals, such as &gt;!the main character\u2019s mother having her hand fused to a beer can as a result of being caught in a fire!&lt; and &gt;!the ridiculous portrayal of a profoundly anorexic former beauty pageant contestant.!&lt;\n\n\nBut, I\u2019m sad to say, this take so completely misses the point of the movie that I\u2019m honestly not sure how anyone could be led to it. We have to remember what the ultimate point of the movie is, which is a satire of the deeply disturbing practice of placing teenage girls on a stage and judging them based on their looks and vibes and smarts. What terrible psychological and physical consequences this must exact on these children - and how jarring it must be to experience these consequences alongside the Midwestern small-town culture and socialization that tells you \u201cthis kind of thing is supposed to be fun and an opportunity for you to show yourself off, young lady!\u201d \n\n\nWhy *shouldn\u2019t* a movie that deals with something so awful use distressing visuals at times to make its point? Of course it is true that former pageant participants go on to struggle with &gt;!anorexia.!&lt; Why should the movie ignore that? Of course the pageant is going to attract the attention of &gt;!local pedophiles, some of whom may even find their way onto the panel of pageant judges.!&lt; Refusing to portray these disgusting but elemental things, just because they are disgusting, is wrong and would be doing a disservice to real people who have undoubtedly been traumatized by participating in them.\n\n\nWhat a strange critique. And, as best I can tell, this is really the only substantive thing that people who didn\u2019t like it have to say. \n\n\nSome people who aren\u2019t familiar with the Midwestern US may fail to understand some context. Take, for example, the hilariously named &gt;!Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club,!&lt; which is exactly what it sounds like. Ebert had a stereotype of Midwestern Lutherans as being \u201cpeaceable folks,\u201d and took this to mean that the idea of a &gt;!Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club!&lt; is too preposterous to be real. Only a person completely unfamiliar with the rural Midwest would make such a generalized stereotype and be so dismissive of the joke. I\u2019m a recovering Midwesterner myself and I can represent to you without hesitation that the &gt;!Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club!&lt; and many other little Midwestern-isms in the movie are uncannily close to the truth. \n\n\nI sincerely believe that the people who didn\u2019t like it can be put into two categories - the first is the category that Roger Ebert is in: simply missing the point and not knowing anything about the Midwest. The second is the category of people who *did* get these things but were made so uncomfortable by the film\u2019s ruthless exposure of the sinister undersides of small-town America that they invented other reasons not to like it. \n\n\nBut that is precisely what makes it good. And dear god, is it funny. There are some scenes which, if your sense of humor is just right, will have you hyperventilating. \n\n\nRest assured that this is one of the funniest movies ever made. It was ahead of its time when it was made and, I suspect, probably disliked for being too critical of Midwestern culture. It will seem behind the times now, in the politically correct era that we live in - but the critique of the Midwest might make more sense to people now than it used to. In this way it is a movie whose time simultaneously came and went.\n\n\nAnd what a shame.\n\n\nI have so much more to say about it, but will refrain from doing so to avoid spoilers. I hope my post will cause some people to watch it. Even if you end up not liking it for one reason or another, I think you will still find it is certainly a very unique movie. Nothing like it will ever be made again.\n\n\nThis post is also made, I hope, with the tacit approval of my grandfather, who still lives in the Midwest and who loves this movie more than just about anything else. When it first came out in 1999, he went and saw it in the theaters 2 days in a row. The second day he brought my grandma, who was so embarrassed by how much he was laughing at it that she possibly considered divorcing him /s. I\u2019m happy to report that they are still married, and have been for the last 60 years. ",
