This film has new, younger characters who are believable and (mostly) likeable, a well-written story, interesting subplots/ back stories which don't detract from the main storyline, a new artificial life character who is different from any we have seen before, plus some tub-thumping one-liners which pay homage to Ripley. This is probably the second best movie of the entire franchise, after Aliens.",

        "content": "I'll begin by saying that this movie is absolutely one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen. The bright colors (red, orange, yellow and green) have such an impact on the vibe of the film. With that said, Theo wears ALOT of red and orange colors. Similarly, the OS1 primary color is a bright orange which matches his shirt in the posted frame. Colors like red and pink symbolize love, and In this case, the start of Theodore and Samanthas romantic journey. Theodore continues to wear these bright orange/red shirts during the \"Honeymoon phase\" (as Theodore calls it) of their relationship. It signifies a healthy beginning to true love.\n\nHowever, as we dive into the issues that Theo and Sam face, he wears more neutral colors such as pale blue and white. When Sams prostitute shows up, Theo is wearing a white shirt. In this moment Theo is extremely uncomfortable, as he is being asked to have sex with someone hes never met by his computer girlfriend. This ultimately causes a pretty deep split between the two, probably the biggest we see in the whole movie aside from the breakup.\n\nAlthough It is a pretty obvious detail, the color usage is a very nice touch in my opinion. I love that colors symbolize the strength and status of Theo and Sams relationship as the movie plays on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vmtsjj4twoe1.jpg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0480a652ffe064fcd40d642c62d3100348a651\n\n",

The film seems to drop oblique hints, but does not address it directly:\n\n- In the opening scene, he has an uncomfortable conversation with the lady cop asking if her daddy ever \"disciplined\" her.\n\n- He has a very weird family dynamic where he has fathered each daughter by two sisters, and they all live together. The younger daughter is even a bit confused by this and ask if she's the product of incest.\n\n- The older daughter despises him and becomes very upset whenever he touches her.\n\n- There's a scene where he invites the younger daughter to watch TV with him instead of doing homework, and says \"we won't yell mom.\" He sits on the couch with his arm around her, and the camera lingers on him as he looks at her.\n\n- In the scene where the daughters visit him in the hotel room, he says \"I've never hurt you\" and the you ger daughter becomes upset to the point where she can't even speak and the older daughter rushes her out.\n\nIs this what the film was implying?",

        "content": "I was 7 when I saw E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL in the cinema for the first time. \n\nMy dad took me down to the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and I remember we waited in a long line. A VERY long line. \n\nMy grandmother had taken me to see RAIDERS the year before at the Mann\u2019s Chinese and the film had terrified and exhilarated me, but at 6, I\u2019d spent a good portion of the film peeking through my grandmother\u2019s fingers as she covered my eyes with her hand. That would not be the case with E.T. - though I recall the beginning was a bit scary for me. \n\nI was immersed in the film almost immediately and by the end I was sobbing when I thought (spoiler alert for a 43 year-old film) E.T. had died, elated when he came back to life and crying all over again when it was time for E.T. to return home. \n\nI saw the film easily a dozen times in the theater. Back then movies would play for 6, 8 or even 9 months. And then Universal rereleased it. My grandmother would take me almost every weekend to see it at the Edward\u2019s El Toro Cinema. It was, for a long time, the only thing I wanted to do when I\u2019d visit her. It\u2019s no wonder the film was the highest-grossing of all time for eleven years (a record it held until Spielberg's own JURASSIC PARK surpassed it in 1993). \n\nCut to 2024 and a friend found a beautifully illustrated children\u2019s book of the film and bought it for me. I read the book to my 4 year-old who loved the pictures and became fascinated by it in storybook form. In retrospect, I wish I\u2019d waited to read it to him, but the book doesn\u2019t include a lot of what\u2019s in the film and, of course, can never reach the level of emotion. \n\nI had planned to wait until my son was 7 and, based on my experience, the critical age to be absorbed emotionally by the brilliance of Spielberg, the stunning performance of young Henry Thomas as \u2018Elliott,\u2019 the supporting cast and the sheer overwhelming genius of John Williams\u2019 score\u2026 but having loved the book so much, he kept asking to see the movie so, tonight, I finally pulled out the 4K disc, shut off all the lights and turned up the surround. \n\nI was not disappointed. Even knowing many of the beats from the film, my son was completely transported - to the point that, during the scenes with the doctors, he turned to me and was legitimately worried that this was where the storybook and the film would diverge. His eyes were watery and he asked, \u201cwait, Dada, he\u2019s not really dying is he? \u2026Is he?!\u201d\n\nBy the end, I was reduced to a puddle again (there is no faster way to connect me with my inner 7 year-old than to put that film on or play that score) and my 5 year-old watched in rapt attention, weeping as E.T. and Elliott said their goodbyes. \n\nAs the credits rolled he looked at me, wiped his eyes and smiled. He said, \u201cDada I loved it.\u201d And then, a moment later, said, \u201cnow I can watch it anytime.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading if you did. \n\n\n\nIf you didn\u2019t: Tldr: Showed my kid E.T for the first time. It played perfectly. \n\n\nWhat was a film that knocked you out that you got to share with someone in your life who had never seen it (a friend, a family member, whoever)? How did they react to it and what was that experience like for you, re-experiencing it with someone?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "It would be easy to assume that *The Day the Earth Blew Up* is the movie Warner Bros. chose to support while *Coyote vs. Acme* was the one they tossed aside. That narrative would almost make sense\u2014one was buried for a tax write-off, and the other actually made it to theaters. But that\u2019s not the real story.\n\n[It\u2019s not an either-or situation, it\u2019s a \u2018WB screwed over both, but one got out situation.](https://preview.redd.it/ulcjmuo6zroe1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674172cb353bf0ae70941c17a6762cf12424eb6b)\n\nThe truth is, WB abandoned **both** movies. They didn\u2019t choose The Day the Earth Blew Up over Coyote vs. Acme\u2014they just happened to **sell this one off to Ketchup Entertainment like a piece of scrap they had no use for.** If Ketchup hadn\u2019t stepped in to save it, WB wouldn\u2019t have cared whether it ever saw the light of day. This isn\u2019t a case of Warner Bros. picking one Looney Tunes project over another. It\u2019s a case of an independent distributor **giving a damn when WB didn\u2019t**.\n\nYou can still be angry about what happened to *Coyote vs. Acme*. You can still hate that WB is gutting its animation division and treating finished films like tax loopholes. But here\u2019s what makes *The Day the Earth Blew Up* different: **it got out.** And because it got out, we have a rare chance to show WB that selling off Looney Tunes was a mistake.\n\n**Warner Bros. doesn\u2019t make a single dime from this movie\u2014they sold it off and walked away.**\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another nostalgia cash-in. It\u2019s a full-length, **hand-drawn, theatrical Looney Tunes feature**, something we haven\u2019t seen in decades. And on top of that, it\u2019s weird in the best way\u2014a mix of slapstick, sci-fi horror, and classic comedy, with Daffy and Porky thrown into a surreal alien invasion. Critics are loving it, and audiences who\u2019ve actually seen it are too. But because WB threw it away, **Ketchup doesn\u2019t have a marketing budget to let people know what it even is.** If you haven\u2019t heard much about it, that\u2019s not the movie\u2019s fault\u2014that\u2019s just the reality of being saved at the last minute by a distributor that doesn\u2019t have billions to spend on ads.\n\n**Because this movie didn\u2019t get the massive marketing push of a major studio release, strong word of mouth is the only way it can reach the audience that would truly appreciate it.**\n\nSupporting this movie doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re \u201cpicking\u201d it over *Coyote vs. Acme*. It just means you\u2019re giving a discarded Looney Tunes movie a chance to prove that WB was wrong to sell it off in the first place. Theaters are where we get to make that statement. Streaming will come later, and people will eventually discover it there\u2014but if this movie succeeds in theaters, it sends a clear message that Looney Tunes *still belongs on the big screen*.\n\nIf you were looking for the fastest way to tell David Zaslav to go screw himself, this is it.\n\n",

        "content": "one of my all time favorite tv shows is adventure time. it's easily one of my top 10 favorite tv shows of all time. i love the characters, the writing, the animation, the humor, the surprisingly complex plot, the voice acting, the action, the everything! it's so fucking amazing! i've also enjoyed the distant lands and fionna and cake spin offs.\n\nin june of last year(a few days before my birthday which was a nice little bonus), it was confirmed that an adventure time movie was in development. as you can imagine, this made me quite happy. what made me even more excited was the fact that adam muto, patrick mchale, and rebecca sugar would be returning to work on the movie.\n\nwe still don't know what the plot is going to be or if it will even feature finn and jake. however, i'm eagerly anticipating this movie. bonus points if it's going to be in theaters.",

        "content": "This movie nails the miserable mundane life on an office worker (and any job really) it\u2019s hilarious and also kinda sad because of how accurate it is. Everything depicted in terms of a job in this film has happened to me, the traffic in the morning, the annoying co workers, the passive aggressive boss who you can clearly tell is trying to be sarcastic and piss you off, the annoying soul sucking phrases (\u201csounds like a case of the Monday\u2019s\u201d) and if you screw up, you have 3 different people telling you the same shit within the span of 10 minutes and you have to just suck it up and take it, unfortunately as long as these jobs exist, this film will remain timeless. The second half of this film is just as great at the first because it shows all the things that YOU WANT to do but can\u2019t because you\u2019ll get fired, Mike Judge really nailed the realism of jobs, and it\u2019s one of my all time favorite comedies, however it can also be called a documentary\ud83d\ude02",

        "title": "I have a question for anyone familiar with Highlander (1986) and its sequels. How is the katana so old?",
        "content": "(I tried going to /r/highlander to post this question, but it appears submissions are restricted for whatever reason.)\n\nSomething in this movie is confusing me. When Ramirez is telling Connor why he has to leave his wife, he explains that his last wife's father was named Masamune, and made his katana around 600 BCE. Later in the movie, it's brought up that the katana's metal is in fact dated back to around 600 BCE, but it's also brought up that this is very strange, considering Japanese katanas weren't made like that until the middle ages. (And this lines up with history; Goro Masamune was indeed a real Japanese swordsmith, but he lived around 1300 CE.) The reason Brenda is so invested in figuring out this case is because finding that sword would be like (as she says it) finding a 747 from a thousand years before the Wright brothers were born.\n\nThis is all very intriguing, but it never really gets touched on again (in the first movie at least, correct me if it's explained in later movies). How did Ramirez get a folded katana from nearly two thousand years before katanas were ever folded? For a moment I thought maybe the movie was implying that Goro Masamune was an immortal (hence why he would be around for two thousand years, still making katanas the same way he learned in his youth) but that can't be since Ramirez was married to his daughter.\n\nDoes this ever get explained? It seems very weird to bring up a huge mystery like that and then never touch on it again. It would have been easy to just have Ramirez say he got the sword a couple hundred years ago (Brenda would surely still be interested in a one-of-a-kind katana made by the legendary swordsmith Masamune) but they make a very deliberate point of how it was made in such an anachronistic fashion.",

The reason my mother let me pick it out (from a VHS RENTAL STORE, GASP HOW ANTIQUATED) was because it had a kid in a ghost face costume on it walking with a guy she must have assumed was his father (Costner).\n\n  \nNah, this was about a pair of murderers who break out of prison and kidnap said kid, kind of a road movie with Eastwood as the Texas Ranger chief who is chasing them. It's worth a watch, it's a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first \"anti-hero\" sad movies. \n\nAnyway, anybody else got stories like this?",

He played the German who escorts Big X played by Richard Attenborough off of the prison camp to be executed at the end. \n\nI always felt that this guy didn't get the credit he deserved for playing a German soldier so much during controversial times, not even that long after WW2 ended. Great Escape was shot in 63', not even 20 years after the war was over. \n\nIt wasn't cool back then to play a German and Karl Otto Alberty knocked it out of the park everytime. Do yourselves a favor and check this man out. \n\nEdited: typos\n\n\n",
