I don\u2019t think this is a groundbreaking take but it was really special to me to just have that \u201cah-ha\u201d moment.\n\nWhen you think about The Dude and how much of a ~go with the flow~ kind of person he is, constantly adapting, you can then really see how he is the embodiment of living by Taoists principles. Just an entire movie dedicated to shit happening over and over to a singular individual wrapped up in the strands and complications of everyone else\u2019s problems. You would expect that to be a terrible experience, and at times it can be, but rather than submitting to despair he just abides. As he abides, there are moments of serenity, more often than not in the bowling alley.\u00a0Now he does go through the range of human emotion as you would expect one to go through during all these events, but not only is that normal, that is what is expected of trying to live and abide in balance with all there is and all that can be. The ol ying and the yang you know? The Dude just simply continues to be. I find that deeply moving and deeply spiritual. We are all just travelers in this iteration of who we are and all we can do is continue to trying to abide and not spill our beverage.",

You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

It is officially the best zombie movie I\u2019ve seen. The whole \u201cI kick arse for lord\u201d, breakfast with zombie to baby\u2019s day out was just hilarious.

I don't need compelx motivations, it is just the right thing to do because its the right thing to do? I can't think of many examples that do this - everything seems to have a complex back story. ",

        "content": "Usually when I watch a movie, I can figure out my rating pretty quickly, either right after or within a day or two. I always land on some score out of 5. But with 2001: A Space Odyssey, I\u2019m just stuck. I\u2019ve been left in awe, confusion, and something I can\u2019t even put into words.\n\nI\u2019ve already watched breakdowns and analyses of the film and its ending, and yet I still can\u2019t decide if I absolutely love it or just really like it. I\u2019ve never had a movie make me feel this way, like the issue is that I\u2019m not even sure how to process it, let alone rate it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way about the movie? If so is it because it\u2019s some sort of masterpiece or is just rlly good cinema?",

        "title": "'Apocalypse Now' is one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - cinematic experiences I've ever had",
        "content": "An ever-degrading fever dream. That's what watching Apocalypse Now I felt like. It probably didn't help that I watched it while coming down from a fever, sweating and a little uncomfortable, with an overcast, drizzling sky outside - but damn, the *atmosphere* this movie creates is second to none.\n\nIt's a bad trip that gets worse and worse, as Willard and his crew undertake their hellish odyssey down the river to find Kurtz. I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I was aware that Apocalypse Now is loosely based on that story. It's a masterful interpretation of that story, widening the scope and scale and making it feel somehow even more sinister.\n\nA lot of this is due to how the movie *looks.* Apocalypse Now might be the most visually stunning movie I've ever watched. It's frankly insane to me that it came out almost *50* years ago because it would still blow away pretty much anything released by even the best directors today. It looks so bold, lush and vibrant, with incredible shot composition and lighting. A sickly orange-yellow glow suffuses the landscape, and mist and fog always shrouds the horizon. It's like the characters are traversing through hell, and it adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie.\n\nIt also has one of my favourite cinematic interpretations of war in a movie. Sure, it shows war as bad, and Americans as imperialists and all of that. But more than that, in Apocalypse Now, war is much more abstract, a dark, primordial force that acts as both catalyst and conduit for humanity's darkest urges. It affects everyone. Killgore, Kurtz, the boys on the boat, Willard. Everyone becomes a beast prowling through the jungle. \n\nMarlon Brando's limited screen time is as impressive as advertised - both the writing and his performance, along with how he's shot - portray him as almost a mythical figure out of a twisted fairy tale. Kurtz is more a concept and an idea than a man. Martin Sheen is more restrained, but you can always see the madness just under the surface.\n\nAnd there's that steadily escalating nightmare-feel of the movie, and what makes it so damn incredible. Each sequence and set piece feels more surreal, bleak and unhinged than the last, culminating with the ritual slaughter/assassination at the temple that's one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I've seen in a long time. Honestly, even if you choose not to overanalyze the movie or interpret what it's trying to say, I think it would still be a 5-star watch based simply on the power of its audiovisual presentation alone. It's such a staggering achievement in filmmaking, I can't say enough about it.\n\nNote: I watched the 2 hr 27 min. theatrical cut. At some point in the future I'll probably check out Redux or The Final Cut",

There are four separate times in the movie where they leave Weaver alone and the killer either breaks into her place, stalks her, or kidnaps her. 4 times.",
