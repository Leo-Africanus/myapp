The dinosaurs went from being completely terrifying killing machines to now just cartoon characters like when Blue winks at the audience and pretends to be dead. Also Hammond's former business partner uses the exact same DNA cloning techniques that were used on the dinosaurs to clone his deceased daughter into another person who becomes a main character. \n\nDominion goes even further to the point where the dinosaurs are just a background noise for the movie. The plot centers around some billionaire who wants to engineer a bunch of locusts to destroy the world's crop supplies so people will buy his food instead, oh and there's some scenes with dinosaurs here and there. Also the original cast came back to remind you you're watching a Jurassic Park sequel.\n\nAt this point JP3 seems like the last faithful sequel which is not really a good thing",

        "title": "'Disney's Snow White' - Review Thread",
        "content": "Director - Marc Webb  \nStarring - Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnapp, Martin Klebba, Ansu Kabia\n\n*A beautiful girl, Snow White, takes refuge in the forest in the house of seven dwarfs to hide from her stepmother, the wicked Queen. The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as \"the fairest in the land,\" and Snow White's beauty surpasses her own.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [46%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white) (Rotten)\n\n**Metacritic:** [47/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/snow-white/) (Mixed or Average)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot-disney-1236167607/)\n\n&gt;Webb proves equally adept at romantic interludes, attack scenes and production numbers, notably the joyous finale, \u201cGood Things Grow,\u201d with the entire cast outfitted by Powell in resplendent white. Sure, those poorly integrated CG little people take some getting used to, but this is the type of wholesome and uplifting family entertainment that comes directly from old-school Disney DNA.\n\n[Awards Watch - Erik Anderson \\[C+\\]](https://awardswatch.com/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-is-the-fairest-of-them-all-in-marc-webbs-fairytale-remake-c/)\n\n&gt;*Snow White* is more clearly made for children than most of the other Disney live-action remakes, and its focus on being a fairytale helps with that goal. This is a simple story that anyone can understand and enjoy, with a cheer-worthy lead and some catchy, if unmemorable, new songs. The film threads the needle about as well as it possibly could, which is impressive even if it doesn\u2019t mean the film is actually great. You may not be whistling on your way out of the theater, but at least watching *Snow White* doesn\u2019t feel like work.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot-1236340753/)\n\n&gt;You could say that we\u2019ve seen other fairy-tale rulers a lot like this one. Yet movies connect in mysterious ways. Who would have thought that a Disney live-action remake could seem this pointedly political? In the end, the most resonant romantic feeling \u201cSnow White\u201d leaves you with may be: Someday my chintz authoritarian will come tumbling down.\n\n[FandomWire - Manuel](https://fandomwire.com/snow-white-review)\n\n&gt;Rachel Zegler is the heart and soul of this film. Not only does she deliver an impressive vocal performance, but she also radiates charisma and emotion in every scene. Her Snow White is fearless, fair, brave, and true like she should be, elevating the character to a new level of sophistication. It\u2019s disappointing to see how many people will leave outside influences to shape their perception of her work because this is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable performances of the year from one of the most talented actresses of her generation.\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey \\[1/5\\]](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey)\n\n&gt;With Snow White, they\u2019ve finessed their formula -- do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices. The film\u2019s prince, played by Andrew Burnap and, for some reason, called Jonathan, is essentially Disney cannibalising itself, as he has the same thief backstory and curtain bangs as *Tangled*\u2019s Flynn Rider. There\u2019s self-cannibalisation at work, too, in Sandy Powell\u2019s costumes, which are dour replicas of their animated counterparts. At times, Zegler\u2019s bob leans dangerously close to \u201clittle Dutch boy\u201d. What\u2019s most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney\u2019s choices have become.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/snow-white-review-disneys-worst-live-action-catastrophe-yet/)\n\n&gt;From a strictly political standpoint, it provides a more enlightened portrait of female independence. Such a nominal improvement, however, proves inherently incompatible with its source material, and the resultant awkwardness defines this misfire, whose every duplication is underwhelming, and whose every alteration is less a move in the right direction than a step on a face-smacking rake. No Magic Mirror is needed to identify it as the lamest Mouse House re-do of them all.\n\n[Guardian - Peter Bradshaw \\[1/4\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/19/snow-white-review-live-action-musical-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot)\n\n&gt;Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are now forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives. Here is a pointless new live-action musical version of the Snow White myth, a kind of un-Wicked approach to the story and a merch-enabling money machine. Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks.\n\n[RogerEbert.com](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/rogerebertcom/) \\- [Nell Minow](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/nell-minow/)\n\n&gt;Some parts of the film work better than others, but none of it has the sweetness and imagination of the animated feature. This \u201cSnow White\u201d is not the fairest of them all. It\u2019s just, well, fair. The other core elements of any version of this story are all present here, with varying degrees of success. Near the top is replicating Disney\u2019s version of the iconic magic mirror that answers the question about fairness (the mirror for \u201cSydney White\u2019s\u201d nemesis is the online campus popularity poll). This one is close to the 1937 film\u2019s design, familiar to Disney fans through many appearances in various productions, from the \u201cWonderful World of Disney\u201d series of the 1950s, when it was voiced by Hans Conried, through the popular \u201cDescendents: Wicked World\u201d series of 2015-17.\n\n[The Film Verdict](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/4059) \\- [Alonso Duralde](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alonso-duralde)\n\n&gt;Like so much of contemporary fantasy cinema, Snow White exists in a weirdly artificial netherworld, and not just where the seven dudes are concerned.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Jacob Oller](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jacob-oller)\n\n&gt;For every attempt to replicate majestic shots from the original or to give them a bit of technological oomph (perhaps most effective as sunlight breaks through Snow White\u2019s fearful first trip through the forest), there is a spurt of modern quippiness that pulls the audience in the other direction. It\u2019s a disorienting take on a film whose success relied as much on its elegance as its beauty, and yet, thanks to sunny songstress Rachel Zegler, there is a talented throughline still obvious amidst the mess.\n\n[New York Magazine/Vulture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/334) \\- [Alison Willmore](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alison-willmore)\n\n&gt;*Snow White* is, for better and (mostly) worse, a product of a corporation that has for years been lumbering after its idea of the zeitgeist with all the agility of an aging colossus. That, in chasing something vaguely progressive and YA-inspired with *Snow White*, Disney has turned out a film with some hilariously timely choices is a great joke, though I wouldn\u2019t call it an intentional one. The most pragmatic aspect of Snow White is that with its plasticky set design and gift shop tacky costuming, it already looks like it takes place in a theme park \u2014 no adaptations necessary.\n\n[Consequence](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2610) \\- [Liz Shannon Miller \\[C+\\]](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/liz-shannon-miller)\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, the best parts of Snow White are the parts that feel genuinely real and authentic. If only there were more of those, and less screen time spent dancing in the realm of mind-breaking absurdity.\n\n[The Playlist](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2100) \\- [Rodrigo Perez](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/rodrigo-perez) [\\[C-\\]](https://theplaylist.net/snow-white-review-oppressed-princess-reclaims-kingdom-from-occupying-tyrannical-queen-in-otherwise-boring-loud-spectacle-20250319/)\n\n&gt;Films are supposed to be passion projects, even the biggest and kitschiest, but one wonders what in this material compelled Marc Webb to dedicate two years of his life to this hollow and soulless project seemingly meant to move merchandise other than hopefully what was a very handsome paycheck. White interjecting its social commentary, \u201cSnow White\u201d otherwise tackles much of the same ideas, but it\u2019s all put together in a very familiar and garish package. The fairest in the land? Far from it.",

Not to sound ridiculous but I have a dog that looks very much like a small bear, and I think I'm projecting hard onto my precious baby pup lol\n\nThe movie even gave Buchanan a cute ending, where we see that what he really wanted was to perform again and be appreciated. So sweet. \n\nI can't believe I only heard about how good this movie is recently and decided to watch it. It is now a favorite movie of mine!",

        "title": "Looking for action movies with EXCELLENT choreography and overall fight scenes, preferably many of them, any kind of martial art is fine.",
        "content": "To clarify what I personally find makes the choreography of a fight scene excellent\n\n1. Believable (at least to an extent). Little to no dancing monkeys, moves that lean towards effectiveness rather than flashiness. (I know, it's a movie, some flashiness is to be expected)\n2. Brutal - Not tournament martial arts, and not just for the antagonists, but for the protagonist as well. It's cool to see the good guy absolutely kick ass, but it's even more satisfying for me, personally, when they get THEIR ass kicked, but manage to barely come out on top. All the better in \"real\" fights as opposed to tournament settings.\n3. Camera work - no shaky cam T\\_T I can forgive this one, but HUGE plus for smooth camera work.\n\nSome movies I've seen that fit the bill to varying degrees, in no particular order:\n\n* The Raid: Redemption/Raid 2\n* The Night Comes for Us (I'm a huge fan of Iko Uwais, if you couldn't tell)\n* John Wick 1/2 (loved 3 and 4 but they got a little campier, still LOVE them but they don't scratch the same itch)\n* Eastern Promises\n* Netflix Punisher (not a movie, less believable maybe, but great nonetheless)\n* The Man From Nowhere\n* Old Boy\n* Bourne movies (So much shaky cam tho T\\_T)\n* Nobody (first half mostly, second half got campy, which again I like campy, just not what I'm looking for in this post)\n\nHonorable Mentions (good and enjoyable but didn't scratch the itch like the above movies):\n\nKingsman movies, Equilibrium, Matrix\n\nI could go on but I'll never remember all of them, thanks in advance for any suggestions!",
