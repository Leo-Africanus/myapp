Brilliant message and fantastic film.\n\n9. The Crying Game.\n\nNot interesting in the gender aspect, but it's about being different in general. And about love in different and difficult circumstances.\n\n8. Life of Brian  \nAbsurdity of religion, blind faith, mob mentality etc. And funny of course.\n\n7. Made in Britain  \nRage, working-class alienation, intelligence not recognised. Brilliance from Tim Roth!\n\n6. The Death of Stalin  \nPower, fear, stupidity, revisionism, narcissism. Intelligence not recognised.. Treating powerful ideas as a joke. Funny!\n\n5. Scum  \nPure brutality, survival, violence. Corruption of institutional systems. Intelligence not recognised (again!).\n\n4. Trainspotting  \nAlso Intelligence not recognised, addiction, escape, working class underclass. Tragic and funny.\n\n3. Withnail and I  \nFriendship, existential crisis, class, depression. Bleak and hilarious - very British.\n\n2. The Wicker Man  \nReligion, innocence, fear, total blind faith. Community (all be it extreme!). Powerful, strange horror.\n\n1. Kes Working class oppression, lack of opportunity, coming-of-age, finding beauty amid bleakness, and, of course, intelligence not recognised .",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been binge watching early 2000s parody movies, so now I\u2019m posting another hilarious scene. This time, from my favorite parody movie ever. I debated between this, the shotgun shovel scene, and the scene where the sheriffs hat keeps getting bigger lol. This is definitely one of the best comedies of the early 2000s and imo, the last good scary movie in the franchise. Everything after just didn\u2019t have the same magic as the first 3, and especially this one. There are tons of  hilarious moments in this film it\u2019s hard to pick just one. Which other scenes from this movie stand out to you? ",

        "content": "New to this platform and love being able to engage about some of my absolute favorite movies as just a regular person. I would give this movie a score of 99/100 points (nothing\u2019s perfect they say but DL comes very close imo.) Ahhh Glenn, John, Swoosie and the young Uma and Keanu all give stellar performances. It\u2019s tradition I watch this movie at least twice usually during the holiday season for whatever reason?  I guess one can say I\u2019m into \u2018period dramas\u201d perhaps DL is a precursor to Bridgerton? I think there\u2019s a contemporary version re-do? Cruel Intentions\u2019 w/ Reese, Sarah, Selma &amp; Ryan is a cool adaptation? Saw it once. It was entertaining but not like DL. Any recommendations  with  a similar vibe with exceptional acting like DL.",

I watched Spiral last year and quite enjoyed his performance. I've been watching Fargo tv series and currently am on season three and there he is again in a good dramatic role. Two weeks ago I came across New Jack City again  and just;  WOW!! I know I watched it sometime  around 1992 probably on home video as a young teen but never realized til now it was him. He put his all into the role of Pookie.",
