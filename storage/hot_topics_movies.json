We're the filmmaking team behind DREAM EATER, a new found-footage horror film out in theaters October 24th.\n\n**Here's the trailer for our film:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivl9iXq98TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivl9iXq98TU)\n\n**About Dream Eater**: \n\nDuring their holiday at a cabin deep in the snowy Laurentian mountains, Mallory documents her boyfriend Alex\u2019s violent parasomnia. When his sleepwalking gets worse, Mallory suspects the cause may be something far more sinister than a mere sleep disorder. Using her expertise as a documentary filmmaker, Mallory digs into Alex\u2019s shadowy past and begins to unravel a decades-long mystery steeped in trauma and the occult. As darkness closes in, an ancient evil awakens \u2013 plunging the couple into a downward spiral of madness and horror that threatens to destroy more than just their relationship. By the time the end credits roll, DREAM EATER will have you questioning who you\u2019re really sleeping next to at night.\n\n**Website**: [https://horrorsectionstudios.com/dream-eater/](https://horrorsectionstudios.com/dream-eater/)\n\nAsk us anything!

        "content": "*A man claiming to be from the future takes the patrons of an iconic Los Angeles diner hostage in search of unlikely recruits in a quest to save the world.*\n\nCast: Sam Rockwell, Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Pena, Zazie Beets\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100% (5 reviews)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_luck_have_fun_dont_die)\n\n**Metacritic:** N/A (updating)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[SlashFilm - Rafael Motamayor](https://www.slashfilm.com/1979287/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;What follows is a truly bonkers, balls-to-the-wall, hilarious sci-fi adventure that starts out as \"Repo Man\" and ends up going full \"Akira.\" It's bold, it's got a great cast, it's one of the timeliest genre movies in years. It is great to have Gore Verbinski back.\n\n[IGN - Matt Donato](https://www.ign.com/articles/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-review-sam-rockwell-haley-lu-richardson) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;At its best, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die is a laugh-filled yet incredibly dark and poignant fever dream that pleads for a safer AI tomorrow. Verbinski's command over utter chaos is nothing short of marvelous, even if the pacing slows while jumping between storylines that eventually all fit together. There's a hopefulness that tries to prevent the film from feeling fatalistic, like there's nothing we can do about AI at its most harmful. But it's also quite entertaining, as Rockwell leads his ragtag squad into escalating unknowns that he actually knows after so many failed missions. As offbeat and dreamlike as Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die becomes, ballooning in scale as time ticks down, its timeliness and prescience are still its most impressive factors. A film this wacky shouldn't be this straightforward, and yet here we are, cleaning the glitter off our bodies; you'll understand soon enough.\n\n[Fandom Wire - Sean Boelman](https://fandomwire.com/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-fantastic-fest-review/)\n\n&gt;Ultimately, much of the film rides on the back of Sam Rockwell, who is giving one of the most unhinged, fun performances of his career. In the years since his Oscar win for *Three Billboards*, he\u2019s been taking on more \u201cserious\u201d work, and while he\u2019s great at that too, it\u2019s nice to see him return to his zanier *Confessions of a Dangerous Mind* and Justin Hammer side. He is incredibly charming and thrives in this comedic space, and his lead performance makes the over-two-hour runtime\u00a0",

Regardless of the film\u2019s shortcomings, it\u2019s a thrill to have this giant of an actor back on a movie screen, hopefully next time with a more satisfyingly fleshed-out screenplay.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/28/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The younger Day-Lewis shows promise as a film-maker \u2013 Anemone certainly\u00a0*looks*\u00a0serious, the correct scowls and swirling skies and wordless, eerie montages to suggest weighty themes, big emotions and ominous suspense. The tools to back up that style with emotional punches that land like the real ones of the brothers \u2013 best believe they tussle it out, because of course \u2013 are not yet refined, but in this father-son duo, at least, I have faith.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236530758/):\n\n&gt;There are flashes of talent in \u201cAnemone.\u201d Ronan Day-Lewis, who has come up in the world as a visual artist, knows how to frame a shot, and he\u2019s canny about playing off the mystique of his father. The whole plot, with Jem entreating Ray to come out of his self-imposed exile, is almost a sly metaphor for how Daniel Day-Lewis would take a sabbatical from acting to become a cobbler or cabinet maker, or for his retirement now. Yet for most of its 125-minute running time, \u201cAnemone\u201d just sits there.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/09/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-ronan-day-lewis-sean-bean-1236557832/):\n\n&gt;*Anemone*, is a film that doesn\u2019t live in or anything\u2019s or anyone\u2019s shadow, even though that\u2019s what the story is essentially about, a plot point made all the more salient by the casting \u2014 or perhaps that should be\u00a0*positioning*\u00a0\u2014 of acting giant Day-Lewis Sr. in his first starring role since\u00a0*Phantom Thread*\u00a0(yep, another PTA production). Press-wise, the fervor for this long-anticipated return has already done a lot of heavy lifting, especially for savvy arthouse audiences. But, although he could so easily have rested on his old man\u2019s laurels, Day-Lewis Jr. instead exploits those\u00a0*expectations*\u00a0of his father\u2019s power (more of that later), and he does so in a fuss-free way that serves the story surprisingly well, right up until the actor finally coughs up his elusive character\u2019s shocking backstory.\n\n[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anemone-review-ronan-day-lewis-1235153177/) (B):\n\n&gt;This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn\u2019t placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It\u2019s disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can\u2019t put them back together again. But everything that\u2019s come before is so rich that you\u2019re ready to forgive it. The title, by the way, comes from the flowers that bloomed from Ray\u2019s own father\u2019s planting. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.\n\n\n# \n\nCast:\n\n* Daniel Day-Lewis\u00a0\n* Sean Bean\u00a0\n* Samantha Morton\u00a0\n* Samuel Bottomley\u00a0\n* Safia Oakley-Green\n\nDirected by Ronan Day-Lewis\n\n",
