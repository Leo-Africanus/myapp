Seeing her Rose Sayer go from being a conservative spinster into a adrenaline-crazed adventuress and have it come across as organic instead of contrived never ceases to be impressive. She was overshadowed by Humphrey Bogart for many critics. In my mind, she was as equally good as he was. \n\nSpeaking of \"The African Queen\", more film aficionados must discover it. It's a very good picture.",

I really liked the premise of this ancient evil being held prisoner by an ancient order only for Nazis to kill them and accidentally release it, and a subsequent fight to lock it back up. Great 80's soundtrack and cool visuals, especially the evil being. However the movie feels chopped in half and stapled back together, with massive jumps in story. It doesn't recover and so I understand the movie's low rating.\n\nI feel this movie would be perfect to remake. They could set it in Syria or Iraq where you'd have a similar play out with an ancient evil being released during the war and destruction of the cultural sites. Showcase some of the ancient Mesopotamian evil monster mythology. You could really play into the horror.\n\nWhat would be another example you feel for a movie deserving of a remake?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As kids, we are more vulnerable, more honest, more able to express our feelings and I must say the first time I saw Stand By Me, I felt the movie was so honest and so real about how young teen boys interact with one another. \n\nThe four leads looked like your average kids and they didn't have perfect families, they all had something going on. Even Gordie, who seemed to have the most stable family life, was dealing with the loss of his older brother and being the \"invisible kid\" in his home life. \n\nThe four boys going on this adventure, looking for a dead body, ends up being a journey where they get to find themselves and grow up. By the end, you feel a change has happened. \n\nAnd it's such a sad movie. River Phoenix was in a league of his own, Chris had everything to be a Juvenile delinquent given how much of an outcast he was in the small town he was stuck in, and instead, he's the nicest and most reasonable boy in ther group, the one who tries to stop the fight and have everyone get along but at the same time, he was tortured by how rejected he was, to the point where he had his heart broken after being betrayed by a grown up, a teacher whom he trusted. \n\nAnd then that last scene breaks your heart. You never forget how impactful it is.\n\nAnd the narrator was right, you never get the kind of friendships you had at 12 as you have as an adult. I didn't understand that as a kid but as an adult,. I now get it.",

This is why I\u2019m optimistic about\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, as it seems like Johnson is going back to basics to escape his recent VFX-heavy run.\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0will be a sweaty reset \u2013 which is what Johnson has relied on for 20+ years of success.\u00a0\n\nJohnson has made a career out of talking/posting/writing about his sweat. The tagline for his Under Armour collaboration is \u201c[BLOOD, SWEAT, RESPECT](https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2018/11/blood--sweat--respect.html),\u201d and when\u00a0[talking about his career,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-rock-inside-dwayne-johnsons-turbulent-delinquent-pre-fame/)\u00a0he said, \u201cYou gotta get up in the morning, you gotta get after it, you gotta put in the work, you gotta sweat. There\u2019s gonna be heavy iron, and there\u2019s gonna be a lot of sweat, and it\u2019s gonna be dirty.\u201d His Instagram posts almost always make sure to include the word \u201c[Sweat](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Qr-GNyoYk/?img_index=therock).\u201d. He\u2019s basically worked sweat into his persona ([Sweat Equity\u00a0](https://www.instagram.com/therock/p/CQpiWpdFyRq/?hl=en)is his thing), so this data isn\u2019t as random or dumb as you\u2019d think.\n\nThe sweat levels should only go to 10, but after watching his movies again, I had to create an \u201c11\u201d category because there are a handful of movies in which Johnson\u2019s sweat glands work overtime. To place each film in their respective categories, I rewatched his movies, looked for sweaty scenes/moments (Yes \u2013 it\u2019s wild, but I had to follow the idea), and came up with a chart. It wasn\u2019t too hard because, since 2017, I\u2019ve been assigned a\u00a0[handful of Dwayne Johnson data posts\u00a0](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/dwayne-johnsons-12-trillion-movie-damage-bill/)and research assignments, so they\u2019ve familiarized me with his filmography. Also, if you're want to learn more about the data collection I recorded a podcast episode about it (Movies, Films and Flix pod - you can find it anywhere).\n\n* **Category 11 \u2013 Red**\u00a0\u2013 The distribution makes me happy\n* **Category 9 \u2013 10 \u2013 Purple**\u00a0\u2013 on average, it\u2019s the most lucrative category\n* **Category 5 \u2013 8 \u2013 Green**\u00a0\u2013 Hasn\u2019t made a category 5-8 movie since 2017\u2019s\u00a0**The Fate of the Furious**.\u00a0\n* **Category 0 \u2013 4 \u2013 Orange**\u00a0\u2013 6 of his last 10 movies fall in this category.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pshv2wn5sv0e1.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b210c750904264b8e3d997d8f364e0ac701180\n\nSix films fall into the 11 category:\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain &amp; Gain, Skyscraper*, and\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0(it\u2019s hypothetical). In their own way, these movies have proven important in The Rock\u2019s\u00a0 evolution as an actor and act as cornerstones of his filmography that have influenced his career.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown. I included longer explanations of their importance below, but these work as nice cliff notes if you are in a hurry or hate reading.\u00a0\n\n* **The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 In an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that when\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0was met with praise from critics, action fans, and general audiences, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\u00a0\n* **The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013 After\u00a0*Walking Tall, Doom, Gridiron Gang,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Be Cool,*\u00a0Johnson needed a hit, which came in the form of the PG-Rated Disney film\u00a0*The Game Plan*. Not only did it help him build a new fanbase, but it was his first non-action film to make more than $100 million worldwide.\u00a0\n* **Fast Five (2011)**\u2013 Once again, after\u00a0*Southland Tales, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Faster*, Johnson found new management and reset his career path. He shaved his head, gained 30 pounds, and got mean again for\u00a0*Fast Five.*\u00a0This propelled him into the action stratosphere.\n* **Pain &amp; Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013 Not only does it feature his best performance, but it\u2019s also his best R-rated film, and he will probably never play a character like this again. In 2013, both\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*\u00a0and\u00a0*Snitch*\u00a0failed to clear $100 million at the worldwide box office \u2013 that hasn\u2019t happened since.\u00a0\n* **Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013 The movie underwhelmed at the box office and kicked off a new era of \u201cimmortal Superman\u201d Johnson. It\u2019s wild watching this film now and seeing a Dwayne Johnson character crying while cradling his daughter atop a burning skyscraper (don\u2019t worry, Neve Campbell saves the day).\u00a0\n\n**Here are longer explanations of why these films are important (if you read the above section, you can skip to the numbers below)**\n\n**1. The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson\u2019s first starring role in\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0was a success, and it did well theatrically. Still, Johnson wanted other roles to prove he could carry a dialogue-heavy action film that wasn\u2019t part of an existing franchise. Johnson took\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0role to step up his acting game and credits director Peter Berg as his \u201cpersonal acting coach on set every day.\u201d After watching the film,\u00a0[Ebert gave it 3.5 stars](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u00a0and dropped this doozy of a compliment\n\n* [Ebert\u00a0](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u2013 \u201cEarly in \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d The Rock enters a nightclub to confront some tough guys, and he passes Arnold Schwarzenegger on the way out. \u2018Have a good time,\u2019 Arnold says. It\u2019s like he\u2019s passing the torch. Whether The Rock will rival Schwarzenegger\u2019s long run as an action hero is hard to say \u2014 but on the basis of \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d he has a good chance.\u201d\n\n* I like this David Shoemaker paragraph from his\u00a0[Grantland](https://grantland.com/features/a-look-career-dwayne-rock-johnson-eve-wrestlemania-29-new-film-pain-gain/)\u00a0days \u2013 \u201cFor the first time, Johnson feels like a legitimate star, but that\u2019s mostly thanks to director Peter Berg, who understood that Johnson\u2019s true talent was his humor. Rather than portray Johnson as a muscly automaton in some hard-boiled revenge tale, Berg made a grimy comedy and allowed Johnson to have fun. Even the fight scenes (of which there are many) are played for chuckles.\u201d\n\nJohnson went all out ([he lost 20 pounds for the role to be more lean](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/)), and the positive reviews proved that he could headline a reasonably successful action film. It was a big step in his acting career, and in an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that after acting in\u00a0*The Rundown*, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u2014He carried a critically appreciated action film and proved he could act alongside people like Christopher Walken. It was his first critically adored film and his only Fresh (60% or higher Tomatometer score) film for eight years (2003 \u2013 2011). It\u2019s still his highest-rated \u201cDwayne Johnson\u201d film (*Hobbs and Shaw,*\u00a0he\u2019s a co-lead, and he\u2019s part of an ensemble in\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0and the\u00a0*Jumanji*\u00a0films).\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment(s)**\u00a0\u2013 His character does wipe out an entire army, but it\u2019s nice when he looks fallible. There are some good scenes\u00a0[when he has his butt kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXF9gcUcNU&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&amp;index=7&amp;pp=iAQB),\u00a0[gets harassed by baboons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdYPqVZIB9M&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&amp;index=6&amp;pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[rolls down hills](https://youtu.be/jKyhNbLEKxY?list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut).\u00a0\n\n**2. The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*The Game Plan*\u00a0was Johnson\u2019s first $100 million grossing film since\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0(2002), proving he could headline family-friendly comedies. Johnson said he wanted to make a\u00a0[movie that his daughter could watch,](https://www.blackfilm.com/20070921/features/dwaynejohnson.shtml)\u00a0but it was mainly a smart pivot after\u00a0*Doom, Be Cool*, and\u00a0*Walking Tall*\u00a0didn\u2019t take off. It definitely boosted his box office marketability, and he went on to appear in\u00a0*Get Smart, Tooth Fairy, Race to Witch Mountain*, and\u00a0*The Other Guys*\u00a0(which all grossed over $100 million).\u00a0\n\n**Importance of Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson picked up a new fan base, and the role helped re-spark his career for a short time.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013 He\u00a0[cries](https://youtu.be/ZD8wDJKzEgY),\u00a0[dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFwBMwCOF-Q&amp;pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQuA6Iobmqw&amp;pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sweats](https://youtu.be/XGQRDirweUM),\u00a0[reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI17vaYpW1A&amp;list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&amp;index=9&amp;pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[sings more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfKjInbMjnw&amp;list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&amp;index=20&amp;pp=iAQB). You can legitimately feel the desperation and willingness to do anything to make the movie work.\n\n**3. Fast Five (2011) \u2013**\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0currently has his highest IMDb and Letterboxd scores of any Johnson film, and it legitimately propelled him into the big leagues. On the set of\u00a0*Fast Five*, he told his makeup artist to\u00a0[leave him alone and let him be sweaty](https://x.com/TheRock/status/1336855153719185408)\u2014this paid off.\u00a0\n\n[In an interview with Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a36037/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-0815/), Johnson said he had a moment of clarity in 2010 when he realized he had to \u201cstop, readjust, reassess, and change everything around me\u2014and I gotta take one more shot.\u201d He needed to take one more shot at superstardom after years of movies like\u00a0*Faster, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy*, and\u00a0*Planet 51*\u00a0(*Southland Tales*\u00a0didn\u2019t help either), lowered his stock, and halted any growth as an actor. So, he changed up his management, and after years of talking to Vin Diesel about joining the\u00a0*Fast and Furious*\u00a0franchise, he shaved his head, grew an insane goatee, and put on\u00a0[30 pounds of weight](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/#:~:text='Fast%20Five'%20(2011),-Johnson's%20turn%20as&amp;text=of%20crime%20fighter.-,After%20years%20of%20leaner%20roles%20in%20films%20like%20Tooth%20Fairy,doughy%2Dby%2Dcomparison%20Diesel.)\u00a0(after years of being encouraged to lose weight) to play Luke Hobbs in\u00a0*Fast Five*. The film was a gigantic hit, propelling Johnson into the action stratosphere. It\u2019s worth noting that this is easily his sweatiest film \u2013 and probably his best action movie.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 He got mean again and kicked some ass.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[He loses a fight to Vin Diesel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2PsfXZ3wyY&amp;pp=ygUPZmFzdCBmaXZlIGZpZ2h0). This won\u2019t happen again.\u00a0\n\n**4. Pain &amp; Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*\u00a0features Johnson\u2019s best performance (he\u2019s perfect in it), and it was nice seeing him back in R-rated territory after\u00a0*Faster, Southland Tales*, and\u00a0*Doom*\u00a0didn\u2019t click with the mainstream. Johnson accepted a massive pay cut (the main actors all did this for a cut of the backend) because he loved the complexity of the role, and it was a nice departure from his typical type of role. The film didn\u2019t make much money, but it\u2019s a beautifully sweaty (and nasty) piece of Michael Bay R-rated Bayhem. What\u2019s interesting is that since\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*, he\u2019s veered away from performances like this and, in 2018, said, \u201c[No one\u2019s going to see me play a borderline psychopath suffering from depression](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/dwayne-johnson-the-pain-and-the-passion-that-fuel-the-rock-630076/).\u201d This is kind of a bummer because he\u2019s given up on edgy performances that push him as an actor and instead dove into more safe comedies and action films.\u00a0\n\n**Quick Note**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[During a 2024 GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0he backtracked on his 2018 comments and said \u201cI don\u2019t know who the f\\*\\*k that guy is.\u201d\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 It proved he still had an edge and could push himself in non-blockbusters. Also, as Johnson said, \u201c[The biggest departure](https://theultimaterabbit.com/2019/06/09/dwayne-johnson-on-getting-pumped-up-for-pain-gain/)\u00a0(for me) was the vulnerability, showing this type of vulnerability and playing a character who is easily influenced and who\u2019s just out of prison and looking for salvation.\u201d\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The neighborhood watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diiaCw3frzo&amp;pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz)\u00a0scene is wonderful.\u00a0[He\u2019s terrible at robbing banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8lQy1CTlZk&amp;pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz), and\u00a0[I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll never see him grill a hand again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esg4w4b2xvc&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqr50cPGNoGN1w-TAWqYwpMr&amp;index=10&amp;pp=iAQB).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s easily his best R-rated film.\u00a0\n\n**5. Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0didn\u2019t make globs of money or achieve critical praise, BUT it features a different type of Johnson performance. SPOILER \u2013 At the end of the film, he\u2019s sitting atop a skyscraper and awaiting his death while he clings to his daughter (he\u2019s also crying, which is rare). At the last second, Neve Campbell saves the day and resets the skyscraper\u2019s fire extinguishers. The movie received a lot of pre-buzz because Johnson\u2019s character lost a leg and had to save the day with a prosthesis. It\u2019s an odd choice (I guess it takes away from his superhuman prowess), but he went on an all-out promotional campaign and seemed to genuinely care about normalizing disabilities.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, this is probably the last time we\u2019ll see this kind of character from Johnson. He tried to play a \u201cnormal guy,\u201d and it didn\u2019t work. He followed it up with\u00a0*Hobbs and Shaw*\u00a0(Hobbs becomes a superhero in it),\u00a0*Jumanji: The Next Level*\u00a0(plays a dude named Smolder Bravestone),\u00a0*Jungle Cruise*\u00a0(no spoilers \u2013 you\u2019ll see),\u00a0*Red Notice*\u00a0(barf) and\u00a0*Black Adam*\u00a0(wildly powerful). They are miles away from his\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0character and more in line with his over-the-top persona. So, even though\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a hit, his decisions were somewhat altered because of its lack of success.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 His plan didn\u2019t work, and he slowed his film output. He played a major role in seven films between 2016 and 2018, and has appeared in six films in the last five years.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The finale of the film sees him cradling his daughter while they wait to be burnt alive (he\u2019s also crying)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M06KzvYxlsc&amp;pp=ygURc2t5c2NyYXBlciBlbmRpbmc%3D). He REALLY wanted to seem fallible.\u00a0\n\n**Why do I think The Smashing Machine will be a sweaty success?**\n\n[Here\u2019s a quote from a recent GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0\u2013 \u201cIt was also an opportunity for me, I realized, to stretch myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been stretched yet, and also challenge myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been challenged.\u201d\n\nBetween\u00a0*Red Notice, Black Adam, Jungle Cruise,*\u00a0and the upcoming\u00a0*Red One,*\u00a0Johnson has taken a lot of flak for reportedly being the alleged reason for the swelling budgets and less-than-stellar critical and box office results (there are other reasons, of course\u2026). His\u00a0*Fast X*\u00a0appearance didn\u2019t light the world on fire either. So, when it was announced that he was going to star in the Benny Safdie-directed\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, a film adaptation named after the excellent 2002 documentary about MMA fighter Mark Kerr ([watch the doc \u2013 it\u2019s awesome](https://youtu.be/-7DO5c7gWNw)) \u2013 I knew it was Johnson pulling a hard reset on his VFX heavy blockbuster run. When I saw the sweaty first image, it became obvious that Johnson was up to his old tricks he\u2019s used throughout his career (hard resets and sweaty pivots). What\u2019s funny is that Safdie and Johnson had talked about making the film since 2019, when Johnson bought the rights to Kerr\u2019s story. Johnson admittedly\u00a0[ghosted Safdie for several years](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-mark-kerr-movie-1234940165/)\u00a0(\u201cBenny thought I ghosted him, and maybe I was just a f\\*\\*\\*in\u2019 asshole\u201d), but after years of not-so-great movies and a chat with Emily Blunt, Johnson called Safdie back, and now they\u2019ve made the movie. Johnson says he hasn\u2019t quit \u201cfour-quadrant blockbusters,\u201d but he needed a career reset to explore films with more humanity. It\u2019s a smart move \u2013 and it all points back to sweaty performances.\u00a0\n\n**The Numbers**\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is that his incredibly sweaty films have a slightly higher critical/user average than his less-sweaty movies. The differences aren\u2019t anything big, but they prove that a little extra sweat helps.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**11 \u2013 Wild Amounts of Sweat**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 55.2\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.9\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.5\n* Box Office Average\u00a0 \u2013 $249 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain &amp; Gain, Skyscraper*\n* *Fast Five*\u00a0has the highest IMDb score (7.3) and Letterboxd score (3.4)\n* *The Game Plan*\u00a0was his first non-action film to clear $100 million worldwide\n* *The Rundown*\u00a0was his first film with a Fresh Tomatometer Score\n\nThe biggest drawback to sweat-heavy movies is that they aren\u2019t huge earners.

        "content": "So, a few years ago, I was able to watch for the first time the amazing movie called \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and it blew me away. However, whenever I tried to read about it online, people only ever seemed to talk about the hellish production and how much of a bomb it was, which, sure, that's interesting, but no one seemed to discuss the story!\n\n  \nI don't know how many of you have seen this movie, but to me, its main theme is the phenomena of transmission. This can be seen with the Baron (who is supposed to be an in-universe fictional character) who starts the movie as a decrepit old man but, through his adventures with the young girl Sally, he starts to get rejuvenated, his hair unwhitens, his face uncrinkles, as he is being ressucitated through contact with the younger generation, much like a story.\n\n  \nI'm not sure how much of this theory is purely me overanalyzing the movie, but it seemed so obvious to me. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen tells the life of a story, of the way culture stays living. It's all about the importance of telling stories. In fact, this movie both discusses transmission and acts out transmission at the same time! \n\n  \nBecause who remembered Baron Munchhausen, the old german tall-tale-teller? I didn't. But that movie allowed me to learn about his existence and read his stories (which bangs btw go read it especially the version with the Gustave Dor\u00e9 illustrations). It was able to transmit the story of the Baron onto me, and so I have read some of his stories to my younger cousins.\n\n  \nAnyway, didn't really want to write such a huge wall of text, but I mostly wanted to discuss the story of the Terry Gilliam movie about the Baron. What do you guys think about the story? Am I just overanalyzing?",

I don't think any thread from this little game has ever had this much participation. Thanks for that in any case! And now I ask you to continue just as diligently when it comes to **Italy**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed.
