        "content": "We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.\n\n\nBut on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  \n\nHe's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command &amp; Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! \n\n\nHe's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. \n\nHe has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.\n\nI personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!\n\n\nHe is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. \n\n\nTim Curry.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/29qFh8i.jpeg",

        "content": "I've just watched San Andreas, which is a fun but unsurprisingly unrealistic movie, but one thing that's stood out to me as particularly immersion breaking is the use of time. It's just arbitrary.\n\nFor example, at the start of the film there's a scene where a rescue helicopter is running low on fuel whilst hovering during a rescue.\n\nThe Rock (I don't even think the character has a name, it's always just The Rock playing himself) says \"we have 5 minutes!\". \n\nAbout 15 minutes later and the helicopter is still going. And then they finally rescue the girl and fly back to base, the lack of fuel completely ignored for the rest of the flight.\n\nThe scene already had plenty of jeopardy, why add low fuel as well if it's going to be ignored immediately?! \n\nAnd then later, The Rock is saving his daughter from drowning whilst appearing to hold his breath for 30mins all while doing intense physical exertion. \n\nBonus points for him watching her drown before deciding to try kicking the blockage to free her...\n\nDo these silly time related discrepancies annoy anyone else more than they should? \n\nIs there a name for this?\n\n",

Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher both had phenomenal performances, but I can't stress how great Jack Quaid is in everything I've seen him in.\n\nIf you haven't seen Companion, I highly recommend going in with as little information as possible. A truly fantastic film.",

For me, some genres are almost automatically out of the running like horror or films about war. \n\nIf I was single, I could see myself living in the universe from the movie Companion. There's gotta be better movies though right? Maybe one where everyone is imortal or lives in harmony etc.  \n\nCurious to hear what others come up with.",

        "content": "I know there are several reasons that people will probably give me as to why he probably return to drama. \"He's afraid to take on sinister roles out of fear that people will copy them\", \"He's only doing the Sonic movies for the money and his grandson\", \"He's losing interest in award shows after the Will Smith incident\", \"He's not interested in fame and publicity anymore and wants to retire and do his art and live reclusively\", \"The failure of Dark Crimes killed all potential he had in being a serious actor\", yada yada. But his involvement in The Weekend's Dawn FM album convinced me that he still has what he's got in terms of being serious.\n\nThat's not to say that I respect what he's doing now, but the man has proven to be really talented, and I'd love to see him one day pull off another dramatic (or even comedic) performance and see him finally get his dues being recognized by the Academy before he's gone. Maybe then I could finally stop hearing people mention the same two movies (Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine) over and over again and bring up how he should won awards for either movies. I think Adam Sandler's buzz for Jay Kelly would probably convince him otherwise, but who knows?",

        "content": "Who here likes this movie? Although I've never been religious, I've always thought this was a great movie, primarily for the cinematography, acting, and script. Although the special effects look quite primitive by today's standards, I'm sure at the time that they were cutting-edge. I also like their interpretation of the first 30 years of Moses' life, which isn't in the Bible, and adds a great deal to the context of the story. I also like the added drama concerning Nefertiri as well as Lidia, Joshua, and Dathan. Whatever you believe, I'd say it's a very good story with some powerful moral lessons, most of which is the value of freedom versus tyranny, which is a universal issue transcending time and culture.",

        "content": "Does anyone else have a weird or interesting hobby associated with their movie watching?\n\nFor over a decade now me and my brother have a weekly bad movie night. We have themes for each eight week cycle and it runs on a calendar which includes spots for in-theater bad movies and Stallone movies. There are an extreme number of rules which we agonize over as we construct the cycles for the year. But that\u2019s not the weird part.\n\nAlong the way I stumbled upon the idea to start a fictionalized telling of our lives watching bad movies. Each time we watch a movie I write 300 words that continue the story that is vaguely (often extremely vaguely) associated with the film that week. This has now gone on for years and the story, if written out in full, would be longer than The Hobbit. The story is inane. It kind of melts your brain if you try to read too much of it at once\u2026 but I also genuinely laugh out loud at the outlandish things I\u2019ve come up with on a whim. An example is a whole eight film cycle which started with us becoming enraged at Kevin James and kicking his head clean off. We go to jail, but the video of us doing this goes viral and we are set free because it\u2019s so dope. We then become media moguls centered around this event along with Scott Bakula (who in the story might be our dad)\u2026. This turns out to be a day dream and I fact we instead become good friends with Kevin James. I just can\u2019t quit writing the story because it\u2019s too fun to do. \n\nAnyway, has anyone else picked up a weird habit associated with the films you choose to watch?",
