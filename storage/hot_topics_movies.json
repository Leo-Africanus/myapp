I never noticed an accent slip. There's certain words that UK/Aussie's usually slip on if their accent skill isn't perfected.\n\nToni Collette for just everything I've seen her in. I think I saw a movie where her natural accent was used but I can't even think of it.\n\nBoth I just assumed were Americans until I randomly found out weren't.\n\nEdit: Yes, I made a mistake and put who's and not whose. I get it. Thank you",

        "title": "I\u2019ve watched 22 horror flicks during october - mix of modern and classics - either never seen bevor or last watched as a child. Here are my ratings.",
        "content": "I\u2019m 40, male, European (I\u2019m only stating this so you don\u2019t wonder why I don\u2019t know certain movies), just got laid the fuck off in November and decided to go all in on spooktober. There are some classics in here that I have never seen before and there are some classics that I have seen as an 8 year old but never again since, as well as some modern movies that I have read about. My goal was to close some gaps AND get some new era horror in. Rating scale is not relative to horror but to movies in general. No spoilers. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\n1. Hitcher (1986)\nBelieve it or not: never seen this. I was expecting some creepy slow paced road movie. Oh boy was i ever wrong. I really enjoyed it. But it was almost more of a terminator vibe than anything else. 7.5/10. This could go up to a 9/10 if it keeps staying in my head like it did those past few weeks. Greatly recommended.\n\n2. Final destination bloodlines (2025)\nFun all around. Entertaining and never boring. Great ideas well executed. 6.5/10. recommended.\n\n3. Malignant (2021)\nGreat start, kinda drags on for too long to subvert you. But then gets really fucking great and pays off during the last third of the movie. Loved this one more than I should\u2019ve and would watch it again with friends just to see their faces when shit really gets going. 7/10. recommended.\n\n4. In a violent nature (2024)\nReally enjoyed this \u201ekind of\u201c fresh take/perspective. Even though it doesn\u2019t fully deliver on its premise it\u2019s still special enough to feel different. Atmospheric, really gory, mostly well executed. 6.5/10. recommended.\n\n5. May (2002)\nThis was one of my favorites. Went in completely blind and loved everything about it. Performances are top notch across the board and it just keeps getting weirder with every minute. This is right up my alley! 8/10. Watch this!\n\n6. Dead and buried (1981)\nGreat atmosphere first and foremost. Fun twist at the end. Enjoyed this as well. 6.5/10. Recommended.\n\n7. Cat\u2019s eye (1985)\nStephen King adaptation. 3 shorts. I remember being horrorfied as a kid of the third one. This time around I LOVED the first segment, enjoyed the second one and didn\u2019t really care for the third one. Just for the first one though it\u2019s a 6/10. Not necessarily recommended.\n\n8. Halloween III: season of the witch (1982)\nWired. But kind of cool. Just for what it is and what it was trying to do. Got bored a couple of times during this, but did kind of appreciate it. 5.5/10. Not recommended to the general audience.\n\n9. Barbarian (2022)\nAfter watching \u201cweapons\u201d on the big screen this year (and fucking LOVING it) I had to give barbarian a shot. I do trust directors blindly once I really like one of their movies. So yeah I also liked this one. Not quite as nuanced and witty but just as fucking terrifying. 6.5/10 (weapons 7.5/10). Recommended.\n\n10. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside (2024)\nNetflix movie. I generally don\u2019t have many good things to say about Netflix movies. This one was entertaining with a fun twist. 6/10. Not necessarily recommended.\n\n11. Possession (1981)\nFuck me this was a ride. I cannot decide on if it\u2019s pretentious or genius. Maybe a little bit of both. The dialogues feel unnatural and the sets are sterile but the performances give it so much weight that the creepy fucking reveal in the third act hits like a baseball bat to the head.i really loved the over the top performances by some of these actors and they stayed with me for days. 8.5/10. Watch this immediately.\n\n12. Heretic (2024)\nMeh. Falls short especially at the conclusion and I didn\u2019t really care for it, even though performances aren\u2019t bad. 5/10. Not recommended.\n\n13. Evil dead rise (2023)\nAs an 80\u2019s kid I grew up with the evil dead trilogy. Sadly I didn\u2019t care too much for this one. Last 15 minutes were great creature horror. Everything up to that was rather boring and not at all up to par with anything that came before it. As a fan of the series I guess you would still enjoy it. I\u2019d still have to rate I 5.5/10 and not really recommend it if you\u2019re not an evil dead fan. \n\n14. Nightmare on elm street (1984)\nSo much worse than I remembered. Doesn\u2019t hold up for me at all. I\u2019m much more a John Carpenter guy than a Wes Craven guy and this was just another disappointment after rewatching it. There are so many things wrong with this movie, and don\u2019t get me started on the ending. 4/10. 4 because it gave birth to an icon of the horror franchise (I really only enjoy dream child). Recommended because of cultural impact only.\n\n15. Halloween (1987)\nSo, so much better than I\u2019d remembered. Watched this last when I was like 10, so 30 years ago. This is a true horror classic and it still holds up. It\u2019s so well executed (except for one scene, but I won\u2019t spoil it here). 8.5/10. Everyone should watch this. So do you. Go watch this right now.\n\n16. Tales of Halloween (2015)\nDon\u2019t know why I watched this. First couple of shirts were fun. Then it just dragged on. There were some truly dogshit parts in here. 3/10. Only watch this with your 5 y/o cousin on Halloween night and never admit to anyone that you\u2019ve seen this. (I did enjoy 2 or 3 of the shorts but don\u2019t tell anyone please).\n\n17. The descent (2005)\nGreat! Until it isn\u2019t. Why the fuck are most of them Turing into ass kicking Lara Crofts mid movie? I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to break a monsters neck in pitch blackness. Great premise, pretty solid execution but falls short somewhere in the middle and sadly loses credibly along the way. Still a great movie with pretty decent effects and atmosphere. 6.5/10 - would recommend \n\n18. Skinamarink\nThe fuck was that? I actually watched this all the way through to the end. I\u2019m not quite sure if that\u2019s an achievement or just wasted life. Interesting for sure. As a fan of film and art I really want to enjoy and recommend this. But I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sure some people will get something out of this, as did I. But I can\u2019t recommend this to the general audience. 5.5/10. Interesting. Not engaging. \n\n19. The ritual (2017)\nAnother Netflix movie. This one is genuinely great though. Great performances, great scenery, great atmosphere, fantastic monster design. 7/10. Highly recommended.\n\n20. The Thing (1982)\nLucky enough to have watched this at a beautiful movie theatre this month, this is a Jo brainer. 10/10. No doubt top 5 movies of all time. Don\u2019t need to tell you probably. \n\n21. Return of the living dead (1985)\nGo watch this right fucking now. I\u2019m not even joking. You need to watch this right now. 10/10. \n\n22. Bring her back (2025)\nPositively surprised. Great supernatural horror drama with some truly gnarly and disturbing scenes. 7/10. Recommended.\n\nHonorable mentions from November at the big screen:\n\n- weapons 7.5/10\n- alien 9/10\n- I saw the devil 8.5/10\n- the fly 8/10\n\nHappy Halloween y\u2019all.\n\n\n",

I thought it was a great movie that didn\u2019t deserve the hatred I\u2019ve seen it get for years.\n\nI loved the acting, I thought the story was interesting and left me thinking about the nature of the brain and what we are as humans, the CGI was awful and it was dated even back when it was first released but it has an uncomfortable grit to how thinks look in the VR world, etc. I finished the movie with a smile on my face and a disappointment that I\u2019m one of a few who seems to unironically enjoy it. \n\nIt absolutely has its shortcomings. The plot is ridiculous, it can be pretentious at time, it was named after and partially adapted by a story written by Stephen King and yet it also had almost nothing to do  with the original pitch, and the CGI DOES look like shit for sure; but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m willing to look past its issues because they don\u2019t mean that much to me.\n\nThis thread isn\u2019t about \u201cLawnmower Man\u201d though, it\u2019s about you and your criteria.\n\nWhat are some movies you think get more hate than they deserve? Are you a real man\u2019s man that enjoys the subtle complexities of \u201cThe Room\u201d, or maybe you\u2019re someone who just enjoys slop and doesn\u2019t care what other people think about your interest in \u201cSlow Torture Puke Chamber?\u201d I wanna know what cinematic cinema hot takes you\u2019ve got.",

At one point, they pursued buying the rights to Hidden Fortress because of the strong similarities. At one point, Luke was a female, Han was Luke's brother, Luke's father was the one in prison (interesting point for some debates) and the film featured 40 wookies \n\nEPISODE 5: Once written, the screenplay of Empire is almost exactly what is seen on screen. The only cut scenes were those involving wampas in the rebel base (cut because of time and unsolved technical glitches) and about two minutes of Luke/Yoda Jedi training with no real dialog. \n\nEPISODE 6: Leia was to be elected \"Queen of her people\" leaving her isolated. Han was to die. Luke confronted Vader and went on with his life alone. Leia was not to be Luke's sister. \n\nEPISODE 7: Third trilogy was to focus on Luke's life as a Jedi, with very few details planned out. \n\nEPISODE 8: Luke's sister (not Leia) appears from another part of the galaxy. \n\nEPISODE 9: First appearance of the Emperor.\n\nSource link: https://www.theforce.net/episode1/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp\n\nWhile I enjoy all of the numbered episodes except for 9 and *maybe* 8 (I\u2019m not interested in arguing about any of this!)

        "content": "November, 1986. Chernobyl disaster, Challenger explosion, Lake Nyos disaster, US reestablishes diplomatic relations with the Vatican after more than a century of anti-Catholic sentiment. Pixar is founded, Microsoft goes public and releases the \u201c[IBM PC Convertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_Convertible)\u201d ($5,900 in today\u2019s dollars, 256 KB of RAM and a monochrome display, weighing in at 13 pounds). \n\nAnd Star Trek IV was released. \n\n- - -\n\n\nSiskel: Star Trek IV The Voyage Home is one of those rarest of birds, a sequel that is better than the original. In fact, I liked it as much as any in the whole series, and it's a good series, particularly Star Trek II. How do they do it? I think by remembering that we go to a Star Trek movie to spend time with likable characters who obviously like each other, rather than with most outer space pictures, seeing a whole bunch of cardboard characters fighting all sorts of technological creatures. For example, in this mission to save the planet Earth, Admiral Kirk and Mr. Spock and the rest of the Star Trek crew return to Earth through the streets of San Francisco. This scene may remind you a little bit of Crocodile Dundee, this time with a whole bunch of fish out of water. \n\n&gt; Driver: You watch where you're going, you dumbass.\n\n&gt; Kirk: Well a double-dumbass on you. \n\n&gt; Bones: It's a miracle these people ever got out of the 20th century. They're still using money. We gotta find something. Spock, the rest of you stay here. \n\nKirk: The rest of you break up. You look like a cadet review. \n\nSiskel: Funny bit, saving the planet Earth requires the crew to find some humpback whales that are being sought by a mysterious space probe. The Star Trek crew soon finds themselves underwater. That last bit is from the last part of the movie, and that's the least interesting part The most pleasing part is simply when these familiar characters talk with each other, gently joke with each other. Really, the appeal is not unlike The Cosby Show, Our Father Knows Best, where we're seeing a family affair on the screen, a family with distinct characters who like each other and we suspect at some point love each other. \n\nEbert: I also thought this was one of the very best movies in the series, and it's funny because usually, as you said, sequels get worse and worse and worse. This one is better and better. I love Mr. Spock. \n\nSiskel: They have a lot of humor this time in the fact that he cannot tell a lie. \n\nEbert: So Catherine Hicks, who's the whale expert, is saying, do you like Italian? And Spock says, no. And Kirk is saying, no, yes, we like Italian. No, no, I don't, you know. Do you like it? No, I don't. That's very funny. And then, of course, the relationship between Hicks and Admiral Kirk is interesting. The fact that she is so emotionally involved with these whales, and only on Star Trek, you're quite right, would you have a scene where you start out in outer space in the 23rd century and winds up in San Francisco with [saving the whales](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/climate/whale-threats-solutions-antarctica). That was one of the things the TV series did so well, was to take a contemporary issue and put it into a science fiction format to make a statement about it. So the movie has heart, it has a message, it's a lot of fun. \n\n\nSiskel: I think it has some beautiful writing. They can get away, because the characters are true, they can get away with saying lines that if they're thrown in another movie, you say, oh, it's just a bunch of, that's phony, it's broad emotion. Here, there can be a conversation between Spock's father and Spock that touches us. Because they have these characters down cold, they've kept the team together, which is usually what doesn't happen in most sequels. \n\nEbert: They not only have kept the team together, but Leonard Nimoy is the director again this time, and he has developed into quite a good director. \n\nSiskel: I think he moves things right along. \n\nEbert: It's nice that the people who originally made the Star Trek saga are now still controlling what happens with the movies instead of somebody else with bright ideas to turn it into George Lucas or Steven Spielberg or something. They keep the human element. \n\nSiskel: Right.\n\n- - - \n\n[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1olp6i4/siskel_ebert_review_of_star_trek_ii_wrath_of_khan/nmjlpnd/?context=3) is a similar post for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.",

        "content": "Firstly, it is by far my favorite movie ever. The entire series. All three. I love every moment and every scene, and can pretty much recite every movie line by line.\n\nJust watching the movies, literally every single line is pretty much connected to the bigger story, and looking away/not paying attention for a split second can cause you to miss an Easter egg, a foreshadowing line, or important information. I love how engaging it keeps the watcher. The way that the series finishes complete full circle, and ends on such a good note to \u201cclose\u201d time is amazing. Regardless of the obvious paradoxes that are in the movie, I think that every little thing is important to pay attention to. Even the little things. The recycled lines, the same locations, and same characters, all just fall into place.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any other movie that I have seen or can think of that does it like these movies do.\n\nEdit: just wanted to give a fun example of a little detail- in the beginning of the first movie, Marty met doc at *Twin* pines mall, and when he goes back to 1955 on Mr. Peabody\u2019s pine farm, he drives away and hits one of the pine trees. When Marty returns to 1985, the mall is then called *Lone* pine mall. Some people might have caught that, some others may have not.",
