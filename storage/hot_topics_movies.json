But until he did Philadelphia 1993 he became a dramatic actor and even he did Forrest Gump afterwards he had a great transition.\n\nBut which other actors who started out comedy then became a dramatic actor just like Tom Hanks did the jump from a goofy actor to serious actor well any suggestions about this?",

Familial failure is held together only by their need to help a little girl. Not to help her win, but to simply participate in her dream. A twisted dream defined by poor American standards. But despite the family's failures, they are brought together by what really mattered the whole time: their love for one another and a common goal. \n\n  \nIt's also a great look at early Carell and Dano. \n\n  \nDoes anyone else miss those feelgood vibes that we were getting in the early 2000s from indie movies before streaming was huge?",

Not necessarily the best scene ever, or from your favorite movie, but just a single, specific moment that pops up in your head out of nowhere, even years after you've seen it.\n\nWhat's that one scene for you? What movie is it from, and what's so unforgettable about it? Was it something shocking, something beautiful, something weird, or just a really powerful moment?\n\nFor me, it's definitely a few moments from Annihilation. But one that really messed with me was when they get deeper into the Shimmer and you start seeing how the mutations are blending everything together. Like those flowers that had human-like features, or even the way the crew members started to get mixed up with the environment and each other. That whole visual of nature and people merging in this bizarre, unnatural way was so creepy and unsettling. It really made you think about what was happening in that zone. That whole idea of things losing their boundaries and becoming something else\u2026 yeah, that sticks with you. Coming from a person with plant biology background may be a reason. \n\nWhat's that one scene for you? Share the movie and what made that specific moment so unforgettable. Let's hear those scenes that are just stuck to your memory!",

It is everything a 90s movie wanted to be and if you've never seen it do yourself a favor and check it out.",

        "content": "I\u2019m watching the Crown and its depiction of the Apollo 11 mission, including the interview with the crew. It got me thinking about how many times I\u2019ve seen this event portrayed in different movies and series, across time and genres, due to the historical significance and it\u2019s impact on individual stories, themes and characters. What other historical moments are often portrayed like this and why do you think that is? What\u2019s your personal favorite? \n\nI think a safe bet for a general category of moments might be World War 2, there are so many moments that resonates deeply with audiences and are interesting to portray in media from different perspectives. What else? ",

        "content": "When doing work, I often like to play movies in the background. This means that I often listen to and not watch the movies. What are some movies that are great to listen to without any visuals? This can include movies which are focused on dialogue, but can also include movies with great scores and sound design (e.g. Lynch has great sounds in his movies).",
