I\u2019m Kyle Buchanan and I serve as [The Projectionist](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-projectionist), the awards season columnist for The New York Times.\u00a0\n\nI cover the movie industry and pop culture for the Times, reporting from film festivals like Cannes and Venice and writing profiles of major movie stars including [Daniel Craig](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/movies/daniel-craig-queer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.U8jx.7d-4ger4UXMk&amp;smid=re-nytimes), [Jennifer Lawrence](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/movies/jennifer-lawrence-causeway.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.tKWd.S0GSQcqLjW1Y&amp;smid=re-nytimes), [Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/movies/wicked-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.PElh.CByDLRMS-eBU&amp;smid=re-nytimes).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI also wrote the best-selling book \u201cBlood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road,\u201d and would like to note that even though George Miller\u2019s action masterpiece placed at #11 on our list, I personally think it should have been even higher.\u00a0\n\n**From Leah:**\u00a0\n\nHi there, I\u2019m Leah Greenblatt!\u00a0\n\nI write primarily about movies and books for The Times, covering everything from[ the return of the raunchy sex comedy](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/movies/sex-comedies-no-hard-feelings-joy-ride.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.Wosq.1BhmODMjJ9H-&amp;smid=re-nytimes) to classic celebrity profiles (like [Michael Keaton reprising his role in \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d last year](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/movies/michael-keaton-beetlejuice-beetlejuice.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.3G3w.ZduBBinIb5db&amp;smid=re-nytimes).) More recently, I dug into [how they pulled off that wild plane stunt in the latest \u201cMission Impossible\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/movies/mission-impossible-plane-scene.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.HoD9.hGqHh0VOvemP&amp;smid=re-nytimes) and why we can\u2019t seem to get enough of [stories about cult](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/books/review/25-books-review-instability-of-truth-blazing-eye-sees-all-rebecca-lemov-leah-sottile.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.gtlg.DA9s4WuUOMZC&amp;smid=re-nytimes)s (And also, [Joni Mitchell](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/books/review/joni-mitchell-henry-alford-paul-lisicky-i-dream-of-joni-song-so-wild-and-blue.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.M-XZ.kvMQD7i1kRYM&amp;smid=re-nytimes)).\n\nThis is my second time working on a major NYT culture list: I helped put together the [100 best books of the 21st century](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.uK6T.Ul-9LJm0ROFE&amp;smid=re-nytimes), which some of our readers are still debating more than a year later. I love the conversations that these lists lead to, and what they can tell us about ourselves.\n\nAll of these links are available for free, even without an NYT subscription.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll answer questions from 3-4:30 p.m. ET. \n\nAsk us anything about how the list came to be.\n\n",

        "content": "For me, it was between the DeLorean used in the first Back To The Future movie, specifically the exact one used for the first time travel journey when Marty escapes from the Libyans and goes to 1955, the exact rockhammer used to dig, tunnel and break out of Shawshank Redemption prison or the deneuralyser from the first Men in Black film. \n\nI eventually settled on the DeLorean because it's a DeLorean, arguably the most famous time machine and easily recognisable for the film as opposed to the actual car itself, it is also from one of my all time favourite movies, a great conversation piece and if I wanted to, I could host/sell viewings of it.\n\nWhat would you choose?",

My girlfriend yesterday recommended this and this is one of the best movies I have seen. \n\nSurely, I will go back watching to get a full breakdown and understanding even more but its amazing. \n\nFirstly, I like how the movie uses the Swan as the way dividing the movie segments. Nina starts as the white swan but eventually rebells into the black swan.\n\nLily being a representation of what she wants to be, which is why I think we see her faceswapped.\n\nVery good idk.",

        "content": "The other day I was thinking about the teaser trailer for the 1992 film Toys. (Here for context: https://youtu.be/jFNdcCqYgBg?si=38f-2BM6uROQ5QHD) There\u2019s no footage from the film, it\u2019s weirdly liminal and unsettling, and it\u2019s just a minute and a half of Robin Williams riffing. It\u2019s better than the movie itself.\n\nTeaser trailers are a lost art form. They don\u2019t exist to showcase the plot, but to intrigue people into finding out more, or to get them thinking about the movie long term. The teaser trailer eventually died, mostly because with the internet, you can announce when a movie is coming much easier than putting together a minute of unrelated footage, but it lives on in my heart.\n\nThat got me thinking, what are other people\u2019s favorite teaser trailers? What trailers got people excited for a movie without revealing too much information about the movie itself?",

I Love You is one of those rare ones where the movie actually matches the emotion of the book, maybe even makes it hit harder in some ways.\n\nI read the book ages ago and loved how deeply it went into Holly\u2019s grief, but watching the movie again recently made me realize how beautifully they brought all that pain, awkwardness, and slow healing to life on screen. Hilary Swank is so good in it like you feel everything she\u2019s going through, even in the quiet moments. And Gerard Butler... the way they handled the letters? Literal heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect adaptation  they changed some things but the feeling is the same. It still makes me cry, but not in a depressing way... more like that weird comforting kind of cry, you know?\n\nCurious if anyone else feels like this too. And are there other book-to-movie adaptations that you think actually did justice to the source material? I\u2019m always looking for more like this.\n",
