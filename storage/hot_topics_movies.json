In particular, there's the scene in \"Eclipse\" where Nikki Reed's Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her fianc\u00e9e and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her fianc\u00e9e for last. Frankly, a vampire mix of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" and \"Kill Bill\" sounds a lot more interesting to watch than anything around Bella, Edward or Jacob.\n\nYour example?",

        "content": "First off, what an incredibly beautiful and stylish film. The cinematography, heavy saturation and overuse (in a good way) of split diopter shots really pull you into this one. \n\nThe script uses one of my favorite writing techniques, which is to show you glimpses of the wider story &gt;!like the opposing politicians who ordered the expose on McRyan, Burke's meetings with them (the very concept of a meeting with a pro-assassin is hilarious), Jack's backstory with the cops, how the death is impacting the presidential race, Manny &amp; Sally's schemes and so on!&lt;, but never letting you get distracted from the fact that *this* is the main storyline. It makes the world of the movie feel so real.\n\nAlso, and I said this in the past about Serpico (1973), I love how grimy and \"un-movie-like\" the setting is. Manny's apartment, the train station, the streets, everything is very much as-is. \n\nJohn Lithgow with a performance for the ages, probably my new favorite movie sociopath. He's far from the cartoony portrayals you normally see, with the silly \"dropping the smile when the victim isn't looking\", he is just always *on*. \n\nAs soon as the movie ended, all I could think of was that I will definitely watch it again.",

        "title": "What's a movie you think is incredible, but wouldn't recommend to anyone?",
        "content": "Some movies affect you so deeply that you can\u2019t deny how powerful they are, even if you know they\u2019re not for everyone. Maybe they\u2019re emotionally draining, uncomfortably dark, painfully slow, or so abstract and experimental that most people wouldn\u2019t connect with them. These are the kinds of films that stay with you for days\u2014sometimes even weeks\u2014but you wouldn\u2019t call watching them an easy experience.  \n  \nFor me, one of those movies is Synecdoche, New York. Charlie Kaufman created something that\u2019s so layered and thought-provoking, exploring life, death, creativity, and regret in a way that feels almost overwhelming. Every time I watch it, I notice something new, but I can\u2019t recommend it casually. It\u2019s heavy and deeply existential, the kind of film that leaves you emotionally drained. Honestly, I think most people wouldn\u2019t want to feel that way after a movie, and I can\u2019t blame them.   \n  \nAnother one for me is Come and See. It\u2019s one of the most intense war films I\u2019ve ever seen, showing the horrors of war through the eyes of a child. It\u2019s incredibly well-made and devastating, but it\u2019s also one of the hardest viewing experiences I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s so raw and haunting that I feel hesitant to suggest it to anyone, even though I think it\u2019s important.   \n  \nWhat about you? Do you have a movie that you respect or admire but don\u2019t easily recommend? Maybe it\u2019s too dark, too slow, or just too much for most people. I\u2019d love to hear what comes to mind and why it left such an impression on you.",

The way the lighting switches from illuminating the Germans face to the face of Brody as he plays Chopin perfectly, and the face of the German realizing how he has been part of a force that has possibly taken away talent such as this. You see him realize the horror of the Nazi regime as the song plays. I just came here to say that I always loved that scene but the recent rewatch cements that as an all timer for me.",

My entire family quotes it all the time, and I have yet to ever meet a single person outside of my parents and sister who have ever even heard of it. ",

All the other melee scenes are pretty brutal too despite the quality of the movie overall. \n\nAny recommendations for more movies with brutal combat like this?\n\nThanks!",

She had this spunk and comedic timing. I would have liked to have seen her develop outside of her usual quirky characters and if she tried dramas. But, it looks like she'd rather stick with fashion. Just hopefully her mental health is a priority to her because she still doesn't look so good right now. ",

Some of it's harmless or predictable enough (such-and-such is coming back for a sequel, a certain film is being remade for the 18th time, etc.). But sometimes...there are announcements from the moment you read them, you're like, \"Yeah, ok...I'll believe it when I see it\". Has anybody else experienced this and if so, what are your favorite examples? Some of mine are...\n\n  \n\\*To be clear, I'm not taking about fake news. I'm talking about real announcements that either didn't make sense logically or just sounded like pipe dreams\\* \n\n*  Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War will open on the same day \n* Quentin Tarantino is making a Star Trek film\n* The next Friday the 13th film will be produced by LeBron James\n* A 21 Jump Street x Men in Black film is in the works \n\nAnd I'm just gonna call my shot with this one...I don't think that Luca Guadagino/Daniel Craig Sgt. Rock movie is gonna happen. I'll be genuinely shocked if it does. ",

        "content": "For starters Sicario is entertaining. Maybe it's not \"important\" in the way other movies are, but it has great pacing, tension, action.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is obviously an all time great director and does a fantastic job. The performances from Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are complex and believable. Whether or not you are a boomer who enjoys the Yellowstone Extended Universe, Taylor Sheridan is a talented writer and it's a great script.\n\nThen on top of that J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (RIP) delivers one of his best scores. Amazing cinematography from Roger Deakins who may be the greatest cinematographer of all time. Even Joe Walker's editing is noticeably good.\n\nI'm sure people in the comments will trot out all the classics and say various movies are more innovative, or influential, or important and yes that's true. I'm not saying Sicario is \"better\" than The Godfather Part II. But in terms of just being successful in every aspect of filmmaking, Sicario is really an impressive movie with no real weaknesses.",
