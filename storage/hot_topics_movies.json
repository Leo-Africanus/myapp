One of those things where you cannot believe your own eyes from start to finish (there was one character who had a chainsaw coming out of her butt, which she effectively used in battle!!).\n\nWhat about all of you? What is the craziest, freakiest, most insane, most bizarre movie you have ever watched?!",

        "content": "Recently saw this movie and I was shocked to the extent that I didn\u2019t recognise Matt Damon in this movie.\n\nI mean, of course I knew it was Matt Damon. But usually Matt Damon is one of those actors who doesn\u2019t entirely disappear into his roles. He is a great actor, but I\u2019m always like \u201coh yeah that\u2019s Matt Damon - that\u2019s his charm, his cadence, his vibe\u201d. It is rare that I ever not think of him as Matt Damon in a movie.\n\nBut in this movie, it was the first time I was utterly shaken by a character he played and fully understood him as a separate entity from the usual Matt we see in movies. The way he mixes an insecure, queer vulnerability with almost desperate, yet ice cold cunning and violence - I\u2019ve never seen him like this. It is truly a performance that stands out from his other roles. And it was probably the only time I both reviled and feared him in a movie. Just great all around.",

        "content": "I'm going through a rough patch right now, and movies are the only thing that help me turn my brain off for a bit. But I don't just want something sad - I want those films that destroy you emotionally. The kind that make you cry not just for minutes, but hours or even days. The ones that sit in your chest long after they're over, that you can't get rid of no matter how much time passes.\n\nDon't worry about language or genre or release year - I don't care about any of that. I just want to feel something real again. What movie did that to you? \n\nHelp a friend who's in need - recommend me the films that broke you.\ud83d\ude42",
