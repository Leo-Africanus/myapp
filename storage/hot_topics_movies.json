There\u2019s early critique, Ellie\u2019s speech, Malcolm\u2019s warning, but by the end, he\u2019s grieving a lost dream, not facing consequences.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needed to be the villain. But it\u2019s fascinating how the story wraps systemic failure in nostalgia, and leaves us mourning *with* him.\n\nIs that emotional sleight of hand? Or just good character work?\n\nCurious what others think.",

        "title": "\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" gets a bad rep but it's the one movie in the series which offers you the biggest thrills while also being a big fun adventure and a Horror movie at the same time (PG-13 founder?)",
        "content": "We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. \n\nBut as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. \n\nOh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (\"I'm a Vegetarian!!!\").\n\nAnd I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. \n\nPeople bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. \n\nHarrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once.",

        "title": "\"The Cat in the Hat\" (2003) is surrealist genius.",
        "content": "Okay, hear me out. *The Cat in the Hat* (2003) is not just a chaotic fever dream from our childhoods. It\u2019s actually a brilliant piece of surrealist comedy and deserves way more credit than it gets.\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s talk about Mike Myers' performance. It\u2019s absolutely unhinged in the best way. He takes the Cat beyond the page and turns him into a manic trickster god, bouncing between vaudeville humor, adult satire, and slapstick. He *knows* how ridiculous the whole thing is, and he leans into it hard. That self-awareness is what gives the film its edge.\n\nNext, the set design and cinematography are insane in a good way. The film looks like a Dr. Seuss book exploded on a soundstage. The colors are bold, the architecture is twisted, and everything is slightly off-kilter. It creates this dreamlike, almost dystopian suburbia that mirrors the chaotic energy of the Cat himself. It\u2019s visually unique in a way most kids\u2019 films wouldn\u2019t dare to be.\n\nAnd yeah, it\u2019s full of jokes that definitely weren't meant for kids, but that\u2019s what makes it timeless. As a kid, it was all goofy fun. As an adult, it\u2019s loaded with wild one-liners and surreal humor that feels closer to Adult Swim than Nick Jr.\n\nIs it a faithful Dr. Seuss adaptation? No. But maybe it\u2019s not supposed to be. Maybe it\u2019s a cult film hiding in plain sight. A chaotic satire of consumerism, suburbia, and childhood boredom wrapped in a furry costume and a red-striped hat.\n\nRewatch it with fresh eyes. You might just realize it's genius in disguise.\n\nAnyone else secretly love this movie?",

        "title": "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever felt this disturbed by a film before (Hereditary)",
        "content": "So I\u2019ve seen my fair share of horror films but I just watched Hereditary for the first time and it might be the first one that genuinely\u00a0*got*\u00a0to me. I felt weirdly shaken by it - not scared, but unsettled on some deeper level. Some scenes were so horrific I didn\u2019t even realise I was squeezing/clenching my hands until they ended. And I even unexpectedly started crying in the final 10 minutes, not out of sadness but more like something closer to dread. I literally felt off afterwards and didn\u2019t want to go to sleep for a while.\u00a0\n\nAt first I rated it 4.5 stars because it was good but I never really wanted to think about it again - but then I\u00a0*did*\u00a0start thinking about it again. And things started clicking.\n\n**Spoilers below:**\n\nAt first, the history of Annie\u2019s family just seemed like a dark family backstory: her father starved himself, her brother took his own life, and both were labelled schizophrenic. I initially assumed this was just background context, sad but not exactly plot-relevant, but by the end of the film I realised they weren\u2019t just tragic footnotes - they were likely\u00a0*failed vessels*\u00a0for Paimon. Annie\u2019s mother, Ellen, wasn\u2019t simply difficult or estranged - she was a long-time cult member, hell-bent on summoning a demon. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that she tried (and failed) to use her husband and son first. Her husband deliberately starving himself becomes more than just an act of despair or mental illness when you consider that Paimon prefers \u2018healthy male hosts\u2019. Similarly, her son hanging himself in her room after claiming\u00a0*\u201cShe was trying to put people inside me\u201d*\u00a0 wasn\u2019t simply a mental breakdown. It was an act of resistance.\u00a0\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, she turned her attention to the next generation - hence her sudden reappearance in Annie\u2019s life and insistence that she give birth to Peter,\u00a0*the next male in the bloodline*. But Annie\u2019s refusal to let her back in only lasted until the birth of Charlie, at which point she took control and practically raised the child, which heavily implies that Ellen had been planning for Charlie to be Paimon\u2019s host - expecting a male - but when Charlie was born a girl, she went ahead anyway. This led to what was probably her first semi-successful attempt, and explains so much about Charlie\u2019s eerie behaviour (her unsettling nature, the clicking sounds, how she was rather odd for a young girl), because Charlie was never really Charlie - she was always just a vessel for Paimon, waiting. But Paimon\u00a0*prefers male bodies*\u00a0(as Joan says), so Charlie\u2019s form was never meant to last. Her death was never just random or for shock value, it was a ritual -\u00a0*\u201cWe have corrected your first female body.\u201d*\n\nCue Peter.\u00a0\n\nThe entire film builds toward his possession with an unbearable, creeping sense of inevitability. What first seems like a chaotic sequence of family tragedies slowly reveals itself to be something far worse: an orchestrated series of events designed solely to break him down emotionally and spiritually and bring him to his most vulnerable state, ready for Paimon to take control. Every family member\u2019s fate - from Charlie\u2019s decapitation to Annie\u2019s unraveling to Steve\u2019s sudden death - was part of a dark lineage passed down like an evil heirloom.\n\n\u200b\u200bThat\u2019s what makes Hereditary so disturbing. It doesn\u2019t rely on senseless gore or cheap jump scares to get under your skin. Instead its horror is slow, psychological, and brutally personal. It\u2019s about the things you can\u2019t outrun - not just demons or possession, but lineage, inevitability, and being born into something you can't escape. Every character\u2019s doom feels prewritten, every scene purposeful. That\u2019s what hit me so hard: the sense that these people were\u00a0*never*\u00a0free. That they were cursed not by any true fault of their own, but by blood.\n\nBy the end, it all comes together. The final treehouse coronation scene makes everything else fall into place: the decapitations of \\*just\\* the female worshipers that were used as vessels then discarded, the cult\u2019s twisted fixation on Peter, the inescapable curse of inherited fate, and the way every family member's tragedy served the same dark purpose.\n\nTo sum up, Hereditary was horrifyingly brilliant in a way few horror films are. I may not have loved watching Hereditary, but I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since. And that, to me, is the mark of something truly unforgettable. Final rating: 5 stars.\n\nAlso as for why Ellen was so dead set on using her own family as pawns in her evil plot, I\u2019m not entirely sure. Perhaps it was because their bloodline already had some sort of unholy tie to the supernatural. Or perhaps she simply just wanted the honour of knowing it was her own flesh and blood that was responsible for hosting the demon she worshipped. Either way\u2026 wtf. (I cannot wait to rewatch this at some point in the future and notice all the extra little details I may have missed the first time round!)\n\n**Edit: Wow, I genuinely didn\u2019t expect so many people to engage so thoughtfully with my writeup - 160+ comments and counting!**\n\n**I watched Hereditary for the first time last night and wasn\u2019t even planning to unpack it, but it haunted me so deeply I couldn\u2019t stop thinking - and writing - about it. Hearing that it helped things 'click' for some of you or gave a new emotional angle to revisit the film with has genuinely meant a lot. Whether you loved it, hated it, or were left somewhere in between, hearing all your perspectives has added so many new layers to how I understand the film.**\n\n**Huge thanks to everyone who's taken the time to read, respond, share their thoughts, interpretations, and even personal reflections - it\u2019s made the whole experience feel way more interesting and alive! I\u2019ll keep responding to as many comments as I can because I\u2019m really enjoying the conversation - but just wanted to pause and say a quick thank you here too :))**",

        "content": "Apologies if this has been talked about to death, but my god this movie is amazing and no one knows what I am talking about.\n\nI was grinning like an idiot the entire film, it's 4 stories loosely intertwined into one plot, kinda like 4 Rooms. It had a super small release, a friend randomly invited me and I had never heard of it or seen a trailer. We had to see it in our town's little boutique theater, but it just came out on streaming. The film is a love letter to Oakland, CA, specifically in 1987. You do not need to care about Oakland or 1987 to love this movie. It's so goddamn good.\n\nAnyways, pleaaase, do yourself a favor and see this film. It has Pedro Pascal (why get him and then do no advertising??) and I audibly groaned when he came onscreen, just because he is in everything. I take a shower and expect him to be in my bathroom holding a towel for me. However, he plays a great character, brings a load of gravitas and isn't a massive part of the film. He nails the role but he isn't the star.\n\nThis movie has it all: humor, tragedy, basketball, SICK rap battles, romance, action, scares, sword fights, psychic powers, skinheads brawling, racists getting their comeuppance, all set to an amazing 80s soundtrack. 2 Short (famous Oakland rapper for you youngsters) is played by an actor and then 2 short is also in the movie playing a character. It doesnt get more 80s than that.  \n  \nI realize the description I just gave sounds like I had a stroke but you have to see it. It's seriously fantastic. I clapped at the end of the movie. I CLAPPED, like a drunken child. I am not a movie clapper. Ever. OK, maybe when Cap picked up Mjolnir. But I was so happy, I didn't know how else to express how much fun I had just had. The small audience was all laughing and gasping and going bananas. It is without a doubt the most fun I've had in theaters in years, and I go to the movies about 3-5 times a month. \n\nWhen the movie got out, I immediately called every friend I have and recommended it, I didn't even wait to get to my car. I literally made about 7 calls in 15 minutes. \n\nAnyways, that's all. Aint trying to overhype it, but it reminded me of the films of the 80s and 90s where weird, experimental gems just landed in your lap, instead of the churning, \"film by committee\" bullshit state that Hollywood is in right now. Do yourself a favor and check it out, if this doesn't become a cult classic, I will be really surprised.\n\n",
