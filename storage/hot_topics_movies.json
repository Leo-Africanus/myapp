Dune Part 2  - No doubt the greatest movie of the year and a perfect balance between  spectacle and detailed world building .\n\n\n2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.\n\n\n\n3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )\n\n\n\n4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .\n\n\n\n5. Smile 2      - A fresh engaging horror flick which lives up to the hype.\n",

Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.\n\nA Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).\n\nThe Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.\n\nHonorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.\n\nWhat others?",

        "content": "Are there any good Italian thrillers from that era (1970s-80s) that are actually filmed and set in Italy, i.e not pretending to be set in America with mixed English and overdubbed italian cast? I know there are some good Italian movies made in the last 2 or so decades but I'm particularly interested in that specific era. Is there anything close to say, Manhunter, but more, you know, Italian?\n\nIf you got some recommendations, please do not hesitate to post them here.",

Any earlier? Any one know the first? \n\nSide quest - do you think it\u2019s based on any fact?",

I've recently watched Django Unchained again and he was really briliant in it.\n\nHe was obviously also great in The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road, etc but those are his stand-out performances in my personal opinion\n\nedit: not sure why some people want to argue with me and are downvoting this? I can still think he deserved Oscar wins for his other roles, especially because him not winning an Oscar for so long became a meme for the longest, his smirk when he finally won for The Revenant at the Oscars said everything.

        "content": "What are some unique and lesser known animated films for family and kids? Stuff similar to Studio Ghibli movies or the examples I've listed below. Looking for good stories, unique presentation, distinct visual style, etc. Characters should not have heavy attitudes or behavioral problems. Lesser known animated films.\n\nBad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.\n\nGood Examples:\n\nAll of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).\n\nLong Way North\n\nApril and the Extraordinary World\n\nSirocco and the Kingdom of Winds\n\nKensuke's Kingdom\n\nBig Fish and Begonia\n\nWolfwalkers\n\nThe Secret of Kells\n\nSong of the Sea\n\nMy Father's Dragon\n\nThe Magician's Elephant\n\nEleanor's Secret\n\nSea Beast\n\n\nThese classic animated films:\n\nTreasure Planet\n\nAtlantis\n\nRoad to El Dorado\n\nTitan A.E.\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\nPrince of Egypt\n\nFilms like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.\n\n\nAny recommendations similar to those above?\n",
