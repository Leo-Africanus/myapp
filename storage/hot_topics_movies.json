Jeff Fowler, who directed all three of these movies, is a quicker and wittier flimflam magician of energy than he was when he made the first \u201cSonic\u201d in 2020.\n\n[io9.com](https://gizmodo.com/sonic-3-movie-review-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-paramount-sega-2000540156):\n\n\n&gt;Full of electric spectacle and action-packed adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 completes the best video game movie trilogy yet.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review/) (8/10):\n\n&gt;The weaker elements of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 feel unimportant in the wake of an entertaining time that will no doubt thrill audiences of all ages.\n\n[Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review) (4/5)\n\n&gt;Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow. Between this year's games and film, Sonic's shining bright with Shadow in tow.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (8/10):\n\n\n&gt;Clever jokes, a noticeable reverence for the source material, and some fantastic antagonists make the Blue Blur's latest race an entertaining ride from start to finish.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1741398/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (7.5/10):\n\n&gt;The outcome is a \"Sonic\" movie that feels like everything fans love about the games distilled into a film that's fast, flashy, a hell of a lot of fun, and boasts an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\n[The Irish Times] (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2024/12/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-a-hunk-of-good-honest-rubbish-for-the-festive-season/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Carrey\u2019s antic madness \u2013 elsewhere often too much to digest \u2013 is just what the Sonic films needed to balance out the digital gloss.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Should Carrey, who has consistently hinted at retirement plans, decide not to return for Sonic 4, this will certainly be a fine trilogy capper.\n\n[Screen Daily] (https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review/5200227.article):\n\n&gt;Whether it\u2019s Jim Carrey playing not one but two supervillains, or the introduction of even more supporting characters, Sonic 3 wears out its welcome, resulting in an entertaining but exhausting affair.\n\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba) (6/10):\n\n&gt;Against all odds, the Sonic the Hedgehog movies appear to be getting better as they go.\n\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/18/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-supplies-laughs-and-energy-for-hedgehog-threequel) (3/5):\n\n&gt;While no one could deny the cash-grab fan-service underpinning to the entire project \u2026 well, it\u2019s actually a not unenjoyable experience, even if you are someone on whom the intricacies of early-00s game narrative are lost.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The MVP of the first two films, Carrey dials down the physical comedy in both his roles, amping up punning (\u201cDorkupine!\u201d) to hit-and-miss effect. For all the actor\u2019s gurning and the film\u2019s visual busyness, few images pop or lodge in the memory.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-1235078147/) (D):\n\n&gt;It might be enough to entertain young children or diehard SEGA loyalists, but the rest of us are left to lament that the running time isn\u2019t as fast as its blue protagonist.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before. With their abilities outmatched in every way, Team Sonic must seek out an unlikely alliance in hopes of stopping Shadow and protecting the planet.\n\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog\n* Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Miles \"Tails\" Prower\n* Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna\n* Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog\n\n**Live-action cast**\n\n* Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik\n* James Marsden as Tom Wachowski\n* Tika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski\n* Krysten Ritter as Director Rockwell\n* Natasha Rothwell as Rachel\n* Shemar Moore as Randall Handel\n* Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone\n* Tom Butler as Commander Walters\n* Adam Pally as Wade Whipple\n* Alyla Browne as Maria Robotnik\n\nDirected by: Jeff Fowler\n\nScreenplay by: Pat Casey, Josh Miller, John Whittington\n\nStory by: Pat Casey and Josh Miller\n\nProduced by: Neal H.

Going in without knowing anything about the story, I thought this film was going to be a Sly action film going wild on bad guys (which is also a fun time) but when it started progressing, I was surprised when he is actually getting into a long spanning fight with the police. \n\nI loved how this film was more reflective and character work is done so smoothly through dialogues and flashbacks. A soldier isolated and ostracized by society riddled with PTSD getting pushed around with no limits. I am not saying he is not at fault too but the first blood was not shed by him. A troubled man getting troubled further. \n\nThat monologue at the end of the film was just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking. It also puts into perspective the mental anguish of the character in broad strokes. Overall, First Blood is a triumphant film in all the right ways\n",

I watched it today and it was an absolute treat. Not only is it original in its storytelling, it's also extremely detailed in the world it presents. It's gritty and uncompromising with a clear vision. This is a serious fantasy film about a bloodthirsty crusader who takes an oath of non-violence. I don't want to go into any spoilers, so I won't. If you have seen it, would did you think? If you haven't seen it, then check it out.\n",

        "content": "Recently saw Red One with my kid. I saw the trailer and thought I might like it. Asked my son if he would like to see it. We saw it together and below is how each of us felt about the movie\n\nMy Opinion: I went into Red One with some anticipation having liked the trailer, but I have to say the movie just didn\u2019t work for me. The plot felt all over the place, lacking coherence and purpose. It meandered from one set piece to another, leaving me questioning what it was trying to accomplish. There were moments where it seemed like it might find its footing, but those moments were fleeting.I lost interest in the movie so many times that I started checking my phone out of boredom. My son, however, wasn\u2019t having any of that - he insisted I put the phone down and watch it with him. Reluctantly, I complied, but the movie still failed to win me over. Overall, it felt like the film was trying to do too much without actually doing anything well.\n\nMy Son's Opinion: My son absolutely loved it. For him, the movie was a non-stop adventure packed with action, humor, and cool moments that didn\u2019t need to make perfect sense to be fun. He loved the imaginative elements and larger-than-life characters, and he found the chaos exciting rather than frustrating. To him, it was a perfect blend of humor and spectacle that kept him entertained throughout.\n\nThe one thing we did agree on was our favorite character in the movie\u2014the talking polar bear.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zim952wor7e1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae96b523fd4be323c9a64cc77e959635de3f94a3\n\n",
