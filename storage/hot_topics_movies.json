The physical acting and the voice work feels so much less expressive and animated (as in lively). In the same vein, I remember watching a scene from the Lion King remake and thinking Timon and Pumbaa were just so boring. Where was all of their signature flare? Especially Timon. In the cartoon that Meerkat just oozed charisma, and in the remake he felt super flat.\n\nCalling these performances phoned-in feels harsh, but I honestly don't know what else to call them. These entire movies feel phoned-in, and the worst part is that I know a lot of people worked really hard on them.\n\nI know a lot of these have writing and story differences (*ahem* Lilo and Stitch), but even with a shot-for-shot adaptation like HTTYD, it feels like the same movie, but worse.\n\nSomeone explain this to me.",

I define \"foreign\" movie to be any movie that is not made in English AND either has a predominantly non-American cast or predominantly non-American storyline. I guess British or Canadian movies aren't quite \"foreign\" enough in that sense \ud83d\ude03.\n\nI'm Asian but I have been living in the West for the last 18 years, including about 10 years in the US. As a lifelong fan of Hollywood and foreign movies, I'm trying to understand what made some foreign movies resonate with American audience. So far, I have the following in my list:\n\n1. Parasite (Korea)\n2. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (China/Taiwan)\n3. Am\u00e9lie (France)\n4. Life is Beautiful (Italy)\n5. City of God (Brazil)\n6. Lola Rennt / Run Lola Run (Germany)\n7. Slumdog Millionnaire (India)\n8. All About My Mother (Spain)\n9. Cinema Paradiso (Italy)\n10. Train to Busan (Korea)\n11. Pan's Labyrinth (Spain)\n12. La Dolce Vita (Italy)\n13. Godzilla (Japan)\n14.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been working on a project called **StoryTerra**, an interactive map where you can explore thousands of movies, books, games, and TV shows based on where and when their stories take place.\n\nThis project brings together over **120,000 titles**, including books, films, TV shows, and games, which I annotated them with their narrative time periods and real-world locations or the closest location to their fictional setting. You can explore the world by clicking on cities, regions, or countries, and use a time slider that lets you browse centuries, decades, or individual years.\n\nWould love to have some feedback, it\u2019s still a work in progress and I\u2019m always looking to improve it!",

I've just never happened to catch the film aired on TV and it never seems to be available to stream however my brother owns all the blu-rays so he's lent them to me. \n\nAt 11 years old when it came out, \"Freddy Vs Jason\" is one of my favourite horrors ever and I've seen all the \"Nightmare on Elm St\" movies a dozen times but I've just never caught any of the original Friday films until now. It's not that I've never wanted to, I just didn't have the chance.",

        "content": "Just watched Charade (1963) and I honestly don\u2019t get how this isn\u2019t talked about more. It\u2019s Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn being effortlessly charming in Paris, with a twisty mystery plot that somehow blends romance, suspense, and comedy without feeling forced.\n\n Hepburn is attempting to find her dead husbands lost money amongst spies and thieves. It\u2019s stylish as hell, funny, weirdly dark in places, and has some great character actors like Walter Matthau and James Coburn all pulling their weight.\n\n It's snappy, modern, and it's even in color! \n\nI\u2019m on here all the time and barely ever see it brought up, even on the classic film subs. Like how is Charade not in regular rotation for people who love Hitchcock-style thrillers or old Hollywood stuff? Is anyone else a fan? \n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/C6T2Q4XO7uA?si=WgRhVNO-KfNWH8bO\n\nHere is the full movie: https://youtu.be/-uc86VH8hdA?si=sSuJTK1EBjYUMKiz",

A movie so convincing you feel like you could meet the characters in real life. \n\nI know a lot of WW2 vets said Saving Private Ryan was really realistic, but I can\u2019t say. \n\nLost in Translation I think is another movie where I feel like I easily could have been in that movie as myself, having lived in Japan as a foreigner.\n\nI really love documentaries for this reason, because the subject matter is the real world. \n",

Like its predecessor, it's delightfully silly, but now we're in an era where those movies aren't made as often... and when someone tries, it's a 50/50 chance they land it. *Happy Gilmore 2* is a solid return to the kind of film that, honestly, there should be more of. Some jokes run too long, don\u2019t land, or could use another draft. It's a constant stream of cameos, which is overall fun but sometimes a little distracting. But, at its core, the sequel is a good-natured charmer about a troubled everyman who is trying hard to grow up without losing himself in the process, and it gives us a lot to laugh about on the way. What more can you ask for?\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/review-adam-sandlers-happy-gilmore-2-may-be-worst-sequel-of-all-time/)\n\n&gt;With all due respect to *Grown Ups 2*, *The Ridiculous 6*, and *Sandy Wexler*, *Happy Gilmore 2* is the bottom of the Sandler barrel\u2014a grim disaster that not only sullies the good name of its ancestor, but so badly flails on its own limited terms that it suggests the A-lister should concentrate on dramatic parts and leave the immature comedy to others.",
