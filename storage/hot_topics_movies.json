        "content": "*Disowned at birth by his wealthy family, Becket Redfellow will stop at nothing to reclaim his inheritance, no matter how many relatives stand in his way.*\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Glen Powell, Margaret Qualley, Jessica Henwick, Topher Grace, Ed Harris, Zach Woods\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [51%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_make_a_killing_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [54 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-make-a-killing/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/how-to-make-a-killing-glen-powell-a24-review/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;How to Make a Killing has the acuity to know that even if you are willing to play such a rigged game in ruthless fashion, you\u2019ll still lose. The film\u2019s magic trick is taking this bleak idea and knowing how to find the fun in such brutal sport.\n\n[Slash Film - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/2104095/how-to-make-a-killing-review/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Powell's Becket recalls similar upwardly mobile antiheroes like Saul Goodman or Michael Corleone, characters who seem to be living a wish fulfillment of righteousness, only to find themselves trapped by the persona they've built up. It's this aspect which Ford addresses most subtly, ultimately making \"How to Make a Killing\" a cleverly scathing indictment of the American dream as it stands. It's also an impressively multi-layered indictment, too, for while it'd be easy (and rather popular) for Ford to point out how the haves and the have-nots aren't all that different from each other if they were able to switch places, the filmmaker instead leans into the complexity and systemic issues surrounding wealth and success. \"How to Make a Killing\" is a movie that sneaks up on you, and like Becket himself, doesn't simply stab you in the chest or punch you in the gut. Instead, it slowly poisons you, leaving you bewildered by the end as to how sick you and the country you live in has become.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/how-to-make-a-killing-review) \\- 'C'\n\n&gt;At the center of it all is Powell, making the same face for an hour and 45 minutes, too unflappable to root for, too smug to magnetize as an inhuman American Psycho. And *How To Make A Killing* needed to pick a side, either of clownish class comedy or of bitter sociopathic satire. Its split-difference approach certainly racks up a sizable body count, but its most battered and bruised victim is the truism it keeps hitting: In America, there are no consequences for the rich, unless other rich people desire it. That\u2019s almost funny, in an empty and respectable way, like how a *New Yorker* cartoon is almost funny, or how Glen Powell is almost a leading man.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/how-to-make-a-killing/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;As someone who absolutely loves any kind of a crime film, \u201cHow To Make A Killing\u201d can be entertaining at times as a morality play wrapped in designer suits and generational spite. It\u2019s juggling a lot more than it needs to, and it never fully synthesizes its most perceptive ideas, but it\u2019s powered by another star performance from Powell, keeping it barely afloat.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Alexander Mooney](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-john-patton-ford/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;The brittle humanity of Ford\u2019s characters is the key ingredient to his film\u2019s grim sense of irony. In a media landscape replete with hot-button satires and airless farces, *How to Make a Killing*\u2019s rejection of formal frippery and easy caricature is refreshing. Ford cultivates an old-school flair while keeping one finger on the pulse of the current moment, shrewdly retooling the canonical story of a rotten family patronage to comment on a quintessential American birthright: the compulsive desire for individual gain.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-margaret-qualley-1236666029/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s likely that 95 percent of the people who go to see \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d will never have seen, or even heard of, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets,\u201d the 1949 British black comedy it\u2019s a remake of \u2014 or, I should say, a reimagining, since for once that marketing-spin term applies. In its day, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d was wickedly outrageous. But in the age of \u201cDexter\u201d and \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cBeef,\u201d \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d just plays as a patchy amusement. Yet I was held by it; the film\u2019s acrid riffs on the hidden depravity of the new greed culture keep it aloft. And each time Margaret Qualley shows up, she gives the movie a charge, because of how her Julia incarnates money hunger cut off from everything else. Qualley somehow makes that fun, maybe because it\u2019s the one thing in the movie that everyone can agree on.",

        "title": "In \u2018Goodfellas\u2019, is Tommy D. actually humiliated during the \u201cI amuse you?\u201d scene?",
        "content": "Is that scene about a wounded ego, or is it a status check? On the surface, it looks like Tommy gets his feelings hurt. For a second he seems honestly confused, like Henry just called him a clown in front of everyone. But Tommy has clear sociopathic tendencies. He enjoys pushing people to the edge and watching them squirm. Add in his Napoleon complex and it makes even more sense. He\u2019s small, volatile, and obsessed with respect. The sudden switch in tone feels less like insecurity and more like a reminder that he decides when people laugh and when they panic.\n\nAs for Henry, the fear makes sense in that moment because they\u2019re in public and the power dynamic is on display. Tommy\u2019s unpredictable, and everyone at that table knows he\u2019s capable of real violence over something minor(Spider\u2019s killing later in the film). When they torch the Bamboo Lounge together, Henry scolds him because the setting is different. They\u2019re alone, partners in crime, not performing for an audience. Henry isn\u2019t fearless. He just understands when Tommy is posturing and when he\u2019s actually unstable. At the table, with witnesses and pride involved, the risk feels real. \n\nInsight into the real-life Tommy from Pileggi\u2019s \u2018Wiseguy\u2019 made me think about this. It also made me think about Scorsese\u2019s genius at work.  Did he layer the scene in a way that every choice Pesci makes is open to interpretation? Is Tommy actually humiliated for a second, or is he entirely in control, and just running that power check on Henry? Scorsese doesn\u2019t force a single answer. Instead, he lets the tension live in the ambiguity. The fear in Henry is real either way, but the audience is never sure if it\u2019s \u2018cause Tommy\u2019s ego is bruised or because he\u2019s testing who\u2019ll break first.",
