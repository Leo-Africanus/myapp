In particular, there's the scene in \"Eclipse\" where Nikki Reed's Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her financee and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her financee for last. Frankly, a vampire mix of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" and \"Kill Bill\" sounds a lot more interesting to watch than anything around Bella, Edward or Jacob.\n\nYour example?",

        "content": "For starters Sicario is entertaining. Maybe it's not \"important\" in the way other movies are, but it has great pacing, tension, action.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is obviously an all time great director and does a fantastic job. The performances from Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are complex and believable. Whether or not you are a boomer who enjoys the Yellowstone Extended Universe, Taylor Sheridan is a talented writer and it's a great script.\n\nThen on top of that J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (RIP) delivers one of his best scores. Amazing cinematography from Roger Deakins who may be the greatest cinematographer of all time. Even Joe Walker's editing is noticeably good.\n\nI'm sure people in the comments will trot out all the classics and say various movies are more innovative, or influential, or important and yes that's true. I'm not saying Sicario is \"better\" than The Godfather Part II. But in terms of just being successful in every aspect of filmmaking, Sicario is really an impressive movie with no real weaknesses.",

He's especially good in a supporting role like The Grey and Cop Shop.  He just seems like a dudes dude.  Who is your Frank Grillo who you love to watch all their movies even though they might be bad and low budget?",

It was the first time I thought about the future of technology and artificial intelligence, and as the years go on the ideas and characters portrayed become more of a near reality than pure science fiction.\n\nIt's also the first time I thought about how insignificant our time is on this planet is (pretty big thoughts for an 11 yo) and how there will be intelligent objects that can and will outlive generations. An idea that often provokes existential thoughts in my adult life. \n\nThe pure magic and emotion of the film has stuck with me and cemented it's place as my favourite Spielberg film. Which Spielberg film has had a significant impact on you making it your favourite that isn't necessarily his 'best' movie?",
