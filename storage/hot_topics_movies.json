        "title": "Did you ever find something in the Extra Features of a DVD that took you completely by surprise?",
        "content": "I was just thinking about the decline of DVDs as a format for home theater. The Extras are something of a lost art by now, as a result. Then I remembered this time I discovered a really out-there deleted scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sgsj5rob5ype1.jpeg\n\n\nWe had this movie on DVD back in the day, and my brothers and I were dicking around with the extras after having finished watching the film itself. I don't know how well any of you remember your mid-aughts Rowan Atkinson movies, but towards the middle Mr. Bean has to hitchhike his way across France to get to the Cannes Film Festival, despite not speaking French. He's picked up by Sabine, the female lead, who assumes he's a Russian director or something. This is where the cut scene takes place. \n\nBasically, it's an extended sequence where, through an escalating series of misunderstandings, Sabine starts to question her career and her life's work, pulls the car over, and lays down on the street, screaming \"je veux mourir (I want to die)\". Now, you might be asking yourself \"isn't this a comedy movie?\", and you would be right. The whole affair is played for laughs. You see, it's the middle of the French countryside, so the highway doesn't have any other cars on it. Sabine is forced to wait until a vehicle in either direction shows up to end her misery. Mr. Bean, who has no clue what's happening, just bumbles around asking \"Cannes?\". Until a truck approaches, and he starts to panic. He unsuccessfully coaxes her to get off the street, and then she grabs onto his shoe, saying something about how they should die together(???). I don't even remember how this sequence ends, but in order for it to fit into the larger film, either they must have rewritten/reshot a bunch of stuff, or the intention was for them to get back in the car and never mention or acknowledge what happened ever again.\n\nHonestly, it's not hard to see why they cut this scene. I feel bad saying that because of all the work they put in, especially the actress, but it's overly long, it doesn't really suit the movie that it's in, it's in poor taste and highly inappropriate, and most damning of all: it just isn't very funny. \n\nStill, it's a wild and unexpected ride that I never would have experienced if I had just seen Mr. Bean's Holiday on some kind of streaming service. What was the most off-guard a DVD extra has ever caught you?\n\nEDIT: I found the scene on Youtube. If you're wondering how it ends, the scene just cuts right as the truck seemingly drives over Sabine. Guess we can consider it an alternate ending? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WrxyOZYizd8?si=mOWoV_SPkkrFo7zE&amp;t=467",

His dad (\"JASON JASON JASON\") is a bitter old man who lost his dojo after Van Damme kicked his butt so he is constantly telling his kid to stop training.",

        "content": "I've felt Michelle Rodriguez has been trying to be Vasquez in every movie she's in but nobody has ever been as cool and bad ass as Vasquez. \n\nI re-watched Aliens not that long ago and it's impressive how big a part Vasquez has in the movie. She's confident, strong, such a stealth personality that being a woman isn't a problem, the guys respect her and play around with her as she is able to show she's better than any guy around. And she never shows fear or vulnerability, she's always shooting them guns and taking the risks. To the end, she's a hero. I love that character, probably more so than Ripley whom Vasquez teasingly calls Snow White.",
