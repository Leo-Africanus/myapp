Thompson. \n\n\"The film follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio del Toro) as they embark on a drug-fueled road trip to Las Vegas. The story explores themes of the American Dream, the failure of the 1960s counterculture, and the chaotic nature of their drug-induced experiences.\"",

It always feels like someone is watching you or following you. \n\nIt\u2019s a film set in NYC but it\u2019s an Italian production. I love when foreign films are set in the states. They\u2019re always so bizarre. But it\u2019s interesting to see what foreign studios do with their films set in the states. I imagine it is how foreign countries view Hollywood productions set in their countries. \n\nThe actor they cast to play the murderer was genuinely creepy. ",

        "content": "It was a realistic and true ending, especially in the\n80s teen sex comedy genre. \n\nAwkward guy has an attractive friend who screws over girl. Awkward guy likes girl. Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

I\u2019ve already seen *The Conjuring*, *Insidious*, *Hereditary*, and *The Exorcist*. I\u2019d love to hear about some underrated, international, or truly scary movies that gave you chills. Any suggestions are welcome!\n\nAlso, if you recommend a movie, it would be awesome if you can give a short explanation about why you liked it or what makes it scary. That would really help me decide which one to watch first. Thanks!",

        "content": "What are examples of needle drops in movies that are so iconic, the movie basically owned the music from then on? \n\nIMPORTANT: I **don't** just mean favorite/the best needle drops, no matter how well-placed they are. I'm looking for examples that basically turned a piece of music into being synonymous with a movie/scene - to the point where if another movie used it, it would feel weird or even seem like theft.\n\nExamples I mean:\n\n\\- \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss: This piece wasn't well-known until it was used in *2001: A Space Odyssey*. Today, it\u2019s basically the \"2001 song.\" Almost every use of it now feels like an allusion to *2001* (or at least to space). *The Blue Danube* is close, but I think that piece is independently iconic -for example, there's a *Looney Tunes* cartoon that uses it, and I don't think of *2001* when I hear it.\n\n\\- Dick Dale's \"Misirlou\": While it\u2019s based on a folk song, there's no way anyone hears the surf guitar version and doesn't immediately think of *Pulp Fiction* (Well, except maybe for that Black Eyed Peas song). A good argument could also be made for the Chuck Berry track during the dance scene.\n\nExamples I don't count:\n\n\\- Songs that are iconic on their own: There are songs that were used amazingly well in movies, like *Be My Baby* in both *Mean Streets* and *Dirty Dancing*, but the song itself is so well-known that it\u2019s hard to say any one movie \"owns\" it, no matter how perfectly it\u2019s placed. (This is why I think Tony Bennett's *\"Rags to Riches\"* at the beginning of *Goodfellas* doesn\u2019t count, though I *do* think \"Sunshine of Your Love\" during De Niro's smoking scene could qualify.)\n\n\\- Songs used elsewhere that are just as recognizable: I thought *Lust for Life* in *Trainspotting* would be a great candidate until I remembered how many commercials have used it. Now, a lot of people probably associate it with ads, meaning the movie can\u2019t really claim ownership of it.\n\n\\- And of course, music written specifically for the movie doesn\u2019t count for what I\u2019m looking for. So, obviously, the theme from *Star Wars* or *Indiana Jones* will always be tied to those films.\n\nLet me know if another thread has tackled this before, but would love to hear your thoughts!  \n",
