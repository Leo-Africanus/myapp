        "content": "October is the perfect month to immerse yourself in horror movies, you know, because of Halloween.\n\nI am going to recommend a movie that you have probably all seen and it is 'The Exorcist', 1973, which for me is the best horror movie of all time, the difference is that I am going to recommend that you see a version that was released in 2000, The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen (Or The Exorcist, Extended Version).\n\nIn this version they reintroduced approximately 11 minutes of footage deleted in the 1973 version. The most famous additions are:\n\nThe infamous \"spider walk\" scene (Regan descending the stairs on all fours and backwards).\n\nA conversation between the priests Merrin and Karras.\n\nAn extended ending that includes a meeting between Lieutenant Kinderman and Father Dyer.\n\nIn addition to a complete restoration and remastering.\n\nTo this day, I still get scared watching her.\n\nGive me your opinion about the movie.\n\nI read you in the comments.\n\nGreetings",
