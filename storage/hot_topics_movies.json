        "title": "Transformers One is Actually Really Good",
        "content": " I saw the first trailer for in the cinema (where I also work and get to see films for free as an employee in that cinema). And I thought it looked super unfunny and terrible with forced humor that plagues modern Hollywood blockbuster films (thanks MCU!). Whoever edited that trailer should kind of hang their head in shame since they did not do a good job to sell this film. The second trailer was better and showed a bit more depth that it wasn't just a unfunny comedy Transformers. But I guess the damage of the first teaser trailer was already done. I didn't see this film in the cinema. I was still on the fence. But the reviews were actually very good. And not just by pop culture fandom critics who were bigger Transformers fans. More respected \"prestige film\" critics who would turn their nose up at this kind of film. Like Mark Kermode, who did praise the film and actually laughed out loud at a scene. Which is an achievement since he absolutely despises the awful BayFormers films. I don't even think he even likes the first film, which is the one that is actually good. \n\nBefore I go on further praising this film. I do want to say that the first maybe 30-40 minutes was a bit rocky. Some of the jokes didn't land and felt forced without giving the audience a chance to breath. Like some of the  forced humor made popular by the MCU (which I do overall enjoy the first 3 Phases, especially Iron Man, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok, and Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame. But some of the humor even in the best films still make me cringe a little with how forced and unfunny they are that undercut certain dramatic scenes). The worst offender is Keegan-Michael Key as B-127 (later Bumblebee). I found him very unfunny. He kind of turned Bumblebee into a bit of a joke cowardly type character with repetitive uninspired joke dialogue. Which is the opposite of who Bumblebee should be from what somewhat little I know of the character lore. So this film still had to sell me for those first 40 minutes. I did enjoy some of the scenes with Orion Pax/Optimus Prime and D-16/Megatron. Seeing their friendship before they became the biggest adversaries was interesting and it added depth to those characters that only more diehard Transformers fans that saw all the popular cartoons and read the popular comics knew more of their backstory as friends turned deadily enemies. And Chris Hemsworth (who sounded more and more like Peter Cullen as the film went on, and I want to highlight his performance when he could have easily phoned it in) and Brian Tyree Henry were great in the roles respectively. \n\nAbout 40 minutes in, the plot really kicked in for me and we get a more cohesive narrative. Other than Key's B-127 (who I still found largely unfunny for the most part), I became more compelled by the plot. And the animation I found very impressive considering I find some modern Hollywood animation lazy and uninspired with their cutting corners approach. The film truly started to become \"More than Meets the Eye\". At least to me who admittedly isn't a big TF fan. Jon Hamm was also very good as Sentinel Prime. An interesting character who's true motivations are revealed around that timestamp. And honestly when it came to the final act, I was hooked and I felt what I would describe as Danny Devito in Always Sunny when he says \"Oh my God I Get It\". It was kind of awesome. I felt like fist pumping honestly. And wish I saw it in the cinema and not waited to watch it on home media. I am honestly disappointed this film flopped. Because the ending to this film hooks you with a set up to what could have been an even better sequel overall. I mean it would still have Key as Bumblebee, unfortunately. Also I apologise if anyone liked his voice performance. But it was just too much for me. I did like Scarlet Johansson though. And pretty much most of the voice cast other than Key. Especially Tyree Henry, who crushed it. Also the legendary character actor Steve Buscemi was inspired casting as the voice of Starscream. So overall this movie is low-key one of the best films I have seen released in 2024 in my catch-up of films I missed that I am watching at the start of 2025. And I am just as shocked since again I'm not the biggest Transformers fan. But maybe I might turn into one if we get more animated films like this. \n\nEDIT: Deleted the first paragraph, which I admit was unnecessarily long winded on an already somewhat long-winded post.\n\nAlso TL;DR: Transformers One is great fun overall with overall great modern CGI animation. The best Transformers film that is actually set on Cybertron, has no annoying human characters, and has character development and isn't just simply robots beating the crap out of each other for 2 hours or more. Key as Bumblebee was my least favorite part of the film and was too annoying overall. But I was very impressed with Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax/Optimus Prime and especially Brian Tyree Henry as D-16/Megatron. They really sold this film for me, especially towards the end. ",

        "content": "I was thinking, the other day, after a rewatch of Pulp Fiction that we, collectively as a society, really missed out on a Vega brothers movie that would have been great. Looking at the performances of Michael Madsen and John Travolta in those movies, coupled with Tarantino's storytelling, it makes me kind of sick thinking about what could have been but never was. Just imagining a single scene of those two characters having a chummy interaction with each other makes me tingle a bit.\n\nThis got me thinking about the question I am posing today for you bunch of movie buffs... what do you think is the greatest movie that is known to have been conceived but never got made? What are we worse off for as a media consuming civilization for not getting the pleasure of watching? I will throw my hat in on the never made Vincent and Vic Vega movie, but I haven't really explored too many other options... I leave that to you all.\n\nI request that everyone, before replying, check the existing replies (Ctrl-F search if you have to) to see if your suggestion was recommended, give it a thumbs up, and add your take as a reply. Thank you.",

It's just delightful. [The 'no ticket' scene is a great example.](https://youtu.be/s0vNsH81YeA?si=Y4DMb7z9itI2eAN8)\n\nIt's absolutely baffling to me that all we got out of the legacy of those are one good Mummy movie and two okay National treasure movies, iirc. And now Jungle Cruise, I guess? Ugh. \n\nAnyway, can anyone please recommend some adventure movies that scratch my itch for quick thinking escapades? Doesn't have to be after Indiana Jones but bonus points if it is! Thank you! ",

Every weird little movement or rhyme he did made it feel like I was watching some strange ET like creature trying to become a person.\n\nSo many memorable lines from him, \u201crevenge tastes best while wearing a dress\u201d and \u201ccan I not get rid of this fucking cousin?\u201d",

Never understood why this film didn\u2019t get the credit it deserved. So if you want to do something don\u2019t think twice about it and go for it.",

        "content": "This movie is something special. The cast meshes extremely well. Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn\u2019t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he\u2019s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too.  \n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it\u2019s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. \n\nSome of my favorites lines in this movie:\n\n*lands on ship* \u2026\u2026.Aaaahhhhhhhhhh\n\nWait! Don\u2019t open that! It\u2019s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don\u2019t know!!!\u2026.sniff sniff\u2026seems like there is air\n\nWe have to get out of here before they kill guy!!\n\nGuy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!?!\n\nBesides\u2026..hehehehehe, I just had this really interesting idea. Guy: Are you stoned?\n\nWell screw that!\n\nThe list goes on. If you haven\u2019t seen it, go watch it!!",

She decided to put on E.T., hoping for some lighthearted distraction. From the point the government come to try and take him, my sister and I just became more and more inconsolable.\n\nBut the parts that really sent me over the edge  was when he runs away and it cuts to him waking up down by a creek with racoons around him. I thought the racoons had eaten his legs. I have no idea how I didn't clock he just had little legs, but boy was I absolutely horrified. \n\nI'd love to hear other people's reactions to things in films they completely misinterpreted on first viewing.

It could be a brutal murder, a cold and emotionless decision, or an act so heartless it defies what normal people would find acceptable. For example, Amon Goth constructing the concentration camp and mercilessly killing the engineer who tried to explain an issue is a powerful display of such evil. Moments like these define the antagonist's character and leave an unforgettable impact on the audience.",
