So I\u2019ve been wondering: what really makes a villain *stick* with you?\n\nIs it a powerful performance? A compelling backstory? Maybe it\u2019s how well they challenge the hero, or how believable (or terrifying) their motivations are. For me, it's often when a villain feels just a little too real\u2014like they could exist in our world.\n\nVillains like Hannibal Lecter (*Silence of the Lambs*), Anton Chigurh (*No Country for Old Men*), or Nurse Ratched (*One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest*) all left a strong impression, but for very different reasons.\n\nWho\u2019s the most memorable movie villain for you\u2014and what made them stand out?",

Given that he was also making the film during the Iraq war, it would have packed an even bigger punch given how much of the war's premise was BS.",
