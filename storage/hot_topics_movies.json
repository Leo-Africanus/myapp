You can see the exact moment Rick falls in love with her. Brendan Fraser gives this bemused, but slightly dazed smile which I feel represents almost every guy in the audience too lol",

Can you remember the movie that you saw when you were way too young who showed it to you and what affected it have on you?",

        "content": "My wife and I recently decided to get back into watching movies but after a a couple of months we were having a difficult time deciding on the next movie. \n\nWe ended up coming up with a system that has worked pretty well so far. \n\nIt started off with us watching Boogie Nights because my wife had never seen the movie. We were talking about all the people in it and started discussing about actors who had bit parts in movies before they hit it big.\n \nThis led to the idea of her looking at the cast from Boogie Nights amd selecting one actor and looking at their filmography. She would then pick a movie that either one of us had seen or neither of us had seen and we cannot select the same actor back to back.\n\nShe started off with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Cold Mountain, which led me to Natalie Portman in The Professional, then Michael Badalucco in Summer of Sam, to John Leguizamo in the Menu and just now Ralph Fiennes in Conclave. \n\nIt's been really fun so far and I highly recommend it as it narrows down the selections especially with streaming. \n\n",

        "title": "Strange Cinema Experiences",
        "content": "I went to see Superman last night at my local cinema. It's small, only 2 screens, and there normally aren't that many people there since it's in a rural area of England. I had hoped since it was a few weeks into Superman's run it would be pretty empty. I was wrong, it was maybe three quarters full. Oh well, no big deal.\n\nI sit down, and a little bit later an old man wearing a suit sits next to me, his wife and presumably their daughter beside him. When sitting down, he knocked my drink on the floor. Oh well, it was bottled, just didn't have much fizz in it anymore, and of course he apologised. Shit happens.\n\nThen they pull out the loaf of bread. It was half full, and they have some cheese slices and just start making some sandwiches. Never seen anyone do this before, very very odd behaviour, but ultimately harmless. Just so strange. This was all during the trailers, so no bother. I regret watching the screen instead of the group beside me honestly, because there was a lot of rustling and I wonder what other ingredients they brought for their sandwiches. I suppose I'll never know now.\n\nSo now we're about 20 minutes in, and this old man - who I estimate was probably in his 70s - is starting to breathe quite heavily. I think he's a little warm, and given that he's wearing a suit with what looks like a thick jacket on quite a muggy evening, that makes sense. Instead of taking it off though, he pulls out an electric fan with a distracting bright blue light that is now noisily whirring right next to me and blowing air in my face. Were I to embelish the story, this is where I'd say he also smelled, and that stench was blowing right up my nostrils. Thankfully, that was not the case at all. I was laughing to myself because, in a way, I got a free 4D experience, the wind blowing through my hair as Superman flew about. He did eventually decide to take the jacket off, which I think was a much wiser decision. The fan went away, though it did make more minor appearances sporadically throughout.\n\nAbout an hour in, a very loud phone alarm goes off near me. I nearabouts shit myself, I could've sworn I turned my phone off! Of course, I did. It was the old man's. Wow, what an embarrassing mistake, I think to myself! But oh no, this was no mistake. This was the reminder to take his medication, mid way through a film, in a packed cinema, which he does. But of course you wouldn't want to take that on an empty stomach, so it's time to make a few more sandwiches.\n\nTo my mind, there was nothing overtly annoying about this experience. I overall enjoyed the film and was laughing at the strange antics of the man next to me. But it was certainly very, very bizarre. Anyone else got any strange cinema experiences to share?",
