        "content": "When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.\n\nIt's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.\n\nWhat could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??\n\nI didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.\n\nGladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.\n\nIt's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.\n\nHe managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.\n\nWith Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.\n\nHe's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.\n\nIt's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.\n\nIt's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.\n\nRussell's performance wasn't just \"playing the hero\" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.\n\nHe's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.\n\nIt's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.\n\nI hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Found it on Netflix and just finished watching, don\u2019t remember seeing anything about it when it came out.\n\nStars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal. They had top billing for obvious reasons, Brolin and Gyllenhaal are what attracted me to it, but there\u2019s a lot of actors sharing the screen and they\u2019re all top notch in this movie.\n\nI decided to watch it despite thinking to myself \u201cokay, this is gonna be one of those movies that I can go ahead and play in my mind with probably 70% accuracy.\u201d I thought it was gonna be superficial and formulaic - it was not.\n\nIt\u2019s based on a true story of a disaster on Mt Everest in 1996. Won\u2019t go into more detail than that to avoid spoilers.\n\nI doubt the movie would blow anybody\u2019s mind but it\u2019s just a really good, solid film. There\u2019s a lot of human drama that felt very genuine to me, no melodrama. No cheesy dialogue. No caricatures. No actors hamming it up or overacting, in my opinion. No major genre cliches that I can recall. In fact I feel that it\u2019s the type of movie that kinda defies genre, although you could categorize the themes well enough.\n\nPlot wise I didn\u2019t find it predictable at all. If you\u2019re already familiar with the story then I think you\u2019ll find that the events aren\u2019t portrayed predictably. No cheap thrills or cheap sentiment, just real ones. It made me feel shit.\n\nThe cinematography is great, there\u2019s a lot of astounding shots of the mountain and surrounding environment. I don\u2019t know if it was IMAX, but I\u2019d have to assume it was because of some of the photography that just screams IMAX. Watch it on your biggest screen\n\nLong story short, I was expecting to accept a certain degree of eye rolling bullshit but there was none to be found. Really solid movie, it impressed me a lot.",

Now we literally have people voluntarily documenting every aspect of their lives for strangers online.\n\nThe scene where Truman realizes patterns in his world (same people walking past at the same time) reminds me of how recommendation algorithms keep showing us the same content. And when he tries to leave town but encounters obstacles? That's basically what happens when we try to disconnect from social media - there's always something pulling us back in.\n\nThe most haunting part was when Truman asks \"Was nothing real?\" That question hits harder now when we're all curating these perfect online versions of ourselves.\n\nAnyone else revisit older films that seem to predict our modern reality in ways that weren't obvious when they were released?\n",

To be honest, I was afraid to watch them again because I figured I'd find them to be immature and dated.\n\nBut, I'd run out of movies I'd wanted to watch, and I figured I'd give them a re-watch all these years later. Oh, boy, was I impressed. They were all truly a delight to watch from start to finish.\n\nFortunately, I'd forgotten most of what happens during the films. There are scenes and jokes that I remembered, but they were also fun to watch because they're performed so well. Absolute classics. Then, the rest, had me laughing on the inside and the outside.\n\nNowadays, there aren't that many movies that I find truly joyful to watch from start to finish, but these movies all met the mark. When I first saw Goldfinger, I didn't even know who Beyonce was xD.\n\nI don't think there's been comedy like this since the last time it came out.",

        "content": "I went into *Grave of the Fireflies* completely clueless , I had no idea what to expect. But by the time the movie ended, only one thought kept echoing in my mind:\n\n**\u201cWhoever starts the war, no matter who wins or loses, the ones who truly suffer are the people just trying to survive it.\u201d**\n\nThe pain, the sorrow, the daily struggle of those living through wartime\u2026it\u2019s unmatchable. Unless you've lived it, you can never truly understand it. And I was in tears by the end.\n\nI came across some online discussions where people were blaming Seita, the brother, saying his pride got them killed. But honestly? I don't agree. During a war, everyone is pushed to the edge , there\u2019s food scarcity, fear of sudden death, bombing raids. Every morning, you wake up wondering if you\u2019ll live to see another day. In that kind of world, the mind doesn't function normally.\n\nEven the aunt, who many view as cruel, was also a victim of the war. You could see how it was mentally breaking her. Seita and Setsuko were just children. Seita had just lost his mother, had no contact with his father or relatives, and on top of that, he had a little sister to protect. How is a child supposed to carry all that?\n\nPeople say it was pride...but if it was, would he have risked stealing food again and again, even after getting beaten, just to feed his sister? That\u2019s not pride. That\u2019s pure, desperate love. He didn\u2019t have an adult to guide him. He was just a boy, doing the best he could in a world that had collapsed around him.\n\nThis movie doesn\u2019t draw a line between good and bad\u2014it shows how **unfair** war is to everyone. And I think this is the **saddest movie I\u2019ve ever seen in my life**. I don\u2019t want to watch it again... but I truly believe *everyone*, especially our generation, needs to see it **at least once**. You\u2019ll learn something that no book or lecture can teach.\n\nAlso, that background music , Absolutely unforgettable. And that fireflies scene... the red glow, Seita and Setsuko sitting together on the bench in the night ,that image is forever engraved in my heart.\n\nThis movie... it\u2019s more than a story. It\u2019s an experience. And I\u2019ll never forget it.",

        "content": "Robert De Niro is my favorite actor, and this performance is his crowning achievement. This was basically the first performance where an actor gained a lot of weight for the role which inspired many other actors to do the same thing to this day. His performance is raw, unfiltered, angry, and completely believable as Jake LaMotta. This performance is right up there with Brando in The Godfather and Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. This film is just a perfect character study of a violent guy slowly destroying his own life professionally and personally. The black and white was perfect for this film as well, it almost made the boxing scenes feel more vicious in a weird way. The scene in jail where he\u2019s punching the wall and crying and screaming is some of the finest acting you could ever see. He completely deserved his Oscar for this film.",

        "content": "When I was growing up, I used physical media all the time: VHS tapes, DVDs, Blu-rays. I remember going to the store or renting a movie and feeling a real connection to it. I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays too, especially full series of movies I loved.\n\nThese days, with streaming platforms, everything is online and instantly available. It\u2019s so convenient: you can watch whatever you want, whenever you want. The same goes for books and music.\n\nBut I wonder: do people still prefer physical media? Does anyone still collect Blu-rays or DVDs? Do you think physical media offers something digital just can\u2019t replicate? Like, do you miss the experience of handling a book, album, or movie?\n\nI guess what I\u2019m really asking is: do you miss that era of physical media, or are you glad we\u2019ve moved on to everything being digital?",

Granted, I may be biased because I did study linguistics, so the movie was right up my alley, but I get the feeling it's be quite intriguing even if you're not into that particular science.\n\nI am giving the movie a big, fat, enthusiastic 9/10, and now I want to continue with the alien motif. I'll go for Sputnik either tonight or tomorrow, but can't decide what movie to pick as the third. Any recommendations?",
