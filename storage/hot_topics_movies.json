None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn't phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.\n\n",

        "content": "Weird way to make a movie. My wife and I enjoyed the ride, it's at least fun and riveting to watch and figure out what it's leading up to\n\nThe movie has some issues in my opinion, and obviously the whole Shutter Island plot is obvious from the get-go basically as soon as you know he's both a recovering alcoholic after having driven drunk.\n\nMy maim things are\n- What's actually real? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Were the police real people involved in the investigation, or did they just happen to be there when he was leaving? They were too agreeable to not be Shutter Island-esque plants. But prior to that it doesn't seem like the hospital is at all trying to push any investigation. \n\nIt seems like the therapist lady was guiding the investigation, but it was unclear at what point that was the *purpose* of him being there, since finding the bodies didnt seem like an important or relevant point until she showed up. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he lock them in the gas station? How the frick does he steal the cop car? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DOES he actually kill the security, break in and manage to kidnap a guy? And no one stops him?! What??? Did he actually shoot the oxygen tap and blow up the OR and shoot Bruce? Or is that in his imagination?\n\n\n- Why are there so many small seeds they plant that are more of poor misdirects rather than intentional red herrings?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; besides some message of masking trauma and parallels to him losing a wife and child, as well as tying in his alcoholism, how does the previous wife plot have any relevance? Not saying I don't get it, but they could've basicslly.cut that whole thing and it wouldn't make a difference to the main plot.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The LL floor thing is wacky to me. What are the chances that it actually IS the organ donation floor?? I mean, he saw them go down there assuming it was cor a CAT scan and is none the wiser, he finds out at some point that they genuinely harvest organs, AND it's ACTUALLY on the floor he saw them going to? Puh-leeease!!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; How was Peri's scarf in there? He brought it in when he got treated? \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If he was coming in being treated for a car crash, why would no one have checked his car out? Looked out the window even? \n\nTons of other things to point at, but these are some of the glaring flaws. \n\nI feel like because of some things they did in thus movie, they missed some good opportunities. In some areas, it's utterly predictable. In others, they do a weird twist that contradicts something established earlier in the plot.\n\nIt would've been better if they didn't show MC having fallen into the pit. The viewer knowing that he has untreated head trauma makes it obvious that everything is in his head. It's been said before, but it would've actually been better if they made him seem delusional to trick him into not realizing it was a REAL evil organ-harvesting hospital.\n\nNonetheless, San Worthington is STELLAR in this movie, and it definitely had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what exactly is going on and what'll happen next.\n\n\n\nHoly frick that was long.",

But I was completely hypnotized from 15 minutes in all the way until the end. I would actually say the movie only got better and better as it went on. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it and I know it\u2019s a movie I\u2019ll watch again and again and again \n\nBut it is true, nothing really happens. If you\u2019re a fan of beautiful cinematography though, I would check it out anyway because it\u2019s hilarious and entertaining enough to not really not all these intricate relationships and drama and romance.

        "content": "I just want to take a moment and appreciate Harrison Ford. In my opinion, he is the best every man action hero that I can recall in cinema. His most iconic characters aren\u2019t the best of the best at every single thing. Even when he wins the fight, he usually has taken a beating throughout and barely manages to make it out alive. The fight choreography is really clumsy, just like how an everyman character should be. I personally love when he throws a haymaker and almost falls over.\n\nIndiana Jones is an academic first and foremost. Deckard is a cop. Han is a smuggler. Jack Ryan is an analyst. His characters find themselves in extraordinary circumstances but you never find their involvement unbelievable. His character is just lucky to make it to see another day. They show confidence in the skills they should and he perfectly portrays when he\u2019s out of his depth. His character finds themselves grit to go on because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but he hopes for the best without knowing he\u2019ll win in the end.\n\nI love watching the over the top action spectacles from time to time where the main hero breezes through waves of bad guys and has the best one liners. But if the goal is to see yourself in a character, I think Harrison Ford is the best action hero of his generation.",

What if Indiana Jones had two perfectly average sequels after The Last Crusade? \n\nThe Last Crusade ended with the heroes *literally* riding off into the sunset. And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones' happy ending. \n\nWith such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn. Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?",
