        "content": "My wife is currently watching a TV show and the episode is about a group of people who are kidnapping people and selling them. One of the women who is imprisoned is revealed to be the mastermind of the entire operation at the end of the episode. At one point, other members of the group come and take her away from an actual captive, but they still continue to act like she's a captive as well long after they're away from the person. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this except to continue to dupe the audience into thinking this woman is a captive as well.\n\nSo, this got me thinking about other things like this. Another one I can recall is in a horror movie where the character on screen is facing to the left and the creature pops out from behind him in a jump scare that is SOLELY for the camera. The character would never have seen her or even knew she was there.\n\nWhat are some other examples of this?\n\n  \nEDIT: Yes, it's an episode of Criminal Minds, for those asking.",

        "content": "All I\u2019ve ever heard about this film is bad things since it first came out. People still will tell me it\u2019s terrible and that Routh is a terrible Superman etc. I finally decided to watch it tonight, and disagree. I\u2019m actually upset I never watched it sooner.\n\nIs it perfect? Far from it. But even the Reeve films weren\u2019t perfect. I\u2019ve seen people say it\u2019s all too \u201cconvenient\u201d, but so were the Reeve films? I mean Reeve literally rewound time in the first one to fix everything.\n\nThis film feels like a love letter to the Reeve films and I loved that. Routh gives an honorable and respectful performance as Reeve\u2019s Superman. He plays Superman with this gentleness and warmth I liked. His Superman feels warm. I found him lovely. It\u2019s a shame he got most of the hate when the film came out. Had Reeve lived to see this film made I think he would be proud of Routh\u2019s work. He was honorable and respectful in his portrayal.\n\nKate Bosworth is miscast as Lois Lane, as she is too young and dare i say\u2026 too pretty? Bosworth was only 23 when cast. They definitely needed someone who looked a bit more mature, but she did best with what she was given. Her Lois is a bit whiny though?\n\nKevin Spacey actually looks like he\u2019s having a blast playing Luther and he plays it up just like Gene Hackman.\n\nParker Posey is perfection here.\n\nI don't think people REALLY understand that \u2018Superman Returns\u2019 (2006) was a direct sequel to \u2018Superman 2.\u2019 That's why Luthor knows where the Fortress of Solitude is and how Superman knocked up Lois.\n\nMost people I hear say that they just didn\u2019t really like how Brandon Routh portrayed Superman, but Brandon Routh captured the spirit of Chris Reeves perfectly. He looks just like him at that age (Reeves was also in his late 20s during the filming of the first 2 movies) and totally sold me on this being the same boy scout/awkward dork character from those films.\n\nI agree Kate Bosworth was miscast being too young to play Lois (she was 23, while Margot Kidder was older than Reeves during the earlier movies), but as far as acting goes she, much like Routh, captured old Lois very well.\n\nLuthor seducing a rich old lady to get him out of jail and inherit her money sounds like something he'd do in the past movies. It's absurd comedy! A staple of the old films.\n\nAnd most people complain that the ending was quick and convenient when that was the case with the earlier films as well (time reversal, anyone?).\n\nOverall, I love this movie and it gets more shit than it deserves.",

I know, all the signs of poor quality were flashing to begin with, but it was at the height of FoX-Men hate, so I went in with an open mind. But the second I heard that flat delivery of that elementary school parable, I knew I was in trouble.",

Jim Thompson's snappy fast-paced dialogue is music to the ears, and the fragmented story-line, jumping back and forth in time and between character POVs, is masterfully done. Kubrick's cold and detached camera lends an atmosphere of foreboding, culminating in an iconic heist sequence and an ending that is just the perfect capstone to a film dripping with dread and cynicism. Just wanted to gush about this gem. I might be late to the party here but I'm glad I showed up. Give it a watch, folks.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about this for years now, and I still can\u2019t wrap my head around how Bradley Cooper didn\u2019t win Best Actor for A Star is Born. This film is an absolute masterpiece and easily ranks among the finest movies of the past decade and a half.\nCooper didn\u2019t just act in this film \u2013 he directed it, co-wrote it, produced it, and performed all his own vocals live. The emotional depth he brought to Jackson Maine was extraordinary. Every scene crackled with authenticity, from his struggles with addiction to the tender moments with Ally. You could feel the weight of his character\u2019s pain and vulnerability in every frame.\nAnd then there\u2019s the technical achievement. Cooper transformed himself physically and vocally for the role, spent years learning guitar and developing Jackson\u2019s specific singing style, and created some of the most emotionally resonant musical performances ever captured on film.\nI understand Bohemian Rhapsody was a cultural phenomenon, but let\u2019s be honest about what we\u2019re comparing here. Rami Malek delivered a solid performance, but he was lip-syncing to Freddie Mercury\u2019s vocals for most of the film. Meanwhile, Cooper was singing live, in character, creating original music that became genuinely iconic.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 Malek\u2019s physical transformation and embodiment of Mercury was impressive. But when you stack it against Cooper\u2019s multi-faceted artistic achievement in A Star is Born, it feels like the Academy missed recognizing one of the most complete creative accomplishments in recent memory.\nThis still ranks as one of the most puzzling Best Actor decisions in Oscar history. What are your thoughts? Am I being too harsh on the Bohemian Rhapsody win?",
