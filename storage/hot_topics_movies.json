        "content": "Hi r/movies! I'm Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, writer/director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which is out in theaters nationwide starting today, Friday, July 18th.  I've also written and directed Netflix's DO REVENGE (starring Maya Hawke &amp; Camila Mendes), and written and directed Netflix\u2019s SOMEONE GREAT. Ask me anything!\n\nWhen five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences. A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they're forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer... and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.\n\n**Here's our trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs)\n\nI KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is out in theaters nationwide starting today.\n\n**Bio:**\n\nJennifer Kaytin Robinson is making her theatrical debut in 2025 with the new installment of the cult classic I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which she also co-wrote. The film features returning fan-favorites Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the original films, alongside a new generation of talent including Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon, and Gabbriette.\n\nRobinson is also known for her sophomore directorial feature DO REVENGE for Netflix, which she also produced and wrote. The film is a darkly comedic high school reimagining of Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Strangers on a Train\u2019. Its ensemble cast features Camila Mendes, Maya Hawke, Rish Shah, Austin Abrams, Talia Ryder, Alisha Boe, Sophie Turner and Sarah Michelle Gellar, and debuted at #1 globally on Netflix.\n\nHer feature directorial debut, SOMEONE GREAT, which she also wrote, premiered globally on Netflix in 2019. The cast includes Gina Rodriguez, Brittany Snow, DeWanda Wise, LaKeith Stanfield, and RuPaul, among others.\n\nHer additional credits include co-writing the screenplay for Marvel\u2019s THOR: LOVE &amp; THUNDER together with Oscar-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi, which grossed over $760 million worldwide; and co-writing the screenplay for the Max Original feature UNPREGNANT.  \n\n*Ask me anything! I'll be answering questions starting at 3 PM ET.*\n\n",

The curiosity as they're trying to figure out the nature of the planet, and the way the music hits for \"those aren't mountains\" is great sauce for your \"oh shit\" feeling.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy - Defeating the bad guy with the power of friendship is an old one but \"Black Tears\" is great as it ramps up with each member joining hands and the way it crescendos right before \"We're the Guardians of the Galaxy\" really adds to how triumphant the scene feels.\n\nWhat are yours?",

Those people don't get how this is a time-honored tradition in high school movies, going back to the 50s (\"Grease\" openly mocked it). The 80s films that \"Stranger Things\" draws inspiration from had some especially egregious examples. James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink\" looks like a Wall Street yuppie trolling a high school for jailbait. Alan Ruck was pushing 30 in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off (a decade older than Mia Sara who was an actual teenager when they made it). And to use a \"Stranger Things\" cast member as an example, Matthew Modine was a married dad when he played a high school senior in \"Vision Quest.\" The list goes on.",
