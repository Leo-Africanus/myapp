        "content": "This is one of those movies that I somehow missed during my childhood. I just ended up seeing it and my god, this movie is excellent. Like all great family friendly movies, it manages to be a very wholesome and accessible movie to children while also being a movie with surprisingly sophisticated themes and character work when you look at it with adult eyes.\n\nI was so impressed that this cutesy little animal movie managed to deliver some very salient points about biases and class injustice. I loved the part where the dogs go \"We have to speak slowly because all sheep are obviously stupid.\" And then it goes \"the sheep spoke slowly because all dogs are *obviously ignorant*.\"\n\nAnd even though the movie doesn't come right out and say it in the text, I couldn't help but feel that the movie was HEAVILY implying some kind of vegetarian message in it. Or maybe a better way to phrase that it is the movie implicitly asks questions about our treatment and eating of animals that even adults find hard to answer.\n\nNot trying to sound preachy. I eat and love BBQ. But watching this movie it is **very** hard to avoid asking myself \"Why is it okay to eat pigs, but it's not okay to eat the dogs or the cat?\" Which I was suprised to see in a movie where the target audience is children. \n\nAnd also HUGO FUCKING WEAVING is in this! I had no idea! I know it sounds stupid, but I'd easily put this right next to Matrix and LoTR for how much I enjoyed it and I will fight anyone over this. ",

The whole parent-child theme, the idea of sacrificing everything for a slim chance to save humanity\u2014it\u2019s way more emotional.\n\nAlso, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score still gives me chills, especially during the docking scene. Christopher Nolan might get flak sometimes for being \u201ctoo ambitious,\u201d but for me, this movie is one of his masterpieces.\n\nCurious\u2014where do you rank Interstellar among Nolan\u2019s films? Do you think it\u2019s underrated compared to Inception and The Dark Knight?\n",

This is an excellent, chilling movie about a guy who goes crazy due to excruciating circumstances, and I can sort of relate to his predicament! I also lived in LA for about 10 years and I've seen much of the same bad scene depicted in the movie, which is a far cry from the Hollywood glamor typically depicted of it! I also know the feeling of being on the edge, but luckily I'm a nonviolent person, so if I lost it, I'd most likely just resort to verbal abuse, which I'm pretty good at! In any case, I recommend this movie, since I think it depicts a dark part of real life we all must face, for better or for worse!",

        "content": "To me, it has to be Pretty Woman.  Not Julia Roberts' first film, but the film that immediately catapulted her to a box office start, if not *the* star of that era.  She lit up the screen with that smile, charmed the hell out of the audience by blowing her nose loudly into Barney's handkerchief (kudos to Hector Elizondo in that scene, and every other scene he was in), and dropped jaws in that red dress.  This movie was the arrival of Julia Roberts.\n\nWhat other movies can this be said of?",
