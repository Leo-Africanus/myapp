He\u2019ll also appear in the horror film MCCURDY POINT, which he produced and starred in alongside fellow Groundling and other great bud, Ryan Gaul. Kiel earned an Emmy nomination for his work on ROBOT CHICKEN, where he also became an expert at picking up Hot Wheels that he launched off ramps. (It\u2019s a thing at Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.)

I debated between this, the shotgun shovel scene, and the scene where the sheriffs hat keeps getting bigger lol. This is definitely one of the best comedies of the early 2000s and imo, the last good scary movie in the franchise. Everything after just didn\u2019t have the same magic as the first 3, and especially this one. There are tons of  hilarious moments in this film it\u2019s hard to pick just one.

        "title": "Movies That Are Only Half Great?",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about Focus (2015) and man, that movie is such a great half of a film. Spoilers ahead.\n\nThe first half? Genuinely fantastic. Will Smith and Margot Robbie have electric chemistry, the con sequences are slick, fast-paced, and fun as hell. The New Orleans setting, the smooth jazz over quick grifts, the football gambling sequence - it\u2019s got this stylish, high-energy vibe that pulls you in. It feels like you\u2019re watching Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Catch Me If You Can.\n\nThen\u2026 the time skip hits. And suddenly we\u2019re in Buenos Aires, and the whole movie just changes pace and tone. It goes from playful con artist fun to a slower, more romantic, double cross heavy drama. I get that the point is to show how Margot\u2019s character has grown even more confident and cunning - to the point where she can now turn the tables on Will\u2026 but the transition is jarring. It feels like two different movies stitched together.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those cases where if the whole movie had just stuck to the tone and energy of the first half, it could\u2019ve been something really special. Instead, it ends up feeling like a great setup with a middling follow through.\n\nCurious - what are some other movies you guys think are \u201chalf great\u201d? Like, the first or second half absolutely rules, but the other half kinda doesn\u2019t match the magic? Bonus points if you explain why",
