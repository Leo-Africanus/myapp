        "content": "Hi r/movies \u2013 I'm Fleur Fortun\u00e9, the director of THE ASSESSMENT, in theaters now from Magnolia Pictures. Starring Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Olsen, Himesh Patel, and Minnie Driver,  the film had its World Premiere at TIFF 2024, and played at the Zurich Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, and more. The film is my feature directorial debut, but I've been directing music videos (like some for Skrillex, Drake, Pharrell Williams, and Travis Scott), commercials, and shorts until now. More on the film:\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT follows Mia (Olsen) and Aaryan (Patel), a successful couple who hope to become parents in a near future where resources are extremely limited and the government keeps firm control over reproduction. They are assigned an assessor named Virginia (Vikander), who moves into their home for seven days to evaluate whether they deserve to move forward in their parenting journey. What Mia and Aaryan are hoping is a routine test quickly unravels into a psychological nightmare, forcing them to question the very foundations of their society and what it truly means to be human.\n\nTHE ASSESSMENT is now in theaters, and you can check out screenings in your area here: \n\n[https://www.theassessmentmovie.com/movie/the-assessment/book-now](https://www.theassessmentmovie.com/movie/the-assessment/book-now)\n\nOfficial Trailer:\n\n[https://youtu.be/bYmELiSalx0](https://youtu.be/bYmELiSalx0)\n\nTalk to you all later!

That's without talking about his hit-making run in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, or his TV show resume, which is arguably even more impressive (he's literally about to come out with a show that has near-universal critical acclaim pre-release)\n\nUnlike other leading men who have a lot of well regarded stuff in their filmography, Rogen isn't really playing a numbers game. The man hasn't really been in a whole lot, it's just that a large portion of what he does do, is some version of good\n\n",

        "content": "I came late to this movie. Years late. A decade even. My daughter knew we loved \u201cPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\u201d thus, she said, we should love \u201cHot Rod.\u201d \n\nBruh.\n\nI never laugh during an initial viewing of a comedy. Don\u2019t know why, but any comedy I see the first time, it might elicit a chuckle here or there, maybe a chortle or a slight guffaw, but that\u2019s about it. \u201cHot Rod\u201d had me cackling the first time I watched it, and every time I\u2019ve watched it since, I still laugh hard.\n\nSo unbelievably quotable\u2026 \u201cCool beans,\u201d \u201cBABE, WAIT, BABE!\u201d \u201cYoo-hoo shitheads, I found this bag of fireworks in the men's restroom. Would you guys like to light them off?\u201d \u201cLet me join your crewwwWWW?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking green tea all goddamn day!\u201d \u201cYou guys, the bathroom here is nuts!\u201d \u201cUltimate punch!\u201d \u201cPussyyyyyyyyyy\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Rod and I like to party.\u201d \u201cI said you look shitty! Goodnight, Denise!\u201d\n\nPerfect soundtrack! Effing EUROPE songs throughout. The \u201cYou\u2019re The Voice\u201d montage! We know the story takes place in the age of the internet, but when? It\u2019s timeless, sorta. 80s glam metal songs with earnest lyrics, clothes vehicles and houses that could put you in any of the last five decades. \n\nStill cannot believe this movie even exists. Thank god it does. With all of the frightened studio execs unwilling to take risks on anything because audiences are unpredictable and unreliable, for Paramount to basically go, \u201cOK idiots, here\u2019s $25 million, go make a movie,\u201d it\u2019s baffling to me. It\u2019s also a shame this movie is still not as well known as it deserves. I would have thought, y\u2019know, long tail rules, \u201cHot Rod\u201d would have made its money back by now.\n\nI\u2019m dropping this here for appreciation of a damn funny movie that deserves more viewers.",

        "title": "The one Disney animated film that BEGGED to be made into a franchise/series but never did? THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE. Oh how I wish we could\u2019ve had more adventures with Basil of Baker Street",
        "content": "I know everyone always goes on about the Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladdin etc. (&amp; those are wonderful films)\n\nBut for me? 1986\u2019s \u201cThe Great Mouse Detective\u201d is the **PERFECT** animated Disney film. I love practically every frame. The music, the voice acting &amp; animation? It\u2019s wonderfully charming. Disney doing Victorian era London is always special &amp; atmospheric. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know the premise? It\u2019s simple. What if Sherlock Holmes\u2026was a mouse. Solving mice crimes. All while living in mouse hole tucked away in actual human Sherlock Holmes address of Baker Street\n\nThis movie was completed in that sweet spot where Disney had yet to make the switch to digital coloring(aka digital Ink &amp; paint aka the CAPS system) and so this film has that warmth &amp; charm that was a little bit lost when the conversion was made circa the early 1990s. It does have a very early CGI sequence in an animated film, the terrific Big Ben Clock climax. (The gears were created digitally and then traced over, not actually rendered out to film or composited digitally)\n\nSo what makes the film so special? The characters. The characters! I know this isn\u2019t technically \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d BUT if it were, this would be my favourite rendition of the great detective. \n\nLike all great Sherlock adaptations it\u2019s the Sherlock/Watson relationship that is the true measure of success and this movie takes the cake. David Q Dawson is our Watson stand in, he\u2019s a caring albeit clumsy mouse, compared to Basil\u2019s man(er..mouse) of action. They just have terrific chemistry. You buy them as friends instantly. \n\nAnd it\u2019s this reason more adventure were needed. I don\u2019t care in what form. Straight to video, animated series or legit theatrical sequel. So long as the same voice actors were used? Give me more! But alas, it was not meant to be. After Little Mermaid and the rest become huge cultural juggernauts, there was no more room for the relatively modest successful fare like The Great Mouse Detective. And we are all the poorer for it. Also unlike most those other films, this isn\u2019t a musical. There\u2019s one scene where characters break out in song. And it\u2019s great.\n\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered if Disney would do the same \u201clive action\u201d remake route befallen to so many of the animated films. Maybe in time but you\u2019ll never do better than Vincent Price as Ratigan, Barrie Ingham as Basil and Val Bettin as Dawson. RIP.\n\nAnd that score by Henry Mancini? Now that\u2019s a theme! Remember when we had memorable musical themes? \n\nSo? For those who haven\u2019t had the pleasure or for those who have &amp; haven\u2019t had the pleasure in awhile, go check out The Great Mouse Detective, bask in its charm, warmth, heart and splendor. \n\nThis movie deserved to be a franchise.",

        "title": "\"Flow\" - How the Cat-Whale dynamic resonated with me after my mom's suicide",
        "content": "I finally watched Flow yesterday at one of the last screenings here in France, and feel so spoken to. As someone who has lost a lot of people these past few years and felt responsible for the actions of others, the theme of people entering and leaving your life during their own journey gave me a lot of parallels.\n\nBut the Cat's relationship to the Whale really resonated with me, in my heart before I could explain it. I first saw this dynamic as a \"help where you can and accept when you can't\" moral:\n\n&gt;The Whale saving the Cat, while literally lifesaving for the Cat was just a bit of effort on the Whale's part, maybe just an afterthought in its day. However, this situation could only be manufactured through the absurd scenario of the flood, where Whale just happened to have the skills needed to help. When the flood ends, the Cat is the only one with the skills/intelligence to get the rope out of the tree and help save the animals on the boat. When the Cat finds the Whale again -beached in a forest, another absurd scenario-, there is nothing he can do other than comfort the Whale while it dies. We aren't all built with the right tools for every scenario, and some problems are beyond our means, we are not able to save everyone, even if that person had previously saved us and we feel indebted to them. A very stoic moral that preaches forgiving yourself.\n\nBut I couldn't figure out why it was so powerful to me, so I went for a walk under the nighttime drizzle after the movie. I then realized that I saw the Cat &amp; Whale's relationship as that of me and my mother, who lost her battle with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago. \n\n&gt;In addition to saving the Cat, the Whale was following the boat, serving as a source of comfort in a sea of danger. If something goes terribly wrong, the Whale would be there to save the Cat again. My mother, and most people's parents, was that source of comfort, and it's thanks to her that I am alive today, simply by virtue of being her child. She followed my boat as I sailed through the troubled waters of divorced parents, being moved as a child to a country whose language I did not speak, and through any other challenges in my life.\n\n&gt;I have spent the past 2 years guilting myself since I found her dead. With a better son, she would still be alive -despite the fact that I had already stopped 2 of her attempts and was the only thing left giving her joy in life-. And while that may be partly true simply due to the butterfly effect, for the most part, I have to accept that the external circumstances (bipolar disorder &amp; suicidal / a beached whale in the middle of the forest) were far too overwhelming. \n\nIf I watched \"Flow\" and could \"forgive\" the Cat for not being able to save the Whale, then I have to forgive myself for not being able to save my mom.",

Examples:\n\n- **A Real Pain**: after tour guide James is saying a heartfelt thank you and goodbye to Benji and just turns and nonchalantly and flatly tells David thanks. James' actor has said that that was just meant to be funny and even Jess Eisenberg originally though the take was \"ruined\" but ended up loving it and using it.\n\n- **Leon the Professional**: Gary Oldman dramatically yelling \"EVERYONE!\" was one of a couple takes that he intentionally was overdoing to make Luc Besson laugh. Turns out he liked it enough to use it in the final film.\n\n- **Severance**: TV obviously, but in the most recent episode when Mr. Milchick delivers a letter to a character and then abruptly sprints away, Tramell Tilman has said he just did that to be funny and didn't think it would be used.\n\nWhat are some more famous or interesting examples?\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**: To emphasize, I'm not necessarily interested in \"just\" improvised scenes/lines here, but specifically a delivery or take where the actor themselves thinks it's ridiculous or a joke or unusable that I'm interested in.",

Hijinks ensue and eventually we meet the evil \u2018Fabrication Machine,\u2019 an evil machine that was corrupted by the warmongering government, resulting in it building murder machines that eventually turned on humanity and led to the lifeless wasteland the movie takes place in.   \n    \r\nThe evil Fabrication Machine obtains the soul transfer Talisman, and begins hunting down the sack puppets, eventually sucking the souls out of 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 into itself.   \n    \r\nFor the grand finale, 9 gets the Talisman back from the Fabrication Machine, and suddenly the Talisman that has up until now only ever been a soul transference device, becomes a Deus Ex Machina laser that goes pew pew pew and kills the Machine, freeing the souls of the sack puppets (but not reviving them.) Ultimately this ending leaves just 3, 4, 7 and 9 to a bleak future, just the four of them in the endless expanse of a ruined world.   \n   \r\nNow, what is the Chekhov\u2019s information I want to moan about? Throughout the movie we learn the following:   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist from the beginning is the one who created the Fabrication Machine, he was a good man who built the machine to build and create for peace.  \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Fabrication Machine is corrupted by the government, but the Scientist specifically says that: \u201cMy creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul\u201d.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist with his benevolent soul, has transferred his soul into the 9 sack puppets. \u201cYou are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul.\u201d.  \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Fabrication Machine could easily destroy the sack puppets physically, but seems to go out of its way to specifically absorb their souls using the talisman. Note that the machine already has a specific slot/port on it to use the talisman presumably designed and installed by the Scientist.    \n    \r\nSo what ending did I see being built up with this information? Lets review:    \n     \r\n\u2022\tThe machine is designed to create, it just chooses to create death. It still could create life, at least artificial life, should it have a change of heart.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe machine is evil specifically because it lacks a soul, however the Scientist included a way for it to absorb souls, since it already has a port for the Talisman. This implies the Scientist already had the Talisman and soul transfer technology before building the Fabrication Machine.   \n\r\n\u2022\tThe Scientist transferred his \u2018good soul\u2019 into 9 sack puppets. The Machine hunts down the Talisman and sack puppets, prioritising absorbing their segments of soul over physically destroying them.   \n\r\n\u2022\tDid the scientist plan this all along? Was the machine always meant to have a soul, but the government stopped him? Was releasing his soul into the wasteland in the form of sack puppets a desperate attempt at self-preservation, or a last ditch effort to provide his corrupted creation with the soul it both needs and craves to fulfil its original benevolent purpose?      \n     \r\nSo, what happens if the machine captures all 9 puppets? It\u2019ll have a complete soul, the one thing it needed to not be a dick. Maybe it can find and help any remaining humans, or just create a new world of its own creations?    \n     \r\nA lot of this information was dumped on the main character, 9, right at the end, just before he laser blasts the machine. However, the end I saw coming, and was really excited about, was the idea that 9 would have to convince or trick the remaining sack puppets to sacrifice themselves to the Fabrication Machine, allowing the Scientist\u2019s soul to reform the machine and start rebuilding the world.     \n     \r\nPros of my ending:    \nInteresting, dramatic, unexpected. Something different from the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after. In my opinion the original ending is actually pretty bleak, yeah they defeated the BBEG but there\u2019s nothing left of the world, just the four remaining sack puppets, two of which are mute with childlike personalities. The original ending doesn\u2019t set up any kind of post-movie goals or motivation for the remaining sack puppets, they don\u2019t even need to eat or drink. Do the characters plan to just sit in a ruined building somewhere and twiddle their thumbs?    \n     \r\nCons of my ending:    \nIt\u2019s heavily implied that the Scientist was the last human, there isn\u2019t really any world for the Fabrication Machine to rebuild once it turns good. Maybe there are survivors or untouched countries beyond the setting of the movie? The Scientists plan of just releasing his soul through sock puppets and just hoping that his machine eventually hunts them all down is a bit convoluted, could he not just find the machine himself?    \n      \r\nIt\u2019s noted on: https://nine.fandom.com/wiki/Deleted_Scenes - Trivia.    \n      \r\n\u201cAt some point during the preproduction, they had an adaptation where 9's soul actually gets sucked into the Fabrication Machine, and meets its soul to discover that the Machine was really \"0\".\u201d.  \n    \r\nWhich hints at a similar concept, but implies the Scientist put the evil part of his soul into the Machine?\r\n",

        "title": "The Monkey &amp; the generational curse of your father's unresolved issues",
        "content": "Just saw The Monkey last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! As always after seeing a movie I came to reddit to read a bunch of discussion threads and see what folks are saying. Lots of people talked about enjoying the campy kills and dialogue. Turning into pink mist from being electrocuted but your leg somehow flies off and smacks Theo James? \"It is what it is...the word of our Lord.\" Good stuff! What I haven't seen as much talk about is the meaning of the film. Maybe it's been posted about already and I just haven't seen it, but I got the impression some viewers were unhappy with the lack of lore for the monkey-demon itself. I thought there was a clear and neatly-resolved message inside the delightfully silly package so I thought I'd add my two cents review.\n\nTo me the monkey represents the emotional burden of men, especially fathers\\*, who repress their traumas, become stunted, and end up hurting those around them. The film shows us this harm to others on two parallel levels: the realistically fucked up relationship of an emotionally distant dad and his son, and the fantastically gruesome harm perpetrated by the monkey.\n\n\\*Of course the message works for anyone but I think fatherhood and masculinity is the most explicit. All four characters involved in the struggle over the monkey are men with dad issues. The main antagonistic relationships are dad-son, brother-brother, dad-step dad. Elijah Wood's foil to the main character is literally a \"fatherhood expert.\"\n\nHal and Bill both become a type of man in this vein: Hal emotionally repressed and distant, Bill physically violent. In real life a man like Bill wouldn't need magic monkey powers to kill people over his emotions. Family violence is a common tragedy, and at least in part this is because a patriarchal society demands men repress their emotions and become islands unto themselves (\"she was my mom too\" \"I never thought of it that way\"). The monkey kills people around the brothers because there is an evil generational curse on them, but it's only a magic one for film reasons. The real generational curse is that emotionally unavailable fathers wreak havoc on people, especially their sons.\n\nThe movie resolves when the brothers open up to each other and Hal confronts death (literally) along with his feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. By doing this in front of his son he's choosing to deal with his emotions in a healthy way and end the vicious cycle. Likewise about the monkey he says they have to \"recognize that it's ours and keep it close\" so it can do further harm. The evil bastard monkey was the emotions we repressed all along!\n\nFor me it was exactly what I wanted it to be: enjoyably campy and dumb in the best way, but with an actual message buried in the tomfoolery. Watching it with this in mind made me enjoy the movie more and also made the ending feel quite satisfying.\n\n4/5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

It's not about the ratings or notable actors, but just the concept.\n\nThat's how I stumbled upon The Endless(2017), which remains one of the most bizarre but also genuinely intriguing movies I've ever seen. I knew nothing about it prior to watching, read no reviews or opinions, and now I can totally recommend it to anyone interested.\n\nAnd if you indeed are curious, it's a relatively slow and atmospheric horror that touches upon the topic of cults, the people involved in them, and those who manage to get out.\n\nAnyway, what about you? What are some movies that you found by accident that turned out to be good/interesting/thought-provoking?\n\n\n\n",

I didn't read any relevant introductions in advance, but I roughly knew that it was a film themed around \"law and justice.\" When I got to the cinema and started watching, I realized that it was actually a stage play, and what's more, it was a one-person show with a dense flow of lines. I was truly in awe of Jodie Comer's acting skills. At first, I was wondering why there was no scene change and why there were no other lawyers. It wasn't until more than 30 minutes later that I realized it was a one-person show. However! She was so deeply immersed in her performance, and I began to get into the rhythm of her lines. I think the most ingenious part was when she, originally a \"litigation lawyer,\" went to the court to face cross-examination. The transformation of her character signified the shift and questioning of her thoughts about the judicial system. Of course, the content itself also reminded me of Ito Shiori's \"The Black Box.\" For cases like this, there is still a long way to go for the judicial evaluation system and procedures. But I really want to cheer for the actress! I also really wish I could watch it again on the live stage!  ",
