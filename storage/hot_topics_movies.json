        "content": "I was watching a movie last night and for what feels like the 50th time I encountered an overused joke that didn't get any reaction from me.\n\nThe set up for the joke was that a character was using their voice activated GPS and they were trying to input their destination.\n\nThen the \"joke\" started. The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said \"do you want to go to burger king?\"\n\n\"No Burbank\"\n\n\"Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?\"\n\n\"No Burbank!\" \n\n\"Destination set for baja mexico\"\n\nWow, so funny/s. I've seen this joke so many times but it just doesn't do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it's been so overused by this point that it's overstayed it's welcome.\n\nAre there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?",

        "content": "So, last night I made a joke to my brother that I was gonna get high and watch some foreign lesbian love story. Then I did precisely that - 3 grams of edibles later and I rented \"Portrait of a lady on Fire\"\n\nThe movie had good reviews, and I'm still treating it like a joke at first. It's about 5-10 minutes into the film I realized every assumption I MAY have had about the movie was far, far off. and any notions of it being like a joke turned into a joke themselves.\n\nThe shots of the movie were\u00a0**so utterly beautiful it sometimes felt like I didn't even have the right to look at the screen.**\u00a0The\u00a0**characters were so utterly realistic it sometimes felt like I was genuinely invading their privacy simply by watching them.**\u00a0I related to them. I liked them. It is the only film I have seen where\u00a0**the cinematography was so good it provided a theater-like experience at home.**\n\nMy point is, I went into a movie expected a joke, and instead got a masterpiece every film student in creation should analyze thoroughly.\n\n**By the end, I was left thinking \"Jesus, that was so, so much better than it had any right to be.\"**\n\nWhat movie was this for you?",

        "content": "Nothing is worse than being fully invested in a movie, only for the ending to completely drop the ball. Maybe it was a lazy twist, an unresolved plot, or something so ridiculous it made you question why you watched the whole thing.\n\nFor me, *I Am Legend* had me right up until that *wildly different* ending compared to the book. It felt like they threw out all the buildup for a generic Hollywood conclusion.\n\nAlso, *The Mist*\u2014an incredible, gut-punch ending, but still one that made me sit there in stunned disbelief.\n\nWhat\u2019s a movie where the ending ruined the whole experience for you?\n\n  \nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented, now I have a metric ton of films to track down and watch, even if they're bad, I do love twist endings, they help me write better.",
