        "title": "Benny Safdie's 'The Smashing Machine' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*MMA fighter Mark Kerr reaches the peak of his career but faces personal hardships.*\n\nCast: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_smashing_machine_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [79/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-smashing-machine/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Geoffrey Macnab](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-b2817883.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;This, though, is a story in which winning finally begins to seem very hollow. The real way Safdie puts a chokehold on his audience is by examining Mark and Dawn\u2019s physical and emotional weaknesses in such forensic detail. The Smashing Machine may not provide the pay-offs that audiences expect from more conventional sports movies, but this is the most raw and vulnerable that Johnson has ever been on screen. Once you\u2019ve seen him this exposed, you won\u2019t watch his typical action movie stunts in quite the same way ever again.\n\n[Daily Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a classical fight movie that innovates subtly. Maceo Bishop\u2019s nimble photography has the sweat and grit of a vintage muscle flick from the Pumping Iron era, but the score by the experimental jazz composer Nala Sinephro is all swirling harps and breathy saxophones; arguably no piece of music has ever sounded less like a punch in the face. Yet as an accompaniment to Kerr\u2019s battles in and out of the ring, it\u2019s oddly perfect, giving this tough story an unexpectedly sweet and even spiritual edge. Smashing stuff has rarely been such smashing stuff.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Cody Dericks](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-smashing-machine/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Dwayne Johnson delivers the best performance of his career as the amiable but troubled UFC champion Mark Kerr. Emily Blunt and Ryan Bader are also excellent in their roles. The screenplay is repetitive and frustrating. Blunt's character is so unlikeable and written with such vitriol that it becomes exhausting to watch her, although Blunt's performance is as good as it could possibly be.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-1236503546/)\n\n&gt;Johnson, shifting his whole aspect (he seems like a new actor), invests that silent, moody, hidden side of Mark with a quality of mystery. He gives an extraordinary performance, playing Mark Kerr as a gentle giant with demons that will not speak their name, yet the audience can feel them there; we want to see those demons healed. You might think the key word in the movie\u2019s title is \u201csmashing,\u201d but it\u2019s actually \u201cmachine.\u201d Mark is a man who reins in his violence by having constructed his entire self \u2014 body and personality \u2014\u00a0as a controlled engine of demolition. The movie is about how this man-machine becomes a human being.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Jordan Mintzer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-delivers-the-blows-as-a-tormented-fighter-in-benny-safdies-gritty-and-downbeat-mma-flick-1236358361/)\n\n&gt;Johnson has rarely played a loser, but he\u2019s always been likable, displaying a massive grin to match his massive pecs in action vehicles that never allowed him to showcase much range. He manages to go deep here without overdoing it, killing the audience with kindness as a benign warrior who suffers from one scene to the next, triumphing briefly in the ring before succumbing to addiction and/or romantic grief. Like Mickey Rourke in *The Wrestler* \u2014 a film from which Safdie seems to take a few cues \u2014 the actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-smashing-machine-review-1235148509/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;Johnson\u2019s performance is out-and-out wonderful, a beady-eyed fusion of body and spirit that osmoses Safdie\u2019s sensibility to deliver what can\u2019t be disputed as the most layered work of the actor\u2019s career. A vividly contradictory Blunt, funny and sad especially in articulating Dawn\u2019s conflicted response to Mark\u2019s post-rehab emotional about-face during a tense argument, is equally sensational.\n\n[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \\- [Damon Wise](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/damon-wise)\n\n&gt;Dwayne Johnson owns the whole thing with his truly remarkable work as fighter Mark Kerr, disappearing so fully underneath Kazu Hiru\u2019s astonishing prosthetics that the opening of the film, presented as contemporary footage from an event in Sao Paulo 1997, looks genuinely like the real thing. It\u2019s that rare beast, a biopic that\u2019s light on the bio and resistant to being a pic. It\u2019s a film about a human being, and its effect is strangely haunting, since Dwayne Johnson seems to do everything while doing nothing.",

        "content": "It\u2019s 2AM, I can\u2019t sleep and I need some fodder on the screen to put me to bed. Picking \u2018The Mighty Ducks\u2019 was the wrong movie but in watching it, it has really made me realize how much the world has changed since 1992.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s a work of exaggerated fiction. Even in 1992, no law firm is giving a pee wee hockey team $15k to buy equipment, there weren\u2019t publicly broadcast televised pee wee tournaments with commentators, analysts and a full stadium audience, coaches aren\u2019t telling 10 year olds that if they don\u2019t make the game winning shot, not only are they letting their coach down but they are letting their team and their dead dad down and finally, the dialogue is way too clever and quippy for a bunch of 10 year old kids.\n\nGreat, we got that out of the way. But the movie unintentionally captures a vibe in the 90s that has since disappeared. They shot it earnestly and now it\u2019s a time capsule for that time. The kids are out hanging out with each other, the cities are lively, people communicate in the wild. The kids have this sense of adventure that I recall in my childhood but don\u2019t see in kids today. They are generally just out in the world without parental supervision, and that\u2019s *okay*. Shit, the notion of a grown man trying to teach kids hockey didn\u2019t come with the default assumption of grooming and pedophilia. \n\nIt\u2019s just wild how different things are today. I was a teenager in the 90s and again, yes the film exaggerates but the details they showcase in how we freely communicated back then and how people didn\u2019t jump to the worst conclusions of each other, is just wildly different.\n\nFinally, this is a little off topic, but this movie was rated PG yet it gets away with so much stuff and definitely isn\u2019t just a kids movie, as we know them today. The kids are looking at dirty magazines, they make light hearted race jokes like calling the 2 black kids and one white kid \u201cOreos\u201d, Gordon Bombay verbally rips the kids apart and straight up tells them they \u201csuck\u201d. I just can\u2019t imagine a PG movie today having any of these vibes.\n\nI really encourage giving the film a shot. I haven\u2019t seen it since I was probably 10 years old myself. No it is not high art and it won\u2019t blow your socks off. But if you recognize that the days we live in today are just\u2026so\u2026bland, I think you\u2019ll have a good time with this unintentional time capsule of a film.",

        "content": "Recently i saw Vampires by John Carpenter, i adore the director but the movie had tons of problems and the biggest one was how deeply unlikeable the two leads were.\n\nJames Woods was just offputting at every second, beating a priest that was his ally and overall being sleazy as fuck and having a really questiinable sense of humor... Daniel Baldwin was worse somehow, an actually uncomfortable presence- he kept beating a woman that was turning into a vampire, at one moment when he tied her to the bed he stripped her of her clothes for some reason. He came across as someone who never had consensual sex with a woman, worse of all is the two ended together at the end of the movie.\n\nBoth literally ruined any enjoyment i might gotten from this movie.",

Guy's a complete scumbag ffs. Not to mention keeping all the world changing tech secrets to himself lol \n\nAnd i swear this guy isnt just simply \"absent minded\"... Hes such a genius yet cant tell time properly and misses the first wedding, whilst not realizing hes been lecturing a life drawing class for a full 5 minutes, nor that he was at a rehearsal dinner for his own wedding just the night before, is utterly bonkers!! \n\nI mean theres ditzy and scatterbrained, and then theres just full blown dementia! \ud83e\udd26\n\nDear god this has spoiled my memories of this flick BIG TIME! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nDid I miss anything?

        "title": "I hiked to where Lone Survivor (2013) was filmed",
        "content": "[Album](https://imgur.com/a/5ZgCmFO)\n\n**Why?:** Lone Survivor (2013) is one of my all-time favorite war movies, factual inaccuracies aside. I\u2019ve always appreciated Peter Berg\u2019s attention to detail with the rifles and gear and the beautiful scenery of the mountains. Once I learned that the film was shot on location in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico, I had to go see the site in person.\n\n**Finding the Site:** The behind the scenes footage from the Blu-Ray special features established the crew filmed at Ski Santa Fe, but I used Google Earth to narrow down the precise filming locations. [Using this large boulder for reference](https://imgur.com/yePWGEv) I was able to determine one scene was filmed at 35\u00b047'35\"N 105\u00b046'47\"W, elevation 11,658ft (3,553m). [Here is the same boulder from the other direction](https://imgur.com/QIEf0S4). For comparison, [here is the same location in person](https://imgur.com/ONLXKZA). Once there, [I found several crimp-nosed 5.56 blank cartridges cases](https://imgur.com/KYRRRrA).\n\n**The Hike:** Luckily, this area is located in the Santa Fe National Forest and is publicly accessible. The elevation at the parking lot is 10,295ft (3,138m) and the hike from there is about 1.4 miles (2.3km). Expect very steep slopes as this is a ski area after all. The most direct route was blocked off for construction when we visited, but we managed to find our own way. Regardless, this was the most physically difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done. Why?\n\n**The Loadout:** I have something of a hyper fixation on the loadouts in this film, so I wanted to recreate them as authentically as possible. Feel free to skip this section if you do not share the same type of autism.\n\n&gt;![This blog](https://atrg836615659.wordpress.com/2019/04/18/anatomy-of-a-lone-survivor-loadout/) has an extensive breakdown of all 4 kits in the film and is a great resource. Overall, I did not clone a specific kit but rather borrowed elements of both Luttrell and Axelson\u2019s kits.!&lt;\n\n&gt;![Supplementary photos](https://imgur.com/a/fwzRg6V)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!**Apparel \u2013** USGI M83 BDU blouse that I raid modded. Added a subdued-tone Texas flag patch to the right arm and a two US ODG US flags to the left arm, one IR visible. Propper BDU khaki trousers. Merrell Moab 3 hiking boots. Green &amp; black shemagh. USGI khaki boonie hat. Mechanix woodland gloves (unfortunately not the black woodland ones as seen on screen)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!**Equipment -** Eagle Industries Rhodesian Recon Vest, khaki (the filmmakers cut costs by using Pantac instead, likely why their equipment appears a tan shade). 5x Eagle Industries double M4 mag pouches. 10x 30rd ar15 magazines fully loaded. 2x Eagle Industries pistol magazine pouches. 2x P226 magazines. 2x Eagle Industries frag pouches. Eagle Industries MBITR radio pouch (unfortunately no radio). Eagle Industries admin pouch with another Texas patch. Eagle Industries horizontal utility pouch. CAT tourniquet rubber banded to the right shoulder strap. Cold Steel SRK-C, the sheath spray painted desert tan (in the film they used SOG Seal Pup knives). 10x12 RMA Level IV ceramic plate (I\u2019m aware none of the Seals wore plates, but I imagine they regretted that). 2x kevlar inserts from groin protectors (pro tip, you can slide these into the lining of the vest to act as additional fragmentation protection). Safariland 6004-77 drop leg holster. W. German Sig Sauer P226 (in the film they used M9s, but the MK25 would have been more authentic). Kelty Map 3500 backpack with some camo netting strapped to the bottom. Pro-Tec skate helmet with rachet NVG mount. I spray painted the helmet in the pattern of the flag of Texas but in ODG, desert tan, and earth brown (the film anachronistically used Ops core helmets iirc)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!**Rifle -** [MK12 Mod 1 cLoNe](https://imgur.com/E7Tnm8N)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!DS Arms MK12 Mod 1 upper. Allen Engineering AEM5 suppressor. H&amp;R M16A1 lower. KAC 98474 rear sight. KAC 99051 front sight. KAC 98060 bipod adapter. P&amp;S broomstick foregrip. PRI M84 gasbuster charging handle. Harris bipod with KWM Pod Loc. Larue MBT-2S. Ergo pistol grip. B5 Sopmod Government stock!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This stuff is all pretty straightforward for a MK12 Mod 1 build, but I decided to go a different route with the optic. The Leupold MR/T 2.5-8x36 scope and ARMS #22 scope rings are outclassed by modern options. To imitate their appearance without sacrificing quality and functionality (and my wallet), I militarized a civilian Leupold VX-R 2-7x33 scope. I added Kenton turrets, Butler Creek scope caps, MK Machining throw lever, and Larue LT123 scope rings. A little less magnification and a basic duplex reticle, but it\u2019s still quite functional for how little it cost.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I spray painted the rifle with Majic camouflage desert tan and earth brown. I highly recommend this paint. To better balance the front-heavy 12lb rifle, I added two 7oz steel rods to the battery compartment of the B5 sopmod.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!**Notable missing items-** Adventure Lights VIP IR strobe (lost the eBay auction) PEQ 2a IR designator (I don\u2019t even have nods yet) PRC-148 radio, Davies TEA PTT, and Invisio M3 earpiece (Too much money for outdated comms) M67 frag grenades (thanks NFA)!&lt;\n\n**TL;DR: 65lb of gear + 12.4lb rifle and I live at sea level.**\n\nDespite training with the vest at the gym, I was woefully unprepared for the altitude. I was gasping for air every 50 feet or so exacerbated by the vest constricting the expansion of my lungs. I drank 3.5 liters of water on the way up. On the way down, my legs actually trembled with each step. Word of caution, walking downhill in the vest also blocks your line of sight to your footing so you cannot watch where you step.\n\n**Bonus:** On the way up to the boulder, we stumbled upon another filming location.[Pictured here](https://imgur.com/UkFB3we) is the behind the scenes notes from the location scout. Note that the cliff on the right, where Murphy makes the call, was added in post-production. [Here is the same area in person.](https://imgur.com/rZ2uHtD) The pictures really don\u2019t do the verticality justice, I cannot believe they filmed out here.\n\nTL;DR: I hiked to where Lone Survivor (2013) was filmed, wearing full kit. Beautiful hike, definitely recommend.",

        "content": "What\u2019re some things that annoy you personally the most about film criticism/discussion these days?\n\nThere are a few things but the main one I miss is general nuance. It either has to be a 10/10 movie or it\u2019s terrible. There\u2019s no acknowledging of good things in bad movies (which sometimes isn\u2019t easy to find so sometimes there is just nothing redeeming about it) or criticisms for good movies. It\u2019s always \u201cwell is it a fresh or rotten review?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rating?\u201d \u201cSum up your thoughts in a sentence\u201d, \u201cmovie good or movie bad\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m also sick of the \u201cwell you didn\u2019t agree with me on a movie therefore I can\u2019t listen to your opinions about anything\u201d. It\u2019s. Subjective. Someone not reacting the same way as you doesn\u2019t mean their opinion is invalid. \n\nOr the whole \u201cthey just hate fun\u201d argument. Or \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just enjoy it??! It\u2019s not that deep!\u201d I don\u2019t go into every movie thinking I\u2019m going to hate it. I do give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSure some opinions can be pretentious. Hell - I\u2019ve been in that boat where I question someone\u2019s tastes because they\u2019ll say something isn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d. And I did not handle those conversations well. But now I don\u2019t try to make them think they\u2019re wrong for an opinion. I try to ask what worked for them or what didn\u2019t. Sometimes they\u2019ll give me a boring answer like \u201cI was just entertained\u201d but sometimes they\u2019ll throw a point that I may not agree with but can understand. \n\nThere are people who are genuinely nuanced in their approach to talking about movies. But good grief it\u2019s not what it once was. I don\u2019t want to sound like that old guy by saying that given that I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s but it has gotten worse in the last decade. ",

        "content": "My wife and I did a bit of a biopic marathon this weekend. We watched Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Walk the Line, and Straight Outta Compton. Each was released approximately 30-40 years after the singer/band was at their most popular. It got me thinking about which current artists will inevitably have an Oscar-bait biopic in the next 3-4 decades. \n\n I landed on Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Eminem. Taylor Swift because she\u2019s Ari ably the biggest pop star right now and doesn\u2019t show any signs of not continuing to dominate music, at least in the eyes of her very loyal fans. And she has had a complex dating history which will make nice story beats in a bio pic. Justin Bieber because he\u2019s had quite the fall after rising very rapidly at a young age and because of his proximity to some nefarious  actors in music\u2019s history. And Eminem because he\u2019s such a polarizing yet popular figure with his own substance abuse and mental health struggles; that Oscar writes itself lol. And I know we had kind of a biopic on him already with Eight Mile, but he\u2019ll inevitably get a proper biopic.\n\nWhat current artists do you see getting a biopic in the next 30-40 years?
