        "content": "TL;DR - What films feel like a panic attack, or pure anxiety, or that you might have a heart attack from the tension?\n\nThe only two films I immediately think of offhand are the frenetic and chaotic energy of both Uncut Gems and Beau is Afraid.\n\nUncut Gems is just pure tension, and I remember at the time a lot of older folks didn't like it or couldn't handle it, and didn't really understand it. That fascinates me. Also, that's art! It isn't supposed to comfort you.\n\nBeau is Afraid is a masterpiece (Also, Eddington is so relevant and if you liked No Country, check it out in context of modern politics and that we no longer have a shared reality).\n\nBut Beau makes people with panic attacks feel \"seen\". It's an unreal Odyssey. Also one of my favorite films ever.\n\nSo, apparently I like that chaos and tension. I think it's also why I like horror: it's a way to parse my own anxiety, channel it, and realize that life could always be worse. LOL\n\nWhat other films feel like a panic attack, or pure anxiety, or that you might have a heart attack from the tension?",
