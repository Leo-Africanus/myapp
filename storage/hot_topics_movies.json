Ask me anything, please and thank you.\n\nSOVEREIGN is out now.\n\nIn this tense and provocative true-crime thriller inspired by true events, a father and son who identify as \"sovereign citizens\" follow a belief system deeply rooted in distrust of government authority. The pair's view turns deadly after a police confrontation, setting off a tragic chain of events that forces a reckoning with power, principle, and the limits of freedom.\\]\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_T4JHPowGbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T4JHPowGbg)\n\nAsk me anything, reddit.

        "content": "Mine is Chef (2014) by Jon Favreau. I don\u2019t know what it is about that movie, but I can rewatch it endlessly. The pacing, the food shots, the music, it\u2019s all just warm. I think part of it is the whole journey of reinvention. A guy loses everything and ends up finding peace by going back to the basics, cooking out of a food truck with his kid. It always hits in the right way.\n\nAfter watching it once, I got irrationally inspired and went on a cooking spree. I started trying to make Cuban sandwiches and even attempted to recreate the grilled cheese scene. Yes, I burned the first one. I remember ordering a tiny sandwich press from this random store on Alibaba because I couldn\u2019t find the same style locally. It took like 3 weeks to arrive, but it was totally worth it. It actually worked really well and now it lives permanently on my kitchen counter.\n\nWhat I love is how Chef isn\u2019t flashy. It doesn\u2019t rely on over-the-top drama or weird plot twists. It\u2019s just... good vibes. It feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket after a bad day.\n\nI feel like everyone has their own version of that movie or show. It might not be technically perfect, but for some reason, it just gets you. It becomes your go-to when you\u2019re tired, sad, overwhelmed, or just need background noise while folding laundry.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your comfort movie or show? And do you have any weird routines or things you do when you watch it, like needing a specific snack or sitting in a specific chair? I swear, half the comfort is in the ritual.",

        "content": "One that immediately leaps to mind is The Shining. Stephen King has always been very outspoken of his disdain for Kubrick's adaptation, and it later led to the 1997 mini-series which was a more faithful adaptation. Another is I Know What You Did Last Summer, with Lois Duncan also being vocal with hating the film and how it took the premise of the novel and made it into a Slasher film. If I'm not mistaken, Clive Barker wasn't fond of the film version of Rawhead Rex and his disappointment with it was a big factor in him directing the original Hellraiser film.",
