        "title": "Rewatching 'Seven' yesterday really made me realize how weak 'Longlegs' was",
        "content": "They did a re-release of Seven in IMAX this past weekend, and even though it's not the most obvious contender for the format, I was able to go with my subscription, having only seen it on TV previously, and goddamn did it hold up.\n\nThe sound design, especially the music used in the opening titles, felt so grimy and real. The way the story unfolds as it slowly creeps towards an inevitable conclusion, even going so far as to have Somerset say \"you know this isn't gonna have a happy ending.\"\n\nThere were a lot of details I picked up with seeing it at that scale; one moment that stood out to me is when they have dinner together, the moment Somerset sees Tracy, there's this momentary darting-of-the-eyes that almost looks like a brief moment of recognition of what's to come, or at least a grizzled detective who's seen enough to know that a young detective with a beautiful wife investigating a vicious serial killer isn't going to end well, and that there's a reason the people who end up in that field for so long generally don't have anyone that immediately close to them.\n\nCompared to last year's *Longlegs*, which like many of you I was excited for based on the marketing - visually, it seemed creepy, the weird symbols, the grainy crime scene photos, the billboard with the phone number, it was all a brilliant way to get millions of people to watch something with a paper-thin story.\n\nThe biggest issue with the film is that it seems more intent on capturing the \"ambience\" and \"vibe\" of the genre, which it admittedly does well, but once you actually realize how thin the story is and how little there are to any of these characters, it begins to resemble the turkey from *Christmas Vacation* turning into dust.\n\nThere's a scene in *Seven* of the two detectives on the couch pouring over evidence; Mills says he's getting a second beer, and asks if Somerset wants one as well. Somerset says he'd prefer wine. Right away, this tells us not only did Mills start drinking first (which feels very in character), but that Somerset would prefer something slower, so as to not get too drunk while working. Mills proceeds to pour an absurd amount of wine into a tall, regular drinking glass, and only a minute later does Somerset pick up the glass, notice how full it is, and briefly look at it in befuddlement. Almost all of this exchange occurs visually.\n\nThere's more characterization in this scene than literally the entirely of *Longlegs*.\n\nA phrase I've heard used in comedy (but that I also think applies to many forms of storytelling) is, \"don't put a hat on a hat.\" Aka, the context I first heard it was in relation to writing a sketch for SNL that had Natalie Portman in it, where the initial setup was going to be something about a tutor teaching a student, and then halfway through they said \"wait what if she's also her character from Star Wars\", and then the whole thing fell apart. This kept ringing true the more *Longlegs* continued its descent into silly contrivances, with four separate plot elements that all feel as though they could've independently been the vessel for a story; the mother being forced to make a pact with the killer (which in itself is already absurd; the idea that maybe she would've turned a blind eye towards *one* as a way to save her daughter would've been interesting and slightly believable, but the idea that she ends up taking this gig for twenty years is laughably dumb).\n\nWe then proceed to learn the full extent of it, that the plan was for Longlegs to get the mother to delivery dolls to these families that had metal orbs in their heads that caused the families to go crazy and kill each other. It's like reheated Mike Flanagan gumbo. I was shocked at how not 'cool', smart or interesting this reveal felt in comparison to how sleek and Fincher-y the first hour of it felt. It's a cinematic Krabby Land.\n\nAnyways, I don't mean for this to just be another \"muh old is better\" as much as it is a hunger for more films with real characters that act and behave like real people, who do things unrelated to the plot while they're waiting for something, who occasionally sit down and talk about their lives, and who don't just feel like sterile vessels for the delivery of plot devices. Something as simple as the wine exchange is all it takes to turn a basic scene of exposition into something more flavorful and 'complete'.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I'm going for with this; I'm not simply saying \"X is better than Y\". Asking any film to live up to *Seven* would be impossible, I'm saying \"X feels lacking in a way that Y does not, here's one example of how Y does this correctly\".\n\nThe point of this was not to shit on *Longlegs* but to demonstrate how much a few very minor changes can turn what would be a boring exposition scene into something that gives us an entertaining insight into the differences between the two, which gives the experience a lot more meaning beyond just \"atmosphere\".",

Not because I want to be these women because I\u2019d rather die but they\u2019re so horribly mediocre and they\u2019re always being held up as paragons of virtue and some sort of measuring stick to humiliate me. Everything I do is so original and unique and I put so much of myself into it like my book and my record and it\u2019s only brought me heartache and pain and I don\u2019t think I can play the game to be accepted. I\u2019m too intelligent, I have too much pride.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s also footage from Truth or Dare Documentary where she laughed about her hair dresser having anal bleeding after being drugged, asked one of her dancer\u2019s to show her his penis on camera, and made fun of Kevin Costner. \n\nMadge is one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest narcissist and a true adaption could be the American Psycho of music biopics.\n",

Mark definitely never speaks that fast. \n\nI have enjoyed many of these biopic performances though. Notable ones for me are:\n\nMeryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher\nForest Whitaker as Idi Amin\nChristian Bale as Bob Dylan \n\nBut I am interested in knowing what biopics had actors who did a terrible job? \n\nFor me the worst one is Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs.

And even that doesn\u2019t come close to some of the wild feats of intelligence I\u2019ve seen untrained animals perform on YouTube. \n\nVery quickly, the movie reveals itself to take place in a fantasy world, the lore and rules of which are never explained. We see massive sculptures and bizarre land formations unlike anything on earth, but conspicuous by their absence is humanity. All around the animal characters, the residual pieces of some kind of magical society Are left empty to sink beneath the ever rising tide.\n\nEventually, we see an actual wild sequence of supernatural magic, and what appears to be one of the animal characters very literally ascending into heaven? Shortly thereafter, the water begins to lower; the two incidences seem connected but the correlation isn\u2019t clear. \n\nThe boat we see in the tree at the beginning let us know that the waters have risen before. But how and why any of this is happening appears totally opaque on first viewing. \n\nDoes anyone have any theories or ideas about how the world of flow came to be abandoned, what the rising tides mean, or what happened to the bird?

        "content": "I think the best example I've seen so far is the first John Wick. There was something special about the movie, wherein all the major bad guys (except for the brat kid) well and truly knew how fucked they were once they heard the name John Wick. There was no question that he was capable of single handedly bringing down their empire, which was alluded to be extremely powerful. The mob boss started grieving for his son before his death, that's how inevitable he felt it was. It also helps that the action was absolutely world class, the mechanisms of the underworld were just alluded to, rather than being explicitly spelt out, and John's past was a mystery to us.",

        "title": "The Reggie payoff in Bad Boys: Ride or Die is quite possibly the best use of a side character in a lega-sequel I've ever seen. Are there any other examples of this?",
        "content": "For context, Reggie was in one scene in Bad Boys II from 2002. He's a 15-year-old taking Martin Lawrence's daughter on a date. Literally one scene where Smith and Lawrence lay into him. He has no bearing on the plot, no arc, nothing. He's just a joke. They could've cut the scene and it wouldn't have taken much from the movie beyond a bit of length (it's 2.5 hours.) Bringing him back in Bad Boys For Life to marry Lawrence's daughter was a fun nod back to II given that 18 years had passed. It's a simple, easy callback, and I was happy they got that actor to come back for one scene. \n\nThen in Ride or Die, he gets a full on action scene that is one of the most fun, well-choreographed John Wick-esque sequences in the movie. But that's it. He doesn't join them in the final showdown, he's not brought into any other action. It's literally just an action showcase, and an epic payoff for anyone who's watched the franchise over the years. To add to that, I can only assume that it wouldn't have the same impact for anyone who doesn't have the nostalgia of watching that scene in Bad Boys II 22 years ago. ",

        "content": "Context:\n\nI was in my mid-teens when I saw Die Hard, for the first time, in the theaters. A natural film-lover, I was still pretty young and naive when it came to how movies go and could fall completely into the moment of films without cynically \"knowing\" how films work to create the audience experience. Nevertheless, I was a pretty astute kid and could spot bullshit a lot of the time when I saw it.\n\nSeeing Die Hard in the theater was probably the first time I had ever wondered if the protagonist in an action film might not make it out alive. I'd seen Star Wars, Raiders, Terminator, etc. And while all of those other films were thrilling, I never had the sense that the main good guy would fail/die. It didn't really matter because they were still fun to watch. But it wasn't until Die Hard that I actually wasn't able to assume John McClane was just going to make it no matter what.\n\nSpecifically, the scene where he digs a massive piece of glass out of his foot \u2013showing his physical vulnerability, followed immediately with the conversation with Al [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYkXeqVQXdk), I suddenly realized that he could conceivably be killed by the end. To be sure, I never questioned that the bad guys would not prevail, but would there be a heroic sacrifice? An inevitable decision he couldn't escape? Everything was on the table after that scene.\n\nThere haven't been many films I can say that about since then. Don't know if it's because I've gotten too jaded, know too much about how the movie business works, gotten better at picking up on clues in films or any kind of combination of factors. But I'll always cherish that memory of sitting in that theater as a teenager completely wrapped up in the moment of not knowing how it would turn out.\n\nPost note: Before anyone chimes in with \"how could you have ever questioned whether he would survive or not?!\" A. As I said, I was a teenager who didn't necessarily know that the heroes almost never die in action movies, B. Sometimes the hero actually *does* die in adventure movies (e.g. Charlton Heston and James Franciscus in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes, which I had seen previous to Die Hard), C. Bruce Willis was still looking for his big cinematic break to get him out of TV, so there was no guarantee his character couldn't be killed \u2013he just wasn't that kind of movie star at that point.",

        "title": "Physical comedy is often instantly associated with cheap humor, not because it\u2019s inherently cheap, but because it\u2019s significantly more difficult to create intelligent and subtle humor with Physical Comedy.",
        "content": "This scene from *Young Frankenstein (1974)* is a perfect example of why I think physical comedy is at its best when it\u2019s subtle, clever, and nuanced. What elevates the comedy of this scene into something much more intelligent is not the physicality itself, it\u2019s the way the characters interact with their environment and each other in a perfectly choreographed way. The humor comes from the precision and restraint, not just chaos. That\u2019s what makes it so brilliant. \n\nWhat are some other examples of physical comedy in film that are smart and creative, rather than cheap or overly slapstick? I\u2019d love to hear about moments where physical comedy added depth to the humor instead of just relying on surface-level laughs.\n\n\nAnd just to be clear, I don\u2019t think people believe it\u2019s just lowbrow humor, but it does seem like slapstick or cheap gags are often the first things that come to mind when you hear the term \u201cphysical comedy.\u201d Things like pratfalls, exaggerated movements, or over-the-top antics dominate the perception, and there\u2019s a very good reason why. \n\nIt\u2019s because it\u2019s far easier to make cheap humor from physical comedy because it relies on immediate and exaggerated visual cues that require very little thought to elicit laughter. That\u2019s the reason why 95% of the time, this is how we see Physical Comedy predominantly being used in film. Unfortunately, because of this, the term \u201cPhysical Comedy\u201d has become somewhat synonymous with lowbrow humor. \n\n\n",

And that is a solid commitment for a casual watcher to make.\n\n\nWhat I liked: \n\nAfter minute 55, the movie is friggin rivetting. I didnt want to stop it to get up to pee. \n\nThe acting is excellent. And I mean excellent. There was one point where I teared up a little. And another where I chuckled along with the characters just because it was just a good moment. The character building and relationship building is top notch.\n\nEven the small characters do well. If you dont watch westerns you forget that &gt;!anyone can die. and goodamn it characters drop like flies in this film.!&lt;  And that really sells a story to me.\n\nRussel Crowe. You forget how good of an actor he is.\n\nMusings: \n\n\nI fell asleep watching this movie back when it came out and I just kinda forgot about it. I've heard many people say its a good movie so its been on my list for a long time. Just took me around 18 years to get around to watching it. Oddly enough, I fell asleep watching it this time too. So I watched the rest of the movie today. And I'm happy to have watched it. I'm already excited to watch it again. \n\nThe good part is things makes sense at the end. There were a few things that bothered me after I watched it so I read up the reddit posts about the movie and that cleared it up for me. I watched the scenes redditors talked about and I found that, yeah, it all adds up. In a convincing way. \n\nIf you liked this movie, I will recommend you watch Appaloosa, if you havent already.",
