        "content": "After her death, it was revealed that Tanya Roberts had shaved like 6 or 7 years off her age.\n\nFor years, Katharine Hepburn claimed to be born in 1909. Turns out she was two years older than that. She was born in 1907. \n\nIt's also been long rumored that Donna Mills was born in 1938, not 1940.\n\nAnd remember when Jessica Chastain claimed to be born in 1981 but her former classmate, the deceased Mandisa, outed her as being 4 years older. She was born in 1977.",

        "content": "Okay so I love movies and would spend hours upon hours reading reviews and people's opinions about any and all movies, especially ones I have watched. But there always comes a time when there's a popular movie that everyone has seen, but you haven't. But you've actually read enough or heard enough from that movie to be able to discuss it when it pops up in conversation.\nFor me, the two most popular ones, and forgive me cause both have sequels and a great following, but I just can't get mysel to watch them.\nMission Impossible films and John Wick films......\nSo what's that one(or two) movie for you?",
