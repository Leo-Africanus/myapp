        "content": "Hi! I\u2019m Evan Ari Kelman, a filmmaker and writer. Barron\u2019s Cove is my feature debut, a new indie crime thriller starring Garrett Hedlund, Brittany Snow, Christian Convery, Ra\u00fal Castillo, Hamish Linklater, Tramell Tillman, and Stephen Lang. It\u2019s now in theaters and on VOD. \n\nFun fact: I first posted the script on r/Screenwriting , and the encouragement I got there helped push me to keep going and get it made. Barron\u2019s Cove is about the bond between fathers and sons, how it endures across time, and what it means to test that bond to its limits. At its heart, it\u2019s about confronting the limiting beliefs we place on ourselves, and discovering the strength to become something more, through love and legacy.

Mola Ram\u2019s terror when Indy starts cutting the rope is another great one. \n\nJust those looks of abject \u201cshit, I\u2019m not supposed to go down like this\u201d moments on a villain\u2019s face that makes the ending so much more satisfying. \n\nI find in action movies there\u2019s something really actually quite deflating and underwhelming about just killing the bad guy.

        "content": "For me its [Osmosis Jones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181739/). So many elements that makes this movie great and feels like it should have sequels. So much fun ideas rolled into innuendos and both visual and word puns, you know, fun for kids, fun for parents.\n\n**Potential 1:** Returning cast, same actor and actresses as before, or same voice actors, either in the same \"body/city\" of Frank, or maybe a transfer to another body. Maybe a new city/person with different problems, new cast of characters, but combined with familiar characters. Love to see Bill Murray making a comeback or maybe a cameo, Chris Rock's fun voicing, and so many other iconic voice actors.\n\n**Potential 2:** The world-building has been established, time to push some more buttons. Maybe a weird flu thing is going on, everyone is kinda coughing, oh god what year is this? Basically if you already introduce the world's rules, time to change or break them in the sequels.\n\n**Potential 3:** Modern animation is experiencing a renaissance of stylized beauty and finding uniqueness, not just like every other realistic disney 3d movie. Time for some experimental looks that combine 2D and 3D like in the original movie, but ramping the style up and doing more style and fun than just realism.\n\nBut in general I wish that more interesting things in animation styles and fun weird movies like [Innerspace ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093260/)to make a comeback. Half for nostalgia and half curious to see how old cool ideas splashed with modern visuals can be.\n\nAnyway, that's my wish for a sequel that will never be made other than in my head. What's yours?\n\nEdit: You guys are great, love reading the movie suggestions and comments.",

        "title": "Are you glad Netflix is reviving Guillermo Del Toro's projects?",
        "content": "Question, Are you glad Netflix is reviving Guillermo Del Toro's projects\n\nYou know I just realized something after watching Del Toro's Frankenstein teaser (Which I am anticipating). This is the second time Netflix has revived a Del Toro project that most people thought he wasn't going to make.\n\nLet me explain, the first time Netflix has revived a Del Toro Project was Pinocchio. Since, 2008 Del Toro had been trying to get his Pinocchio project off the ground and originally, The Jim Henson Company &amp; Pathe were helping him produce the film and at one point, Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Waits, and Christopher Walken were considered for roles. However the film went into development hell and in November of 2017, Del Toro stated that the film was dead and no studio wanted to finance it until in 2018, Netflix revived the project.\n\nNow, Frankenstein is the next film that Netflix has revived. I somewhat did a post on this but In 2014, Del Toro mentioned that making Frankenstein was one of his dream projects and that he was trying to get this made for at least a decade. Well in the 2010s, Del Toro almost got to made Frankenstein with the backing of Universal Pictures. From what I read, Del Toro wanted to make his Frankenstein a 2 part film due to the complexity of the novel. However, the film was cancelled in large part due to Universal decided to go with the Dark Universe route. Now, The film has now been revived at Netflix in large part due to Pinocchio's success.\n\nI find it interesting and exciting that Netflix has revived 2 projects that Del Toro has tried to make but failed with other studios. With Del Toro I have an analogy of throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks as with him he has multiples projects he wants to do but they never stick with studios so he goes to the one that sticks with the studio.\n\nUltimately, I am glad that Del Toro is doing these projects that we wanted to make for so long and I hope he &amp; Netflix revived further projects (Like At The Mountain Of Madness or The Left Hand Of Darkness or any other project Del Toro wanted to make).\n\nAll in All, Are you glad Netflix is reviving Guillermo Del Toro's projects",

The tragedy leads to the MLs self discovery is the best ending I could ever ask for. And the way he looks at Maggie, I am in awe! The film was not rushed, it's just the right amount of everything. Although Maggie was quite a red flag, I think she's only lookin for something genuine and sincere, especially the fact that he's in the medical field where emotions were disregarded. Overall, it gave me a good cry that I really need at the moment. Also, I cannot hear Iris by Goo Goo Dolls the same way again.\n\nThis is my first time posting here, but I really just can't contain the emotions that I currently have lol. (Also, I am quite aware Seth was kinda a creep during the first library scene haha)",

        "content": "I am a big movie buff but have had a bit a blind spot regarding Hitchcock.  I have seen the big ones of course (Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo, The Birds), but the bulk of his filmography I have been largely ignorant of.  I've started to rectify that by watching his movies from start to finish.\n\nI'm up to Lifeboat which I'm watching now.  What confuses me is Shadow of a Doubt.  One of the best critically and commercially.  Not to mention considered his best film by Hitchcock himself.\n\nMAJOR SPOILERS\n\nHere is my opinion of the movie.  It felt to me that uncle charlie tipped his hand and basically came right out and said that he was the murderer very early in the movie.  Therefore there was very little suspense for 3/4 or 2/3 of the movie because we already know that he's the bad guy.  Considering the name of the film I would have expected some actual doubt.  And then the last third of the movie he is straight up just trying to kill female Charlie.\n\nCan anyone explain this to me?  Am I just an ignorant millennial who didn't understand the nuance?\n\nEDIT: Also, was it just me, or were there some seriously weird sexual undertones to the charlies' banter in the first act?\n\nAnd then there's the 35 year old male detective proposing marriage to the 17/18 year old high school student after 2 days of knowing her. Although that's no fault against Hitchcock, that's simply endemic of movies of this time",
