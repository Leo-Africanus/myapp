        "content": "i recently watched 1997's galaxy quest. since i'm a star trek fan, my older relatives have been recommending that i watch this movie for quite some time. i've always heard that galaxy quest was ahead of it's time in it's portrayal of geek culture and i was reluctant when i heard that it was a satire of geek culture. when i hear the words \"satire of geek culture\", i imagine a work that portrays geeks as pathetic man children who take media way too seriously and need to get a life. sure, there's plenty of that in geek culture but that's a minority and not the rule.\n\nhowever, my curiosity finally peaked and i decided to give it a watch. and it's a very funny movie with a fascinating story(even if it is just the plot of three amigos but with a star trek expy). and, despite my fears, the film's portrayal of geek culture is one of my favorite aspects of the film.\n\nlike i said, the film is a satire of geek culture, specifically trekkies. and the film largely portrays geek culture very positively. the geeks in the film are passionate about galaxy quest and knowledgeable about the lore. and, in the end, it's both of those things that end up saving the day. the film also does take lighthearted jabs at geeks, such as mocking the social awkwardness of some nerds and the intense obsession that some of them have. however, as i watched the film, i got the vibe that the filmmakers were laughing WITH me and not AT me. of course, it also helps that i have a pretty thick skin when it comes to jokes at my expense.\n\nif you think about it, the film is less of a satire of geek culture and more of an affectionate parody that's more than willing to make fun of it but is also willing to acknowledge the good parts and that, at the end of the day, geek culture is a good thing.",

        "title": "Mississipi Burning (1988)",
        "content": "A thriller based on the real-life murder of Civil Rights activists in 1964 Mississipi. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play two FBI agents assigned to a missing persons case. They find themselves in a community terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan. Both agents fight for the truth while butting heads over different tactics to bring the Klan to justice. \n\nThis movie hits home at the moment. What really struck me is some of the language the more bigoted characters use to describe the murder of the activists, e.g. \"they shouldn't have been there in the first place\". Absolutely relevant to what is happening right now. Some of the messages of the movie can come across a bit heavy-handed, but it's necessary given the subject matter. Hackman delivers a knockout performance. Frances McDormand also stars. This film is a goldmine for character actor nerds, featuring R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, Kevin Dunn, Frankie Faison, and Brad Dourif, among others. ",

Great film, wonderful script, and the rest of the cast is fantastic. Im surprised I've never met anyone that's seen it.\n\nAnother one would be Robot Jox. Such a fun early 90s movie about the USSR and the U.S. fighting over territory with giant mechs. Crash and burn!",
