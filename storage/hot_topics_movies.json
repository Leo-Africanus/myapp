I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.\n\nDuring this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Ant-Man,\" and \"Prisoners,\" I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn't alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.\n\nFor an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like \"The Suicide Squad,\" \"Dune,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" or \"Late Night with the Devil,\" I just think about how deserved it is. I'm so happy he has had continued success. It is deserved!",

It\u2019s something really special when they are true classics.\n\nMy favorite example is Spielberg in 1993 with Jurassic Park and Schindler\u2019s List. Apparently the wild differences between the two process nearly drove him crazy. There are stories of George Lucas needing to oversee (at least some of) the visual effects after a certain point, Robin Williams calling Spielberg just to cheer him up and so on.\n\nBut the man delivered two *pillars* of filmmaking in a very short span. I know it\u2019s happened other times and would love to hear everyone weigh in!",

        "content": "For a while I figured I\u2019d just outgrown sci-fi. Everything felt like IP reboots, multiverse noise, or \u201celevated\u201d blockbusters with more explosions than ideas. But then I stumbled onto a string of smaller films that reminded me why I fell in love with the genre in the first place.\n\nIn the past few years we\u2019ve gotten:\n\nAfter Yang\n\nSwan Song\n\nArchive\n\nVesper\n\nAniara\n\nThe Creator\n\nJUNG_E\n\nOxygen\n\nCrimes of the Future\n\nThey\u2019re not perfect. Some are messy. Some are quiet. Some barely made a dent at the box office. But they\u2019re all sci-fi with something on its mind. There\u2019s films about memory, identity, biotech, AI, grief, climate, consciousness. Real ideas. Real questions.\n\nTurns out original sci-fi didn\u2019t disappear after all. it just left the franchise machine behind and kept doing its own thing. You just have to look a little harder for it.\n\nWhat did I miss? What else belongs on this list?",

The subtlety of lowering the platform, the banter, the callback for the rest of the movie with Gingie having 1 leg stitched on with icing (and the other missing)\u2026 all of it. And also - at the time - the milk pouring was a technological flex. \n\nWhat\u2019s your pick?",
