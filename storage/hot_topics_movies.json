        "content": "A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.\n\nI knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).\n\nNever in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.\n \nAnother thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.\n\nThe ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).\n\nThe only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.\n\nIn short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.\n\nHighly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",

        "content": "I just saw the movie \"The Lovely Bones\" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. \n\nI came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on \"paired with\" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl \"everyone dies\" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. \n\nI also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to \"everyone.\" The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. \n\nFurthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the \"cool grandma\" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a \"grown man\" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just \"live with it\" less than a year after the murder.\n\nIt's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.\n\nFinally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the \"weird looking, creepy stranger\" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.\n\nThis movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.",

        "content": "**The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lord_of_the_rings_the_war_of_the_rohirrim):\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/):\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-peter-jackson-company-attempt-return-183-years-earlier-tolkein-universe-japanese-anime-1236197887/):\n\n&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/):\n\n&gt;For those who can\u2019t get enough of Middle Earth, here\u2019s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm\u2019s Deep (where we saw Saruman\u2019s Orcs obliterated by Ents in \u201cThe Two Towers\u201d).\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/):\n\n&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore\u2019s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy\u00a0*The War of the Rohirrim*\u00a0on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).\n\nDirected by Kenji Kamiyama\n\n&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the\u00a0Peter Jackson's\u00a0*The Lord of the Rings*\u00a0film trilogy\u00a0(2001\u20132003),\u00a0*The War of the Rohirrim*\u00a0tells the story of\u00a0Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of\u00a0Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of\u00a0Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold\u00a0Helm's Deep.",

I'm very into War of the Worlds, I think it's one of the greatest concepts turned into a movie of all time. Found Footage movies like Project X are incredible at creating an atmosphere, so anything like that will be good too. Thanks!",

        "content": "In 2035, all of Ian Fleming's original James Bond 007 novels, will enter the public domain. This means that anyone can make projects about these original books, including film adaptations. We've already seen non-Eon Productions Bond films in the past with Casino Royale 1967, and Never Say Never Again, but this will be a whole different ball game. \n\nThere are of course restrictions, like studios not being able to use anything made up for the movies, like the iconic opening gun barrel sequence. \n\nBut what do you think? With Eon notoriously prioritizing other projects like Othello over the highly anticipated Bond 26, could it be a good thing that other studios will get a crack at Bond? Or will it dilute the brand and ruin everything they've been building up since 1962?",

This weekend I finished watching 'Us' and 'The Exorcist'...I felt incredibly idiotic knowing that I've potentially missed out on masterpiece films all these years. The #1 thing that gets me attracted to any film is a well written antagonist/villain who I can understand, relate to, or flat out despise. Who are some of your pics for best antagonists in the horror genre?",

        "content": "When I was a teen, I liked pretty much everything in my favorite genres and I enjoyed the highly rated movies from other genres. These days, I find that a lot of it is pretty \"meh\" for me. Last week I was catching up on a few movies that have been praised: I, Tonya, Everything Everywhere All at Once and Anatomy of a Fall. While I enjoyed them somewhat, I found none of them amazing. It rarely happens anymore that a movie amazes me. Everything feels a bit like I've seen it before. In fact, I get most enjoyment out of watching 90s movies, that feels like one big nostalgia trip for me.\n\nI wonder whether this is a normal process, that you end up liking the stuff you discovered as a kid best? Or maybe the introduction of streaming services has brought about a decline in movie quality?",
