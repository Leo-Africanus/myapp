Not that I want her to.)\n\n2) Great lines delivered exceptionally well and with perfect timing by Mr. CP.\n\n3) A fat dragon.\n\n4) Above average special effects, with the exception of one potato-throwing scene.\n\n5) Running joke about magic that echoes what I always think, but doesn\u2019t drag on past its usefulness.\n\n6) A complex plot that\u2019s clear enough not to feel complicated.\n\n7) An ending I should have seen coming but still made me cry. YES it\u2019s okay to cry over a fat dragon movie, although the fat dragon didn\u2019t make me cry and only featured in one of the quests.\n\nI look forward to all the comments agreeing with me.\n\n",

Directors like Jeremy Saulnier and the Safdie Brothers excel at. Recently The Order was interesting too.\n\nThanks in advance.",
