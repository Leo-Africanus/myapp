They advertised it as an action packed war movie and the trailer went so hard with Jesus Walks playing and that baddass shots of them marching with the smoke and fires in the background. Flash forward to being in the theater thinking I'm about to get a war movie but turns out there is no war. I hated it. Flash forward again to YEARS later when I gave it another chance as an adult only to see the genius of the movie. Just like the trailer, the actual war itself was advertised as a war with lots of action. My experience as a teenager going to see this movie paralleled the experience of Gyllenhaal's character. I really just wanted to point out how genius the marketing was and also give props for having the balls to do that. There was a lot of backlash for the movie cause we all expected action. I legit hated the movie so I'm sure it had a huge negative affect overall. But damn that \"marketing\" ties in with the theme so perfectly. It's something that is missed for anyone that watches now without experiencing the trailers and marketing for the movie. ",

        "content": "I know the general consensus is that \"the book is always better\". But do you have any examples of when a movie is actually better than what it is adapting? This can go for any adaptation, not just books. Plays, comics, games are in the mix as well.\n\nI personally think that Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of A Clockwork Orange far exceeds the original novel, but that's just me.",

        "content": "Most people find a nice, tight, well rounded movie as a positive thing. Most people would also agree that some movies meander and linger too long, even if it\u2019s an excellent movie, thus hurting your enjoyment of them. \n\nSo what is a movie that you absolutely loved, and once it ended you felt sadness because you would have been perfectly fine if it was a 12 hour long movie.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even have to be a perfect, award winning  movie per say. Like I feel that way about many of the Mission Imposible movies. \n\nI get so caught up in the practical effects and stunts, the jet setting and filming on location in beautiful locales and vibrant international cities. I love traveling and I love martial arts so for me the mission impossible movies are like documentaries with explosions and fighting that I could sit through all day. \n\n",

        "content": "So hello,  everyone I am not here to antagonize anyone or cause issues. I am curious to know if this movie is the worst of the reboot craze.  From where I am sitting it does a lot of harm to the source material and fails to uphold the legacy the film had. But my opinion isn't the only one so I often wondered what other people thought. I gave the film a shot a couple nights ago. Trying to see if it could match up to the original with Brandon Lee. \n\nMy answer is I don't think it does, but now that I am comparing it to other reboots/remakes. I am wondering if it might be the worst one made. Btw I adore the actors in this but bad scripts do nobody favors. Bill performed amazingly in It and Nosferatu.  So I am just putting this up as a discussion to see what everyone thinks.  ",

        "content": "So I started the trilogy in a weird order \u2014 watched Pearl first (loved it), then X (loved it even more), and finally MaXXXine\u2026 and honestly? I didn\u2019t even finish MaXXXine.\n\nPearl gave us this twisted, beautiful character study. X took that and elevated everything \u2014 style, horror, tension, characters, all of it. But MaXXXine? Felt completely disconnected. Barely any mention or meaningful continuation of Pearl\u2019s story, and her presence in the movie was basically non-existent. Just a few brief appearances that didn\u2019t really do anything.\n\nI was expecting something deeper \u2014 like tying it all together, or at least acknowledging Pearl more. Instead it went in a totally different direction and didn\u2019t land for me at all. I kept waiting for it to feel like a proper sequel or conclusion to what X and Pearl built, but it never did.\n\nAnyone else feel like MaXXXine just didn\u2019t belong in the same trilogy?",
