Inject the poison into her ***first*** while she\u2019s unconscious.\n\nInstead, they decide to \"clear the room\" by taking out the males first? Why? If the Queen dies, the future extinction event is cancelled. Even if the males wake up, they can\u2019t reproduce. They chose the only path that led to a chaotic shootout.\n\nAlso, back on the oil rig - the \"we don't have enough poison\" line is legendary. She\u2019s a biological creature. She has eyes and a brain. You have high-caliber rifles and explosives. Just... end it? The plot armor on that alien was thicker than its scales.",

By the end practically no one is satisfied or happy, despite their efforts to find it. There really isn\u2019t a magical or uplifting moment in life. It almost always ends in disappointment. Some others I found were: \n\nA Simple Plan. A few people have a get rich quick scheme they think will be perfect, but ends horribly with everyone either dead or traumatized forever. Captures greed well. \n\nThe Fly. A lonely scientist falls in love and thinks he has the breakthrough experiment that will make him famous and impress the girl he\u2019s just met but fallen head over heelsfor. And instead it ruins his life and hers. Captures that feeling of love that doesn\u2019t work out despite their best efforts. \n\nThe Thing. People who should be friends have now turned on eachother and are only counting down the days they left until they\u2019re all dead. Captures paranoia well. ",

        "content": "What are good movies where the main character is actually evil, a villain?\n\nI\u2019m looking for movies where the main character is the villain, or at least morally bad, not just misunderstood or secretly good.\n\nFor example:\n\nJoker (2019) \u2014 great movie, but they kinda frame his evil as something that wasn\u2019t really his choice.\n\nCruella (2021) \u2014 same thing, they turn her into more of an anti-hero instead of a true villain.\n\nI\u2019m more interested in films where:\n\nThe protagonist embraces being evil, or slowly becomes a villain without the movie excusing it too much\n\nPsychological, crime, or dark character studies are welcome\n\nSo far my favorite is \"clockwork orange\".\n\nAny recommendations? \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\ude08\n\n*Disclaimer: English is not my first language so I used AI to proof read my post.*",

        "content": "Last night I rewatched The Brady Bunch movie and sequel and it made me realize how much I enjoy the \"out of place/out of time sitcom people\" microtrend of the 90s and early 2000s. \n\nThe Beverly Hilbillies movie, Addams Family movies, Scooby Doo movies...\n\nThat was such a fun, lighthearted \"reboot\" idea. I don't know if they would work now but I'd like to think so. \n\nWhen the Jem and the Holograms movie was announced I thought *for sure* it would follow suit and instead it took itself way way too seriously and flopped. \n\nDo you think this genre could make a comeback? \n\nWhat other film microtrends do you enjoy?

I'll try to watch all the movies and series that are being recommended to me, thank you!!!!",

Excellent performances, smooth writing and dialogues, pacing as required, and great emotional arcs for characters. He's probably my favorite Director-turned-Actor since I'm not familiar with many in that category.\n\nI'm curious to know what others think of him and his directorial films. What's your favorite?",
