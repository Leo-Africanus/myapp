He was no doubt iconic in The Big Lebowski of course, but I think his role as an older Kevin Flynn in Tron Legacy is something I always look forward to every single time I go and rewatch the movie.\n\nWhat about all of you?

        "content": "Obviously, The Prestige is pretty much head and shoulders above anything else for re-watchability, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS something that I have not noticed before. For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, \"But where's his brother?\", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.\n\n- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.\n\n- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. \"Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic.\" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of \"There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!\" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.\n\n- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (\"I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box\"). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the \"real\" prestige.\n\nGreat fucking movie. Any other things you have picked up on after the 12th time through or so?",

Spielberg managed to drop two bangers in one year. I'm curious if anyone has examples of anyone else achieving something similar in another year. The best I can come up with would be Michael Crichton having a #1 book, movie, and tv show at the same time. Funny enough, it still involves Jurassic Park... but the book was written years earlier and the movie wasn't his direct product. Pretty everyone else I can think of at that level goes years between releases, even if most of them are solid hits (such as Cameron, Scorsese, Tarantino).\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "I unironically think it\u2019s one of the best scenes Snyder has directed, and I legitimately think he should direct a flamboyant musical. It\u2019s crazy this was cut out of the theatrical version\n\nIt\u2019s just got so much style in that 4 minute sequence. Great choreography, costumes, and most of all, showmanship. The whole movie is pretty much Oscar Isaac auditioning for his later role in Ex Machina. He\u2019s a hell of a dancer, and has a great voice during this scene.\n\nI recently learned that there was a lot of footage cut from this film that\u2019s not even in the extended cut. According to the choreographer, this scene was a lot longer, and Oscar Isaac did stuff like jump onto the tables",

        "content": "Like the scene wasn't very emotional for you, and then the score kicked in and had you running for the tissues? For a recent one for me, the ending scene of Deadpool and Wolverine wasn't super emotional for me, still sad and all but not sob-worthy, until the choir version of Like a Prayer kicked in. Or the music during the ending of Inception. And the score all throughout Oppenheimer really elevated the emotions for me, making some scenes super moving that wouldn't have been without the score.",

But this got me thinking, I so often see interviews for films where it's revealed that x actor improvised x scene in x film. One popular example is Barry Keogan improvising the sevens when his character strips down and has sex with the ground in Saltburn.\n\nSo I guess my question is, do you think these scenes are actually improvised? Especially with how film making works (setting up shots etc) or do you think it's just a lie to market the movie as well as the actor? It just seems to happen a lot.",
