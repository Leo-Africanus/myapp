        "content": "This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. \n\nMy theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn\u2019t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching. A film being cheap doesn\u2019t always make the film bad.",

It doesn\u2019t have the greatest reviews, which is a mystery to me, because even if it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s got incredible casting, solid plot points, pathos, belly laughs, and mothertucking Luke Wilson. \n\nFirst of all, Sarah Jessica Parker plays the neurotic outsider to a T. Birdy, defensive, repressed, insecure, but good deep down, even the cringe fest dinner scene lands because of master performances by her, Craig T, and Diane. There is no way to resist Rachel McAdam\u2019s charms, and she\u2019s in full effect here. Even the tragic subplot works, and the epilogue has me sobbing every year. Just the right balance of zany, touching, and unpredictable (sorry but that\u2019s mostly true). I love it I love it I love it so much. ",

        "content": "In the opening scene of *Inglourious Basterds*, the farmer LaPadite endures a surprise visit from Hans Landa. A few minutes into the scene, LaPadite asks one of his daughters to close the window of the farmhouse, which she immediately does. This moment is visible at the 3:31 mark in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0dAqhxfvlg).\n\nWhy does LaPadite ask for the window to be closed? \n\nI had thought that having the window closed &gt;!might make it easier for those hiding below the floorboards to hear the conversation, to alert them of any danger. It's also possible that he doesn't want the German soldiers outside to hear any conversation, but they are standing very far away.!&lt; I really don't know. The whole scene is so carefully designed that I know there must have been some thought behind including this moment.",
