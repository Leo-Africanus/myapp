        "content": "\\*\\*\\*Spoilers ahead but it is over 30 years old movie..... sooooo how upset can you get?\\*\\*\\*\n\nWas re-watching Toy Soldiers (1991) and it's about a boarding school taken over by terrorists.  The terrorists make a rule where they do a headcount of the kids and teachers every hour on the hour and for every kid missing they will execute 5 others.  So Sean Astin character sneaks out to hand US Army people intel of all the terrorists but is delayed getting back.  And here is the stupid part... To try and fake out the headcount to make it seem like everyone is there, one of the more prominent characters tries to get his head counted twice by sneaking up the line.  The guy that tries to do it = the biggest blackest kid in school made up of mostly white kids and like maybe 2 other black kids that are quite small AND don't wear glasses!!!  If you are trying to fake out the terrorists like this... don't choose the one guy that stands out a lot and will be easily remembered.\n\nWhat stupid things have you seen in a movie?  Scenes or moves by characters that make you genuinely scratch your head....  And I don't wanna read any comment about running away from a T-Rex in high heels!",

I think the director is amazing. Everyone is trying their best and \"bitches leave\" being the only line everyone remembers is crazy. Just so many good scenes in that movie, I felt tears coming up when he's in his house remembering his family. I wish we had a good remake directed by Villenvue.",

        "title": "Mission Impossible 3 - the one that saved the franchise?",
        "content": "This movie probably saved the franchise after the failure that was part 2. Part 3 is not even a return to formula, since the original from 1996 is much slower paced and flat compared to this installment. It is much better.\n\nOne of the key things this movie does is that it assumes the audience is capable of inferring information from context instead of going for exposition dumps. There is this nifty scene at the beginning where Ethan Hunt can apparently follow a conversation from across the room, outside of normal hearing range. At least, that is what the group assumed. We, the audience, can immediately infer that Ethan can read lips based on this small interaction.\n\nYou get introduced to the bad guy and his cruelty within the first 10 minutes. From there it is a non stop snowball from bad to worse, each following scene more tense than the next. The Shanghai rabbits foot raid was well executed. The movie opted to not show the heist - just the blueprint and the subsequent outcome. Ethan comes crashing out of the windows, yelling that he was not able to make it to the roof. Your mind fills in the blank. The firefight you never see, the attempts to flee to the roof, and what must have caused Ethan to agree to the higher risk of jumping out from a lower altitude.\n\nThe movie also features a \"double-double cross\" that I genuinely did not see coming. The other scenes, such as the faceswap at the vatican or the bridge ambush are exceptionally thrilling. The Shanghai rabbits foot chase, where Ethan finds ingenious but also realistic ways of finding his team an escape (leaning out 10 inches above the road from a speeding vehicle). The ending tops it, where the Ethan goes full iconic Tom Cruise sprint to save his wife at the very last second. Ethan at times seems vulnerable, and in this scene especially so. He has to rely on his wife, who is untrained, to save both him and the world from disaster. \n\nIt all comes together to create one of the best action movies of the 2000's. It's almost perfect - I only found the soundtrack to be very distracting at times. Besides that one nitpick, it is close to a masterpiece in thrilling storytelling, action and character development.",

I'm 60 now and want to watch it again as a older woman and see if the 20 year old in me is still alive.\n\n\n\nIt's not streaming ANYWHERE. Every other 80s movie can be found but not the one I want to see! I saw dvds on Amazon but over 30 dollars. Husband sailed the high seas for me but no luck. \n\n  \nIs there a reason it can't be found? Is it that bad of a movie and my memory of it is skewed by time?",

Coroners / Funeral workers eating around corpses to show how desensitized they are. People using chloroform\u00a0to instantly knock someone out. What I really hate are people that insist on putting a gun to someone's head giving the victim a chance to attack them. A GUN IS A RANGED WEAPON! The whole point is that you can shoot someone from a distance, no need to get that close!",

        "content": "You know a movie is good when it adapts a genre done to death and is still able to captivate you till the end. \n\nZombies are quite unidimensional in execution yet the movie keeps you rather hooked even with scenes largely repetitive. Though you can predict a few things such as the pregnant lady\u2019s husband sacrificing himself and the little girl surviving till the end, you still are waiting for what\u2019s next. \n\nAbsolutely brilliant redemption of the father\u2019s character. And I believe him killing that selfish lad towards the end on the moving train by renouncing himself was an incredible way of how he grew as a human, and more so as a father. He was the only one who had a smile knowing that he was dying and peacefully surrendered. A phenomal tribute towards his daughter and fatherhood.",

        "content": "Netflix has landed its next big French project, \u201cQuasimodo,\u201d which will star Vincent Cassel as the iconic character created by Victor Hugo in his cult 1831 novel \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\u201d\n\nThe film will shoot this summer in France with Jean-Francois Richet (\u201cMesrine\u201d) on board to direct, with a script penned by Eric Besnard (\u201cDelicieux\u201d). \u201cQuasimodo\u201d is being produced by Cl\u00e9ment Miserez and Matthieu Warter at Radar Films, a Mediawan company.\n\n  \nSet in Paris on the eve of the July Revolution in 1830, the epic movie reimagines the life of the man who inspired the fictional character of Quadimodo, a disfigured man who as the bell-ringer for Notre Dame cathedral in Hugo\u2019s \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the cholera epidemic spreads through the city, he\u2019s caught between political turmoil and an impossible love,\u201d reads the synopsis. While the plot remains under wraps, the movie is believed to have a dark edge.\n\nThe movie reteams Richet with Cassel, who starred in the hugely successful two-part crime thriller \u201cMesrine\u201d as gangster Jacques Mesrine, and \u201cThe Emperor of Paris,\u201d in which he played Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq, an ex convict considered as the father of the French national police force.\n\nCassel has recently played in other period films in France, notably \u201cThe Three Musketeers,\u201d based on Alexandre Dumas\u2019 classic novel.\n\nA number of illustrious actors ave played Quasimodo in fictional works, including Lon Chaney, Charles Laughton, Anthony Quinn and Anthony Hopkins.\n\nBesnard, who penned the script for \u201cQuasimodo,\u201d is also directing \u201cValjean,\u201d a project that charts the origin story of Jean Valjean, the protagonist of Victor Hugo\u2019s masterpiece \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d\n\n[https://variety.com/2025/film/global/vincent-cassel-netflix-quasimodo-mediawan-1236428240/](https://variety.com/2025/film/global/vincent-cassel-netflix-quasimodo-mediawan-1236428240/)",
