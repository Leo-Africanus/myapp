        "content": "I\u2019ll try to speak quite vaguely about the movie so I\u2019m not giving anything away, but I\u2019ve seen most of Tarantino\u2018s movies and I feel that Jackie Brown is one of his most mature.\n\nYeah, you still get to be usual violence and shock value and really fantastic conversation, \ngreat music (very catchy Across 110th Street),  and the other typical signs of Tarantino signature style, but at the heart of it, Jackie Brown it\u2019s a pretty mature film. I mean it\u2019s about getting older and about connection betweena middle-age woman trying to survive in a messed up sexist and racist world and an older guy who feels lonely.\n\nI like that there are so many moments where you\u2019re just kind of watching the characters and you have time to really reflect on things. It\u2019s not like nonstop action. Nothing against nonstop action of course, but the character study is quite fascinating. And you got complex characters. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain.\n\nFunny, until recently, I didn\u2019t know that this was actually based on a novel. And that\u2019s rare for a Tarantino film. Maybe that\u2019s why Jackie Brown feels different to me. \nUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t read the novel so I don\u2019t really know how close of an adaptation it is.\n\nNevertheless, I really like Jackie Brown and I think it\u2019s one of those movies you can just watch it again and again and as you get older, you relate to it more and more.\n\nOh, and the movie is also got some pretty funny dialogue and one liners. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote. \n\n Robbie: My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.\n\nEdit: christ, I forgot to mention the great cast (Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda), and fantastic acting. Even a young Chris Tucker does a pretty good job too with his minor role too.",

        "content": "I introduced this movie to my son last night. This is only the second time I\u2019ve rewatched it, but I remember enjoying the movie the first time in the early 2000s. Here are some observations:\n\n1. Tom Hanks can play a bad guy \u2014 albeit a principled bad guy. But the prosthetic nose seemed unnecessary to me. \n\n2. The actor who played Michael did a credible job and looks like a young Ray Liotta (minus the blue eyes; RIP). \n\n3. Paul Newman was still bringing the heat, just a few years before his death. I liked his choice of a vague Irish brogue \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been living in America for many years presumably. His piano duet with Hanks was incredible, setting up the triangle with Newman\u2019s bio son without any dialogue.\n\nWhen he chastises his son in front of his mob captains, he bangs his hand HARD on the table. At his advanced age! \n\n4. Daniel Craig epitomized the entitled, soft brat of a son. \n\n5. Jennifer Jason Leigh was underutilized. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the performance that stole the film\u2026\n\n6. Jude Law was the original Night Crawler, right? On my second viewing, I noticed he was styled like Nosferatu (balding, disgusting teeth with long, dirty nails). He was absolutely ghoulish. \n\nLaw\u2019s diner performance with Tom Hanks was some really fine acting. Memorably fine. \n\nHonorable mention to Stanley Tucci as the put-upon mob mercenary. \n\nOverall, this movie is really good, although the pacing could have been better because it dragged in sections The wrap-up was predictable, but very satisfying.",

        "title": "Watched Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy yesterday. The Gary Oldman Spy movie.",
        "content": "I liked it a lot.\n\nSince I knew nothing of le Carr\u00e9's work or Smiley, and went into it blind, I wasn't sure most of the movie and before the reveal whether Smiley was the mole or not and playing everyone. He gives this smirk whenever key information is revealed and it's like he is amused how far people before him/catching upto him have come but it isn't going to matter since HE IS THE MOLE and they lost now.\n\nWhile he was he narrating the story to Benedict Cumberbatch's character about meeting Karla for the first time, I was wondering the whole time whether he was bullshitting and giving a fake story. Maybe he IS the real Karla and the one in Russia is a \"fake one\" setup by him himself. Basically Usual Suspect-ing us. Also the way that shot was framed and filmed, it was like he was talking to himself(since I thought he IS karla) and the other chair was empty meaning There IS NO KARLA strong arming my suspision that he could be the mole. Also he doesn't remember the face of the now \"HEAD OF RUSSIA\"? That was pretty sus to me. I guess he saw him too long time ago but he should atleast remember his important features.\n\nI honestly don't know if it was intentional or not or if that was just how I was interpreting it. Was Smiley intentionally made to be a Red herring for newbies like me? I later learnt that Smiley is a famous character in the books and other media so for a newbie coming into this movie, were people like me also sus of smilie too? Or did a majority of the target audience knew he was a \"good\" guy beforehard and were never sus of him and were just focusing on the real mole between the 4 main candidates.\n\nAlso Benedict Cumberbatch's character, since I was so sus of Smiley, I felt was the perfect fall guy since he was doing most of the dirty work. I felt smiley was setting him up so he would die at somepoint and blame one of the 4 so Smiley will be free of any suspicious and keep on continue being the mole now being the head of the department.\n\nAnd was the woman who was executed in front of Jim in the torture chamber, the same one Tom Hardy's character got the mole info from? That's pretty grim honestly. Doesn't he still think she is alive and they are going to trade her back?\n\nAll The deaths in this movies are just so brutal and bloody.\n\nAnd at the end, Bill was going to be traded back to the Russians? But then Jim killed him because the betrayl was just too much? That would just fk up the deal that were going to do with the Russians. And Bill will get arrested. I suppose he had nothing left to loose. He is a true loner now. Drove the kid away too.\n\nHonestly Pretty smart move planned by Karla to throw off Smiley by Bill seducing his wife.\n\nI liked the Christmas scenes. Everyone was \"happy\"\n\nThe ending montage was great with that french song.\n\nThis feels like those movies that get better on a rewatch. Am excited to rewatch it again someday.",

If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, I can\u2019t recommend it enough - it\u2019s a clever, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt twist on the classic Groundhog Day time loop story. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti have incredible chemistry, and every viewing reveals something new that I didn\u2019t notice before. I\u2019ve honestly lost count at this point, but I\u2019ve easily watched it ten times - maybe more. It never fails to make me laugh, think, and feel a little better about the chaos of life.\n\n10/10",

The snowy setting in Minnesota, the screenplay, Buschemi and Stormare as the bumbling dim-witted criminals, Macy as the easy-to-hate greedy husband and son-in-law, and McDormand as the lovable chief of police. The Minnesota nice stereotype is well played out throughout the film. \n\nI don't know. I know this is a crime film, but there is something comforting about this film that is unexplainable. ",

        "content": "No one (grown up) thought an r/AceVentura sequel would work but my adolescent brain was seated some thirty years ago and couldn't wait to see more Jim on the big screen. But instead of recycling the original's jokes, Carrey and co swerved and made something different, which is rare for comedy follow-ups, especially today when we all know comedies are often forced into repeating the same jokes from studio interference or audience demand. And because this is \"Ace Ventura,\" that left-turn is exactly why it stuck.\n\nThe OG Miami pet-detective hijinks became a full-blown jungle quest. Tom Shadyac gave way to Steve Oedekerk as writer/director; and Carrey leaned into the live-action cartoon energy *even* harder. Oedekerk called their pace \u201cdefinitely go, go, go,\u201d and you feel it in the rhino scene, the Slinky bit, and every bat-averse yelp... &gt;!Guano!!&lt;\n\nIt premiered on this day in November 8, 1995 at Westwood\u2019s Regency Village Theatre and opened nationwide on November 10 at #1, ultimately clearing over $200M worldwide. Thirty years later, it\u2019s still a case study in how a comedy sequel can change lanes and land.\u00a0",
