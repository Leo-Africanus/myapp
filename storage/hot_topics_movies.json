I\u2019ve already watched and loved Interstellar, Severance, Moon, and I\u2019m really excited about The Three-Body Problem.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated by stories that dive into deep concepts like time, space, consciousness, and the mysteries of existence while wrapping them in captivating narratives and stunning visuals. The kind of content that keeps you thinking, \"What if\u2026?\"\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing out on some hidden gems or even well-known classics that I haven\u2019t come across yet. So, I\u2019m turning to the community for help.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for sci-fi movies or shows that are:\n\nMind-bending and thought-provoking?\nVisually stunning or have a unique storytelling style?\nFocused on deeper themes rather than just action?\nThey don\u2019t have to be super recent; I\u2019m happy to explore older classics or lesser-known titles too.\n\nWhether it\u2019s something like Arrival, Dark, Primer, or even lesser-known works that deserve more recognition, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Also, if there are international titles or indie projects in the same genre, feel free to share those as well!\n\nLooking forward to building a new watchlist based on your suggestions. Thanks in advance for helping me dive deeper into the sci-fi world!\n\nCheers",

The dramatic pause as old girl is walking out of the banquet room right before yer boy hits her with the truth, the subtle score crescendo, right up to \"you're so fucked\", it's the best. Then, the best film outro I've ever seen, dude just processing his shit in the cab, then that creeping satisfaction before the cut, knowing he won &amp; did a righteous act, shit is dope.

And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that won't be true. It will be because youre an asshole.\"\n3. **Heat** restaurant scene with DeNiro and Pacino - despite having a common ground they wont stop on what they are doing\n4. **The Dark Knight** with Bale and Ledger - \"See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.\"\n5. **Inglorius Basterds** opening scene aka Christoph Waltz' epic scene - \"You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?\"\n6. **Marriage Story** \\- Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson - \"Everyday I wake up and I hope youre dead!\"\n\n",

For those unaware Thorssen is in quite a few Schwarzenegger films, often as an extra though he does get some more prominent roles too. He is a good friend of Schwarzenegger and he's basically a human Easter egg to look out for. \n\nAlso directors often cast their children in roles where children are required.\n\n\nWhat other people do you know of that are in a film just as an Easter egg? Not a standard cameo such as Bruce Campbell in Sam Raimi films but one that isn't as noticeable such as Casey Kasem in Ghostbusters which his wife is also in, something subtle that you wouldn't immediately notice.

This thing fucking delivered and hit me like a ton of bricks. Just an absolutely hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. Well acted, well written, well crafted movie. The last scene, fuck man. Genuinely the best drama about relationships I\u2019ve seen in a while. Watching two extremely flawed characters, people from broken homes, fall in and out of love with each other was just heartbreaking yet completely understandable. It was inevitable, it was never going to work but it still was painful to watch. Familiar to so many people whether through first hand or second hand experience. Childhood trauma, different communication styles, different styles for dealing with emotions, different outlooks on life, ambitions and love that just could never last. If you\u2019ve never seen it I would highly recommend it, and if you\u2019ve seen it and have similar movies I\u2019d love to hear about those as well \n",

        "title": "Wild Strawberries: The Title's True Meaning",
        "content": "I recently rewatched *Wild Strawberries* (Smultronst\u00e4llet), Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1957 classic. Since my Netflix is set to English, it displayed the English title, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice how the translation loses the symbolism of the original Swedish one.\n\nThe Swedish title, Smultronst\u00e4llet, literally means \"a wild strawberry patch,\" but it\u2019s more commonly used idiomatically to refer to a special, idyllic place. It could be a place that holds nostalgia or simply somewhere where you feel safe and happy.\n\nThis symbolism is woven beautifully into the movie. Isak Borg, the protagonist, revisits key moments of his past, including a visit to his childhood home. One particular memory involves the girl he loved picking wild strawberries. However, instead of this being a moment of joy, it\u2019s ironic, as she\u2019s seen picking strawberries while cheating on him, turning his *smultronst\u00e4lle* (both childhood home and a wild strawberry patch) into a symbol of loss and missed opportunities.\n\nI think the original title adds depth to the film, especially as it underscores the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and memory. It\u2019s a clever piece of symbolism that doesn\u2019t quite come through in the English title.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this small piece of trivia about an excellent movie!",
