        "content": "Hey Reddit! I'm Clint Bentley, director of films like Jockey and co-writer of Sing Sing. I most recently adapted the novella Train Dreams by Denis Johnson with my longtime collaborator, Greg Kwedar. Looking forward to answering your questions! Check out the trailer here: [https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSYNOPSIS: Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th-century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation\u2019s railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality, and newfound meaning in the forests and trees he has felled. An ode to a vanishing way of life, an ever-evolving world, and to the extraordinary possibilities that exist within even the most simple of existences, Train Dreams captures a time and place that are now long gone, and the people who built a bridge to a future they could only dream of. Directed by Academy Award nominee Clint Bentley with a screenplay by Bentley and Academy Award nominee Greg Kwedar, the writing team behind Sing Sing, the film also stars Academy Award nominees William H. Macy and Kerry Condon.\n\n  \nStreaming on Netflix November 21",

        "title": "Heat (1995) is one of my favorite films, but the inciting incident of the whole plot makes no sense.",
        "content": "MILD SPOILERS BELOW:\n\nHow does Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro), who is shown throughout the film to be utterly meticulous and deeply cautious, allow Waingro (Kevin Gage), who is shown to be a serial rapist and murderer (not to mention a loose cannon, literally), to join his crew for the heist at the beginning of the movie? \n\nSince Waingro's actions are the inciting incident for much of the plot, including the critical denouement at the film's climax, this feels like a major issue that you can't just handwave away. It's an unmotivated/inexplicable action by McCauley, and it feels a bit sheisty that Mann starts the script only *after* Waingro has already joined the crew. It's not like he does some critical, irreplaceable job for them that it would be reasonable to take a risk with. Without some additional reasoning, such as when the crew takes a risk with driver Don Breenan (Dennis Haysbert) when under extreme time pressure, the whole thing with Waingro, and therefore much of the film's core narrative, seems totally out of character for McCauley.\n\nI've watched Heat dozens of times, I can quote the screenplay title to title from memory and, as I said, I think this is one of the best crime films ever made... but it may be built on a paper-thin foundation, unless I've missed something. \n\nPlease share your thoughts; I'm happy to be disabused of my misconceptions!",

I love Pedro Pascal but I\u2019m not really a romance/romcom fan so I waited to watch it on streaming and boy I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay the cost of a movie ticket. \n\nWhy was every character and shot so flat and lifeless and one-dimensional? Why couldn\u2019t this movie pick a tone? Did they think we wouldn\u2019t get the moral of the story after seventeen different monologues about how \u201clove isn\u2019t about checking boxes\u201d? Who thought it was a good idea to have a poorly handled SA-themed plot twist 2/3 into the movie that seems only to serve as a \u201clesson\u201d for the deeply unlikeable protagonist? \n\nThe editing was also so bizarre. There was no reason for this movie to be two hours long and a lot of the scenes felt like there was some kind of time quota they were trying to reach. And in that time, most of the characters don\u2019t go through any meaningful development and in some cases even end up going right back to making choices that the movie already made a point to show didn\u2019t work the first time. \n\nWhat\u2019s wild to me is that the press tour for this movie was delightful and proved these people absolutely can have chemistry together but none of that was present in the actual film. \n\nI haven\u2019t watched Past Lives so I don\u2019t know if this is a director problem or a this movie problem but\u2026yikes.

Outside of this, it was a shockingly compelling story that used the musical genre as a means of better portraying the emotions of characters. Due to the epilogue of one main character I have to remove one full point - I would rate this movie an 8.5/10",

        "title": "The Last of the Mohicans: Alice and Uncas, unlike anything in cinematic history",
        "content": "First, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m at all repetitive (and long!) but this is practically therapeutic because this is something that has bothered me for years. So here it is\u2026 \n\nAlice and Uncas are two of the most interesting characters in cinema to me, they are each so compelling and intriguing. And the love story of Alice and Uncas is one of the most powerful, beautiful, and captivating love stories of all time. Ok I\u2019ll say it\u2026 THE most, in my personal opinion. But what is so amazing about it is, it was given barely any time and they were given barely any dialog! But they didn\u2019t even need it\u2026 The fact that they are two of the most compelling characters and one of the most haunting and captivating love stories while also being the most neglected characters and love story, is absolutely incredible! \nTo the actors Jodhi May as Alice and Eric Schweig as Uncus, the depth and level of acting that went into accomplishing this is so great I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin, making this an example of some of the most underrated acting in history. \n\nThere are so many adoring fans of these characters and their love story that there are tributes to them online. If you read what people write  under YouTube videos, etc., there are a lot of insightful and beautiful comments about Alice and Uncas.  It\u2019s funny because many of us see the same things about them and it was all delivered solely on eyes/body language and whatever else you want to call it. It serves as proof that the best acting comes from within and that there is a greater depth to things such that, with the right writing/acting/directing, can actually successfully be captured even without words or narrative. \nTruly one of the most beautiful things in cinema that captivated and haunted much of its audience, and all of this from essentially having to try to catch the quick glimpses of them in this film. I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like it. Their characters and story overcame and conquered their own neglect so powerfully that they outshined the stars, at least to many of us. \nI say neglect based on focus and time, but certainly not neglect in the intricate detail of their scenes and sheer quality in every detail in them. \n\nAlice is perhaps the most neglected (by way of time and focus) character I\u2019ve ever seen considering her level of depth. I tried so very hard to favor the focused-on main female, Cora. I really tried to watch this through the lens we were supposed to: Cora and Hawkeye being the stars and the epic love story. It just didn\u2019t work. There was something missing. Yes, I like both their characters a lot, yes I like that they were in love, but it didn\u2019t move me like it was supposed to and although Cora had some great lines and very cool scenes that normally make it easy for me to find favoritism, Alice exceeded her\u2026 There is just something about her. And her final scene proves it. \nAlice\u2019s character has so much intense, unexplored depth that makes you want to learn more about her. When she leaves a scene, you want to follow, but never get to. She\u2019s much more mysterious than Cora, not for lack of dialog but simply from her tone, gazes, and other subtleties. Her scenes are so short and so few, but so intense that they are literally haunting. The amount of unexplored depth about her is something I could go on and on about. \nYou see glimpses of such courage from her early on, like when she went to get closer to view the enemies but Uncus stopped her to keep her safe\u2014some have called Uncas her silent protector. And her final moment is one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history and shows that she was a character of so much beauty, love, strength, courage, and profound conviction\u2026 It is one of the top most impactful scenes in cinema. \n\nAlice is also so incredibly beautiful. She is breathtakingly beautiful\u2026 Both actresses are unmistakably gorgeous, but when Alice\u2019s hair comes down, her beauty steals the show. I can\u2019t take my eyes off her. This says a lot given the fact that Madeleine is so beautiful. Btw, they make incredible sisters. \n\nAlice as she\u2019s about to throw herself off the cliff is literally one of the most beautiful images I have ever seen. \n\nAgain, do not get me wrong, both are incredibly beautiful. \n\nUncus\u2026\n\nUncus is such a strong, stoic, brave, protective, cool, heroic, great character. Like with Alice, I could go on and on. Yes he is incredibly handsome! but this is only one of the reasons he is one of the most attractive male characters I\u2019ve ever seen. The level of depth and feeling acted with his eyes\u2026 you can see him seeing something in and feeling so deeply for Alice in the scene where he watches her from a distance, without ever needing dialog to express it. Just one example of many. His level of depth is similar to Alice\u2019s. You can see so much feeling and intensity coming from him with absolutely no words. And in his light hearted moments, his smile is just so great and there is just something about him that I\u2019d have to write like three other paragraphs to convey or at least try to convey.\nHe was so great to watch and there were so unjustifiably few scenes focused on him, but where they were, you couldn\u2019t get enough. \n\nWith Uncas and Alice, I\u2019ve never seen such levels of depth solely from within. Usually this has to be conveyed with words, with them, no words were necessary and the acting translated this to screen! Again, so incredible. \n\nTheir love was so true, pure, and a true soul connection. It developed naturally and powerfully with the pure and authentic language of feeling. This was a unique masterpiece in every regard. \nIt was also one of the most swoon-worthy, romantic, exciting, and beautiful\u2014so absolutely beautiful\u2014love stories I\u2019ve ever witnessed. \n\nI wish I had saved what I read others wrote about their character interactions that people have noticed, because they pointed out so many beautiful and insightful things about the interactions between these two, that, given what little screen time they got, might go unnoticed. (There are 3 cuts so not sure if every cut has all these little moments shown. One example is in the directors expanded edition\u2014not to be mistaken with the final directors cut which I actually prefer\u2014when they get into the canoe after the attack, Cora is holding Alice\u2019s arm to direct her to follow her but Alice pulls away and purposefully goes to sit with Uncas. After someone pointed it out I finally noticed but it was in the directors expanded edition I just watched so I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s in all of them, but hopefully.) What scenes they had together were so moving and intense, though. And even the tiny, easy-to-miss subtleties throughout the film were so precious, those are some of the things others have pointed out in things like YouTube comments. \n\nThe waterfall scene is one of the most beautiful and romantic scenes I have ever seen in my life. And the way he was willing to give his life to try to save her in spite of impossible odds was so profoundly moving. Alice at one point without a second thought  tries to go to Uncus\u2019s aid and presumably fight Magua, showing an incredible amount of love and courage, but the other tribe members held her back.\nAlice was such a haunting character. It\u2019s like she was too beautiful for all the ugliness of the world (and she\u2019s always drawn to the beautiful things, like gazing at the waterfall when they were climbing up the rock and captivated by the waterfall in the cave) and it impacted her so deeply that you could see she would go to this deep, internal place of so much sadness that she didn\u2019t seem to mind to leave this place, like in the behind-the-waterfall scene, but then Uncas pulled her back and held her so lovingly and so deeply and it\u2019s as if his love gave her something good and beautiful to hold onto in this world. When he died for her, she loved him so much that her hope died with him, and with no self-pity at all, rather than be taken as essentially a slave and rather than just surviving without her love, she chose to go with him and end her own life. It\u2019s like her heart was already thrown off the cliff, she just followed. And like Uncas\u2019s selfless rescue of her, she showed such incredible bravery and all that unexplored depth hit the audience so powerfully that this scene, her character, Uncas\u2019s character, and their love story, haunts the audience to this date.\nPlus the sheer level of conviction, her eyes at Magua after slaying her love\u2026 that was the most badass thing in the movie which is saying a lot. In fact, it is one of the most badass things I\u2019ve ever seen. At that point it was like she was a phoenix, and the most evil man in the movie that rose hell, had zero power over her. It was the first time Magua showed any kind of vulnerability and even fear in the entire film. \nOthers have also suggested, based on the way he lowered his knife and looked genuinely concerned, that he saw in Alice in this moment, what Uncas saw in her. I definitely see something there along those lines. \n\nBack to Alice/Uncas\u2026 There is a sort of epic, action/adventure Romeo and Juliet thing to them, but much more profound, deeper and more beautiful. \n\nSo, try as I did, I could not be swept away by Cora and Nathaniel (Hawkeye). Alice and Uncus outshined them for me against even my own will. Both on their own as individual characters, and their relationship. \n\nSo, while this is one of my all time favorite movies, it always left me so deeply unsatisfied and bothered because we just didn\u2019t get enough of the ones so many of us were captivated by and argue are the greatest characters and love story and it always made Cora/Nathaniel feel rather forced to me personally. But we might have seen more! It turns out there was a beautiful love scene of Alice and Uncas that was cut out and I did read it suggested in an interview that some of the reasoning was because director Michael Mann wanted the focus to be on \u201cthe stars\u201d and their love story. It\u2019s not even available to the public online which is insane to me and so annoying. Michael Mann did an amazingly brilliant job with this movie but I disagree with his choice to delete the love scene between Alice and Uncas. And I wish they would AT LEAST make the deleted scenes available to see online. \n\nThe deleted love scene\u2026\n\nThe waterfall scene was longer\u2026 They have a secret love and commitment to one another. In the scene that was filmed and cut out, Uncas and Alice kiss and there was also a scene, still in that setting I believe, where Alice braids her hair or Uncas braids Alice\u2019s hair which is a sign of love and commitment (I\u2019ll post below the meaning of the braid). That is why her hair is braided after the waterfall scene!! That is so incredibly beautiful. (In the past I remember wondering why her hair was suddenly braided.) In fact, it was originally written that when Uncas grabs her and holds her, they actually make love, but because Johdi\u2019s mother was on set and Johdi was 17, her mom didn\u2019t want her to do that scene so they rewrote it to where it just contained a kiss and that is the scene they filmed. \n\nTo me, Nathaniel and Cora were more manufactured where Alice and Uncas happened so naturally, beautifully, raw and authentically. \n\nAnd apparently there were a lot of cut Uncas scenes which to me is annoying because Uncas was such an incredible character, a legit Mohican, and more scenes with him would have been amazing to see as well as more scenes (assuming they exist which I think is a relatively safe assumption) of him and his brother Hawkeye together and of their dad. \n\nBut anyway, Uncas and Alice were each separately so compelling and their relationship so extraordinarily compelling. \n\nI have read that there is an original 3 hour version, if that is true, I really wish they would release the original 3 hour version with all the Uncas scenes and the love scene between he and Alice. People were even talking about starting a petition to do so years back. \n\nIn an interview, I read Eric say that the love scene between him and Alice should not have been cut out. He also alludes to his disappointment that a lot of his scenes were cut, but never comes across as angry or critical and remains gracious, professional, and respectful. The website with that interview has the name Mohican in it but I don\u2019t remember the full site name. \n\nAnd a special shout out to Duncan\u2026 when he translated HIS life rather than Hawkeye\u2019s to the Huron chief, that was SO powerful and moving and heartbreakingly beautiful!\n\n(I am part Huron so I don\u2019t exactly love the depiction of the Huron in the movie lol, but hey.) \n\nTruly an incredible movie but so much tragically and unjustifiably missed!\n\nPlease understand I really like Cora and Hawkeye\u2019s characters a lot. I just don\u2019t get the same level of depth from them as I do Uncas and Alice, but some of Nathaniel\u2019s (Hawkeye\u2019s) lines are my favorite. \nIt did annoy me a bit that Cora didn\u2019t try to just steal a key from a British soldier to unlock Hawkeye and allow him to escape rather than be hanged, though, because I don\u2019t think it would have been that hard for her to get, that made no sense to me, I figure maybe she was going to do something but they were attacked and all that before she had the opportunity? In any case I knew his brother and dad were going to get him out of it, but I digress. \n\nI also want to note, Alice could have jumped before Uncas died. She was instead being held and led against her will but surviving because she had hope and something to hold on for. When she saw her love die, her heart was broken and she refused to take the hand of the man who killed him. She chose to go with her love. Overall it showed an incredible amount of strength, courage, love and again, profound conviction. Same with Uncas going to her rescue. \n\nWhen Uncas and Alice first meet, she yells at him about the horses and he grabs onto her, she suddenly calms and stares at him as if captivated, and he, instead of just stopping her from going after the horses, stops and stares into her eyes. The moment is brief and not in the main focus, but they were captivated by each other from the beginning. And there are so many of these intricate moments with them throughout the entire film if you pay attention like others have pointed out. I mean you\u2019re looking past the main focus points to get a glimpse of characters that were\u2014until the end\u2014pushed to the side. That says a lot. And you\u2019re looking past the main focus points and seeing the most deep and amazing love story unfold while it\u2019s somewhat imo purposefully being pushed aside. That says a lot. I actually think audiences would have appreciated the Cora/Nathaniel story more if we got a fair share of the other main characters and what was happening, that is certainly true for me and someone else suggested as much on this site. \nSo imagine how many other moments we would have seen, even without the cut love scene. And overall, I am really upset at the cut Uncas scenes in general and would love to see them, he was my favorite male character. And I imagine that the Mohican father had cut scenes, too. I would have loved to have seen more scenes of the actual Mohicans and think we should have. That being said, Nathaniel was awesome. Again, I would have  loved to see him interact more with his brother, Uncas, I loved them as brothers. But sorry I think I\u2019m being really repetitive now. \n\nAgain, I really wish they would release the complete, full 3 hour version. It\u2019s too good not to. I mean you could argue there\u2019s not technically a complete version. I don\u2019t know whether or not there is but I do know there were a lot of deleted scenes so I would absolutely love to see a much longer version of this. And having more than three (there are presently three) cuts of this movie is warranted because it\u2019s so great. But AT LEAST make the deleted love scene and braid scenes available to the public online please! \n\nAs for the braiding of the hair\u2026 I read people on a Mohican\u2018s website and some other places talk about how the braid signified a connection and commitment. So I actually just quickly googled it and this is what showed up from AI: \n\nA couple braiding hair in Native American culture symbolizes a deep connection, love, and unity, with the three strands often representing the body, mind, and spirit.\n\n* Union and connection: The three strands of a braid represent the body, mind, and spirit, and braiding them together symbolizes the harmonious union of a couple in all aspects. It can also represent their connection to each other, their family, and the earth.\u00a0\n* Nurturing and care: The act of braiding is an intimate gesture of care, affection, and respect. It's a way for a partner to show support and love, and to pass on positive energy and strength to each other.\u00a0\n* Strength and resilience: Individual strands of hair can be weak, but when braided together, they become strong. A couple braiding hair can symbolize how they are stronger together than they are apart, representing the strength of their bond.\u00a0\n* Shared history and future: Hair is seen as a repository of memories and experiences. Braiding is a way to share and weave together their life stories, and to embark on a new journey with shared purpose and strength\nSacredness: In many Indigenous cultures, hair is considered sacred and connected to a person's identity and life force. The act of a couple braiding each other's hair can elevate this sacred practice to a shared, spiritual experience. \n\nI know this post was long but this has bothered me for so many years. I just wanted to write it and get it all out.  ",

        "content": "I introduced this movie to my son last night. This is only the second time I\u2019ve rewatched it, but I remember enjoying the movie the first time in the early 2000s. Here are some observations:\n\n1. Tom Hanks can play a bad guy \u2014 albeit a principled bad guy. But the prosthetic nose seemed unnecessary to me. \n\n2. The actor who played Michael did a credible job and looks like a young Ray Liotta (minus the blue eyes; RIP). \n\n3. Paul Newman was still bringing the heat, just a few years before his death. I liked his choice of a vague Irish brogue \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been living in America for many years presumably. His piano duet with Hanks was incredible, setting up the triangle with Newman\u2019s bio son without any dialogue.\n\nWhen he chastises his son in front of his mob captains, he bangs his hand HARD on the table. At his advanced age! \n\n4. Daniel Craig epitomized the entitled, soft brat of a son. \n\n5. Jennifer Jason Leigh was underutilized. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the performance that stole the film\u2026\n\n6. Jude Law was the original Night Crawler, right? On my second viewing, I noticed he was styled like Nosferatu (balding, disgusting teeth with long, dirty nails). He was absolutely ghoulish. \n\nLaw\u2019s diner performance with Tom Hanks was some really fine acting. Memorably fine. \n\nHonorable mention to Stanley Tucci as the put-upon mob mercenary. \n\nOverall, this movie is really good, although the pacing could have been better because it dragged in sections The wrap-up was predictable, but very satisfying.",

(I express it that way about the context because it COULD be footage of the map room being discovered that was never used in the final film...)\n\nI wonder what the story is with this?  Was it possibly a reshoot because the moving of the stone \"door\" looks less than impressive...but they hadn't reshot by the time the trailer needed to be out?\n\nAlso - and I know the trailer is pretty low quality - the trailer makes it seem like the face of the tall statue is clear the moment the stone is pulled away...but in the final version, it is more played as a reveal when the lightning lights up the face.  I wonder if that was a \"we need another thrill moment\" from Spielberg in the similar vein to Ben Gardiner's head in the boat in  Jaws... ",

I mean it\u2019s about getting older and about connection betweena middle-age woman trying to survive in a messed up sexist and racist world and an older guy who feels lonely.\n\nI like that there are so many moments where you\u2019re just kind of watching the characters and you have time to really reflect on things. It\u2019s not like nonstop action. Nothing against nonstop action of course, but the character study is quite fascinating. And you got complex characters. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain.\n\nFunny, until recently, I didn\u2019t know that this was actually based on a novel. And that\u2019s rare for a Tarantino film. Maybe that\u2019s why Jackie Brown feels different to me. \nUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t read the novel so I don\u2019t really know how close of an adaptation it is.\n\nNevertheless, I really like Jackie Brown and I think it\u2019s one of those movies you can just watch it again and again and as you get older, you relate to it more and more.\n\nOh, and the movie is also got some pretty funny dialogue and one liners. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote. \n\n Robbie: My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.\n\nEdit: christ, I forgot to mention the great cast (Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda), and fantastic acting. Even a young Chris Tucker does a pretty good job too with his minor role too.",

        "content": "I'm talking about movies like Shutter Island, Mr. Nobody, Fight Club, Inception, Donnie Darko (to a lesser extent) and The Truman Show (also to a lesser extent).  \nI've seen some movies recommended (Manchester by the Sea, Taxi Driver 1976, Silence of the Lamb, Midsommer, Nightcrawler, No Country for Old Men etc.) but they don't have the same effect. Not that they are bad movies; just that they don't fit into what I am looking for.\n\nAnd, just being confusing to understand/complicated until the pieces are laid out at the end isn't what I'm looking for though (examples being a time loop movies, or movies where they just don't explain anything until the end). Movies with a misleading buildup into a payoff-twist at the end, or movies about disillusionment of oligarchies etc. are also not what I want. Just pure mind fuck to where you don't even know whether you actually exist/questioning everything you know.\n\nImportantly though, they should be actually watchable because god forbid a man doesn't want to sit through hours of incomprehensible, boring/flat, dull movie footage.",
