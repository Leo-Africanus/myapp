        "title": "January 10-12 Box Office Recap: 'Den of Thieves 2' takes the #1 spot from 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic', debuting with $15 million domestically. However, 'Better Man' massively flopped in its wide expansion, debuting at #13 with a terrible $1 million from 1,291 theaters, against its $110 million budget.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wyyfpflzhvce1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6b820d9a6c3bcf91bab0d1448e8d898d5716f5\n\nTurns out the kingdom didn't last long.\n\nWhether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.\n\nDebuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).\n\nEven though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.\n\nThe reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.\n\nIn third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.\n\nIn fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.\n\n***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.\n\nSearchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.\n\n***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.\n\nIn eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.\n\nIn ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.\n\nA24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.\n\n***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.\n\nWe have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.\n\n***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.\n\nThe American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (\"Angels\" and \"Millennium\") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.\n\nThere's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions \"who is Robbie Williams?\" and \"why is he a chimpanzee?\" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.\n\nAccording to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).\n\n***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).\n\n***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).\n\n***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M\n*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M\n\n- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (\"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.\n\n- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe find two newcomers this weekend.\n\nThe first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.\n\nThe other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.\n\n#**ANNOUNCEMENT**\n\nAs this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "In Ghostbusters, the fountain scene with Venkman hounding Dana for a date ends with:\n\n**Dana: I\u2019ll see you Thursday.**\n\n**Venkman: I\u2019ll bring the\u00a0Roylance Guide**\u00a0**and we\u2019ll eat and read.**\n\nIt's said so fast, honestly, most people only hear something like \"eat and read.\" But what the hell is Venkman talking about?\n\nIn the original script, \"The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects\" is mentioned in dialog earlier in the movie, akin to mentions of \"Tobin's Spirit Guide.\" Except, famously, GB was largely ad-libbed and reworked scene by scene as they were shooting, and mention of Roylance ended up being dropped. Slight problem: the Dana/Venkman fountain scene was the first shot on the film, so no one had any idea it'd go away.\n\nNot sure why they didn't just re-record the dialog, because a lot had to be anyway due to the fountain noise. In the end, I imagine they just didn't care.\n\nQuick edit for the handful of GB fans for taking this way more seriously than intended: this does not make it a bad movie or a bad scene! It's just a moment where there was supposed to be a callback, only the thing that was being called back to was cut out, so it's up to the audience to fill in the blank. That it still works for you is great! That the vast majority of people can only make out something that sounds like \"roy-lan-sky\" over the sound of the fountain pretty much makes it a non-issue for most. It's just a bit of trivia!",

Paused a few times just to get a hold of myself lol but I can't imagine watching it live in a packed theater with so many other people.

It got me wondering: for those of you who saw it during its original release, what was the theater experience like? How did people around you react? Was it quiet? Emotional?",

        "content": "Ive been on a recent journey of watching classic movies loved by most. As of this I found dead poets society to be on my list of must watch. I\u2019ve just now finished the film and was in love with it minutes in, this film shows a great perspective of young males never having to make their own decisions shown a small glimpse of freedom by a way of words. I\u2019ve seen many arguments on this movie saying that Mr.keiner was the cause of Neil\u2019s death and or highly influenced it. I\u2019d have to say from my point of view as a current high school student that Mr keiner is a person needed in all young men\u2019s lives. He gives hope and confidence to kids who have never had to make decisions for themselves and would never last in the world if they were to be put out in the real world as they are. I believe Mr keiner said all the right things and didn\u2019t make Neil become an actor but inform him on the importance of opportunity and doing what is loved but not expected. Keiner never told him to go against his parents but told him to talk to his father in a civil manner. Neil should have never took it to the point he did but that does not make it keiner s fault. I apologize for the rather argumentative post I\u2019d like to hear opinions on this matter further.",

        "content": "Most movie trilogies I have seen (not many, admittedly) have always had movies which felt disconnected - that is, each movies starts and ends its own story, with the movies only being connected slightly. A good example of this is the How To Train Your Dragon trilogy. While nice, I much prefer a single continuous story in my trilogies, such as in the Lord of the Rings trilogy - a single story spanning 3 movies which was intended to be 3 movies from the start. \n\nOne thing which intrigued me when searching for other such movies, was that all of them were adaptations of other properties like books. I was not able to find a single example of a movie trilogy designed as a trilogy from the start, and was an original story. So, do such movie trilogies exist?\n\nPS: Movie series with 4 or more entries are fine too. I'm not mentioning duologies as examples exist such as Kill Bill.",

Even though there was a drop in quality once Guttenberg left, it was still a fun series that knew when to be silly and when to hit proper social commentary. \n\nFor example: I love how HighTower protects Hooks in the first movie when the instructor calls her a racial slur. While the flipping the car over may be played for laughs, it is still a great scene of HighTower protecting his buddy from a racist rant. Not to mention the movies really show Positive Masculinity between the characters.\n\nLike, no one makes fun of Tackleberry when he admits to being a virgin at his age. In fact, they all support him and act as his wingmen. All the guy (protagonist) characters love and support one another and any teasing is just good natured fun and never cruel. \n\nI also think it is in that Russia movie where the (usually antagonistic) Lassarad proclaims that he plans to rescue his squad because (paraphrasing): \"They are idiots, but they are MY idiots!\" \n\nNot to mention they also created some of the best lady bad-asses with Callahan, Hooks, Kirkland (who proves to be even more of a bad-ass than Tackleberry), Mrs. Feldman, and Laura (Who is just as crazed as Bobcat's Zed).\n\nAnd, of course, who can forget the infamous Blue Oyster Bar!\n\n  \nSure the movies are silly and dumb but they were able to keep the series going with new characters (many introduced in previous films like SweetChuck and Zed) and still maintain that sense of humor and kindness from the original films.\n\n  \nWhich is your favorite and which scene do you particularly find the funniest?
