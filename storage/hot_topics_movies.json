Like its predecessor, it's delightfully silly, but now we're in an era where those movies aren't made as often... and when someone tries, it's a 50/50 chance they land it. *Happy Gilmore 2* is a solid return to the kind of film that, honestly, there should be more of. Some jokes run too long, don\u2019t land, or could use another draft. It's a constant stream of cameos, which is overall fun but sometimes a little distracting. But, at its core, the sequel is a good-natured charmer about a troubled everyman who is trying hard to grow up without losing himself in the process, and it gives us a lot to laugh about on the way. What more can you ask for?\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/review-adam-sandlers-happy-gilmore-2-may-be-worst-sequel-of-all-time/)\n\n&gt;With all due respect to *Grown Ups 2*, *The Ridiculous 6*, and *Sandy Wexler*, *Happy Gilmore 2* is the bottom of the Sandler barrel\u2014a grim disaster that not only sullies the good name of its ancestor, but so badly flails on its own limited terms that it suggests the A-lister should concentrate on dramatic parts and leave the immature comedy to others.",

He then sticks his tallywhacker through the hole, teasing the girls with it, which they all laugh. Enter MS BALBREAKER. She sees the tallwhacker sticking out into the room. She starts to move towards it, unbeknownst to the boy himself. Soon as she approaches, she grabs onto it with both her hands, attempting to keep him there. \n\n\nThis scene, to this day, it's still one that cracks me up to no end.

It probably drove them insane. Anyway even now I am a little bit obsessed with it now, perhaps not as much as then but still. The best fanfare arrangement in my opinion is Bruce Broughton's arrangements to which I think about 5 or 6 exist but were only used for a few years exluding on home entertainment logos before David Newman's fanfare, which I don't mind, but I don't like it as much. The only fanfare I can think of that comes close to this is universal. ",

For me, two films stand out: Last Night (1998), a lesser-known Canadian gem with the great Sandra Oh and Sarah Polley about the quiet, personal ways people face the end of the world. Something about the movie just really affected me on an emotional level. Another one Children of Men, which hit me like a brick with its bleak, grounded vision of a dying future. The world is ending yet people continue on with their lives and go to work anyway. Haunting.",

But also dirty jokes and quips.\n\n\nAll the while watching this movie I couldn't help buy compare it to Robin hood: Men in Tights. The vibes are way too similar. Both in the humour and the fact that both are spoofs of classic swashbucklers.\n\n\nI raked my brain on what could complete that trilogy and I just can't put my finger on it. \n\n\nThe closest thing I could think of is Princess Bride.",

        "content": "Did anyone notice in Superman '25, there was a lack of wide exterior shots of a city skyline. There were no wide-shots of a city landscape with a visible subway/train system or any of that. The closest to being outdoors with the buildings is the Kaiju fight sequence, and if you look for it, you can't see building beyond the street Superman's fighting on.\n\nSuperman '78 you felt like you were in Metropolis as there plenty of exterior shots of authentic New York settings: alleys, taxicabs, streetlights, diners. Superman Returns also had a nice look to it using miniatures to create the wide shot of the city, juxtaposed with the Sydney skyline.\n\nAlso, in 78 and Returns, they're are shots of Superman flying where we see city backdrops. You will notice there are no shots of Superman '25 flying where there're bridges, damns, and other landscapes in the background. Usually when he flies there, it's just sky.\n\nNearly every exterior scene in Superman '25 looks like it was green screen or CGI.\n\nMost of the movie, they place Superman in situations where a Metropolis backdrop isn't required: the Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica, which is just snow and sky, giving them an easy production set. Then there's the Pocket-verse, which an excuse a CGI backdrop. When the heroes travel to Boravia, we don't get shots of them flying there. They just arrive there. And when they do, there's no backdrop of anything. It's just pure sky. It's an obvious studio set. They could've film in a jungle or somewhere.\n\nWhen he is battling in Metropolis, which already looks small, they take the fight to a sinkhole or the sky or the field to get away from the city, basically trying to distract us because they didn't want to pay for a nice detailed Metropolis.\n\nThe whole movie just looks cheap as far as locations go. They spent a lot on CGI but skimped on authentic locations and backdrops.\n\nIn sum, the set design (and cinematography) Superman '78 and Superman Returns are superior to Superman '25 with its generic backdrops thinking we wouldn't notice.\n\nAnd as I side, I have to say, I originally posted this on /comicbookmov... and everyone called me stupid or simply didn't understand what I was talking about. The moderators even deleted my post.\n\nOne commenter sarcastically replied \"Yes they should've shot the movie in Metropolis\" thinking he had a fair point. His logic being Metropolis isn't real, so how could you film there? But then fails to realize The Dark Knight was shot in Chicago and Superman was shot in New York, where real buildings were used for the exterior shots of Daily Planet, Wayne Enterprises, etc.",
