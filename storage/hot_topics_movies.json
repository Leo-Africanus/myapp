        "content": "Can we talk about how amazing the movie Tombstone is?My mom introduced me to this movie and I\u2019ve seen it so many times. I recently just bought the movie on dvd and I\u2019m glad to have a movie like this in my collection. Not only is the cast full of amazing actors (Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton, R.I.P. to both of them) but the acting and the plot are so good. The famous lines \u201cI\u2019m your Huckleberry\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s the rumor\u201d, Morgan taking his last breath on the pool table. Wyatt getting his revenge. Billy Bob Thorton getting smacked and Stephen Lang being almost unrecognizable. It\u2019s truly sad that movies like this aren\u2019t made anymore. Like I mentioned before, I\u2019ve seen this movie so many times and it always feels like I\u2019m watching it for the first time all over again every time I watch it. I\u2019m watching it now as we speak. This movie truly is a masterpiece.",

        "content": "so I've always been that guy who just never watches movie.\n\nI've seen a few (star wars, harry potter, interstellar, and the Truman show) so I decided to sit down and watch the masterpieces everyone always talks about.\n\nThe first on my watchlist was- The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nI went in completely blind. It was a prison story, a kind which I hadn't actually tried before. The story started simple but the characters clicked with me instantly.\n\nI liked most of them.\n\nThe movie is slow, but in a good way. It doesn't rush important moments. The characters feel real, especially the friendship between Andy and Red. That's honestly the best part of the movie for me.\n\nThe moving didn't have flashy actions scenes and stuff but it still touched me, the ending was amazing and I stared at the end credits for a solid minute or two after it ended.\n\nSo for me it would be an easy 10/10",
