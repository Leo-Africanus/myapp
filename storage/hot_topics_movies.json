        "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t complain about this, so here\u2019s me complaining about this.\n\nAgainst my better judgement I decided to watch The Gorge on Apple\u2018s streaming platform, and boy it turns out even an ending as trite as that can be [further undercut by Ted Lasso\u2019s beaming face.](https://i.imgur.com/mB9Z1D6.jpeg)\n\nI remember the story about how George Lucas had to go non-union or pay fines to the director\u2019s guild because he refused to open Star Wars with credits. They cared about them that much. Now, in space year 2026, apparently every professional association of filmmakers give not one solitary shit about credits, allowing as they do every single streaming platform to shrink them to Borrower size so they can Run Some Fucken Adverts. \u201cYes you just watched Schindler's List for three hours and change, but stop processing it there\u2019s not a moment to lose, have you heard about *House MD*? We're gonna play it in 5 seconds unless you tell us not to.\" \n\nThis is Apple\u2019s own movie, these are their people, and they couldn\u2019t even wait for the animations to stop. Like the disrespect afforded to the standard white on black scroll is bad enough, but there are visual effects going on in that little box. You paid vfx artists real human money to make this look good, not enough, granted, but you paid them, and then you made it two inches tall. Morality obviously doesn\u2019t sway these people but how are their shareholders not beating down the door at the sheer waste of it?\n\nNetflix is particularly bad now too, some people will say \"hey you can just make it bigger again\" (as if ruining the vibe alone were not sin enough) but on both Smart TVs and Xbox, the only two places I've bothered testing, going over the \"back\" arrow to get to the tiny credits crashes them all together, like they're punishing you for even questioning their wisdom. How *dare* you try to find out who the best boy is.\n\nAnd just so Disney+ doesn't escape here, when I was watching season 2 of Andor last year their title images for next episodes which pop up unprompted over the credits \\*included spoilers\\*. If anyone has the address for the person who did that, stick it in the comments, I just wanna talk.\n\nI am quite unreasonably mad about this and I don't expect them to change how they do it, but boy I\u2019d sure take an option in the settings, off by default no doubt, that just says \u201crespect the goddamn films you dorks\u201d with a little checkbox.",

However, I think a key part of that experience is the petty-yet-undeniably-righteous thrill of seeing a critic or fan tear into a truly terrible flick. Negative? Granted. Often a thing of beauty? Definitely.\n\nMy favourite, and a contender for greatest of all time, is this autopsy of Steven Seagal's *Contract to Kill:*\n\n&gt;Seagal...walks stiffly and very slowly. It is possible that he never once bends at the waist. Most of the movie, he spends sitting down or walking (again, slowly) up and down flights of stairs. There is a love scene - and, Jesus, what a love scene. His fully dressed body is lowered over a naked woman like a drawbridge.\n\nhttps://www.avclub.com/contract-to-kill-isn-t-just-bad-it-s-steven-seagal-bad-1798189772\n\nSo, movie fans...what reviews live in your head rent-free?\n\nEDIT: So the number one thing I'm taking from the replies is that Roger Ebert was the John Wick of film criticism; a man of focus, commitment and sheer will. \n\n*\"Baba Yaga...\"*\n",

It really pulls no punches in how it trolls everyone on all sides of the social and political aisle.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nThe corporate sponsored leftist terrorist group flown in on their (Soros) jet coming to sow armed militant chaos in a small town. It's an obvious smirking nod to RW conspiracies about Soros or other wealthy billionaires funding all leftist political violence.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as the covid denying sheriff going off the deep end after spiritual guru con man (Austin Butler) cucks him and takes his mentally ill wife. Butler and Emma Stone had small roles but were fantastic in this.\n\nThe conservative black deputy trading bitcoin and into guns getting bullied by his white douchebag co-worker who keeps doubting which side he's on. Then he ends up being set up.\n\nThe various naive BLM young adults doing hysterical performative activism.\n\nLoads of sly jabs all throughout making fun of both left wing covid hysteria and right wing covid denialism, btc/precious metals grifting, and social media based con men.\n\nThe kid who \"saves\" the sheriff at the end with his phone out killing the paid leftist terrorist ends up being a celebrated right wing hero on fox news. It's a sly nod to how media grifts off various fake heroes and props them up for political causes.\n\nThe awkward racial tension between everyone was over the top and just making a statement about how far off the deep end the social conversation has gone in some spaces.\n\nEddington was basically an alternative reality based on the most extreme online commentary about American politics and society. It feels like Ari Aster is saying \"Hey if what you guys believe online is all true then this is the chaotic mess it would be like..\"\n\nThe ending where the sheriff is trapped in his own existential hell and being taken care of by his MIL like she's a surrogate wife while also being forced into some weird polyamorous situation in bed.",

        "content": "I know it\u2019s not faithful to the source material. But it\u2019s epic, the choreography is amazing, Brad Pitt is perfect as Achilles imo, all the other actors/characters are great. Is it faithful? No. Is it corny at part? Yes. But I honestly think it\u2019s a really fun, entertaining movie with some really good performances, great action, music is underrated too.",

        "content": "I recently learned that as far as the various US Bar Associations are concerned, all prospective lawyers or those in the legal trade should watch *My Cousin Vinny* due to how well it portrays the handling of a legal case and lawyer conduct in general; it's not perfect, but it's among the best.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, military academies and officer training corps make it a point that students must watch *National Lampoon's Animal House* and cite Neidermeyer's conduct as an ROTC candidate as how they are *not* supposed to behave and that such conduct is not tolerated within officer training.\n\nWhat are some other examples of required viewing for various professions? Like a doctor or something?",

        "content": "one of my favorite movies of last year was zach cregger's weapons. i'm not gonna go into a long diatribe about how good this movie is because pretty much everyone has already praised it to high heaven. however, one thing i will comment on is cregger's intention of making a prequel about aunt gladys.\n\naunt gladys is the main villain of the film and is easily one of the best villains of the 2020s. not only is she played to perfection by amy madigan but she's a very layered character who's extremely interesting to watch. aunt gladys is easily the most memorable thing about the movie. and it seems like cregger agrees since he plans to make a prequel about gladys.\n\nhere's the thing though. i feel that explaining gladys's origins will ruin a large part of what made her so interesting. her ambiguity.\n\npart of what makes gladys such a scary villain is how little we know about her. all we know for sure is that she's some kind of witch. other than that, we know next to nothing about her. we don't know exactly how old she is, we don't know if she really is alex's aunt, we don't even know if she's really human. and it's that uncertainty that makes her so interesting and so horrifying.\n\nto make a prequel explaining her origins, however good it ends up being, will ruin a large part of what makes gladys such an interesting character. as cliche as it may be to say, when done right, less can be more. and sometimes, what you DON'T see is more scary than what you DO.\n\nthis is also part of why i haven't watched welcome to derry. i don't WANT to know exactly what pennywise is. part of the horror is not knowing.\n\ni just don't get why nothing can be a mystery in modern media anymore. what's next? a pulp fiction prequel where we find out what's in the briefcase? people say that modern media has gone downhill. while i don't really agree with that sentiment, there are some flaws that permeate modern media. and that is the constant hand holding.",
