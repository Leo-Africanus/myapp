Yes, the one nominated for 7 Razzies, that one.\n\nI was 11 years old, when I saw this and obsessed with:\n\n1. Cats\n\n2. Ancient Egypt\n\n3.

Im imagining similar transitions, an obvious shift in the characters established speaking voice.",

Even puppet Goro isn't too bad.\n\nThe CGI and sets look like something from a SyFy Channel series though. But I think we can forgive it because of the technical limitations back this.\n\n  \nI'll take this over the 2021 film anyday. I tried watching the latter several times and it just does not work.

        "content": "For me it's *Conan the Destroyer*. It's the first one I actually saw as youngster.  It was a cable staple for years but I remember feeling like getting a chance to see it was a big deal. \n\nOnce I saw the first film many years later it just didn't hit me the same way. Even with John Milius directing a script co-written with Oliver Stone &amp; James Earl Jones as the bad guy. \n\nI love the sense of adventure in the sequel. Conan assembling a ragtag crew of misfits. Plus there's the big monster fight at the end. I understand it might not be the purest distillation of Cman as a character but it's just a tremendous amount of fun.",

They are searching for Mar \u2014 daughter and sister \u2014 who vanished months ago at one of these endless, sleepless parties. Surrounded by electronic music and a raw, unfamiliar sense of freedom, they hand out her photo again and again. Hope is fading, but they push through and follow a group of ravers heading to one last party in the desert. As they venture deeper into the burning wilderness, the journey forces them to confront their own limits.",
