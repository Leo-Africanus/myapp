Sometimes there are themes that make you reflect and ponder over.\n\nThere is a lot written about the future of movies and there is increasing competition from various forms of entertainment for people's time. There are also reports that newer gens are not that much interested in movies as previous gens were.\n\nBut I feel movies have a place in the world and is a beautiful form of art and entertainment.",

        "content": "We all know Steven Spielberg hates Temple of Doom because he was going through a rough time and the film reflected his mood as well as George Lucas. \n\nBut as someone who was not that impressed by the other Indiana Jones movies, this movie gave me everything I wanted: it was epic, it was funny, it was never boring for a second and it even made scared at one point. Spielberg rarely does Horror but when he does, you're going to have a Horror classic like we saw in Jaws and then, Temple of Doom. \n\nOh, but Short Round and Willie Scott were annoying! Well, I didn't find Short Round annoying. Every kid who saw this in the 80s loved Short Round, and Short Round felt like a real kid who just so happened to be a sidekick, we could relate to him in a way I could never with other kids in adventure movies like those dorky brats from Jurassic Park (\"I'm a Vegetarian!!!\").\n\nAnd I like Willie Scott. First, the Anything Goes number was a stunning opening. It shows the prowess Spielberg had for the musical genre. \n\nPeople bash Willie because she's a shrieking diva but that's what she is. She's not a archeologist like Marion. She didn't even want to go on this mission. She's a character placed in a situation which is out of her comfort zone so she behaves accordingly. And I thought Kate Capshaw did a good job. The way she tries to pass on the townspeople food turning it into an even more awkward moment. And how she grows but not too much. Which is a far cry from what we see today where every female lead needs to be a Lara Croft in training. \n\nHarrison Ford is spectacular in it. Especially when Indiana gets possessed and becomes a temporary baddie. Ford is amazing at playing heroes but I do wish he had played a bad guy just once.",

I\u2019ve been trying everything. My doctor is considering some sort of stress disorder, disassociation or something.\n\nMy therapist suggested staying away from the news, the true crime I used to watch and any content that could be \u201cbad to my mental health\u201d.\n\nWell, today I broke the rules and just watched the movie \u201cUs\u201d (I watched when it was released, but remembered very little). And it was surprisingly good to my anxiety.\n\nI laughed at the comical relief moments. I enjoyed the suspense and also enjoyed the meanings I could take from it. Also led me to acknowledge my own \u201cshadow(s)\u201d and not neglect them (?), at least that\u2019s how I took it. Also, the suspense grows and so does my physical and mental tension, but then these symptoms I already felt anyway gets released. It was a good experience, contrary to my expectations. If I had any.\n\nI feel more grounded and more connected to reality for now. So I\u2019d really like recommendations. I\u2019ve watched \u201cRun\u201d a few years ago and really liked it. Shutter Island. Midsommar. Psychological horror movies. Don\u2019t need to be heavy on the horror, just the building suspense. Also ones that make you think, have or could have deeper meanings. Plot twists. Good movies.\n\nAppreciate it.",

        "content": "Sorry if I\u2019m late to this, I just joined this sub literally to talk about this movie. I kinda like war movies, whether it\u2019s something like fury or saving private ryan, there\u2019s TONS of Great War movies. I haven\u2019t seen one like this though. I don\u2019t know really what it was about this one, it was just different. And I have read that it was incredibly realistic, and people with PTSD actually had a hard time sitting through it. But watching the end credits was a really cool finish, especially seeing the actual people go through how they would clear a street/area. So am I kinda overreacting here or was this legit a good movie?",

        "content": "Personally, despite falling in love with everything Goodfellas, from the iconic death of Tommy for killing Batts and the alleyway scene, I think the segment when feds taped off the Tangiers as a crime scene, arrested everyone, coupled with the brutal deaths of Ginger and Nicky, everything just went to sh\\*t for 10 minutes, the casino was blown up and Sam was involved in multiple car bombings. Casino over Goodfellas.\n\n",

In real life, you\u2019d be lucky if your WiFi connected that fast.\n\nWhat are some other examples you\u2019ve noticed? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of ridiculous stuff we don\u2019t even question anymore in movies.",

The face of wonder.\n\nBut rewatching *Jurassic Park*, I was struck by how softly the film lands on Hammond\u2019s choices. There\u2019s early critique, Ellie\u2019s speech, Malcolm\u2019s warning, but by the end, he\u2019s grieving a lost dream, not facing consequences.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needed to be the villain. But it\u2019s fascinating how the story wraps systemic failure in nostalgia, and leaves us mourning *with* him.\n\nIs that emotional sleight of hand? Or just good character work?\n\nCurious what others think.",

Like, a lot of people laugh at this movie because it's bad and unfunny. But if it had been released in the 80s, many would have considered it a comedy classic.",
