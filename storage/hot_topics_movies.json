        "title": "Just realised that Christopher Nolan's color pallette is very much influenced by his red-green color blindness",
        "content": "I've heard a few times people say his films look too grey-blue and while Nolan himself has mentioned it has largely to do with his filmmaking style being heavily neo-noir, there was another aspect I didn't know about.\n\nhttps://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/a-life-in-pictures-christopher-nolan/\n\n&gt;His colour palettes have been influenced by his red-green color blindness.\n\n&gt;CN:\u00a0Well I left the purple up to other people because I\u2019m colour-blind\n\n&gt;EB:\u00a0Not your colour?!.. [Laughs}\n\n&gt;CN:\u00a0No, I can barely see shades of purple, I\u2019m red-green colour-blind, uh so I left that aspect up to Lindy very much. Um, but no it was a tremendous thing to be involved with because Heath didn\u2019t do many films and he would wait a long time between films, as he put it to me he would wait until he felt he needed to go out and do something else, like he really would wait until he was hungry.\n\n\n\nI had no idea about this but it makes a lot of sense for why his films look the way they do - not that I care either way since I find the grey-blue colors and the orange with Oppenheimer quite appealing - but there's an explanation for it beyond just him finding it \"aesthetically pleasing\". It's basically just his natural inclincation. Today I Learned I guess. \n\nAlso a really interesting excerpt from his Memento book about how this influences his movies:\n\n\n&gt;\"It came up while he was filming Memento, in conversation with Guy Pearce, by way of illustrating why everyone seems to take advantage of poor Leonard Shelby's condition. \"If you tell someone you're color-blind, the first thing they do is they show you something and say, 'What color is that?' If you were in a wheelchair, people wouldn't go, 'Oh, you're in a wheelchair. Can you stand up?' It's a bizarre response, but they're fasci- nated because they can't understand that you would see things differently. So they immediately start asking you what do things look like, and then laughing at you as you get it wrong. You see it with Mark Boone Junior's character, the motel clerk, where he's just fascinated by it. As soon as he tells people he can't remember things, then they start to test his memory. It seems cruel. People are fascinated by other people's perception of the world and the way in which it differs. I've always been interested in the tension between the subjective point of view and our faith in an objective reality. In Memento, we dealt with that enormously, particularly at the end, but I think that is in all my films. Whenever I am making a film, I'm constantly being reminded of the paradox of reconciling our subjective views of the world with our deep-seated belief or feeling that there is an objective real- ity outside that is fundamentally unknowable. We can't step outside our own heads-we just can't.\"",

In this update, I added **easy mode** with the top 2000 movies, but **hard mode** is still available with the top 5000 movies. Players complained about the first hint (\"not so helpful\" - it showed only the title length) - so I added an image from the movie to help. If you try it, please let me know what you think: either here, or you can use the feedback form on the site as well.\n\n",

        "content": "Started listening to this audio drama called the seneschal. It\u2019s set in the Rebel Moon universe (don\u2019t judge me lol) and it has a randomly impressive cast of Ella Purnell, Alfred Enoch, Peter Serefinowicz, but most importantly Jason Isaacs as an evil space Caligula type character. It made me realize how good his voice acting and voice in general is. I like that he still does a fair amount of work in that field, since he also did Baldur\u2019s Gate and Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League as Brainiac. I hope he does even more voice acting in the future in games and random stuff like this",
