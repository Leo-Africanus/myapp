One day they\u2019re headlining big movies, and the next, it\u2019s like Hollywood pretends they never existed. No big scandal, no retirement announcement, just gone.\n\nTaylor Kitsch is a perfect example. After Friday Night Lights, it felt like every studio was pushing him as the next big star. He got John Carter, Battleship, and True Detective, but after a few flops, he just stopped getting those lead roles. Same thing happened with Josh Hartnett. In the early 2000s, he was in Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Sin City, and then he just kind of faded away. I heard he turned down playing Batman in The Dark Knight, which probably didn\u2019t help. Who else do you remember being everywhere and then suddenly gone?\n",

        "content": "Many years ago, me and my wife were on a late honeymoon trip to a cold mountain town. Sadly she got a fever-cold on the second day and we were confined to the hotel room (She pressed me to go out and enjoy, but the cold weather and the cosy room was making me stay put). TV was showing a movie Birdcage, and I found it utterly hilarious. I was laughing out loud, and she was laughing at me laughing. I was laughing at the movie, and she was laughing at me laughing. It was a great evening.\n\nWith a lot of nostalgic feeligns, I decided to watch this movie again recently. But it was a very different experience. \n\nIf you don't know the plot it goes like this: Robbin Williams and Nathan lane are a gay couple running a drag show/gay club where Nathan is the star. Robbin's son is in love with the daughter of a very conservative senator.\nThe gay couple disguise themselves as a heterosexual couple in order to meet and impress the conservative family \n\nI guess when I watched it the first time around, I was young and naive, and I watched from the pov of the young couple who just want to get married somehow, and all troubles Armand and Albert go through made me laugh. \n\nNow I watch it from the pov of the parents (I myself a parent now) and it feels very sad in parts. To pretend to be someone who you are not, for someone else's convenience feels like a sad sacrifice you are making. One speech from Nathan almost broke me.",

        "content": "I went looking for this movie after I heard Wil Friedle making fun of it on his podcast. According to him this is one of those movies that Disney is ashamed of for some reason so there are no VHS/DVD releases and it's not on Disney+ or any streaming. I couldn't even find a trailer.\n\nMovie: https://youtu.be/70iNxgQWbtM?si=m0yWw528spVQsfcy 13:50. Wil Friedle had his first very real panic attack shooting that scene. His panic attacks are what lead to him gaining weight on Boy Meets World due to the meds he was on and eventually led to him quitting acting for a while. He instead became an awesome voice actor.  After Boy Meets World ended we wouldn't see Wil on TV again until his hilarious return on Girl Meets World. https://youtu.be/OQxkGLWbDig?si=OjhSZ1Ql7pyLhFm2\n\nAs a lifelong fan of Wil Friedle I can't hate this movie. It's a DCOM. I'm not expecting Oscar level writing and acting.\n\nWil Friedle and Matthew Lawrence did a movie together? No wonder they worked so well together when Matthew came to Boy Meets World.",

        "content": "First things first, I absolutely dig the fact that the Hughes brothers are shamelessly Martin Scorsese fans and their homages are clear as day. You can tell they were heavily influenced by goodfellas and a lot of Scorsese's techniques from that movie. I think they use it far better than PT Anderson did a few years later with Boogie Nights where it comes off as copying more than actually creating a homage. The overall stories and characters in both movies are so layered and polished. I think both movies are about how as a society these young men are set up to fail and both movies chronicle their downfalls. \n\nDead Presidents to me is their true masterpiece. Larenz Tate gives what should've been a star making performance in this movie. They show brilliantly how in the 60s black men during the war were taken into the Vietnam war when they had absolutely nothing and then chewed up and spit out of the system and sent back into these neighborhoods  with severe PTSD and nothing to fall back on. The Chris Tucker scene where he explains his issues post war with PTSD and anxiety and the end where Tate explains he's a war hero and he gets zero leniency are so powerful to me. It's a shame.both brothers after that and their brilliant pimp documentary became directors for hire. ",

Birmans. Seal point Birmans, to be precise. I would wake and be surrounded by cats and all that the cat life entailed. Kitten cats, male cats, female cats. Cat cages, cat shows, cat breeding. Always the breeding, the eternal lifecycle of the cat burned into my retinas. The yowling, the prowling, the fucking.\n\n&gt;When I was 25, I hung out with some Furries in Hamilton. Charming folk, I really liked them. Loved Disney films. Adored My Little Pony. They got turned on by putting on dog suits, fox suits, cat suits. Adults - all yowling, prowling, fucking.\n\n&gt;I'm 37 now, I've just seen Cats the movie. I've never seen the stage show, but I know the songs. I get the gist. Big songs, big numbers. This film is something else. I am 13 again, I am 25 again. I'm at my parents house, hearing cats fuck. I'm watching a Furry put on a catsuit.\n\n&gt;This is the worst thing I've ever seen. This is what death feels like. This is the worst ketamine trip. This is the CGI from Scorpion King. I don't know if I'm five minutes in or five hours. Nothing matters anymore. This is the death of all things. Fuck it.\n",

        "content": "I watched this movie for the first time this morning. Growing up I was very familiar with it because my sister saw it on its release and was traumatized by it. All I ever knew was how supposedly scary it was, and that\u2019s not necessarily wrong. But between all of the darker material there\u2019s a real sense of whimsy there, and it\u2019s all delivered with such *confidence.* The movie just throws all of these insane ideas out there and expects you to keep up, and I was enthralled the whole time. The main actress has to be one of the best displays of young acting I\u2019ve ever seen in the genre and she\u2019s working against *nothing.* Just props and a chicken for most of the thing. I couldn\u2019t believe when I looked it up and found that it was the director\u2019s only movie. What a wild ride. ",

        "content": "What's your favorite \"gotcha\" moment in a movie?\n\nMaybe gotcha isn't the right word for it, but I'm primarily thinking of moments of dialogue where a character makes a point that essentially shuts down any argument from whoever their talking to. \n\nLike one of my favorites (and the reason I thought of posting this) is in Pulp Fiction when Jules and Vincent are discussing foot massages. Jules insists there's nothing inherently sexual about them, and then Vincent, after asking Jules if he's given any foot massages before, and if he's any good at them, hits Jules (the self proclaimed \"foot fucking master\") with \"Would you give a guy a foot massage?\" to which Jules' only response is \"Fuck you\".",

A very well animated Rock and Sci-FI based movie, similiar to Heavy Metal.\nDebbie Hary, Cheap Trick, Iggy Pop, and Lou reed all contribute to the sound track.\n\nWhile the\nMOK character was meant to be voiced by Mick Jagger, others suck as Michael Jackson were\nconsidered. Ultiamtlely it would have been too costly, and the studio had to settle for Lou\nreed and Iggy pop as singing voices.\nHowever the most interesting bit is that the original idea for MOK to summon the demon was\nto turn Omar, Angel, and the band into instruments with his evil science and magic.\n\n",
